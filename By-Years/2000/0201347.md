This work focuses on mechanical systems in which one or more of the frequencies
of oscillation are dynamical variables, whose evolutions are dependent on the
state of the system. As time evolves these systems can slowly move in and out of
a state of resonance. This proposal investigates the dynamical behavior of these
slowly-varying systems near resonance, accounting for the full complexity of the
coupling between components that exists in these systems. Two primary research
topics are to be addressed in this work, i) the effects of resonances on the
dynamical behavior of directly coupled, multi-degree-of-freedom systems, and ii)
resonant effects in nonlinear systems in the presence of period-amplitude
dependence of one or more of the components. These include mistuned systems
where the components with dynamical frequencies are coupled to all the remaining
resonant modes as well as examples in the presence of additional internal
resonances. The multi-degree-of-freedom systems will be reduced using singular
perturbation methods and the transport of phase space through the resonance
region will be analyzed through analytical techniques and numerical
investigations. Finally, the analytical predictions will be verified on an
existing experimental apparatus that will be used to more fully account for the
complexities of physical systems. Resonances in dynamical systems provide a
mechanism by which complex coupled systems can undergo unexpected qualitative
changes in their dynamical behavior, and this work will lead to a more complete
understanding of this behavior. These topics represent a significant class of
problems with relevance to complex, interconnected mechanical systems and will
identify parameters and the characteristics of coupling which play an important
role in determining the impact of resonances in interconnected mechanical
systems.
