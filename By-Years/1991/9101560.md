This research is in the area of network information theory with emphasis on the
development and analysis of new coding techniques for efficient matching of
correlated information sources to multi-terminal channels and the conditions
under which these coding schemes are optimal. The new coding schemes are based
on joint source and channel coding rather than separate coding for source and
channel. The performance of new coding techniques is compared to the existing
schemes and also to separate coding for the information source and the
communication channel. Special emphasis is placed on the investigation of the
performance of the proposed coding schemes under various types of channel
impairments, such as symbol and block asynchronism. Different types of source-
channel configurations, including cases with feedback, are studied and the
possibility of optimal separate and channel coding in each case is investigated.
