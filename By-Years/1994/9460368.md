The Virtual Model Interlocking (VMI) concept is created to describe geometric
objects and their relationships with maximum flexibility in topologic
definition, geometric relations and heterogeneous information for complicated
engineering processes, such as concurrent engineering, manufacturing processes,
assembly analyses, and geometric reasoning. The Virtual Model Interlocking
system is based on a new non-manifold modeling in Boundary Representation
(B-Rep) topology, which allows detached components, partial topology or pseudo
objects (Virtual Model). Each face, edge, and vertex in the topology can be
interlocked to a construction plan, parameter-driven dimension, or graphic rule.
These attached relationships can modify the orientation and position of the
solid object, the solid topology and its dimensions by the changes propagated
from other objects. VMI provides a modeling framework for engineers to describe
single or groups of objects with incomplete topology during the design process.
The current Solid Modeling systems are commonly used to describe 3-D objects
with Boolean operations. These solid models are difficult to create and
difficult to manipulate, and all the geometry entities within the solid topology
cannot be accessed or manipulated directly. Virtual Model Interlocking is
developed as a design and manufacturing tool to remove these restrictions.
