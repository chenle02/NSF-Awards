The Simulation and Modeling Group at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories has recently
created a circuit simulator for dc simulation of their in- house integrated
circuits. This simulator, called SFRAME has a number of advantages over Newton-
Raphson-based simulation programs such as SPICE. These advantages include global
convergence, the ability to find more than one or sometimes even all of a
circuit's operating points, and the ability to incorporate the sophisticated
bipolar junction transistor models used at Bell Laboratories; running SPICE on
circuits incorporating these models has led to severe convergence problems. This
research will affect major enhancements to SFRAME, including initialization
capability, ability to simulate circuits containing MOS transistors, and
identification of the stability of operating points found. It is expected that
the work proposed herein will be a starting point for a long and productive
industry-university collaboration.
