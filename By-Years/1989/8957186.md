This is an award to support a project involving groundwater quality modelling
and management, evaluating engineering design uncertainty - particularly for
problems of aquifer remediation, minimizing costs through optimal data
collection efforts, incorporating a stronger geologic component in models of the
variability of aquifer properties, and developing groundwater contamination and
water shortages. All these topics involve hydrogeologic simulation as a critical
component. Research will include evaluating the "worth of data" in engineering
design, studying the effects of spatially variable aquifer properties on
groundwater flow and contaminant transport, and the relationship between
hydrogeologic field measurements and the corresponding parameters appearing in
our simulation models. This is the initial award for this Presidential Young
Investigator who worked for the U.S. Geological Survey prior to being employed
by Stanford University. His research for the Survey involved optimization of
engineering design, contaminant -transport model parameter estimation and
uncertainty analysis, and simulation-based evaluation of water allocation
policy. This background is applicable to the work he plans to do with support
provided by this award.
