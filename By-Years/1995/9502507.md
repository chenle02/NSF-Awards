The focus of this research is the development of rhodium catalyzed reactions for
the formation of carbocyclic rings, the application of the Baylis-Hillman
reaction to asymmetric synthesis and the synthesis of a propellane structure
containing a sigma-allyl cation. The focus of the educational plan involves the
teaching of chemistry by using a modular approach and developing an
undergraduate research seminar program. With this CAREER award, the Synthetic
Organic Program is supporting the research and educational plan of Dr. James W.
Leahy of the Department of Chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley.
Professor Leahy will focus his research efforts on the development of new
methods for the catalytic formation of carbocyclic compounds and the preparation
of a theoretically interesting fused- ring system containing a novel
carbocation. The focus of Professor Leahy's educational plan involves the
teaching of chemistry by using a modular approach and developing an
undergraduate research seminar program.
