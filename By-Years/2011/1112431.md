In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry
Program of the Chemistry Division, Ken D. Shimizu of the University of South
Carolina will develop rewritable molecularly imprinted polymers. The approach is
to synthesize polymer networks with conformationally restricted functional
groups capable of non-covalent interactions. The networks would be thermally
annealed in the presence of a guest, and then the guest would be removed to
produce the imprinted network. The "memory" of the network would be erased by
heating it at a temperature that enables fast rotation about the restricted
bonds. The broader impacts involve training undergraduate and graduate students,
continuing a high school chemical demonstration program run by graduate students
in the chemistry department, providing high school students a summer research
opportunity in the laboratory, and the potential scientific and technological
impact of programmable polymers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will further
our understanding of how an "imprint" of a molecule can be rendered chemically
within a material and how that imprint can later "recognize" the molecule
selectively. This work could lead to improved methods to remove impurities from
pharmaceuticals or environmental contaminants from water and to improved
chemical sensors that would provide faster and more accurate results.
