Science has become increasingly reliant on Computational Science methods
implemented in software. These methods are complex, and therefore the software
that implements them is prone to errors. This projects seeks to transformatively
improve the state of the practice in the development of Computational Science
software by applying systematic, data-driven methods (known as empirical
methods) to evaluate how software is being developed and to suggest
improvements. Improving the software engineering methods of Computational
Science would result in higher quality software, and consequently increase our
confidence in the research in scientific phenomena conducted by Computational
Scientists, &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Much of the work in Computational Science is
related to the software that implements it. In this project, the researcher will
apply state of the art empirical software engineering methods to Computational
Science software. Qualitative methods will be applied to conduct large scale
surveys of computational science. Quantitative data mining tools (classifiers,
intelligent data preprocessor, automatic hyperparameter optimizers) will be used
to can learn predictive models of time series of SE data such as "Where in this
system should we look for current bugs?" and "How many bugs are left on the
system?". These models can be used to guide developer effort in building new
code or maintaining old code.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
