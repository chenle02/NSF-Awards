This award by the Chemistry Division supports Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) at the University of Rochester for the summers of
2009-2011. The program director is Thomas Krugh. Eight students each year will
conduct full-time hands-on scientific research as a member of an established
research team. Each participant will have a specific research problem, a
specific faculty adviser, and a specific graduate student or postdoctoral mentor
to provide day to-day advice. A weekly REU Group Meeting provides a forum for
the participants to report their research to each other early in the summer, and
thus to learn from each other and about other areas of chemistry, to discuss
graduate education and scientific careers. Recruiting will build on established
relationships with more than thirty undergraduate colleges and give special
emphasis to the participation of underrepresented minorities, women, and lower
division students.
