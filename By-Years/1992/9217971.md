In a previous study, cataclysmic variables located far from the galactic plane
were found to differ in their properties from those near the plane. Spectra and
photometry of such objects will be obtained to study the nature of their binary
companions. This will allow the distances to be obtained and from them,
luminosities of the accretion disks which give rise to the outbursts of the
variables. A search for galactic plane counterparts of these objects will be
made. The relationship of these systems to theories regarding the hibernation of
cataclysmic variables will be explored.
