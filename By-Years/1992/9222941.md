An integrated system consisting of a mobile robot, high-speed image processing
hardware, and a real-time operating system will be purchased and used in several
robotics research projects. These include: * Visual motion for robot guidance *
Autonomous agent behavior specification and analysis. * Agent construction using
discrete event dynamic systems. This system will permit closed loop control
methods and aid in validation and techniques involving active camera control.
