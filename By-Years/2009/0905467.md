The goal of the project is to harness the information contained in users'
interactions with information systems (e.g., query reformulations, clicks, dwell
time) to train those systems to better serve their users' information needs. The
key challenge lies in properly interpreting this implicit feedback and
collecting it in a way that provides valid training data. Moving beyond existing
passive data collection methods, the project draws on multi-armed bandit
algorithms, experiment design, and machine learning to actively collect implicit
feedback data. Developing these interactive experimentation methods goes hand-
in-hand with developing machine learning algorithms that can use the resulting
training data, and empirical evaluations that validate the models of user
behavior assumed by the algorithms.

This research will improve retrieval quality for important applications like
intranet search and desktop search. Additionally, the project will provide an
operational full-text search engine for the Physics E-Print ArXiv and
potentially other digital libraries, thus forming a test-bed for the research
while also providing a valuable service and dissemination tool to the academic
community beyond computer science. The project provides interesting and
motivating research opportunities to undergrads and international exchange
students, and the PIs will include relevant material into the undergraduate and
graduate curriculum. Finally, following their prior work on the Support Vector
Machine, SVM-light (http://svmlight.joachims.org/) and an open-source search
engine for learning ranked retrieval functions and evaluating the learned
rankings, OSMOT (http://radlinski.org/osmot/), the PIs will continue to provide
easy-to-use software that enables research and teaching, via the project website
