This individual investigator award will provide funds to a senior researcher for
a project to investigate the role of defects in two-dimensional phase
transitions. The concepts of symmetry, dimensionality, and disorder all are
central to the description of phase transitions. It is generally recognized that
defects can play a critical role in phase transitions, especially in reduced
dimensionality. The combination of the atomic resolution available with the
variable-temperature scanning tunneling microscope (STM) coupled with the
ability to grow artificially structured two and one-dimension configurations out
of equilibrium on a surface promises to change the way we think about the role
of defects in phase transitions in reduced dimensionality. This project will
utilize a variable-temperature STM, which renders spatial images of the atomic
and electronic distributions at the surface as a function of temperature.
Surface structure and lattice dynamics will be determined with elastic and
inelastic electron scattering as well as surface x-ray scattering. Surface
magnetism will be probed with a combination of linear and non-linear magneto-
optical Kerr rotation utilizing a newly designed octapole superconducting
magnet. Young scientists from the undergraduate through the post-graduate levels
will be trained in techniques relevant to future careers in academe, industry,
and government laboratories. %%% This individual investigator award will provide
funds to a senior researcher for a project to investigate the fundamental role
of imperfections or defects in phase transitions for material systems in two
dimensions. It is generally recognized that defects can play a critical role in
phase transitions, especially in reduced dimensionality. Many potential
technological devices utilize the properties of a phase transition in a given
material. As the size of devices become smaller, it is important to understand
the effect of defects on the phase transitions of these materials of reduced
dimension. The impact of this research program will be felt on two fronts.
First, these experiments, and the concepts that come from them, may change the
way we think about phase transitions in reduced dimensionality. Secondly, and
most importantly, is the training of young scientists at the undergraduate,
graduate and post-graduate levels in an area supporting our national agenda on
nanotechnology. ***
