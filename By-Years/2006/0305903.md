Cable-Stayed bridges are commonly exhibiting large-amplitude vibrations of the
main stays, frequently associated with the simultaneous occurrence of wind and
rain. These vibrations are of concerns because they potentially induce fatigue
in the cables and cable anchorages. Past research on excitation mechanisms has
generally been conducted using wind tunnels, and several distinct aerodynamic
mechanisms have been proposed. While considerable progress has been made in
understanding and mitigating these vibrations, the state of the art has still
not enabled the prediction of field behavior based on a set of supplied
parameters, nor does a plausible, accepted model exist for the phenomenon. This
research effort is building upon previous findings and the wealth of full-scale
data collected in past projects in order to develop an understanding of the
mechanics of stay-cable vibration at a more fundamental level and to enable the
recommendation of more effective and economical mitigation strategies.
