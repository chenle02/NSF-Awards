This project deals with problems of optimal stochastic control and its
applications. These involve switching systems, ergodic control, and control of
distributed parameter systems. Specifically, the PI's will study the optical
control of switching systems, free boundary problems in several dimensions and
the long-time cost criteria in ergodic control problems. The applications of
such studies include the optimal scheduling of multiple power generations to
meet a random demand for power, the control of queuing and production systems,
and the control of chemical reactions, space structures, robots, etc.
