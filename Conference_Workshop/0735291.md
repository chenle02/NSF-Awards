A quantum computer is a hypothetical device that exploits the principles of
quantum mechanics to perform computations. Such computers use the special
properties of atoms and light rather than electronics to carry out calculations
and have the potential to surpass the speed of digital computers and solve
problems that are intractable even for today's fastest parallel machines. One of
the main obstacles in building such computers is in manipulating coherent
quantum states without introducing errors or losing coherence. In 1997, Freedman
and Kitaev proposed a topological model of a quantum computer that performs
computations by encoding information in the configurations of braids. These
computers have a built-in defense against decoherence and offer the promise of
error rates many orders of magnitude lower than any other quantum computation
scheme to date. In 2002, Freedman, Kitaev, Wang and Larsen proved that a
topological quantum computer can perform any computation that a so-called "qubit
quantum computer" can do. In a series of ten lectures, Zhenghan Wang will cover
the theoretical foundations of the field of topological quantum computing, the
progress that has been made over the last decade, and the future challenges. In
addition, Ara Basmajian will give a series of related lectures on knots and
their invariants.

The conference and the resulting monograph will enable interested researchers to
get involved in this exciting area of research while it is still in its infancy.
It will be of interest to physicists and computer scientists as well as to
mathematicians, and to both theoreticians and practitioners. No background in
knot theory, quantum computing, or quantum physics will be assumed. Travel funds
will be available to deter the expenses of participants. Advanced
undergraduates, graduate students, junior faculty, women, minorities, and
persons with disabilities are especially encouraged to participate and to apply
for support.
