Topics in Harnack Inequalities, Degenerate Evolution Equations and Applied
Mathematics

Abstract of Proposed Research Emmanuele DiBenedetto

This project is to continue research on certain important classes of degenerate
elliptic and parabolic equations and on homogenization theory. A major topic
will be the study of Harnack inequalities. These inequalities have been regarded
as properties of the solutions of certain types of linear and non-linear partial
differential equations. This project will look at proving the validity of
Harnack-type inequalities for new classes of functions. Part of this study will
concentrate on the analysis of solutions of parabolic p-Laplacian equations in
both the sub-critical and super-critical regimes. The problems in homogenization
theory will center on modeling the diffusion of molecules in the rod outer
segment (ROS) in the retina of vertebrates. Homogenized limits will be computed
and identified for such diffusion processes, set in the cylindrical, thickly
layered and incised structures of the ROS. The mathematical problem consists in
identifying a topology and relative compactness to permit the limit process. The
technical novelty of these structures is that the domain becomes disconnected as
the thickness of the layers goes to zero.

Harnack inequalities play a central role in the theory of elliptic and parabolic
differential equations and are used extensively in analysis, geometry and
applications. Determining their range of validity may impact many topics in
mathematical analysis. The homogenization problem is motivated by visual
transduction in the process of vision. The results of this analysis may cast
light on the biological process of vision.
