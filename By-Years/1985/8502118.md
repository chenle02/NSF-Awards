Base isolation systems represent an attractive strategy for protecting
structures from the effects of earthquakes. Several different systems exist and
the subject has world-wide interest. Successful application of base isolation
can reduce structural costs while providing protection against the effects of
earthquakes. An important part of the design of structures is the proper
specification of the design response spectrum. The research project will develop
realistic design spectra for base-isolated buildings and will address low
frequency response. The results of the research will provide the designer with
design response spectra which will be appropriate for base-isolated structures.
