The Academic Career Mentoring Workshop series targets faculty (assistant
professors and associate professors), senior graduate students, and postdoctoral
researchers in computing from the following underrepresented groups: African
American, Hispanic, Native American, and People with Disabilities. The series
started in 2005 and has been funded by NSF grants from 2007 through
2017.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will involve the following
activities:&lt;br/&gt;Organize workshops for 2018 through 2020; for each
workshop, conduct a thorough evaluation of the workshop; leverage the workshop
attendees and the newly-formed FLIP (Diversifying Future Leadership in the
Professoriate) Alliance to extend the annual evaluation to consider the factors
that influence the decisions to pursue academic careers; and at the end of the
project, conduct a longitudinal evaluation of the program for 2010 through
2020.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
