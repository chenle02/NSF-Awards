This proposal will support the 2016 Space Weather Workshop to be held April
26-29, 2016 at the Omni Interlocken Hotel in Broomfield, Colorado. This annual
workshop brings together representatives of industry, academia and government to
present papers and discuss issues related to space weather. This is one of the
few opportunities for the broad community interested in space weather to get
together. Emphasis at the workshop is on the impacts of space weather on
technology including communications, navigation, spacecraft operations and
electric power.

In addition to bringing the three communities interested in space weather
together this workshop invites both undergraduate and graduate students. This
provides the students with information on research developments and on how that
research is relevant to operations. The students are also able to develop
valuable networking connections that span these related but very separate
communities. Because the emphasis of the workshop is to discuss the impacts of
space weather on technology and identify the operational needs for space weather
forecasting it has high societal value. The need to develop improved and
enhanced space weather forecast and mitigation strategies is now a national
priority.
