This is a project to study the ability of biologically active filters to absorb,
adsorb and stabilize volatile organic compounds that are emitted from industrial
and municipal waste processing systems. Experimentation in this project
initially involves passage of synthetic gas streams containing trichloroethylene
through a biologically active medium that initially will be enriched for
favoring methanotrophic microbial organisms. Other organic compounds to be
included include 1,2 dichloroethylene, benzene and toluene. This proposal was
submitted in accord with the NSF Program Announcement 89-60, Research in
Undergraduate Institutions. Previous efforts to remove volatile organic
compounds from process streams to reduce their emission to the air have
demonstrated the efficacy of physical/chemical systems. The physical/biological
process this research addresses has promise of removing the potential air
pollutants from gases prior to their being exhausted to the atmosphere at
significantly.
