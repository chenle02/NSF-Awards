The University of Arkansas at Little Rock (UALR), in partnership with the Little
Rock School District, Pulaski County Special School District, North Little Rock
School District, and Benton School District, is preparing 32 Noyce Scholars by
awarding 24 two-year undergraduate scholarships and 8 one-year stipends to non-
licensed STEM professionals. Superintendents and mathematics/science curriculum
specialists in the Little Rock regional schools attest to the difficulty of
recruiting and retaining well-qualified science and mathematics teachers. The
concentration of poverty in central Arkansas contributes significantly to this
difficulty. The Little Rock area school districts and UALR have a long and
productive history of working together to enhance the quality of K-12 education
in central Arkansas, and are implementing a program in which junior and senior
mathematics and science majors will receive Noyce Scholarships and mentoring
support as they complete the requirements for the secondary education minor that
leads to licensure. The Noyce Scholarship Program also awards stipends to STEM
professionals and engages them in a program of study and mentoring support that
leads to licensure to teach mathematics or science at the secondary level.

The project recruits highly qualified science and mathematics students and
dedicated STEM professionals who are motivated to accomplish a career change
into high quality teacher licensure programs in secondary education. Noyce
Scholars participate in a teacher preparation program that includes instruction
on pedagogy, adolescent development, and curriculum issues, and requires
internships mentored by master teachers. The science and mathematics programs in
which the students participate also provide opportunities for scientific
research.
