The way reservoirs of water are operated plays a crucial role in making
efficient use of the stored water in resolving the often conflicting demands of
flood protection, water supply, and hydropower generation. In current
engineering practice, reservoir systems are usually operated according to
certain rules which are usually determined by trial and error and tested through
simulation studies, without the benefit of modern systems analysis techniques
and high-speed digital computers. This research project investigates the
application of stochastic optimal control theory to the problems of real time
operation of multi-reservoir systems.
