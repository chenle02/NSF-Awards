Abstract: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sensor networks are finding applications in
several areas. They enable tight integration of the physical world with a
computing system infrastructure, thereby permitting better information sensing,
access and control. However, development of sensor network applications has been
extremely difficult: there is very little or no development support. This
proposal is aimed at developing programming languages, compilers and middleware
services that will make it easier to implement, deploy and manage sensor network
applications. The programming languages will provide novel abstractions for
defining sensor nodes and groups of nodes, node and group behaviors, and
interaction among nodes and groups. The node and group behaviors are completely
separated, which supports reusability. The languages will also provide intrinsic
support for group level aggregation, state management, group leader selection,
and one-many and many-many method invocations. The objective is to capture
common patterns of node and group instantiations, data sharing, and
communication so that applications can be developed easily. The middleware will
implement a scalable infrastructure for group management, inter-node
communication, group-node interactions and code distribution. The research will
also explore the performance characteristics of the language abstractions and
middleware services. The proposed research will have significant impact on
development of applications in several areas, including environmental sciences,
disaster recovery, civilian infrastructure monitoring, education, precision
agriculture and pervasive computing. The research plan also integrates
educational and research activities by involving undergraduate and graduate
students through courses, open source software development projects,
