While use of GaAs in electronics is growing rapidly and may approach 10% of all
integrated circuits by 1990, efficient and environmentally satisfactory methods
for recovering gallium, a rare metal in nature, from process scrap do not exist.
Handling of arsenic, a toxic substance and expected carcinogen in minute
amounts, is a problem both with respect to workplace and environmental levels of
arsenic contamination. Research will be conducted into methods of recovering
fallium from scrap while isolating arsenic safely. Primary emphasis will be on a
smelting separation with arsenic collected in an alloy collector and gallium
oxidized into a soda ash slag. Results from this approach will be compared with
direct hydrometallurgical methods: leaching, solvent extraction, and
precipitation.
