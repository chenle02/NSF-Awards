This project is introducing principles of solution chemistry, including
acid/base equilibria, precipitation, oxidation/reduction and complexation
reactions, in the context of solving real-world bioanalytical and environmental
problems, and by integrating instrumental methods of analysis into a new course.
To implement the new course, the project is purchasing two automated CZE systems
and four membrane liquid chromatography systems. The new course is based on
applications modules. All activities including lectures and quantitative
problem-solving sections focus initially on two laboratory-based modules. One
requires students to develop and implement a strategy for assessing water
quality in a river near campus. The other requires students to develop and
optimize a chromatographic method to isolate horse cytochrome c from impurities,
develop a spectrophotometric method to assess the success of their purification
method, examine the electrochemical properties of the purified protein, and
separate a mixture of cytochrome c obtained from different animals. The
experiments incorporate two recently developed separations techniques: capillary
zone electrophoresis (CZE) and moderate-pressure, membrane-based liquid
chromatography.
