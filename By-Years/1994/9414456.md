This research program aims to comprehend physical mechanisms underlying the
magnetically dominated energy-conversion processes that drive solar terrestrial
activity. This will involve the formulation of an MHD treatment of transport-
enriched evolution and instability processes, and their three-dimensional
nonlinear simulation on supercomputers. The strategic goal of these realistic
simulations is to use observable inputs to achieve a predictive capability with
respect to solar activity. Studies performed under this project will help in
understanding related phenomena in the wider universe of astrophysics, and by
the need to predict their consequences in the solar-terrestrial system.
