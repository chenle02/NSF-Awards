9707661 Simon The spectral analysis of Schrodinger operators with slowly
decaying or ergodic potentials will be studied. Making use of recent results of
Last-Simon, Kiselev-Last-Simon, and Jitomirskaya-Last, the project examines
fractal properties of spectral measures and related issues of long time for
quantum dynamics. A major thrust will be to attempt to extend to general
dimension the ideas, techniques, and results developed for one-dimensional
systems. Among open questions which will be examined is the existence of mixed
singular continuous and absolutely continuous spectra in explicit models.
Spectral analysis of differential operators has been a major theme of twentieth
century analysis and theoretical physics. Recent studies have shown that
potentialities that were allowed by classical works of Weyl, Titchmarsh,
Hartman, and Wintner not only occur, but are not pathological as was suggested
by these classical works. Links were made with ideas of chaos science,
particularly with notions of Hausdorff dimension. It is proposed to study these
ideas further, to extend them from the model one space dimension of earlier
works to physically relevant three dimensions, and to explore the consequences
for the long-time dynamics of quantum systems.
