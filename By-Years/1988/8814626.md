The objective of this proposed research is to improve our understanding of
certain aspects of the mechanisms responsible for tropical intraseasonal
oscillation. The complex dynamic framework will be reduced to a group of
tractable models that can be solved separately either by analytic means or by
use of quasi- analytic model and numerical computation. The investigation will
focus on (1) the couplings between equatorial Kelvin and Rossby waves and among
internal vertical modes through moist processes; (2) the roles of boundary layer
mass and moisture convergence in the dynamics of the low frequency wave; (3) the
consequences of nonlinear versus linear heating representation; (4) the causes
of regionally and seasonally northward phase propagation; and (5) the nature of
air-sea interaction in the intraseasonal time scale and the impact of this
interaction on tropical low frequency variations. This research is important
because it seeks to understand the physical mechanisms responsible for a small
but significant portion of the observed climate variability in the tropics;
variability which may act as a trigger for larger amplitude climate variability.
