Computerized infrared spectroscopy is widely used by scientists in many fields
for a variety of purposes, from quality control of industrial products and
monitoring of environmental contaminants to theoretical studies of the basic
nature of molecules. Eight new infrared spectroscopy experiments are being
introduced into the general, organic, analytical, physical and instrumental
chemistry courses at Otterbein College as a result of the recent acquisition of
an infrared spectrophotometer with computer and spectral processing software
attachments. This development is significantly improving undergraduate
laboratory instruction by allowing students to gain experience with this
instrumental technique.
