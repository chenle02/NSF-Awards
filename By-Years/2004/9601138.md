9601136 Firman This research examines the transformation of property rights to
land in Ghana, the Cote d'Ivoire and cameroon during the period of colonial
rule, when Africa was integrated into the world economy. The project aims to
achieve three theoretical goals. First, it explains the origins of insecure land
tenure in Africa. Second, it describes the impact of British and French colonial
institutions on the transformation of property rights - and thus begins to
explain variation in the pattern of political and economic change witnessed
across Africa. Third, the project improves our theoretical understanding of the
political process by which property rights institutions change, and the
conditions under which those rights are made more secure. The researcher uses a
most similar systems research design. She examines the transformation of
property rights among the Akan who straddled the Ghanaian-Ivoirian border; and
among the Bamileke, who reside in the former British and French portions of
Cameroon. By selecting border groups, the researcher holds constant variables
such as ecological climate or proximity to urban center and isolates the effect
of a single independent variable: colonial institutions. By choosing one
hierarchically organized society (the Akan), and one decentralized society (the
Bamileke), the investigator examines the power of rival hypotheses, which link
the difference in the transformation of land tenure to the indigenous social
structure. The investigator relies on qualitative data, specifically archival
data and oral interviews. These data allow determination of the strategies
landowners used to acquire land and defend that land from other claimants. ***
