Proposal: "Parity Violation in Moller Scattering and Real Photon
Experiments"&lt;br/&gt;PI: Piotr Decowski, Smith
College&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract: The grant will support involvement of
undergratuate women students &lt;br/&gt;in cutting edge experiments at the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center: in the &lt;br/&gt;high precision
measurements of electroweak mixing angle at very low momentum&lt;br/&gt;transfer
and in the first two experiments that will use the new photon
&lt;br/&gt;facility in the SLAC End Station A. The photon experiments will
measure&lt;br/&gt;nuclear mass dependence of J/psi and psi-prime photoproduction
cross sections &lt;br/&gt;and will determine gluon spin density in protons from
open charm &lt;br/&gt;photoproduction. Students will participate in building and
testing parts of &lt;br/&gt;detection systems at Smith College, and in analysis
of data at SLAC.&lt;br/&gt;
