Interpreting the locomotor behavior of ancestral primates relies primarily upon
the ability to predict adaptive function from fossil bones. Such predictions
follow from morphological comparisons of skeletons of extant primates for which
behavior in the wild is reasonably well documented. The objective of this
proposal is to isolate variables in muscular architecture, and their correlates
in the bony skeleton, that can distinguish arboreal from terrestrial quadrupeds
(in this particular case, two very closely related primate species of guenon
monkeys, C. aethiops and C. ascanius). This will provide clearer insights into
the locomotor adaptations of fossil primates.
