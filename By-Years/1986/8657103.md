Research involves the integration of solid-state sensors with high-performance
integrated circuits (integrated sensors). Research areas include developing
semiconductor processing techniques in the fabrication of microminiature sensor
structures. Integrated sensor structures and devices under study and planned for
next year include multifunctional sensor chips which will be based primarily on
silicon technology but preliminary studies of compound semiconductors such as
gallium arsenide and mercury cadmium telluride will be considered for the
integrated sensor application. Sensor studies in this work will focus on
materials, devices, and circuits for 1) air flow measurement, 2) measurement of
acceleration, 3) detection of chemical heat-of- reaction, 4) magnetic field
sensing, and 5) chemical vapor sensing. Many of the above sensors will be based
on the compatible incorporation of piezoelectric and pyroelectric zinc oxide
with silicon MOS technology.
