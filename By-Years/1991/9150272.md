Under a partnership involving IBM, the MAA and the NSF, eight regional computer
laboratories are being established to serve as centers for dissemination of
information about instructional materials for use in undergraduate mathematics
courses. IBM is providing the equipment and additional financial support and
with NSF support, workshops are being conducted to provide initial training for
the managers of the laboratories and a two day course is being held at each
laboratory to provide faculty from that region with experience in use of
laboratory based instructional materials.
