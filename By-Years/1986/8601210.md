Probability Theory has undergone rapid transformations in recent decades, due
largely to the demand by industry and defense to address increasing complete
decision problems. Theoretical advances have outstripped computational
considerations. The principal investigator will begin to rectify this imbalance
by focusing on algorithm methods in applied probability, in particular, by the
developing and testing of algorithms based on specific classes of distribution,
the structure of processes and for continuum operations via transform methods.
