Bridges, buildings, highway pavements, and similar structures are deteriorating
at a rapid rate in the United States. Methods to determine the amount of
deterioration to a reasonable degree are not available and, therefore, it is
impossible to determine the remaining life of the structure. This project will
investigate the use of x-ray fluorescense and neutron/gamma detection to
determine the internal condition of materials in place. The two methods are
complementary and will provide a range of capability for use on different
materials. Conditions to be evaluated are salt, moisture, location of voids,
reinforcements, effectiveness of desalination, and penetration of preservatives
or consolidants. The results will be very useful to evaluate the condition of
existing structures and to determine when repair, retrofit, or replacement may
be necessary.
