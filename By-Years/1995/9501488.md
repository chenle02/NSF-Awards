This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral Dissertation Research
Program. This study will examine the conditions under which welfare recipients
are able to make the transition into the job market. Theories examined include
those relating to human capital, network links, and individual attitudes about
the self. A carefully selected sample of 50 AFDC recipients will be interviewed
to learn which characteristics are most likely to lead to successful job
transitions. Additional information will be obtained from interviews with
potential employers. %%% This research will contribute to sociological
understanding of urban poverty, welfare policies, and the pathways to
employment. The focus of this research on welfare and the transition to work
makes it valuable for policy makers concerned with encouraging employment. In
addition to the scientific gains to be achieved by the research, this award will
materially assist a highly promising student in completing research for the
Ph.D. dissertation. Thus it contributes to the future scientific manpower of the
national and the thorough training of the next generation of social scientists.
