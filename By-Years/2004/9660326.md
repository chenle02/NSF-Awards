*** 96-60326 Rosenthal This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I
project will explore control of vibrations for front-end semiconductor
manufacturing equipment, where micron precision is required. This control is
required at sub-Hertz (Hz) frequencies, where local seismic activity and
disturbances in the manufacturing plant often cause vibrations of the supporting
floor. Presently available vibration isolation tables are not effective below 1
Hz. A true multi-channel active feed-forward vibration controller is needed that
minimizes the total positional error of manufacturing equipment being
controlled. Phase I will investigate a new method called SFR-SVD, meaning
signal-free reference using singular value decomposition, to provide effective
vibration isolation at micron resolution and sub-Hertz frequencies. It is
expected to reduce vibration by at least 20 decibels from 0.1 Hz to 100 Hz.
Commercial application will be found in integrated circuit manufacturing
facilities of the semiconductor industry. The cost of semiconductor foundry
buildings may be significantly reduced. ***
