The Space Weather Workshop is an annual conference that brings industry,
academia, and government agencies together in a lively dialog about space
weather. This workshop has evolved into the Nation's leading conference on all
issues relating to space weather. The intellectual merit of the activity is
critical to the advancement of knowledge, understanding and needs of the space
weather research community. The workshop addresses the diverse impacts of space
weather on today's technology. The program highlights space weather impacts in
several areas, including communications, navigations, spacecraft operations,
aviation, and electric power. The presentations and discussions at the Space
Weather Workshop also focus on identifying the highest priority needs for
operational services that can guide future research and identifying new high-
value capabilities that can be transitioned into operations. The conference
fosters communication among researchers, space weather service providers, and
users of space weather services. The workshop will help develop mechanisms to
generate actionable information to drive improved space weather science,
products, services and application to serve a broad user community. The workshop
also fosters coordinated interagency approaches to space weather education and
outreach that will lead to better informed policy and decision makers yielding
more support for research, operational improvements, and better service to the
Nation.
