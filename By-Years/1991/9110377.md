The long-terms goals of this research are to understand the molecular and
cellular mechanisms underlying mammalian learning and memory. Experiments
performed during the last few years have provided a relatively detailed and
testable model describing a complex cascade of biochemical events leading from
certain patterns of electrical activity to long term changes in synaptic
efficacy. Dr. Michel Baudry will continue his work on synaptic plasticity by
using electrophysiological and biochemical techniques to evaluate the roles of
regulatory mechanisms involved in the modulation of the properties of glutamate
receptor subtypes in long-term potentiation and long-term depression in the
hippocampus. This work will be performed on mice, some of which are genetically
different from others. Information obtained should provide a more refined
description of the mechanisms underlying learning and memory not only in adults,
but also during the postnatal development period and to relate learning
abilities to different genotypes. This research has broad implications as it
might provide not only fundamental knowledge concerning cognitive processes but
also tools to alleviate learning disorders during development.
