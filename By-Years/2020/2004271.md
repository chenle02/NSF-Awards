Algebraic Statistics 2020 (AS2020) will be held June 22--June 26, 2020 at the
University of Hawaii at Manoa in Honlulu, HI. The five-day conference at the
University of Hawaii at Manoa aims to achieve four objectives: 1) provide a
forum for algebraists, mathematical biologists, and statisticians to learn about
recent advances in the field and share their current challenges; 2) broaden
participation in algebraic statistics in terms of gender, race, ethnicity,
institution type, geography, and scientific discipline; 3) train junior
researchers in this interdisciplinary area, which requires exposure to both
algebra and statistics; and 4) foster collaboration with international
researchers, specifically those from Japan, who have been making fundamental
progress in the field in the last two decades. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Algebraic
statistics is an interdisciplinary field that uses tools from commutative
algebra, geometry, and combinatorics to address problems in mathematical
statistics. The main applications in the last decade have focused on data
science, biology, and engineering. Algebraic Statistics 2020 will feature nine
keynote speakers, from the US and abroad, three problem sessions led by
established researchers in the field to engage junior researchers and those
interested in learning more about algebraic statistics, contributed talks, and a
poster session. The conference website is

NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
