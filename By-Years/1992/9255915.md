The Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County will initiate an academic year
Young Scholars project in ecological research methods, data analysis and
scientific writing for 20 students entering grades 10-12. Participants will
attend a 30-week course in four museum-related disciplines, concentrating
specifically on the natural history of southern California. Each of the four
"courselets" will be taught by museum curatorial staff and will include
lectures, discussions, lab activities and a field trip to demonstrate field
research techniques. Workshops will be conducted on research methodology and
project design, statistics, scientific writing and ethics in science. Students
will conduct ongoing small group research projects pertaining to subject matter
covered in the courselets. This program is designed to expose high school
students to the research roles of museums, curators and other scientists and to
increase the students' knowledge about the educational requirements for a career
in the sciences.
