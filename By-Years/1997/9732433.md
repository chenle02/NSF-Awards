This project is a continuation of an experimental investigation of long-range
forces between neutral atoms and condensed matter surfaces. Attention will be
directed toward (a) trying to resolve a discrepancy between theory and
experiment on the strength of the van der Waals force between ground state
neutral atoms and conducting surfaces and (b) examining major features in the
current theory of atom-surface forces.
