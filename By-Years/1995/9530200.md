9530200 SMAYDA A 32-yr (1959-1990), process-oriented, quantitative time-series
of weekly environmental and phytoplankton and zooplankton measurements in
Narragansett Bay, supplemented by numerous laboratory and in situ experiments,
will be analyzed. This data set appears to be the longest, quantitative time-
series on plankton and environment available globally. At maximal activity, 27
variables and processes were measured weekly. This project will investigate the
patterns, cycles, trends and variability in environmental conditions and their
relationships to plankton population dynamics. Knowledge of interanual and
interdecadal variability is central to understanding how plankton systems
behave; the "baseline" against which the effects of culturally induced changes
can be detected, measured, and predicted. ***
