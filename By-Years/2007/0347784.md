This project will construct a set of tools and protocols to identify and analyze
the important structural features of online and live communities of practice.
The analytical perspective used brings together ideas from research fields that
too rarely intersect: the study of online communities from ethnographic and
social network theory perspectives; accumulated experience from design
experiments; the anthropological study of professional communities of practice;
and teacher professional development research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An essential
part of the project will be the enhancement of current professional development
for two specific communities of teachers, graduate instructors teaching
gatekeeper courses with high minority populations. A combined online and live
course and support structure will be developed for graduate algebra instructors
at San Francisco State calculus teaching assistants, and the ideas will then be
adapted for graduate instructors of the PDP Treisman workshops at UC Berkeley.
The project will assess the growth of the participants, in terms of teaching
skill, attitudes and their pedagogical content knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;
