9610073 Puleo This research is directed at the development and understanding of
methods for biochemical surface modification of bioinert orthopedic and dental
implant materials. Specifically, biomaterials with plasma-deposited thin films
will be used to deliver and retain osteoinductive bone morphogenetic protein
(BMP) at the cell-biomaterial interface so as to induce expression of the
osteoblast phenotype and thus promote mineralization. The specific aims of the
research are to: (1) quantify the benefit to the amount and/or
stability/retention of BMP-2 provided by immobilization on plasma treated
metallic biomaterials, (2) characterize the bioactivity of BMP-conjugated
biomaterials by assessing expression of osteoblastic traits in vitro using two
pluripotent mesenchymal cell types, (3) determine the individual and combined
roles of weakly and strongly bound BMP-2 in promoting osteoinduction in vitro.
This research could provide knowledge to help promote early fixation and
compensate for gaps between bone and implant in orthopedic and dental
applications. ***
