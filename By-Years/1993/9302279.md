In the past two decades, researching the functional morphology of primate teeth
has managed to make connections with certain diets. Long molar crest length has
been associated with leaf and insect diets, cups sharpness with insect diets,
and low crown relief with fruit diets. However, there has been little attention
to the obvious variation in the physical properties of foods (eg. hardness of
various preferred fruits or nuts, or even in leaf tenderness). Also, seasonal
variation in diets has not been addressed systematically in such studies, but
clearly that is an important variable. This study will address these and related
issues in field and museum studies of a series of Madagascar strepsirhines. It
will provide insights into the relation of tooth form and structure to dietary
variation.
