The University of Wisconsin at La Crosse will provide teachers in rural
Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Iowa with intensive training in energy alternatives,
chemicals in society, pollution and aquatic biology, and biotechnology. A three-
week summer workshop will review scientific principles, describe technological
applications of science, and discuss, at length, the responsibilities of
society. Forty selected high school teachers from western Wisconsin,
southeastern Minnesota, and northeastern Iowa will experience field trips,
special lectures by community professionals, and a large variety of appropriate
laboratory activities. Curriculum development will be initiated and implemented
with the support of the local school districts. During the academic year
following the workshop, participants will integrate lessons involving
technological applications and related societal issues into existing curriculum
in their high schools. The project staff will actively assist participants by
visiting schools on a regular basis for observation and support. The workshop
staff and participants will share responsibility for the dissemination of
related educational materials to as many science teachers as possible through
attendance at professional meetings as well as at specially developed "sharing"
programs.
