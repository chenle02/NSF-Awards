The focus of this research is the synthesis of corannulene homologs containing
16, 21 and 26 rings. These derivatives will be used to form upramolecular
complexes with C-60 and other fullerenes. Other targets include barrelyne and
60-carbon molecules that could provide key intermediates for the preparation of
endohedral complexes of C-60. New understanding in the area contains the
potential for the rational development of new advanced materials. With this
renewal award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr.
Lawrence T. Scott of the Department of Chemistry at Boston College. Professor
Scott will focus his wok on constructing novel organic molecules. The target
compounds are characterized by by highly condensed, convex networks of trigonal
carbons that map onto the polyatomic framework of the fullerenes. New
understanding in this area could lead to the rational development of advanced
materials having potential importance in the emerging realm of nanotechnology.
