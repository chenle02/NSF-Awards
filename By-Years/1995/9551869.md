Title: An Advanced Undergraduate Laboratory for Microfabrication This project is
for the development of a laboratory-based undergraduate course in general
microfabrication techniques and processes. Microfabrication was originally
developed by the microelectronics industry to batch-fabricate miniature
integrated circuits. Only recently has it been applied to other fields and
disciplines. The slow infiltration of microfabrication technology into the non-
electronic disciplines is due to the fact that microelectronic fabrication
techniques have traditionally only been taught to graduate electrical
engineering students or undergraduate students specifically studying
microelectronic devices. In order for non-electronic interdisciplinary
applications of microfabrication to be developed, an appropriate transfer of
this technology to the interested audience needs to take place. The laboratory
course being developed serves as that missing link by introducing this versatile
and powerful technology to a broader audience base. Microfabrication can do for
the mechanical and physical world what microelectronic fabrication did for the
electronic world. The world of microfabrication has tremendous potential, and
numerous applications to a wide spectrum of disciplines are possible. However,
the majority of those applications will never be realized unless
microfabrication is exposed to a broader audience and introduced earlier into
the academic curriculum.
