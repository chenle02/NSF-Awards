This project includes research into a broad range of topics in computability
theory (recursion theory) and into logic applied to various areas of computer
science. Included in the first area are investigations of recursively enumerable
sets, several structures of degrees of complexity from Turing to polynomial
time, and the proof theoretic complexity of some mathematical theorems. The
second area of research includes the analysis and development of a source in
nonmonotonic logic, concurrent programming models, resource bounded logic, and
applications of linear programming ideas and algorithms to data structures and
logic programming. Both theoretical computability questions and more practical
ones are addressed by this project. The theoretical ones are the ones in what is
known as recursion theory, which deals with a model of computability knowing no
bounds on time or space. Although answers to such questions have the ability to
illuminate practical questions, they are really practical only when their
answers are negative, for it is a very strong statement indeed to say that
something cannot be computed even when one puts no limits on resources available
for the purpose. The finer structure of computability theory is even more
relevant to actual computations, and various aspects of that will also be
considered.
