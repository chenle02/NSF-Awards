AST 0307926&lt;br/&gt;Nesvorny&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. David Nesvorny,
Southwest Research Institute, will lead a study of the binary objects recently
discovered in the Kuiper Belt and of the moons of the jovian planets. These two
components of the present Solar System inventory probably date back to the
earliest epochs. Dr. Nesvorny will study various scenarios for their formation,
not solely to explain why they are there, but also to provide crucial
constraints on the current models of planet formation. His research team will
model three recently suggested scenarios of the formation of binary Kuiper Belt
Objects to probe physical conditions that existed in the trans-Neptunian disk
during early epochs. To derive constraints on jovian planet and satellite
formation, the group will study the effects of collisions and gravitational
perturbations on the moons in several planetary formation scenarios. Finally,
they will investigate the possibility that some irregular moons formed when
small objects in the inner proto-satellite disk were scattered outward by the
major satellites and decoupled from them by the effect of passing planetesimals
or by solar tides. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To broaden the impact of this research,
Dr. Nesvorny will partner with the Denver Museum of Nature and Science to bring
aspects of this project's results to the Museum's
visitors.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
