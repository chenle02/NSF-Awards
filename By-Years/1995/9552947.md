9552947 Fate The public broadcasting radio station KCAW-FM is to produce a five-
part radio series profiling Arctic women in science. The series, to be called,
"Alaska Women in Science," is scheduled to be broadcast with the cooperation and
support of the Alaska Public Radio Network. It will be distributed statewide,
with curriculum materials for grades 6-12 to be distributed under the auspices
of the Alaska Department of Education. Both five and fifteen minute versions of
the programs are to be prepared for broadcast and distribution. A series of
profiles featuring Alaskan women scientists, representing a range of
disciplines, will show them at work in their laboratories and/or field
environments. Each segment is to offer both personal and professional insights
into the experiences of the woman scientist featured, and is to provides a
positive role model for young women listeners.
