The nascent information superhighway is offering rapidly expanding opportunities
for citizens to engage in political activities electronically. `Electronic
democracy` projects have generated a great deal of speculation about how new
network-based technologies will affect patterns of political access and
participation, and ultimately, how these will affect the distribution of
political influence and power in the US. This study involves a longitudinal
survey of political participation at several electronic democracy sites, with
the aim of producing an empirical profile of electronic participators. Data will
be collected using on-line surveys at several electronic democracy sites, which
will be conducted in three rounds spaced at six-month intervals. Questions will
examine socioeconomic status, support for the political system, traditional
participation habits, party identification and ideology, and extent of
participation in the electronic democracy site. Data from the survey will be
used to construct a statistical profile of users of electronic democracy at the
sites included in the study. That profile will be compared with a profile of
traditional political participators drawn from existing data in the National
Election Studies and General Social Survey, and a series of hypotheses about
differences between profiles tested. Among the aims of the study are: a)
providing evidence about the extent to which the technology of electronic
democracy may alleviate or exacerbate problems of access and alienation among
low-income, less educated citizens; b) shedding empirical light on the claims of
some that the technology may bring about a populist renewal of democracy; and c)
exploring a new model of political participation that adds medium of
participation to variables for individual-level characteristics and political
context.
