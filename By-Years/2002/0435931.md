This project aims to improve our fundamental understanding of linear and non-
linear planetary scale wave motions, including wave propagation and breaking, in
realistically complex atmospheric flows. Particular attention will be paid to
the stratospheric polar vortex, where chemical and dynamical processes can lead
to severe reductions in the total ozone column, and which is also believed to
play a role in both climate trends and in shorter term predictability of surface
weather patterns. Two complementary paradigms involving Rossby wave motion will
be examined in which respective basic states comprise either smooth or
discontinuous distributions of the potential vorticity. Traditionally, the
former paradigm has received more attention, despite the fact that potential
vorticity distributions in the winter stratosphere tend to form almost
discontinuous, step-like structures. In this study, gradients will be examined
in numerical models and the ideal configuration of horizontal and vertical
resolution in such models will be explored.
