As software controls an ever-increasing number of devices that perform critical
tasks, their security and robustness are of paramount importance to society. In
addition, malicious software and "greyware" that violates the privacy of users
causes billions in damage every year and erodes public confidence in computing
systems. However, despite decades of work on techniques to analyze software with
automated techniques, it remains a difficult and largely manual task. The ExHume
project aims to address this issue by collecting detailed information about both
normal and erroneous behaviors of a large corpus of real-world software. This
behavioral information will then be used to inform a new generation of
empirically guided program analysis techniques, with the goal of significantly
improving software vulnerability discovery and reverse engineering techniques.

The technical approach taken by ExHume is to capture in vivo traces of software
using low-overhead record and replay techniques. This corpus, which will consist
of normal and buggy executions of benign and malicious software, can then be
mined to extract a wide variety of detailed, dynamic information about the
runtime properties of the software under test. Specifically, the data gathered
will be used to create (a) new heuristics for guiding program exploration, which
can be used for symbolic execution and guided fuzz testing; (b) methods for
identifying previously unseen implementations of known functionality and
algorithms; and (c) a set of domain-specific dynamic taint analyses that can aid
in explicating the features used by image processing and machine learning
algorithms.
