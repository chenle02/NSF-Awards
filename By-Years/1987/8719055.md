The objective of this research is to integrate the concepts of dynamic and
static security assessment. The integration begins by examining the relationship
between load-flow equilibrium solutions and steady state stability analysis
techniques. The integration process continues by relating sensitivities of
transient stability margins to steady- state parameter values. Modeling issues
arise throughout the study in terms of reduced-order models, system equivalents,
and other simplifications. These formal, time-scale methods used by the
proposers will add a firm mathematical framework to the ad-hoc engineering
approximations now in existence for evaluating the static and/or transient
character of a large-scale interconnected power system.
