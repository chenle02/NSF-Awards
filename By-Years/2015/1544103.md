The Promoting Research and Innovation in Methodologies for Evaluation (PRIME)
program seeks to support research on evaluation with special emphasis on: (1)
exploring innovative approaches for determining the impacts and usefulness of
STEM education projects and programs; (2) building on and expanding the
theoretical foundations for evaluating STEM education and workforce development
initiatives, including translating and adapting approaches from other fields;
and (3) growing the capacity and infrastructure of the evaluation
field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project supports engineering faculty in their
efforts to develop, evaluate, and improve delivery of their courses. The work is
supported by the Course Social and Cognitive Engagement (CSCE) Framework. The
expected outcomes of this project are: (1) an exploratory framework for how
engineering faculty make choices and engage in evaluation processes; (2) a
deeper understanding of processes that underlie cognitive and social engagement
in engineering classrooms; and, (3) a valid and reliable CSCE instrument with
modular subscales to measure student engagement of STEM education.
