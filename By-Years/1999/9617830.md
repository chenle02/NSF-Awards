With funds for a Small Grant for Exploratory Research from the Organic Dynamics
Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor W. Grant McGimpsey of Worcester
Polytechnic Institute will carry our work relating to the design, synthesis, and
time-resolved photochemical evaluation of relatively large, multichromophoric
molecules which are candidates for functioning as optically driven photonic and
electronic wires. The novelty of this proposal is the use of a second laser
pulse to excite a metastable triplet formed in a first pulse. The chromophore on
which excitation ultimately resides will be accessible only following absorption
of the second photon, and thus absorption or emission which requires that
chromophore is a signature for the second photon. The future of computation
requires ever decreasing size and ever increasing speed. At some point molecular
devices may become practical and well understood enough to be functional
contributors to this goal. Materials such as those being studied might
eventually function as molecular switches, potentially a component of future
computers. The basic research to be done in this project lays the groundwork for
both materials and technique.
