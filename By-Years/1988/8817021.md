Much of Alaska consists of a collage of lithotectonic terranes, however,
considerable controversy exists concerning where many of these terranes
originated and how they traveled to their current location. This RUI project
will investigate the Goodnews-Togiak-Tikchik (GTT) composite terrane of
southwestern Alaska by paleomagnetic analysis of cores previously collected from
the Tikchik Wilderness area. These data will be incorporated with results of
other studies in an effort to constrain the terrane trajectory for this
composite terrane.
