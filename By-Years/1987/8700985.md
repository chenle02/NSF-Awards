The theory of Lie groups, named in honor of the Norwegian mathematician Sophus
Lie, has been one of the major themes in twentieth century mathematics. As the
mathematical vehicle for exploiting the symmetries inherent in a system, Lie
theory has had a profound impact upon mathematics itself and theoretical
physics, especially quantum mechanics and elementary particle physics. Critical
to the use of Lie theory are the linear realizations of the symmetries, called
representations. In recent years, the algebraic approach to representation
theory of semi-simple Lie groups has grown in power and importance, and it
dominates in the attempt to classify all the irreducible representations.
Professor Shelton is an expert in this methodology. His work involves an array
of interactions with other areas of mathematics, including homological algebra,
spectral sequences, and sheaves of differential operators. He has begun a
systematic study of the difficult problem of computing extensions between
universal highest weight modules in various categories. He has solved this
problem for certain special classes of groups, most notably those associated to
Hermitian symmetric pairs. He proposes to extend his work to the general
category of semi-simple Lie groups.
