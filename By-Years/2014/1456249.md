Measurements and chemical analysis of super-micron (greater than 1 micrometer)
sized particles in the atmosphere are being made as part of the aircraft-based
Wintertime Investigation of Transport, Emissions, and Reactivity (WINTER) field
campaign, scheduled to take place during January and February 2015. An important
goal of the WINTER campaign is to characterize the multiphase chemical
processing and transport of air emissions over the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic US
during wintertime. These data, when combined with the measurements being made by
other campaign investigators, are expected to provide unique insight into the
chemical processes that occur in the atmosphere during the winter months This
research is relevant to the development and optimization of models used for
predicting air quality and climate change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chemical
analysis of the aerosol samples will provide data on the concentrations of
soluble ions (chloride, nitrate, sulfate, oxalate, sodium, ammonium, potassium,
magnesium and calcium) in the atmosphere. The abundance and distribution of
aerosol chloride can play a critical role in the production of nitryl chloride
(ClNO2) and influence regional atmospheric photochemistry. Supermicron sea salt
and dust particles can serve as strong sinks for gas phase nitric and sulfuric
acids and influence the chemical cycling of nitrogen and sulfur oxides, possibly
competing with processes leading to new particle formation. The combined results
from the WINTER campaign will lead to a more comprehensive understanding of the
year-round fate of anthropogenic pollutant emissions in the atmosphere.
