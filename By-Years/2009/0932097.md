This project supports the participation of researchers in data mining and
machine learning, as well as domain experts, at the "Next Generation Data Mining
Summit: Dealing with the Energy Crisis, Global Warming, and Transportation
Challenges" (NGDM 2009) from September 30 - October 2, 2009 in Baltimore, MD.
Through invited talks, competitively-assessed papers, panel and audience
discussion, the summit encourages the participants and larger community to
cooperatively define data mining problems and share resources so as to advance
solutions to long-term sustainability challenges.
