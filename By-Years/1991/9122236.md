In this Experimental Physical Chemistry project,sponsored by the Chemistry
Division, Prof. Maroncelli (Pennsylvania State University) will measure
picosecond kinetics of excited state proton transfer reactions and their
catalysis by alcohol solvents. Mechanistic analysis of the data will be carried
out with the aid of molecular dynamic simulations. The result will be a detailed
understanding of the role of solvent geometry in assisting this important class
of chemical reactions. %%% Chemical reactions in which a single proton hops from
place to place in a molecule occur widely in nature, and play a central role in
both biochemical and technologically important processes. These reactions are
typically too fast to be studied in detail. Prof. Maroncelli (Pennsylvania State
University) will address this problem using new, ultrafast optical spectroscopic
methods and powerful computer simulations. The result will be a molecular level
understanding of one of the most important reactions in chemistry.
