In this three-year U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research project in polymer
materials between Radivoje Vukovic of INA Research and Development in Zagreb and
Frank Karasz of the University of Massachusetts, the investigators will continue
to study the relationship between polymer miscibility (the capacity to blend and
combine) and chemical structure. Polymers and new copolymers prepared by the
Yugoslav group will be analyzed for structure and those properties which promote
blending and compatibility. The goal of the project is to develop new and
improved polymer blends. This is an excellent international match. The Yugoslav
group, highly experienced in polymer synthesis, will prepare the new copolymers
while the U.S. group will analyze its properties and characteristics. This
project was approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on Cooperation in Science
and Technology and is supported through a joint fund consisting of matching
contributions from the governments of the United States and Yugoslavia. The U.S.
contribution is provided annually by the Department of State. No NSF funds are
involved. Grants are made to the principal scientific institution in Yugoslavia,
but include dollar funds for U.S. scientist travel to Yugoslavia and for
Yugoslav scientists' living expenses in the U.S.
