This award provides computational equipment for the study of stochastic
approximations in statistics. The three areas of emphasis include the study of
modifications of stochastic approximation methods to insure that a point of
global rather than local minimum is approached, the study of stochastic
approximations in the case of dependent errors (that is, errors that do not form
something close to a martingale), and the study of finite sample behavior of
stochastic approximation methods.
