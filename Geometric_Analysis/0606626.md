Title: Future directions in global Riemannian geometry

The last few years have seen remarkable progress in several subfields of global
Riemannian geometry including the geometrization program, rigidity and
finiteness theorems for manifolds with various curvature bounds, classification
theorems for manifolds with large isometry groups etc. This conference will
gather many of the people in the field who have made lasting contributions and
present directions for future research. In particular, we expect to encourage
and support graduate students and young researchers to attend this conference.
The conference will give them an overview of techniques and methods in global
Riemannian geometry. It will also provide them with an opportunity to have
direct contact with the best researchers, with each other and foster good
opportunities for collaboration. The proposal seeks funding for a mathematical
conference entitled, ''Future directions in global Riemannian geometry''. The
conference will be held September 22nd-September 24th, 2006 at the mathematics
department of the University of Maryland, College Park. The conference is being
held to celebrate the sixtieth birthday of renowned geometer Karsten Grove of
the University of Maryland, College Park who has made seminal contributions to
the study of global geometric properties of higher dimensional objects called
Riemannian manifolds. The past few years have seen several exciting developments
in Riemannian geometry and our goal is to encourage new ideas and more
collaboration between graduate students, young researchers and other Riemannian
geometers.
