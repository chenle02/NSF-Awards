The objective of this research is to study the disruptive technology of protein-
based disk recording through recording/storing/retrieving information on the
surface of a photosensitive protein using near-field optical transducers
(nanolasers) and demonstrate the potential for areal densities beyond 10
Terabit/in2. The approach is to integrate unique and unmatched optical
properties of photochromic proteins with the state-of-the-art in the emerging
field of heat-assisted magnetic recording. These properties include thermal and
structural stability of 2-nm molecules with a photocycle with a characteristic
transition time of the order of a few
picoseconds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;The emphasis of
this multidisciplinary project will be on the device integration rather than the
biophysics of proteins. An "apertureless" &lt;br/&gt;near-field optical system
will be utilized to focus light into a spot size of less than 30 nm in diameter.
To manufacture unique ultra-high throughput nanolasers, as necessary for
adequate signal to noise ratio, focused ion beam will be used to define
nanoscale apertures on a metal-coated emitting edge of a semiconducting
diode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;UCR is one of America's
most ethnically diverse research institutions. The investigators commit to make
every effort to assure diversity among the students involved in this project and
especially with the goal to attract more young people in the region of Inland
Empire to enroll in Ph.D.&lt;br/&gt;programs. This effort also calls for
outreach to K-12 schools. Finally, it is anticipated that the study of the
"high-risk" protein-based memory could not only leapfrog the data storage
industry but also revive the national initiative in molecular electronics.
