9730655 Jovanovic The objective of this project is to construct the first models
in which the following features arise: (a) Growth and cycles are endogenous, (b)
They are driven by innovation, (c) The number of inventions is large, (d) There
are no "big" inventions, and (e) Growth and its variance can be negatively
correlated. These new models integrate the business-cycle half of macroeconomics
with the growth theory half. They provide a rigorous way of studying the
dynamics of business cycles and economic growth that is more consistent with the
U.S. experience. This project should provide valuable new insights into the
growth process and its variability. ??
