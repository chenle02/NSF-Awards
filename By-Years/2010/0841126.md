&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 0841126&lt;br/&gt;PI: Jon
Eisenberg&lt;br/&gt;Institution: National Academy of
Sciences&lt;br/&gt;Lead&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title:
Usability, Security, and Privacy of Information Systems: A
Workshop&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The National Academy of Sciences will
organize and hold a workshop to involve the community in topics of increasing
priority to NSF/CISE: namely usability and privacy. Usability is concerned with
providing tools to help users of all kinds (e.g., home users, enterprise
administrators, network administrators, forensics analysts) manage the security
and privacy of their systems. The privacy topic is very broad, as it deals with
a range of challenges and issues, e.g., what is privacy, what mechanisms will
help achieve it, how can privacy be measured, are their impossibility results
relating to the attainment of privacy?
