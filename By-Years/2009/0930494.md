This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).

This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project is to develop a novel
technology for the large-scale sorting of single walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs)
by diameter and electronic type.

An economical process for sorting carbon nanotubes can enable many applications.
Metallic SWNTs could serve as leads in nanoscale circuits, flexible and
transparent conductors (replacement for indium tin oxide (ITO)),
supercapacitors, and field emitters, while high-purity semiconducting SWNTs
could find applications in field-effect transistors, photovoltaic devices, and
sensors.
