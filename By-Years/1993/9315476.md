9315476 Denning This award of $156,000 is for curriculum development in complex
systems design. This project will bring into the design portfolios of
engineering students a selection of practices and tools used by researchers in
engineering and science to deal with large systems. Each selection will be
designed as a module consisting of handbooks, simulations,demonstrations,
software systems, and specifications of experiments. Each module will be
developed by an interdisciplinary team of three faculty and one graduate
student. Each team's mix -- computer science, computational science and
informatics, and school of education -- will assure that the source discipline's
thinking will be part of the module. The proposed project will complement and
leverage a major ARPA project dealing with high performance computing in the
curriculum. The proposed project will also complete a suite of initiatives
undertaken by the Computer Science Department at George Mason University to
transform undergraduate education.
