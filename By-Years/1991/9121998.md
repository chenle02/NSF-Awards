An idealized study of barotropic eddies in the ocean will be conducted by means
of numerical simulations and semi-analytic calculations. This is an important
step to understanding the dynamics of isolated baroclinic vortices in a
realistic ocean. Numerical simulations and laboratory experiments have shown
that, although the intermediate behavior of the eddies can be very complicated,
the final result of instability is either a stable rotating tripole or a pair of
stable translating dipoles. An analytic study of the stability of the initial
vorticity profiles to finite amplitude perturbations will also be done using a
moment approach based on Lagrangian perturbations.
