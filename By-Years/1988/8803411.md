The characteristics of a number of recurrent weather systems observed in the
Rocky Mountains and western United States will be examined under the direction
of Professor Bosart. While case studies of some weather systems first appeared
in literature several decades ago, little has followed since. One example is the
so called "Nevada low", which generally forms in spring east of the Sierras when
the 500 mb flow is southwesterly. A precursor lee trough is often seen from
Oregon to southern Nevada. What are the life cycle, dynamic and thermal
structures of the Nevada lows? Do they play any role in the later cyclogenesis
downstream? If so, how? These Nevada lows are believed to be different from
Colorado or Mediterranean lows, mostly attributed to differences in the physical
dimensions and characteristics of local terrain. Besides leading to a better
understanding, a careful study should also aid in the interpretation and
utilization of predictions from numerical models.
