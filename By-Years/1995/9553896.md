9553896 Zubrowski The project will develop a set of video and print materials
to inform and support teachers' understanding of hands-on elementary science
teaching and learning. The materials are designed for use in in-service teacher
education, preservice education, science center or museum training, and
community-based programs. The project will build on work of a previous NSF-
supported project by Zubrowski that is producing a series of eight video tapes
that depict students engaged in the free exploration of various science
phenomena. The follow-up project, in response from reactions from teachers and
teacher educators using the pilot material, will produce four half-hour videos
that will illustrate a complete teaching/learning cycle where students explore a
single phenomenon and continue on to develop and apply conceptual understanding
related to the phenomenon. In the new material, the students will interact with
materials and phenomena in a design engineering/inquiry science investigation.
