For the past 150 years, organic chemists were concerned with the understanding
of the covalent bond. Recently, research on molecular recognition (generated by
weak, non-covalent interactions) has been recognized worldwide as an important
intellectual and technological frontier. Endo- (generated by convergent
cavities) and exo (generated by larger bodies of similar size and shapes, or
surfaces) molecular recognition, preorganization and self-organization provide
the basis of spontaneous generation of functional supramolecular architectures
via self-assembly from their components. It is now accepted that molecular
recognition directed synthesis and self-assembly are responsible for the
generation and properties of biological systems. This research aims to use
molecular recognition both to self-assemble synthetic supramolecular liquid
crystalline polymers and to direct their phase behavior. Two novel classes of
polymers will be investigated: functional supramolecular polymers which self-
assemble by using principles that resemble those of tobacco mosaic virus, and
both cyclic main-chain polymers, as well as polymers containing liquid
crystalline cyclophane (i.e., cyclic derivatives of main-chain liquid-
crystalline oligomers) receptors as structural units. The second class of
liquid-crystalline polymers will display molecular recognition directed phase
transitions. It is expected that this research will produce molecular devices
such as self-assembled supramolecular synthetic ion channels and various other
systems which, by analogy with natural biological systems, will combine
selective recognition with external regulation. Most important, this research
will enable a step ahead in understanding some of the processes that nature uses
and about which we know so little, and transplant them to the field of synthetic
su pramolecular polymers.
