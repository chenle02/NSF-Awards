The research will assess the possible relations between pattern and process by
using a spatially explicit simulation model that produces spatial patterns which
will be compared to patterns recorded by Landsat imagery. The work will allow
testing of the effects of different positive feedback strength, seed rain, and
environmental gradient on the abundance of tree species at an ecotone. A sample
of 30 to 40 rectangular hillslopes will be identified for this purpose in
Glacier National Park. The patterns observed on the landscape and simulated in
the model runs will be quantified using common metrics of landscape pattern.
Further a hybrid metric will be generated which best describes the dominant
variation among the sampled units. A model to predict the observed metrics will
be fit from the simulation parameterizations. The outcome will be a deeper
understanding of the basic ecology of ecotones through a stronger
conceptualization between pattern and process. The work is also germane to the
notion of ecotones as indicators of the impacts of climate change.
