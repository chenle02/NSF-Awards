The modern molecular approach of nucleic acid sequence comparison will be
combined with the latest computer-aided cladistic analyses to answer fundamental
questions about the evolutionary relationships and taxonomy of a widely known
and frequently used algal unicell, Chlamydomonas and its relatives. Drs. Mark
Buchheim and Russell Chapman at Louisiana State University have gathered
preliminary evidence that indicates that many of the 500 or so described species
of Chlamydomonas are not valid and that textbook examples of the evolution of
motile colonies of algae from unicellular Chlamydomonas must be re- examined.
The extensive use of this organism and some of its relatives in cell biology and
molecular biology research, as well as its prominence in virtually all textbook
coverages of green algae, make the study of this eukaryote unicell especially
important. Nuclear encoded ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences will be obtained
through direct sequence analysis using reverse transcriptase enzymes or through
polymerase chain reaction amplification of ribosomal DNA. Sequences are aligned
by computer and used as characters for taxonomic evaluation of the most likely
pattern of phylogenetic splitting leading to the several subgroups of
Chlamydomonas currently recognized. The phylogeny so obtained will test whether
colonial or multicellular forms of green algae have evolved only once or several
times, and from what likely ancestral lineages.
