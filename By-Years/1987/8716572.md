This research seeks to determine the mechanisms by which the plant
chromoprotein, phytochrome, photoreversibly regulates the activity of nuclear
enzymes, especially that of a chromatin-associated nucleoside triphosphatase
(NTPase). The research is designed to follow up and extend earlier findings
which showed that red-light activated phytochrome could stimulate NTPase
activity and nuclear protein phosphorylation in isolated pea nuclei and that
Ca2+ and calmodulin played important roles in this response. It will be
determined how much Ca2+ is required to support the NTPase stimulation and
determine whether red light induces a change in the free Ä±Ca2+! in the nuclear
preparation. Phytochrome will be immunocytochemically localized in isolated
nuclei to help evaluate where within the preparation it may be functioning.
Binding of purified NTPase to DNA will be studied. Specific DNA sequences that
are recognized by the enzyme will be sought. There is evidence the NTPase may be
phosphorylated by a spermine-activated NII kinase. This kinase will be isolated
and characterized to test whether it can phosphorylate the NTPase and whether
its activation is promoted also by calcium.%%% Results expected from the
proposed experiments should contribute significantly to an improved
understanding of how light and Ca2+ can regulate nuclear metabolism, with
possible implications also for models of how phytochrome regulates gene
expression. The ultimate aim of this project is to understand how the plant
photoreceptor, phytochrome, controls growth and development changes in plants.
Current data favor the hypothesis that phytochrome achieves this control in many
instances by inducing specific alterations of membrane properties in target
cells.***//
