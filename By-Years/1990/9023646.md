Specific technical objectives of this research are to: o Evaluate the current
understanding of material properties (primarily for silicon, bulk and thin
films), as a basis for good spring design. These properties will not only
include the tensile and shear moduli, but also the yield strength, fracture, and
fatigue properties. o Determine a set of commonly required spring configurations
(cantilevers, spirals, bridges, etc). o Analyze (utilizing micro-finite element
analysis) spring configurations for their compliance, resistance to
manufacturing errors and tolerances, resistance to stress concentrations,
fatigue, etc. o Analyze spring configurations for their micro- dynamic
responses, resonant frequencies, etc. o From the above, extract a set of rules
for designing standard springs. The rule-set will depend upon: material;
stiffness (or natural frequency) required; space and orientation required;
preferred technology, and other aspects. o Integrate the rule-set into a
computer-aided micro-mechanical spring/oscillator design system.
