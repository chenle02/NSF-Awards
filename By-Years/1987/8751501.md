The Kalamazoo Area Mathematics and Science Center, established in 1985 with a
$2,000,000 gift from the Upjohn Company, provides facilities for advanced
mathematics and science activities and courses for high school teachers and
students from nine public and three non-public school districts. This project
will develop and implement expanded programs for utilizing technical
professionals from area industries, hospitals, and other non-educational
organizations as well as from neighboring higher education institutions to
expand the programs of the Center, both internally and through outreach to area
schools. These outside professional will be utilized in two capacities. As
resources persons, they will work with teachers in enriching class curricula
through consulting, classroom presentations, and assisting in the development of
teaching materials. As mentors, they will help individual students devise and
conduct research projects. Replicable procedures for recruiting, training, and
utilizing such resource persons and mentors will be developed and disseminated
widely for use in other communities. Cost sharing by the partners will total
100% of the NSF funding.
