This workshop will bring together leading researchers in cultural anthropology
to a two-day workshop in Washington DC at the end of June 1995. The workshop
will discuss issues, theories, concepts and methodologies in the broad area of
how cultural anthropology can advance knowledge in Human Dimensions of Global
Change and in Human Capital. The result of the workshop will be a paper defining
a research agenda in which cultural anthropology's strengths as a research
tradition are matched to the needs in these two general research areas. This
workshop is important because the fundamental issues of human-environmental
interactions and human creativity and productivity in the broadest sense have
been traditional parts of anthropology's research agenda. The attention of this
workshop will help define the current issues and focus the interest of
contemporary researchers on these specific research topics.
