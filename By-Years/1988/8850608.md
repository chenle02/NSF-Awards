This project will enhance the use of data in the making of informed policy and
programmatic decisions at the national, state, and local levels by disseminating
information on the status of science and mathematics education. Initially the
project will be based on the recently completed report of the l985-86 National
Survey of Science and Mathematics Education. Later, other studies such as the
National Assessment of Educational Progress(NAEP), the international science and
mathematics assessments, and state data gathering programs will be included. The
participants in the project will include national professional organizations,
state science and mathematics supervisors and others interested in the status of
science and mathematics education. Each participant will be provided with
briefing books which summarize the data through pie charts, bar graphs, and
tabular results presented in the form of transparency masters and camera ready
copy. Basic training in survey design will also be provided so that policy
makers and program personnel will be better able to judge the adequacy of survey
efforts and decide when policy changes are indicated.
