This award provides 60% funding for the acquisition of a combined atomic force
and scanning tunneling microscope system that will be installed and operated in
the Beckman Institute Materials Resource Center at the California Institute of
Technology. Funding from the National Science Foundation will be shared equally
between the divisions of Chemistry and Earth Sciences. Caltech is committed to
providing the remaining 40% funding required. The microscope system will be
capable of imaging surface topography of materials at the resolution of
individual atoms. It will be applied in a large number of research projects at
Caltech where surface analysis is critical; for example the interaction of
aqueous species at solid-liquid interfaces.
