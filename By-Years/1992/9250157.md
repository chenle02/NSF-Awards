The study of molecular asymmetry is being incorporated into the laboratory
curriculum at four different levels: in the first semester introductory organic
laboratory, students resolve optical isomers and prove chirality and measure
optical purity using a polarimeter; during the second semester they synthesize
secondary alcohols in enantiomeric excess and determine the isomeric ratios; in
the advanced instrumental laboratories, enantiomers are resolved on a chiral
HPLC column using the polarimeter as an HPLC detector; the chiral synthesis of
(+)- disparlure, the Gypsy moth pheromone, is performed in an advanced organic
laboratory. This equipment is also significantly enhancing undergraduate
research in chiral synthesis.
