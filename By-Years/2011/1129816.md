The research topic of this IRES program in Hong Kong is applied mathematics. Ten
undergraduate students from the U.S. are selected each year to go to the Hong
Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) where they will collaborate
with another group of ten students from Hong Kong and China. The program
solicits mathematics-related problems from industry in the area, and the
students work on those problems in mixed teams of four students each. Each team
has an academic mentor as well as an industrial mentor. Students are encouraged
to publish their final reports. The intellectual merit of the program stems
primarily from the challenging problems that are identified in an industrial
setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This international research experience broadens
the students? understanding of the world, especially East Asia, and prepares
them to engage with international colleagues in the future course of their
careers. The PIs makes an effort to include underrepresented minorities, and the
experience encourages the participating undergraduates to appreciate research
and to continue to graduate school.
