Our society is increasingly more dependent on computing systems that include
components built from tensor models and rely on them to make critical decisions,
like for example airplane controllers built from MATLAB code, or neural networks
in self-driving cars. The surge in size and complexity of these systems has made
their development, testing, and verification extremely costly and time
consuming. To address this challenge, this project develops novel automated
reasoning techniques that can support the development cycle of tensor-based
systems, at scale, from design to verification, with the potential to increase
both performance and reliability of the resulting systems, while broadening the
applicability of symbolic reasoning to new domains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
goal of the project is to develop new automated reasoning and symbolic
optimization techniques needed for reasoning about complex systems that rely on
tensors and data as the underlying model of&lt;br/&gt;computation. The current
generation of automated reasoning techniques focuses solely on scalar domains,
and they are inadequate for reasoning about large tensor systems with data. This
project develops new reasoning techniques, in the context of satisfiability
modulo theories, that can operate at the level of tensors. The key novel ideas
explored in this project include high-level modeling and representation of
tensor models, data-aware reasoning and optimization techniques for both linear
and non-linear tensor models, and combination of numerical optimization and
symbolic reasoning techniques. The project integrates the new techniques into
machine learning and software analysis tools and evaluates their
effectiveness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
