This Integrative Graduate Education and Traineeship (IGERT) project at Rutgers
University and partner Princeton University will establish an interdisciplinary
graduate education, research, and training program focused upon scientific,
technical, and policy issues related to sustainable and affordable clean energy
technologies, emphasizing innovations in nanotechnology. This IGERT project will
develop and implement a new interdisciplinary curriculum, Nanotechnology for
Clean Energy, featuring novel courses in fundamental (nanoscale) materials
science, physics, chemistry, and electrical engineering with specific
applications to energy technology development. Graduate trainees will apply this
innovative training in a dynamic educational exchange program with select
African institutions, promoting development of their global awareness and
understanding of challenges involved in scientific and economic development in
the developing world. The three objectives of the African international
component of this project are: (i) provide IGERT trainees with realistic
perspectives of the challenges of energy generation and storage for communities
located far from the grid; (ii) foster face-to-face and cyber-enabled exchanges;
and (iii), encourage U.S. students, particularly those from underrepresented
populations, to enter science and engineering fields to work on critical, real-
world problems of relevance to developing countries. Talented undergraduates
from underrepresented groups will be aggressively recruited from minority-
serving institutions, including students participating in the Research in
Science and Engineering Program and the Bridge to the Doctorate Program at
Rutgers, designed to prepare students for the rigors of an interdisciplinary
Ph.D. program. This IGERT project will help promote development of a diverse,
globally aware, and scientifically capable workforce trained in nanotechnology
and international development issues, and will also involve students in close
interactions with national laboratories and industry partners to translate
scientific results into usable and commercially-viable technologies to address
real-world energy needs. IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the
challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the
interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the
technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of
the future. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate
education by establishing innovative new models for graduate education and
training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends
traditional disciplinary boundaries.
