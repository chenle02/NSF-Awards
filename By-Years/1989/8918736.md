Professor Jerome K. Percus is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to perform theoretical studies on model fluids
which are subject to strong external forces such as those which occur in phase
separations. This research is important for gaining a more complete theoretical
understanding of fluid properties and the natural phenomenon of phase
separation. Classical equilibrium fluids will be treated by free energy density
functional extensions of local thermodynamics. Exactly solvable models, bulk
information, exact restrictions, and the effects of non-local modes will be used
as inputs for the model. Lattice gases will also be examined for the information
they provide on feedback loops. Fermion fluid ground states will be handled by
accurate representation of the kinetic energy functional, by extension of
classical linear response techniques, and by momentum expansion based upon
quantum phase space representation.
