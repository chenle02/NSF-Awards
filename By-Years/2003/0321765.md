This SBIR Phase II project aims to develop a prototype of a highly-parallel,
mass-selected purification system for large pharmaceutical drug libraries. High-
throughput purification is driven by the industry recognition that combinatorial
chemistry samples must still be purified even after chemical screening. This
project will examine monolithic parallel preparative liquid chromatography
configurations. The key enabling technology is low-pressure photoionization mass
spectrometry (LPPI MS), which permits accurate molecular detection in mixtures
of compounds without the problems of competition-for-charge and ion suppressions
that plague conventional ionization methods. A practical purification rate of >1
sample/min (12 parallel purifications in <12 min column cycle time)
corresponding to a potential 16-hr daily rate of >960 sample purifications/day
is expected. This work will transition into a Phase II prototype involving
strategic partners to commercialize the technology.

The proposed high throughput purification system for combinatorial libraries has
the potential to dominate an important niche market for molecular analysis and
screening for drug discovery. This rapidly growing market will fuel applications
in many other directions of drug development. The proposed activity will have a
broad and profound impact on society as a whole by providing valuable
information that can lead to improved drug therapy and early detection of
disease. The practical outcome is to improve health care and reduce costs. This
project also has the potential for explosive commercial growth, which will
stimulate economic development.
