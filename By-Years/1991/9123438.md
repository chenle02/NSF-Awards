An International Symposium on Atomic Layer Epitaxy(ALE), a relatively new
subfield of epitaxy, is being held to assess the ALE field, and to establish
ties between universities, research institutions, and industry. It is expected
that top scientists in the field will attend, and that the symposium will
provide an effective forum to discuss and delineate the critical scientific
issues in this research area, and to consider and define the approaches and
techniques needed to address them. Understanding and controlling processes at
the atomic level are becoming increasingly important for electronic and photonic
materials, and ALE represents an advantageous way of achieving layer-by-layer
control through the self limiting aspects of the process to yield accurate layer
thicknesses and uniformity on an atomic scale over wafer-scale dimensions. %%%
An evaluation of the status of ALE, and recommendations by the symposium
participants for the emphasis of future work, and their assessment of the most
important contemporary research issues will be of great value to the
understanding and development of the technique of ALE, and for its subsequent
utilization in the field of microelectronics.
