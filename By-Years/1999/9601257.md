9601257 Smith This grant provides partial support of an international Workshop
on Tau Lepton Physics (TAU96), the fourth in a series on that subject. Previous
conferences were held in France in 1990, US in 1992 and Switzerland in 1994.
About 100 particle physicists attend. Results are presented from recent
experiments at LEP at CERN, SLD at SLAC, BEPC in Beijing, and especially to be
noted, at CESR, the facility at Cornell University supported by NSF. ***
