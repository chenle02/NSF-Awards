This award supports the continuing research program at Black Hills State
University in underground astrophysics research. The focus is mainly on dark
matter and neutrinoless double-beta decay experiments planned for the Sanford
Underground Research Facility (SURF) at Homestake, SD. For the dark matter
experiments, DARKSIDE and MAX, BHSU is designing, building, and optimizing a
continuous wave custom cavity ring-down spectroscopy (cw-CRDS) system for
measuring the level of impurities in argon gas. This is important for the
success of the depleted argon-based dark matter detectors. With this award the
BHSU group expects to improve upon the sensitivity of commercial CRDS systems by
at least an order of magnitude. The BHSU group will setup the facilities needed
to clean the ancient lead bricks to be used for shielding the double-beta decay
experiment, MAJORANA. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: Every summer the
BHSU group involves South Dakota undergraduates in hands-on research. The BHSU
QuarkNet Center, established in 2009, is one of the most active QuarkNet Centers
in the country. Last year five teachers brought about 30 students to participate
in an LHC Masterclass held at Homestake. As the group enters their 4th year,
they expect to add about four new teachers to the Center. In addition, the BHSU
group is working with representatives from Oglala Lakota College, in an effort
to establish the first QuarkNet Center at a Tribal College or University (TCU).
