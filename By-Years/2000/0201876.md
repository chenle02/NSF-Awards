0201876 Bresler Since its inception in the early 70's, magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) has become a premier diagnostic imaging tool. Although its early
applications were largely limited to stationary objects, MRI has also proven
extremely useful, in recent years, for dynamic imaging applications, such as
cardiac, functional or interventional imaging. An important challenge
confronting dynamic MRI (D-MRI) is obtaining both high spatial and high temporal
resolutions. Over the last two decades, many fast imaging methods including
fast-scan techniques, phased array RF coils for parallel acquisition, and
reduced sampling of the data space have been developed. In spite of these
advances in fast MRI, many applications are still critically dependent on
additional speedups, and virtually all applications could benefit from them.
Examples include 3D multiphase cardiac imaging, coronary angiography and plaque
characterization, cardiac imaging without breath-holding, diffusion-tensor
functional brain imaging, and interventional MRI with high tissue contrast and
temporal resolution.

The general goal of the proposed research is to develop, implement and test a
new unified theoretical framework for minimum-redundancy D-MRI data acquisition
and image reconstruction. In this framework, dynamic imaging is treated as a
higher-dimensional image reconstruction problem, with time being an independent
axis. Instead of attempting to freeze all motion by sufficiently fast
acquisition, time variation during acquisition is explicitly accounted for in
the steps of MRI sequence design, data acquisition, and image reconstruction.
The approach will draw on and extend theories and algorithms introduced by the
PIs over the past few years, which offer the potential for significant speedups
of the imaging process. Furthermore, combination of the theory and techniques
developed in this project with fast scan methods and with methods based on
phased-array RF coils will produce combined speedups, greater than any one of
the individual approaches.
