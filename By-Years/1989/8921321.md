This Science in Developing Countries award supports cooperative research in the
kinetics of reaction chemistry to be conducted by Clifford Bunton of the
University of California at Santa Barbara and Sergio Bunel and colleagues of the
University of Chile in Santiago. They will study reactions of terpenoid
phosphates catalyzed by bivalent metal ions, especially ionic surfactants that
interact strongly with these metal cations. Rearrangements and thermal
decompositions of azide ions, used to trap intermediates in hydrolysis of
terpenoid esters and halides, will be examined as will sugar complexes with
transition metals. The preparation work including that with labelled compounds
will be done in Bunel's laboratory at the University of Chile. Various analyses,
such as high field NMR, Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy and GLC mass
spectrometry will be done in Santa Barbara. Kinetic studies will be performed at
both centers. Thus the strengths of the two laboratories contribute to the
science produced by international cooperation.
