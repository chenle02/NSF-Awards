Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: Gravimetric Analyzer to
Gas Sorption Studies&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: CTS-0417861&lt;br/&gt;Principal
Investigator: Eva Marand&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Virginia Polytechnic Institution
and State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this
proposal is to secure funding for the purchase of an IGA Gravimetric Analyzer,
which would enable the PI to accurately measure the magnitude and dynamics of
gas and vapor sorption in nano-composite membranes. Such sorption information
would complement permeation data already obtainable in the laboratory with an
existing constant-volume permeation apparatus. Together, these two separate
experiments would allow the PI to discern the transport mechanism in nano-
composite membranes, thus promoting a fundamental understanding of gas transport
in heterogeneous materials and permitting efficient design of nano-composite
membranes for specific applications. Research projects, which would directly
benefit from the acquisition of the gravimetric analyzer, include the
development and characterization of polymer/zeolite mixed matrix materials,
polymer/nano-layer-aluminophosphate and polymer/carbon nanotube composite
membranes for gas separation applications, as well as polymer/silsesquioxane
nanocomposites, for applications in sensors, membranes and catalysis. These are
multi-investigator projects, involving Virginia Tech faculty as well as faculty
from other institutions, all of whom would have access to this instrument. In
terms of the broader impacts, the availability of a gravimetric analyzer would
promote the various educational and outreach activities, which are associated
with these research projects.&lt;br/&gt;
