Methane gas hydrate is a unique ice-like mineral that occurs in large quantities
on land in northern latitudes and in marine sediments. At room temperature,
these minerals vaporize and release large quantities of methane which is a
strong greenhouse gas. The vast quantities of these minerals which stand to
become unstable and release methane to the atmosphere as Earth's surface and
oceans warm is a serious concern. This award provides partial funding for the
Second Gordon Research Conference on Natural Gas Hydrates in Ventura, California
in March of 2012. This four and a half day conference brings experts from
academia, industry, and the US National Lab system together with other
participants including students and early career researchers. Topics of
discussion will be: the physics and chemistry of gas hydrates, hydrate
production, hydrates in the past and present environment, recent exciting
discoveries, and what we know about hydrates on other planets. A focus of the
conference will be on whether it is possible to produce hydrates in a
sustainable manner. Broader impacts of the work include the importance of the
theme to global warming and geohazards with regard to slope and ground stability
in a warming world. An emphasis of the conference will be the engagement of
students, postdocs, and early career faculty. Fellowships will be made available
to help support the participation of members of groups historically under-
represented in the sciences and engineering.
