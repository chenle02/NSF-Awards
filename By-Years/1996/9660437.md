9460437 Schmidt This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project to be
carried out by Cleveland Medical Devices will develop a wireless auditory
transceiver that would translate and receive speech. It could be used in a
classroom or other environment. Current assistive listening device (ALD)
technology is limited to one-way reception of audio transmitted from a single
source and amplified by a bulky device worn by the hearing impaired person. This
system should improve two-way communication among hearing impaired children and
their teachers and classmates. The unit should enhance communications for
severely hearing impaired students within classrooms, small lab groups and math
work groups, as well as individual instruction. This project has the potential
to benefit hearing impaired students in the classroom. It will also allow family
members to talk to hearing impaired individuals and to each other from anywhere
in the house and assist hearing impaired individuals in hearing the TV, radio,
phone, doorbell etc. Moreover, it can serve many others in environments where
auditory signals need to be enhanced and noise reduced.
