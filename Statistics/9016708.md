The objective of this research is to develop and extend the theory and methods
of adaptive sampling, with particular attention to problems of estimation of
abundance of a natural resource. Such designs are particularly applicable to
clumped or aggregated distributions as are often found in sampling plants,
animals, fossile fuel resources; they may be equally promising for certain
problems in epidemiology. Properties of adaptive sampling designs will be
derived; and comparisons of efficiency will be made with conventional designs
currently in widespread use.
