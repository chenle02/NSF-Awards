&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program and
the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program are co-
supporting a "Young Investigator Workshop in Supramolecular Chemistry" organized
by Dr. Steven C. Zimmerman of the Department of Chemistry at the University of
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and Dr. Eric V. Anslyn of the Department of
Chemistry at the University of Texas, Austin. The workshop will bring together
young investigators from the U.S. and Canada along with a few strategically
chosen established scientists in order to establish a cohort group of scholars
for the purposes of mentoring and information exchange. Further, the workshop
will facilitate the development of collaborative research at the interfaces
between the areas of organic-inorganic, organic-analytical, organic-chemical
biology, and organic-inorganic-materials science.&lt;br/&gt;
