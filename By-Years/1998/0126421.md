Chemistry (12)

The goals of this project are to narrow the gaps between textbook concepts and
real world chemistry, and between student interests and student laboratory
experiences. These goals are being accomplished by structuring laboratories for
all chemistry courses around the common theme of the environment, by stressing
the use of instrumental techniques, and by adding a service learning component.
This project is adapting the Topic Oriented Approach Development concept from
the University of Wisconsin and implementing specific laboratory experiments
from the educational literature. Students are placed in real world situations so
they will find chemistry laboratories interesting, relevant, and applicable to
their world. The chemistry courses serve non-chemistry and non-science majors at
an environmental liberal arts college, and thus the focus on environmentally
related topics is especially relevant to student interests. The use of
instrumental methods in the laboratories adds a dimension of interest, skill,
and analytical thought, improving both teaching and student learning.
