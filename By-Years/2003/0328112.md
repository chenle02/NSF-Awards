This project addresses critical research needs in the rapidly developing area
of catalytic conversion of biorenewables. Organic acids produced via
fermentation constitute an important class of renewable resource-derived
compounds; they are made in large quantities from biomass and can be converted
into a variety of building blocks for pharmaceuticals, foods, polymers,
solvents, and other products. The research will characterize organic acid
adsorption and hydrogenation on heterogeneous metal catalysts in an aqueous
environment. The reaction and adsorption studies to be conducted with organic
acids and combinations of acids with other species will develop a better
understanding of binding strengths and reactivities of organic acids and their
reaction products on different metal catalysts, thus providing a foundation for
ultimately tailoring catalyst properties for hydrogenation of specific organic
acid substrates. Additional aspects of the work will clarify key issues such as
the role of water on the catalyst metal, the effect of poisons such as CO, and
retention and generation of chirality in the product species. Further, because
hydrogenation and dehydrogenation share chemical pathways, this work has
implications for hydrogen generation from biomass as a clean energy source. From
an environmental standpoint, heterogeneous hydrogenation over metal catalysts in
water allows easy catalyst separation and reuse, avoids organic solvents, and
greatly reduces waste generation in comparison to use of homogeneous catalysts
or traditional hydride reagent chemistry. This "green" hydrogenation pathway
thus represents a primary class of enabling technologies needed for the "biomass
refinery" of the future. Finally, this effort supports the larger mission of
educating the next generation of scientists, who will be responsible for
producing our nation's chemicals and fuels from renewable, sustainable
resources.
