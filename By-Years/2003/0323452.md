Application of Engineered DNA Nanostructures in Nanofabrication

The long-term goal of this project is to develop novel methods for
nanofabrication of materials of computational interest by using engineered DNA
nanostructures as templates, and to bridge the size gap between lithography (a
top-down approach) and self-assembly (a bottom-up approach) in nanofabrication.

The specific objectives of this proposal are threefold: (1) constructing of
equilateral DNA triangles in the size range of 5-30 nm, (2) depositing DNA
nanostructures controllably on microstructured substrates, and (3) performing
DNA templated nanofabrication.

The broader impact of this research is that this is highly interdisciplinary
research, and provides participating students excellent learning opportunities.
Special efforts are also being made to recruit women and minority students into
this project.
