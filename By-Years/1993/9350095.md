9350095 St. Louis proposes to initiate a self study that focuses on two major
objectives: the assessment of quality mathematics and science programs and the
development of a comprehensive systemic plan for improving mathematics and
science programs. The self study will guide the organization of specific actions
which key stakeholders may take to develop a shared vision of mathematics and
science education. A steering committee of stakeholders, along with school
partners, will share the responsibility for implementing the stages of the self
study. Data gathered will be prioritized and developed into long range and short
term goals for systemic change. ***
