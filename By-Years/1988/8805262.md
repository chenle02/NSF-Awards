This project is concerned with field arithmetic and the algebraic theory of
quadratic forms. The principal investigator has a long-term interest in the
structure and classification of positive semi-definite polynomials and will
continue working in this area. In relation to this work, the principal
investigator will study the Hurwitz Problem on the composition of sums of
squares by using the techniques of induced representations. The postdoctoral
associate on this award will work on the theory of W-groups and will investigate
the application of this theory to problems in quadratic forms and field
invariants. The research supported involves the theory of quadratic forms which,
in its simplest form, is a study of polynomial forms of degree two or
equivalently, an analysis of the types of inner products that can define the
metric geometry of an n-dimensional vector space. This is an important and
difficult branch of mathematics which has attracted the attention of a number of
notable mathematicians.
