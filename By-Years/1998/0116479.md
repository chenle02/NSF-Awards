With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at Sacred Heart University will acquire a two-channel,
pulsed-field gradient 400 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) Spectrometer.
This equipment will enable researchers to carry out a numbers of studies
including a) the conformation, orientation and location of biologically active
lipoidal/amphiphilic compounds in liposomal membranes; b) protein-RNA
interactions; c) structure elucidation of natural products; d) synthesis of
self-assembling multi-metallic systems; e) synthesis of potential anti-hypoxia
agents; and f) microwave applications in organic synthesis.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is
used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential
to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR
studies will have an impact in a number of areas including biochemistry.
