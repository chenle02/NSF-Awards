Kingsborough Community College (KCC) and Brooklyn College (BC), two branches of
The City University of New York, are implementing a new collaborative program to
create a highly qualified workforce for the area's growing biotechnology
industry. The project is a coordinated effort developed in conjunction with
local industry standards, and includes the following strategies: (1) Offer an
articulated degree program between KCC and BC enabling students of diverse
backgrounds to either enter the biotechnology industry through the completion of
an A.S. degree in Biotechnology at KCC, or through a stream-lined program to
complete either a B.S. or B.A in Biology at BC after completing their A.S.
degree; (2) Develop a pipeline from high school to industry through a
comprehensive recruitment and education effort to assure that the biotechnology
program attracts a broad range of students across all demographics, and (3)
Train educators working at different educational levels in current methods and
approaches used in this rapidly transforming industry and prepare them to
transfer this knowledge to their students.

The two-year A.S. in Biotechnology is modeled upon successful biotechnology
programs offered locally and across the nation. The curriculum is front-loaded
to offer all courses specific to biotechnology at the community college with
advanced study at the senior college. This provides broad opportunities for
students to choose between multiple career paths. The participation of an
industry advisory board contributes to the enhancement of the curriculum and
identifies the current and future needs of the biotechnology industry. The
project is being disseminated to reach national and local audiences through Bio-
Link, NSF annual meetings, NABT meetings, scholarly publications, newsletters,
brochures, a frequently updated program web site as well as a capstone
conference.
