This project will provide the principal investigator with the opportunity to
conduct advanced research not possible at her home institution and to interact
with students and colleagues through teaching, counseling, and mentoring
activities in a way that demonstrates her career in science. This project
furthers VPW program objectives which are: (1) to provide opportunities for
women to advance their careers in engineering and in the disciplines of science
supported by NSF and (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and
engineering by providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers
employed in industry, government, and academic institutions.
