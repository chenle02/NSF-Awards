This group Research Opportunity Award grant, supported by the Analytical and
Surface Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division, seeks to encourage research
in undergraduate institutions by attracting faculty to a combination research
and classroom summer program. Having learned broadly of new analytical science
and technology from the classroom work, and having done forefront research in
the various research groups at North Carolina, the undergraduate faculty will
return to their home institutions, to foster undergraduate research there. %%%
This program is one of three group Research Opportunity Award grants supported
by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division. It is
unique in its combination of classroom lectures with research participation.
Combined classroom and research work seeks to broaden the general understanding
of teachers from small 4-year institutions, as well as to catalyze their
increased involvement in research.
