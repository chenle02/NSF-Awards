This project is developing a new Junior-year entry point for highly qualified
candidates into the Hunter Teacher Academy by funding scholarships for 40 new
biology, chemistry, earth science, mathematics and physics pre-service teacher
candidates for service in grades 7-12. It takes advantage of an existing
program, the Teacher Academy, an honors program that is currently attracting
highly qualified high school students to careers in math or science teaching.
The program is creating: a new pipeline of high caliber students into
undergraduate teacher education programs; the infrastructure to facilitate
innovation and collaboration (among Department of Education teachers, Arts and
Sciences faculty, and School of Education faculty); and an infrastructure to
support, evaluate, and refine the program. The project adds ten graduates per
year to the 18 STEM teacher candidates the academy presently
graduates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Preliminary results from the
existing Academy suggest that an honors college can attract and graduate as STEM
teachers outstanding applicants from the high schools. This project greatly
broadens that outreach; by extending the concept to junior-year applicants it
provides an entry point for community college students and for transfers from
other colleges thus greatly expanding the pool of students eligible for the
program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The Noyce Teacher Academy
Program serves as a "proof of concept" to CUNY and to the Teacher Academy
partnership by demonstrating how to integrate advanced students into a pre-
service community originally designed only for freshmen entry. It is an
experiment in partnership and vision between CUNY and the New York City
Department of Education. The designers of the project are rethinking every
aspect of teacher education including courses in discipline-based Arts and
Science departments, fieldwork and the entire process used to recruit students
to teaching.
