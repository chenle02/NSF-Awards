Free Space Optics (FSO) provide a cost-effective, license-free, high-bandwidth
and long-range solution to meet the escalating demand for wireless network
capacity and scalability. This project aims to develop technologies for robust
FSO networks from the network and cross-layer optimization perspective. Various
network dynamics will be addressed with the following approaches. (i) For
dynamics at large timescales, network planning and topology optimization will be
investigated based on the concept of algebraic connectivity. (ii) For mid-
timescale dynamics, effective load balancing and adaptive multipath routing will
be developed. (iii) For small timescale dynamics, channel estimation will be
investigated to enable rate adaptation and optimal receiver design. Wavelength
diversity will also be exploited for the diversity-multiplexing
tradeoff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this project will enable scalable
wireless access networks with multi-gigabit rates, to accommodate the predicted
increase in wireless data. Project outcomes will be disseminated and
incorporated into the Auburn University Wireless Engineering curriculum. The PIs
will strive to involve REU students, and to participate in Auburn?s TIGERs Camp
for outreach to K-12 students. The PIs have collaborations with an HBCU on
research, curriculum, and recruiting minority graduate
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a timely project given the imminent
explosive increase in wireless data. This project is of high risk, due to the
lack of measurement data in the public domain and the novel approach taken in
this research. This project is also of high payoff. If successful, it can bring
about the much needed technologies for high rate, long distance, and scalable
wireless access networks.
