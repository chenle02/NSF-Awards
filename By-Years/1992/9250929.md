This project uses CCD imaging and spectroscopy capabilities at the astronomical
observatory of Central Michigan University. Students observe images with the CCD
directly or use the spectrograph to observe emission lines in nebulae. This will
significantly improve instruction in the methods of observational astronomy for
advanced astronomy students. It will also increase opportunities for individual
student research projects, especially senior projects by physics majors.
