This is a grant under the Scientific Computing Research Equipment for the
Mathematical Sciences program of the Division of Mathematical Sciences of the
National Sciences Foundation. This program supports the purchase of special
purpose computing equipment dedicated to the conduct of research in the
mathematical sciences. This equipment is required for several research projects
and would be difficult to justify for one project alone. Support from the
National Science Foundation is coupled with discounts and contributions from
manufacturers and with substantial cost-sharing from the institutions submitting
the proposal. This program is an example of academic, corporate, and government
cooperation in the support of the basic research in the mathematical sciences.
This equipment will be used to support three research projects in the Center for
Applied Mathematics of Cornell University: dynamical systems theory, the
investigators are Guckenheimer and Philip Holmes; statistics of image
processing, the investigator is Richard Liu; three dimensional geometry, the
investigator is Robert Connelly.
