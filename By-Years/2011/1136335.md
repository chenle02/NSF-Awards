The San Francisco State University (SFSU) Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship
program will increase the quality, quantity and diversity of well-prepared
science and mathematics teachers in California public schools serving the
State's neediest students. The project will support 28 unique scholarship
recipients with 10, 3, 5, 5, and 5 new recipients in project years 1 through 5
respectively. The project builds on SFSU's successful track record of supporting
future teachers entering middle school and high school and sustaining a vibrant
pre-service teacher community. It leverages multiple resources to create an
intensive experience based on recommendations from the research literature on
the importance of professional community and the development of educational
leadership. Noyce Fellows meet in regularly scheduled leadership seminars and
play key roles in important national initiatives such as the Algebra Project and
the Strategic Education Research Project. SFSU is recognized as one of the
nation's most ethnically, culturally, and economically diverse institutions, and
graduates the majority of teachers in the San Francisco Unified School District.
Pre-service STEM teachers trained through the Noyce Program have a positive
impact on many high-needs schools in the immediate area. The commitment of the
California State University Chancellor's Office to spread the SFSU teacher
development model means that insights and innovations from the Noyce Program
will also be rapidly deployed.
