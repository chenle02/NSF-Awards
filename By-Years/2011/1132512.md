NSF funding will be used to support the participation of US scientists to a
workshop on spintronic materials, "Workshop on Spin Transport in Solids", that
will be held in Beijing, China. The main objective of the workshop is to provide
an interactive forum for leading researchers to present and discuss their most
recent findings, to afford a platform for graduate and post-doctoral students,
primarily from China, to describe their progress in verbal and poster format,
and to allow scientists, both young and mature, to have informal and in depth
discussion with one another. The scientific scope ranges from novel materials,
including concentrated and diluted magnetic semiconductors, to semiconductor
device structures, to techniques to probe spin dynamics and to the description,
both experimental and theoretical, of spin motion in non-magnetic materials. The
broader impacts of the workshop range from providing an international experience
to junior researchers to stimulate networking of US scientists with Chinese
investigators.
