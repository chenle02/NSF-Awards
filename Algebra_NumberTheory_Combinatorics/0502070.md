The principal investigator and his collaborators will address several groups of
problems in areas of algebraic geometry, combinatorics, and computational
algebraic geometry, with emphasis on syzygies and their relevance in geometry
and combinatorics. Algebraic geometry at large deals with geometric objects
described by systems of polynomial equations. The area is central to mathematics
since such geometric objects include certain fundamental examples in the most
diverse disciplines of mathematics.Its importance in the applications of
mathematics comes from the fact that such algebro-geometric objects provide
models often used when representing fundamental geometric forms via equations
and also on a computer. The investigator will study the geometry and algebra of
polynomial ideals in close relation to their complexity, will investigate
several combinatorial aspects related to his proposed complexity bounds, and
will extend the use of exterior algebra methods to projective geometry. The
principal investigator's activity will also include the development of various
fundamental algorithms in computational algebraic geometry and their
implementation in the Macaulay2 package written by Grayson and Stillman.
