A flashlamp pumped tunable dye laser and a laser wavelength meter will be used
to conduct Raman, Rayleigh and Fluorescence scattering experiments in a wide
range of combustion research projects which are currently underway, or that are
under construction. These include: departure from chemical equilibrium in
subsonic and supersonic turbulent reacting flows; boundary layer stationary and
propagating turbulent flames; and reciprocating engine combustion. These
research projects are aimed at providing understanding of combustion processes
related to fossil fuel energy conversion, air pollution, propulsion, and fire
safety. All these projects share the need of an optical diagnostics system
capable of providing information about the density, temperature and major
species concentrations in the reaction zone, as well as flow velocity. It is
anticipated that the tunable dye laser and the laser wavelength meter will
provide valuable data for the analysis of these combustion problems.
