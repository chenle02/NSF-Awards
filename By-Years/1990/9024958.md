This award supports the establishment of a working group for the science
planning of the prospective initiative: Pole- to-Pole Paleoclimate Transect for
the Western Hemisphere Ä±"Pole-Equator-Pole", the PEP Working Group!. This effort
will link regional paleoclimatic records in a north-south latitudinal transect
to explore interhemispheric paleoclimatic connections and increase our
understanding of the latitudinal structures of climate change. The proposed
working group would formalize a detailed science plan for this initiative,
identify gaps in the scientific effort, assess the results of prior field,
laboratory and modeling studies, and insure integration of interdisciplinary and
international efforts.
