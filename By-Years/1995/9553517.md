9553517 Berken St. Norbert College will initiate a three-week Young Scholars
project for thirty Native-American students entering eighth grade. The focus of
the summer residential program will be a thematic one, Mother Earth, integrating
mathematics and science. The students will take part in activities that call for
them to conduct experiments, make measurements, analyze data and work with
computers. Working with college faculty, local school educators, and Native-
American mathematicians and scientists as role models, these young men and women
will have the opportunity to build a solid foundation for a lifelong interest in
mathematics and science.
