Matching funds are provided in this award for Dr. Bruce Hammer to extend the
use of NMR imaging techniques to the measurement of perfusive flow through and
intersticial flow about the beads in a packed HPLC column. Application of
transverse magnetic field gradients followed by gradient reversal will allow
flowing molecules to be labeled and their displacement with time followed.
Information about the flow field will be shared with corporate scientists at 3M
to improve HPLC packing materials and their use in bioseparations. Separation
and purification of pharmaceutical drugs constitutes a large portion of the
costs in their manufacture. Improvements in powerful purification techniques
like HPLC should lower costs and improve the quality of medications.
