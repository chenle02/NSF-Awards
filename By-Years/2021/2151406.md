The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a scalable, on-demand, research-
based innovation for learners in virtual and recorded training programs.
Research has shown that underrepresented populations arrive at an undergraduate
institution less likely to have the advanced study skills or confident awareness
to seek assistance when faced with uncertainty in the classroom. This project
provides on-demand responses to in-lesson queries and helps develop deep study
skills. Additionally, for the students who arrive at college without sufficient
familial or academic support, the proposed product becomes a resource to
participate successfully in an undergraduate environment.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project will build an engine that automatically identifies the discipline of a
course based on the extracted words and phrases spoken or visually presented in
class, and then will identify terms important to the learning objectives of the
course, garnered via categorical arrays of discipline specific keywords.
Automatic creation of personalized study guides is initiated based on the
learners' individual queries or class discussions. This innovation is applicable
to the remote learning industries, where it may increase the value of their
customersâ€™ online content and enable teaching professionals to strive for higher
levels of equity in the student population.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
