This Minority Research Initiation Planning Grant will enable Dr. William
Quintana to establish a program studying the molecular precursors to the ceramic
materials BN and B4C. The object of the work is to discover new synthetic routes
for the efficient production of preceramic materials. Monosubstituted
alkynylborazines will be prepared and studied. The compounds will be polymerized
and charactierized by NMR spectroscopy. Subsequently they will be decomposed
into BN. %%% Support from this program will enable Dr. William Quintana to
establish a research program investigating certain polymer containing boron
compounds which can be decomposed into the ceramic material boron nitride. This
compound has considerable commerical importance because of its physical
properties. New, more efficient routes to its preparation are important to the
chemical industry.
