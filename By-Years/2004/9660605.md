*** ABSTRACT 9660605 Sofge This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
project will develop and test a new approach to active interior noise control in
a three-dimensional enclosure. The new thrust in the proposed research is a
digital adaptive system that makes use of both analyses and directly measured
data from a three-dimensional enclosure to card out active noise control by
using smart materials located on flexible boundaries of the enclosure. The
system is intended to track the changes in the acoustic information due to
movement, changes in open apertures, etc. and carry out on-line minimization to
realize the desired acoustic performance. Unlike most methods that assume that
the acoustic field inside the enclosure can be modeled by using standing waves,
the proposed method is designed to accommodate diffuse sound fields in the
enclosure. Furthermore, the noise is not assumed to be harmonic and nonperiodic
sound fields are to be considered. The neural network based filter proposed
herein can make use of analytical and experimental data to assign initial
weights that are to be adapted to carry out (locally) on-line minimization of
sound pressure in the enclosure. Noise reduction in aircraft is a subject of
serious commercial concern in the industry. The techniques developed in this
effort will be widely applicable to noise reduction in rotorcraft cabins of
commercial helicopters, and may be adapted for use in commercial airline
cockpits, as well as in factory settings and other vibration critical
manufacturing environments. ***
