The goal of this project is to determine the feasibility of several technologies
and associated design techniques in the development of an end-to-end optical
data path for use in interconnecting processors and a massively-parallel
processing system. Some of the optical components proposed for use in the data
path, such as polymer waveguides, optical switches, and fiber/waveguide
couplings, have been shown to operate individually. This project will construct
and characterize several end-to-end systems using these components. The work
will proceed in phases, in which a data path is first built up from discrete
purchased components, then individual components are replaced with an integrated
substrate that uses polymer waveguides to interconnect sources, switches, and
detectors.
