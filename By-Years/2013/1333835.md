The research objective of this award is to establish the inter-relationship
between dielectric breakdown and electric-field induced deformation of
elastomeric materials. Integral to the research objective will be quantifying
the role of defects as well as electric-field induced mechanical localization
produced by conducting fibers and electrode geometry. The approach will be
largely experimental with direct measurements of the deformation fields produced
by pre-straining and applied voltages for different fiber electrode arrangements
and for a variety of device geometries. The observations will be compared with
and complemented by modeling studies based on theories of nonlinear electro-
mechanical coupling of deformable dielectrics. Together, these will be used to
design and construct proof-of-concept electrically controlled devices capable of
extreme strains.

If successful, the benefits of this research will include simplified designs for
utilizing dielectric elastomers in engineering applications including energy
harvesting devices, linear actuators and displays. The project will also
contribute to Harvard's existing outreach programs involving undergraduate
research and local high-school outreach, other community outreach programs.
