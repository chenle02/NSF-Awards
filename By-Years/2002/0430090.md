Architecture, Algorithms, and Circuits for an Energy-Efficient Single-Chip Tera-
Op/sec Digital Signal Processor Abstract

Digital Signal Processing (DSP) workloads are typically numerically intensive,
parallelizable, and increasingly required in a number of applications. The
project will develop the architecture, algorithms, circuit, chip layout, and
software for a single-chip processing system that is capable of calculating DSP
workloads with high performance and high energy efficiency. Processing chips
contain a very large number of small asynchronously clocked programmable
processors connected by a reconfigurable 2-dimensional grid network. The
research will result in the design, fabrication, test, and characterization of a
prototype processing chip, including the development of software for a small
number of complex multi-algorithm applications. The project will evaluate the
merits of the proposed architecture for these types of DSP workloads.

The research may lead to new capabilities that were previously constrained by
maximum levels of power dissipation or throughput, in numerous applications such
as life-extending medical devices, high volume consumer products, and very high
throughput radar and image processors.
