This research will investigate protein dynamics in detail in order to understand
how these macromolecules, especially enzymes, precisely work. Nuclear Magnetic
Resonance Spectroscopy has proven over the years to be a viable method to
determine protein dynamics. But, it has mostly been limited to the determination
of the motions of the NH vector in proteins. In this project, the dynamical
processes of many different vectors in proteins using residual dipolar couplings
experiments, conformational exchange broadening experiments and cross-correlated
relaxation measurements will be investigated. To interpret these data,
theoretical computations of the chemical shift tensors will also be carried out.
All these data will be combined to formulate comprehensive dynamical models of
anisotropic local motion that are important for the complete description of the
protein's molecular and energetic properties.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Proteins are
not nearly as static as is often assumed. The molecules have intrinsically
mobile areas which are necessary to perform diverse functions in a living cell.
Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy is a technique that can retrieve the
dynamical properties of virtually each atom, individually, in a biological
macromolecule, such as protein. The detailed insights will likely help in the
fundamental understanding of the molecules of life.&lt;br/&gt;
