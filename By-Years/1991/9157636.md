This work will expand on the understanding and exploitation of tractable models
of reasoning. To explain how people perform so well on tasks that are
theoretically intractable, we must assume that approximation methods, based on
tractable models, cover a significant part of intelligent activities and, hence,
should serve as the cornerstone of automated reasoning systems. This principle
provides the motivation for this research. This work will: (1) Establish a
formal relational basis for connectionist models and neural networks and, using
the language of constraint networks, quantify the powers and limitations of
these models in terms of expressiveness and computational efficiency. (2)
Establish a formal basis of causal theories using the language of relational
algebra and (directed) constraint networks. (3) Identify tractable classes of
logic programs, default knowledge bases and temporal reasoning sub-languages,
recognizable via the topological features of their specifications. (4) Apply
constraint network techniques to real life problems such as scheduling, planning
and diagnosis.
