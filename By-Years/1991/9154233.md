This project is a two week workshop in which faculty from institutions which
lack significant parallel computing resources learn how to deliver effective
courses and units on parallel processing. The tools used during the workshop
include transputers which can be installed in existing personal computers or
work stations, software simulators, and a network connection to a major research
center. The primary topics are (1) parallel computer architectures, (2) writing
programs for parallel computers, (3) integrating parallel processing into the
computer science curriculum, and (4) teaching parallel processing to
undergraduates. The workshop includes lectures and laboratory sessions in which
participants write programs for parallel computers and parallel computer
simulators. Participants also plan a course or unit on parallel processing to be
implemented at their institutions during the subsequent academic year.
