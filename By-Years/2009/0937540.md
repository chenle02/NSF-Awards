This award gives travel, housing, and registration-cost support to selected
doctoral students from U.S. universities for their participation in the Doctoral
Consortium of the 19th International Conference on Automated Planning and
Scheduling (ICAPS-09) held September 19-23 in Thessaloniki, Greece. ICAPS is the
premier conference for research in artificial intelligence planning and
scheduling, with relevance to a wide variety of applications such as software
engineering, manufacturing, transportation, and robotics. The ICAPS-09 Doctoral
Consortium includes a poster session, where students present their research, and
a mentoring program that pairs senior scientists with doctoral students.
