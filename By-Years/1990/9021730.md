This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP) award from the
Research Facilities Office provides funds to the University of Tennessee at
Knoxville for the repair and renovation of Middle Dabney Hall which houses a
major proportion of the research and research training activities of that
institution's Chemistry Department. This building was constructed in 1954 and
has not been renovated since that time. The ARFMP grant of $1,700,000 and
$4,910,000 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used to modernize
these research and research training facilities. This project will address the
need to improve the current research infrastructure both in terms of increasing
its safety and of increasing the quantity and quality of research that can be
conducted by upgrading the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC)
system and by installing fume hoods, solvent cabinets, and casework. This award
contributes to the infrastructure of science by providing an improved
environment for the conduct of research and for the training of undergraduates
from other institutions through the Science Alliance and National Science
Foundation summer research programs as well as for the training of the
University of Tennessee's own undergraduate and graduate students.
