This work involves the investigation of the adhesive characteristic of two
principal fouling organisms, namely, Enteromorpha intestinalis and Ectocarpus
spp. that adhere to underwater ocean vessels and structures, the resulting
formation on the surfaces and the consequent changes in hydrodynamic forces. The
study therefore will take shape in three phases. The first is to establish the
time varying adhesion of the organisms as a function of surface and
environmental conditions, including factors that influence adhesion. Secondly,
to develop a model of the fouled surface as a function of time, surface and
environmental conditions. And finally, the work includes the use of the modeled
surface to analytically formulate a method to better predict changes in
hydrodynamic forces caused by fouling.
