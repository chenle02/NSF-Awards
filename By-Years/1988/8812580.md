This is is a proposal on phosphoinositide research that is currently an area of
great interest in relation to second messenger models both in animal and plant
cells. The Principal Investigator has already demonstrated the importance of
phospholipase and phosphoinositide in membrane fusion. The current project will
focus on membrane lysophatidylinositol 4- triphosphate (LPIP), its synthetic
pathways and catabolism, its functional significance and regulatory mechanism.
Biochemical, immunochemical and molecular techniques will be used to achieve the
objectives. Since the project will help identify parameters that promote
membrane fusion, it could have important ramifications in biotechnology.
