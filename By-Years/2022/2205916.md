The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-
UP), through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation
and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the
preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue
science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or
careers. Spelman College seeks to understand how assessment practices in post-
secondary mathematics courses can impact Black female students' academic
achievement on assessments, retention in subsequent courses, and mathematical
identity and agency. This project investigates the standard-based grading
approach to assessment, and is designed to provide data helpful in understanding
Black female student achievement, experience, and retention in precalculus
courses, as well as retention in STEM majors, and ultimately individual identity
and agency within mathematics. Results from this project will add important
insights to the wider body of knowledge about standard based grading in higher
education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduate level mathematics courses
traditionally employ a points-based grading (PBG) system in which final grades
are a percentage of total points earned. Standards-based grading (SBG) is an
approach to assessment in which students are provided clear learning objectives
and grades are directly based on students' ability to demonstrate full
proficiency of these objectives. By comparing data from two sections of a SBG
precalculus course and two sections of a PBG precalculus course, the proposed
project seeks to understand Black female student achievement, experience, and
retention in the SBG precalculus sequence courses, retention in STEM majors, and
ultimately identity and agency within mathematics. The specific aims are to: 1)
redesign Spelman Collegeâ€™s current point-based grading Precalculus I course into
a standards-based grading course, 2) implement the redesigned standards-based
grading Precalculus course, and 3) document student and instructor experiences
in the standards-based grading Precalculus course, perform student follow-up
focus groups and interviews, and collect retention data for STEM majors. Results
from this project will add important insights to the wider body of knowledge
about SBG in higher education and provide resources for other Mathematics
faculty and departments who may be interested in how SBG might enhance their
pedagogical and/or curricular initiatives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
