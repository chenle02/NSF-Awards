California State University, Dominguez Hills and the Urban Education Partnership
are collaborating on a planning proposal to create an NSF Master Teaching
Fellowship project that will develop math and science master teachers for urban
schools in the Los Angeles and Lynwood Unified School Districts. Both are high-
need districts that enroll primarily low-income students of color. Objectives
for the planning process include: 1) establishing partnerships among CSUDH, the
Partnership and school districts; 2) reaching an agreement with the school
districts about possible roles for master teachers; 3) developing written
criteria for participation in the project, a selection process and marketing
plan; 4) developing a written model and timeline for five years of professional
development for master teachers; 5) developing methods of evaluation for the
project; 6) Identifying sources of nonfederal match; and 7) developing a budget
that includes costs, number of fellows, and financial feasibility. A diverse
planning team of university faculty, science and math specialists, teachers, LEA
representatives, and others is conducting key activities including: assessing
the districts' need for master teachers and the roles they can fill; assessing
the needs and interest of teachers who may participate; creating a skills
profile of a master teacher and a list of appropriate sources for training by
researching best practices and successful strategies in the partner
organizations and others; developing connections with STEM faculty, private and
public sector professionals who could provide participants with customized
enrichment activities; producing a five-year training timeline for master
teachers; developing and signing MOUs that clarify the partners' and districts'
roles and responsibilities; and identifying matching funds. The team is drawing
on successful strategies, research, and consultation with appropriate experts to
develop guidelines for recruitment, participation, selection and evaluation of a
master teacher project.
