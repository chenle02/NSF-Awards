This proposal requests support to analyze observations obtained during the
Convection and Precipitation/Electrification Experiment (CaPE) conducted in
central Florida during the summer of 1992. Simultaneous traverses through
convective clouds by two similarly equipped King Airs are the focus of the
proposed work. Emphasis will be on the evolution of the kinematic fields within
those cumuli that were sampled with more than a dozen passes during their life
cycle. The two-aircraft pattern will provide observations of the basic
characteristics of the near-environment, visible cloud, updraft and downdraft,
and the horizontal flow in and at the edges of these features. Vertical mass
flux and momentum transport as a function of life cycle will be estimated for
several of the better observed cases. The analyses have the potential to be the
bench-mark for the kinematic structure of moist convection in an environment
characterized by low shear and high convective available potential energy.
