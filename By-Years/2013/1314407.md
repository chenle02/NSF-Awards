The National Collegiate Inventors & Innovators Alliance (NCIIA) proposes to
scale the I-Corps program by supporting the program at campuses in
geographically-diverse locations across the U.S. NCIIA will work with members of
the I-Corps teaching team to implement a I-Corps curriculum workshop. Feedback
from the evaluation process will inform improvements in both the instructor-
training program and the I-Corps curriculum. NCIIA Course and Program grants
support the development and implementation of experiential education programs
that teach engineering and science students to apply innovative and
entrepreneurial thinking to their coursework.

The goal of the I-Corps program is to determine the commercial feasibility of
technology derived from NSF-funded research. Participants will leave the program
with an expanded skill-set that will give them the tools necessary to evaluate
and translate their research into applications that can benefit society. This
program will support a network of instructors who can improve and adapt the
program model as it is disseminated to new institutions and regions.
