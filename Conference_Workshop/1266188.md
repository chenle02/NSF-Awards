This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of graduate students and
postdocs attending the Advances in Nonlinear Science that will be held on March
14-16, 2013, on the campus of the University of Pittsburgh.

The workshop aims to bring together leading experts and researchers in nonlinear
partial differential equations (both on the applied and theoretical sides), with
an emphasis of the Theme Semester on the modern game theory with applications.
The proposed conference builds on the relevance and applications of stochastic
methods applied to non-linear partial differential equations that stem for
recent developments in game theory. The keynote speakers have been confirmed and
represent top figures in mathematics. These are: E. DiBenedetto of Vanderbilt
University, R.V. Kohn of New York University, L. Mahadevan of Havard University
and G. Strang of MIT. Between 30-40 participants are expected to participate in
the workshop, the majority of whom will be from outside of the University of
Pittsburgh. Special attention will be paid to the recruitment of women and
minorities participants.
