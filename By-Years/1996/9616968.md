Brainerd, Tereasa AST 96-16968 Dr. Brainerd will investigate the formation of
rich clusters of galaxies using high resolution numerical simulations. A nested
grid code will be used to follow the evolution of rich clusters. The infall
history of the richest clusters in popular hierarchical models will be
determined and the physical properties of the clusters will be compared to
available observational results to assess the viability of the models to
reproduce observed clusters. The numerical clusters will constitute a database
of high resolution test clusters for investigating effects such as gravitational
lenses for a population of distant source galaxies.
