Kohlstedt 9526925 An experimental investigation of three central issues in upper
mantle rheology is proposed: (I) the dependence of viscosity on water
concentration, (ii) the dependence of creep behavior on mineralogy and (iii) the
dependence of creep rate on pressure. The proposed experiments are designed to
gain a basic physical understanding of the roles of water, mineralogy and
pressure on the flow behavior of mantle rocks. An important goal of this
research is to determine quantitative constitutive equations for plastic flow
that permit reliable extrapolation of laboratory results to upper mantle
environments.
