Much economic research in the last decade has focused on the phenomenon of
knowledge spillovers, by which it is meant that the externality that is created
when one researcher's efforts facilitate or enhance the success of someone
else's efforts. Knowledge spillovers are created in the public sector, when
universities and government labs produce basic research results that provide the
foundation for applied research in the private sector; they are also created in
the private sector when researchers take advantage of knowledge produce by other
private agents. These spillovers are key to understanding the process of
technological progress, how it contributes to economic growth, and how policy
levers can be used effectively to foster growth through innovation. The purpose
of this research is to analyze the flows of knowledge spillovers across time,
technological sectors, and geographic areas. Relevant data is already being
assembled that will permit the testing of models of regional and sectorial
growth incorporating knowledge spillovers. This research is important because it
will increase our understanding of role of science and technology in fostering
economic growth. The results of this project will also be of interest to other
scholars and to science policy makers.
