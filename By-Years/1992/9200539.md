In degree theory, one tries to determine whether natural classes of oracles
with differing information content have different algebraic properties. Thus
questions about decidability of fragments of elementary theories of degree
structures are pursued, in order to determine which degrees are definable, and
how complicated the definitions must be. Rigidity questions, or questions about
automorphisms of the structures are pursued, with the aim that if a structure is
rigid, then sets with different information content do, in fact, look different
algebraically. Such questions are within the scope of this project. The major
tool of proof in recursion theory is the priority argument. A general framework
for priority arguments at all levels is being sought, in the hope that a better
understanding of priority arguments will assist in finding applications of this
powerful combinatorial technique to real world problems. Computing, as it is
practiced today, is of an interactive nature. Rather than the model of twenty
years ago, where the computer was presented with a program and ran until it
obtained an answer, the programs of today pause frequently and ask for input
before continuing. Thus the true model of computing, as it is practiced, is the
Turing machine with an oracle.
