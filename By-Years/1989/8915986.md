This award should complete an isotopic investigation into the origins of the
Cameroon line, a 1600 km. long chain of volcanoes and plutons which is unique in
that it traverses both oceanic and continental lithosphere. Recent published
work has shown that: The basalts have identical chemistry in oceanic and
continental sectors; Phonolites are common in the oceanic but rare in the
continental sector; Rhyolites are common in the continental sector but absent
from the oceanic sector, Amphibole is abundant in the oceanic sector but scarce
in the continental sector; The basaltic lavas display a progression to more
radiogenic Pb with time in both oceanic and continental sectors: There is a
remarkable lead isotopic anomaly at the continent/ocean boundary in that the
volcanics immediately to either side have a uniform highly radiogenic ("St.
Helena type") signature regardless of lead concentration. So far this project
has expanded on the published database and presented the first detailed Nd and
Pb isotopic studies of some of these centers. The striking near symmetrical
change in Pb isotopic composition with distance ffrom the continent/ocean
boundary which has been demonstrated, appears to be due to the remelting of
upper mantle previously affected by the St. Helena plume. A comprehensive suite
of mantle xenoliths from the region has been collected, and these will be the
focus of chemical and isotopic studies this next year.
