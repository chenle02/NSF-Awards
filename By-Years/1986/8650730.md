The acquisition of a vacuum evaporator, an ultra-microtome, and a glass knife
maker under this project will enhance the opportunities for undergraduates to
conduct laboratory research using the University's transmission electron
microscope. Students from the Departments of Biology, Biochemistry, Chemistry,
Geology, and the fiber-optics and pre- engineering options will have the
opportunity to participate in projects using the electron microscope. Further,
the electron microscope projects will link together all levels of
interdisciplinary research activities at the University. It is expected that
this approach will enhance the research skills of the undergraduates; increase
activity and cohesion among all student levels across departments and
disciplines; and increase undergraduate participation at scientific meetings and
in the preparation of manuscripts submitted for publication. The project will
also combine existing senior research courses, as well as a planned new course
in Electron Microscopy, into a continuous learning process spanning the
undergraduate years.
