Information about DMS-0107796 for FastLane website. Principal investigator:
Mikhail Shubin. Abstract. It is planned to obtain necessary and sufficient
conditions, as well as explicit necessary and explicit sufficient conditions,
for the discreteness of spectrum of magnetic Schroedinger operators on Euclidean
space and on Riemannian manifods with geometric restrictions. Presumably the
conditions will be given in terms of separation of fields and effective
potentials. They will use Wiener capacity and its generalization - magnetic
capacity. Physically we are looking for conditions when electrons display a
discrete spectrum and are confined into bounded domains for any fixed value of
their energy, when such a behavior of electrons results from a joint action of
electric and magnetic fields.
