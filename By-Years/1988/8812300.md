A numerical model of the ocean is being developed. It will include a spectral
element description in the horizontal, and a layered coordinate in the vertical.
These refinements will provide an alternative to current ocean models which will
increase computational efficiency, lower memory and storage requirements, and
provide the potential for variable grid and parallel architecture developments.
The model will be exercised on several critical physical processes in the ocean
including the deep circulation, interactions with topography, and mechanisms
controlling potential vorticity in ocean gyres. Model output will be contrasted
with that from the ocean community modeling effort. The work is a contribution
to the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE).
