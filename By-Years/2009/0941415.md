Seeing the Forest and the Trees (0941415)

The project is implementing a novel method of combining mobile communication
technologies with social networking software and websites into the biology
curricula of several courses at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. The
innovative curriculum takes full advantage of college students' proficiency with
networked communications (e.g., PDAs, cell phones, Facebook, Flickr, and Google
Earth) while familiarizing them with field observations and research skills.
Students are able to share their observations and data through various online
sources by contributing to ongoing research about invasive plant species, plant
diversity, plant phenology and plant-animal interactions. By evaluating the
experiences, ideas, and attitudes of instructors and students using mobile
technologies, this project can inform a wide range of educational institutions
on adapting this unique approach for its own curriculum. For example, faculty at
UMass Boston are evaluating the technology developed in the project in one day
workshops with Boston Public School students and middle school teachers. Data
collected and lessons learned are being disseminated via a public website called
MobileTechnologiesForTeachingFieldCourses. Ultimately this project utilizes the
advances in geospatial, mobile, and multimedia information technologies
coalesced with their application to environmental science topics to benefit
educational institutions of all levels, Citizen Science programs, and
environmental non-government organizations.
