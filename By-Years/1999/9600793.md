ABSTRACT PI: Koenig Proposal Number: 9600793 Support is requested for young
American scientists who would like to attend the International Society for
Behavioral Ecology (ISBE) meeting to be held in Canberra, Australia, 29
September-4 October 1996, hosted by Andrew Cockburn and the Australian National
University. This biennial conference is open to all those interested in
behavioral ecology. It is held in alternate years from the International
Ethological Conference (IEC) and is the primary international gathering of
scientists focusing on the ecological correlates of behavior in an evolutionary
framework. The meeting brings together workers from a variety of countries and
offers an unparalleled opportunity for young American behavioral ecologists to
meet colleagues in the Australiasian region, share their work with an
international audience, and become introduced to Australia's unique biota and
its associated conservation problems.
