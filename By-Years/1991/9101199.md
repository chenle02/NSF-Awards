This project is a continuation of the prior project on Process Design in Metal
Forming. A goal of research in manufacturing is to accomplish proper design and
control of processes for producing required parts most economically. One of the
most important aspects of process design in metal forming is design of preforms
and process sequence. In the prior project, the application of the new approach
to preform design in complex forming processes has been investigated. The
approach used capability of forward simulation and backward tracing of a forming
process by the finite element method. Significant accomplishments were the
development of the finite element method and implementation of the backward
tracing procedure for three dimensional deformation processes. The results of
these investigations demonstrate that it is possible to design preforms without
resort to designer's experience. In the prior project, the design criterion
considered was a geometrical requirement for the final product. For process
sequence design, additional requirements must be introduced in the design
process. Thus, the objective of the research is to develop the methodology for
systematic process sequence design, considering quantitatively requirements for
material formability, defects-free metal flow and economic die manufacturing, in
addition to the geometrical requirement. Many industrial parts are formed
sequentially by multiple dies, each of which contributes to the final shape
change. The project will provide analytical tools for designing the required
dies, which are now designed by trial and error, based on experience.
