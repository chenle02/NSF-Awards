Arizona State University seeks to understand how open-ended, hands-on Making
work and activities can reflect student learning gains in formal engineering
education, particularly in an undergraduate, product-based course. The aim is to
expand understanding of what Making and learning through Making in the context
of engineering design education might be. The results generated during this
study will describe the learning trajectories of engineers as they learn Making.
These results will illustrate educational pathways within the engineering
education curriculum that could be further studied. By examining the engineering
student Making learning experience this work can impact the quality of
engineering design teaching.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this
project will be the advancement of knowledge of the learning pathways of Making
through capturing empirical evidence in the engineering classroom using multiple
qualitative methods. This exploratory project will address the relationship of a
Making mindset and engineering design practice. The results will have the
potential to highlight routes to Making learning that can illustrate pathways to
engineering as well as a means for faculty and institutions to adopt a Making
mindset approach in engineering design learning that is more
inclusive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is a part of NSF's Maker Dear
Colleague Letter (DCL) portfolio (NSF 15-086), a collaborative investment of
Directorates for Computer &amp; Information Science &amp; Engineering (CISE),
Education and Human Resources (EHR) and Engineering (ENG).
