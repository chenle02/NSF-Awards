Calcium and proton uptake at the alkaline surfaces of characean algae will be
investigated. Two competing models will be tested: the "electronic" model and
the electroneutral one. Various methods will be used to distinguish between
these models. Pericellular ion and electrical fluxes will be estimated from
chemical and electrical gradients. The uptake and translocation of calcium and
carbon will be measured using split chamber and radioisotope experiments.
Cytochemical localization of calcium ATPase will be attempted. The molecular
form of carbon transport toward the site of calcification will be investigated
by examining the fractionation of stable isotopes of carbon and oxygen between
precipitated calcium carbonate and solution. The study has implications with
regard to bicarbonate utilization in aquatic systems, membrane
electrophysiology, calcium transport through cells and across membranes, and the
mechanisms of calcification in plants and animals. Because bicarbonate is
concentrated by some algae and used as a carbon source for photosynthesis, this
project also is likely to add to our understanding of this important life
process.
