This project will explore a transformative model of interdisciplinary research
and evaluation of current and proposed open science policies, practices, and
interventions. This model, the Fellows and Leaders in Open and Equitable
Scholarship (FLOES) model, aims to help academic researchers partner with
operational platforms and ongoing open science initiatives to embed experiments
and measurements into existing science systems and activities. The program will
be transformative by pioneering a new scalable methodology, seeding a new
generation of researchers focused on open scholarship, and building a coalition
among practitioners and researchers engaged in open and equitable research.

This Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure project is co-funded by the Science
of Science program in the NSF Directorate for Social, Behavioral and Economic
Sciences.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
