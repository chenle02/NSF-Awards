This grant is to facilitate collaboration of a researcher from the Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory with an astrophysics group at the University of
Rochester on the physics of dense plasmas. Specifically, it will investigate the
process of phase separation at high densities in C/O and Fe/H plasma mixtures.
It will also compute new equations of state for H and He in order to study the
"metallization" (pressure ionization) of these elements at high densities. The
calculations will give insight into (at least) two quite different systems:
stellar interiors and laser plasmas; they should, in each case, significantly
improve our quantitative understanding of the system's behavior. They could also
be of value in due course in other higher density systems.
