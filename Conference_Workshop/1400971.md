Under the terms of this grant, the Society for Industrial and Applied
Mathematics (SIAM) will administer a travel award program for approximately 100
U. S. mathematical and computational scientists, particularly early career
faculty and graduate students to attend the International Congress on Industrial
and Applied Mathematics (ICIAM 2015), to be held on August 10-14, 2015 in
Beijing, China. The ICIAM congresses are held every four years and are the
primary worldwide forum for presentation of advances in the mathematical and
computational sciences and their applications to science and technology.

Travel awards are especially important for early career researchers and graduate
students who may otherwise have difficulty in marshalling sufficient funds.
Without travel support, they would be likely to take less advantage of this
opportunity for direct interaction and networking on an international scale.
This support will help U.S. mathematical and computational scientists keep pace
with the advances in applications to technology and science being developed
throughout the world. The award process will acknowledge the importance of
diversity, encourage women and minorities to apply, and give priority to
qualified applicants.
