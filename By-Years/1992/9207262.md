As AI planning systems are applied to more realistic problems, the issue of
choosing among alternative plans arises. The planner typically cannot prove that
any alternative will or will not be successful, and so it much choose among
plans on the basis of how likely they are to achieve their aims and how
efficiently they do so. Decision theory supplies a normative model for making
these choices, but is not directly applicable to the planning problem as AI has
posed it, and more importantly does not provide a computational framework within
which to make the choices. In particular, decision theory offers no advice on
how to generate or modify plans. Decision theory and symbolic AI planning
algorithms therefore offer complementary strengths: the former provides a rich
representation for expressing choice among alternatives and a theory of how to
make those choices rationally; the latter provides a computational method for
generating and improving plans, but under restrictive assumptions. The two
approaches will be integrated to produce a practical decision-theoretic planner.
The research contains theoretical and computational; aspects, the former
oriented toward reconciling the decision-theoretic and AI problem
representations, the latter oriented toward developing an algorithm that
efficiently builds, evaluated, and chooses among plan alternatives.
