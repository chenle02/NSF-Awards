Title: Student Travel Support for 16th International Conference on Verification,
Model Checking and Abstract Interpretation (VMCAI) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award will support student travel to the 2015 16th International Conference on
Verification, Model Checking and Abstract Interpretation (VMCAI) . The
conference will be held in Mumbai, India, in January 2015. VMCAI is a conference
that bridges the gap between the various methodologies that are used for formal
verification. The conference has brought together two communities---namely, the
model checking community and the abstract interpretation-based program analysis
community---both of which were largely independent 15 years ago. Supporting
student travel to attend professional conferences and workshops is a very
important mission of the NSF. Verification technology is being rapidly deployed
in a variety of areas both in academic research as well as in industrial
systems. Thus the broader significance and importance includes fostering the
next generation of researchers in this research area, as well as providing
international experiences to build a globally-aware workforce. In particular,
students will have the opportunity to learn state-of-the-art methodologies, be
exposed to novel techniques, and interact with senior researchers in their areas
of expertise.
