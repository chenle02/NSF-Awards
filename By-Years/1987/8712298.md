This research will center on two basic problems. The main one involves the
geometry of the period space. In the first part of this problem the P.I. will
attempt to construct a smooth analytic compactification of period space in
arbitrary weight. The boundary components should have an interpretation as
period spaces for mixed Hodge structures and the gluing should reflect several
fundamental results on degeneration of Hodge structures. This compactification
should make it possible to recast much of Hodge theory in a more geometric form
and help in the study of Shimura varieties. In the second part of this problem
the Cartan-Kahler theory of regular integral elements for exterior differential
systems will be applied to obtain dimension bounds and local invariants for the
image of the period map as well as its intersection with Shimura varieties. The
second problem deals with moduli spaces of Lax structures. Here the research
will focus on the study of the moduli space of Lax structures for a given
integrable Hamiltonian system as the fundamental algebra- geometric invariant of
the system replacing the less natural though common notion of spectral curve.
Applications are envisaged to a series of classical systems in the form of
theta- function parametrizations which are completely natural to their systems
rather than working only up to isogeny. This research will focus on problems in
algebraic geometry and applications to partial differential equations. Not only
then will the geometric objects arising as the set of solutions of simultaneous
polynomial equations be studied for their own sake but attempts will be made to
apply this deep theory to other
