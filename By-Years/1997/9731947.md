The focus of this research is the development of synthetic techniques for the
preparation of alpha-amino acids. The main classes of methodology to be explored
include: 1) allyl and crotyl silane/stannane additions to oxazinal-based oxonium
ions to access hydroxymethylene peptide isostere; 2) an asymmetric (1,3) dipolar
cycloaddition approach to spirotryprostatin; 3) unsymmetrically beta, beta-
disubstituted alpha-amino acids via inter- and intramolecular SN2' reactions and
via radical additions to E- and Z-alpha, beta-dehydro oxazinones; 4) preparation
of Z-beta, gamma-unsaturated-alpha-amino acids and
Z-1-aminocyclopropanecarboxylic acids. With this renewal award, the Organic and
Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Robert M.
Williams of the Department of Chemistry at Colorado State University. Professor
Williams will focus his work on developing efficient, selective and practical
methodology for the construction of biologically important alpha-amino acids and
their derivatives in optically pure form.
