ABSTRACT CTS-9457097 Daniel Schwartz The general objective of this effort is the
correlation of molecular level processes with laboratory-scale processing
variables in electrochemical systems. Molecular-level spectroscopic measurements
are coupled to macroscopic transport and reaction processes. An in situ Raman or
luminescent image provides a molecular-level "snapshot" of an electrochemical
interface or boundary layer that can be resolved spatially with micrometer
resolution. These imaging capabilities allow the study of processing-property
relationships in a variety of electrolytic or electrodeposition systems,
including conducting polymers, ferroalloys, and biological systems. They are
especially useful when homogeneous chemistry in a reactive boundary layer is an
important factor. They also permit the study of the coupling between redox
reactions (homogeneous or heterogeneous) and transport processes. The processes
studied represent the applications of electrochemical technology to modern
"high-tech" devices, including advanced batteries, magnetic storage devices,
fuel cells and space-age metals. They are also applicable to separation and
decontamination procedures for chemicals, soils, and nuclear wastes. ***
