This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project will apply novel Atomic
Layer Deposition (ALD) technology for the encapsulating of ultrafine particle
surfaces used in certain advanced materials for aerospace applications and drug
delivery. Ultrafine sized iron particles will be nanocoated with alumina
providing film thicknesses of 50, 25, 12.5, 6.3, 3.2, 1.6, and 0.8 nanometers.
The particle nanocoating will be carried out in a fluidized bed process
developed at the University of Colorado. The produced particles will be
characterized for film thickness, particle size distribution, surface area, and
film coverage uniformity. They will be evaluated for coercivity, remanent
magnetization, hysteresis loss, and oxidation resistance. Nanocoated iron
particle filled epoxy composites will be fabricated and tested for
electromagnetic transmission/reflection. Commercially, this powerful and
versatile processing method can encapsulate ultrafine particles with ceramic
nanolayers to offer unparalleled control of coating thickness ( 0.1 nm) relative
to more conventional methods. Such ultrathin, chemically bonded, conformal
coatings on individual primary particles provide for materials opportunities
never before realized . Envisioned applications include novel ferromagnetic
materials for artificial dielectrics for microwave lens antennas, radar
crossection reduction materials, and drug delivery.
