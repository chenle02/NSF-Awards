The research objective of this award is to develop a set of advanced engineering
principles for design of the exoskeleton systems that reduce the internal
musculoskeletal forces and oxygen consumption in a person during a variety of
laborious tasks in various workplaces. The hypothesis is that these systems will
decrease the severity and number of work-related back injuries while enhancing
worker safety in automobile assembly plants and distribution centers. The
research approach progresses from the exploration of the human-machine
interaction when both the flow of power and information between the device and
human dictate the overall functionality and performance of the device. Employing
the dynamic models of various elements in this human-machine interaction,
passive impedances and actuators will be developed for the exoskeletons. A set
of experiments will be conducted to quantify the effect of the exoskeleton
system on human trunk in sagittal plane, in frontal plane, and rotation around
the spine. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the technologies proposed here
will manifest in the development of broad classes of exoskeleton devices for
workers who repeatedly move objects in factories, warehouses and distribution
centers. This project will yield a set of engineering principles that decrease
the risk of injuries due to repetitive maneuvers in distribution centers and in
auto assembly plants. This project further will increase the availability of
affordable assist systems for workers and improve the quality of life for
workers. The educational impact of this research is derived from the proposed
concerted effort to integrate education with research. Graduate and
undergraduate engineering students will benefit through involvement in the
research. The prototypes developed in this research project will enrich
educational platforms for the study of design, modeling, and control of assist
devices interacting with humans.
