The Correspondence of Charles Darwin is making available, for the first time,
full, authoritative texts, edited according to modern textual principles and
practices, of all the extant, known letters written and received by Charles
Darwin. Darwin's correspondence, because it is so rich in information about his
life and work, is a prime source for understanding the intellectual revolution
in which he was the central figure. As is well known from his publications,
Darwin was a great questioner, observer, experimenter, and synthesizer, and his
letters illustrate these capacities in abundant detail. They also reveal how he
went about his work and, what does not appear in his publications, his doubts
and anxieties, his false starts and disappointments. The letters concerned with
his research reveal the extraordinary extent of Darwin's relationships with
other scientists and informants--relationships that constitute a remarkable
intellectual network among the leading scientists of the nineteenth century--and
in the aggregate they give striking evidence of the how heavily Darwin relied
upon correspondence to complete his research. The Correspondence has a wide
audience, including historians of science, biologists, geologists, philosophers,
scholars of the nineteenth century, and general readers, for whom are brought
together materials now widely dispersed among scattered repositories.
