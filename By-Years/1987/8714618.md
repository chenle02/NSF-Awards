There are many existing medical imaging techniques, including x-ray computerized
tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasonic imaging,
radioisotope imaging, and thermographic imaging. Each has its own advantages and
are suitable for different applications. Electrical impedance tomography (EIT)
images electrical resistivity. It measures currents and voltages to determine
the object's impedance distribution. Since different organs have different
resistivity, this technique then recognizes the differences and will produce an
image. EIT has several advantages, they include: safe from ionizing radiation,
inexpensive instrumentation, and portability. A system has been developed for
EIT, including a 16-electrode physical phantom, a data acquisition a system
interfaced with a PC, reconstruction software, and color display facilities.
This action provides for renewed support to: determine the sources of
measurement error from a physical phantom, develop an error-tolerant
reconstruction algorithm that can optimally reconstruct the image form measured
error- contaminated real data, determine the image spatial resolution that can
be practically achieved for typical impedance distribution of the human body,
expand the two-dimensional reconstruction method to a three- dimensional method.
Both of the PI's are experiences researchers and the institutional support is
adequate, I recommend support.
