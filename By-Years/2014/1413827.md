The Council of Graduate Schools (CGS) is undertaking an exploratory capacity
building project to plan a multi-year Best Practice research effort focused on
institutional models and strategies for integrating STEM workforce development
and graduate education. The project will provide a better understanding of what
skills deficiencies employers identify in STEM graduate students, what
structures are or are not in place to meet those needs, what learning
environments are effective, and how investments can be directed and leveraged to
enhance STEM workforce preparation. The effort will fill a knowledge gap for
graduate degree holders through in-depth input of industry leaders into the
research design of the proposed follow-on research
plan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will lay the groundwork for a more
comprehensive evidence-based research study that will identify the
characteristics of institutional models and strategies that effectively align
professional development training with degree requirements and career outcomes.
The primary tasks consist of a CGS member survey, a synthesis/framework paper, a
workshop of key stakeholders, and a culminating publication that will include
project results, a framework for future action, and a compendium of existing
model programs. These activities will involve different types of institutions
throughout the U.S. and industry leaders from multiple STEM employment sectors.
