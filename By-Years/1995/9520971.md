9520971 Stucky The key structure-property relationships of technologically
useful materials have their origins first at the nucleation stage in the
embryonic collective assembly of atoms or molecules, and secondly in the
organization of distinct organic/inorganic nanophases to form sometimes
architecturally elaborate composite configurations. This research is directed
towards these two fundamental processes: kinetic controlled atomic and molecular
assembly and the use of interface dynamics to control structure, electro-optic
properties, thermal transport, and stability in composite structures. The
synthesis, modification, structural characterization, and study of structure-
property relationships will be specifically investigated for three types of
materials: (1) nanophase electrooptic and magnetic materials with tunable
nanostructure dimensions and physical properties; (2) meso (15-200
0A)-structured biphase composites and porous materials; and (3) active framework
porous phases. A continuing goal is to develop the methodology for constructing
molecular sievelike or mesoporous phases with nonlinear active or conducting
frameworks that might reversibly interface with molecular adsorbates. %%% The
primary significance of this research is in the development of a basic
understanding of the nanostructural design of 3-dimensional composite and porous
phases. The potential technological applications of these materials include air
separation, catalysis, composite materials with high mechanical strength,
flexibility, and
