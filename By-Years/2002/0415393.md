Professor Arthur Suits of Wayne State University is supported by the
Experimental Physical Chemistry Program for research to develop a new direction
in the study of ion spectroscopy and collision dynamics by exploiting the
advantages of the velocity imaging technique and its ready application to both
electron and ion velocity measurements. Three tasks are being carried out: 1)
velocity map imaging is being used to study ionizing crossed-beam collisions of
excited atoms (H* and He*), to ultimately obtain new spectroscopic information
on protonated species such as H3+, CH5+, H3O+, and others; 2) rotationally-
resolved electron energy spectra for a range of atom-atom and atom-molecule
scattering systems are being obtained to provide insight into the dynamics of
these reactions; and 3) prior work on the decay dynamics of superexcited states
and ion-pair dissociation to investigate non-adiabatic processes, electron
correlation, and Rydberg-valence coupling is being extended. The work is having
a broader impact both on the training of future generations of physical
scientists but also on our basic understanding of chemical dynamics.
