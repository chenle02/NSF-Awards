The vertebrate paleontology collection of the Stovall Museum, University of
Oklahoma, constitutes a major US holding of such materials, is one of the best
existing records of vertebrate evolution in the southern plains, and is in
various respects a unique research resource. The Paleozoic and Mesozoic
holdings, in particular, contain a number of type specimens and exceptional
series, including a large collection of Oklahoma Permian tetrapods and singular
dinosaur faunas or specimens. The collection was amassed during a short interval
earlier in this century and was never properly curated; because of ensuing
decades of inactivity and neglect, the specimens are currently inaccessible and
thus not available for research purposes. The University has, in recent years,
taken positive steps to redress past deficiencies in collections care, has re-
established an active program in vertebrate paleontology, and has committed
itself to increased levels of support for the future. This project will support
recovery of the Paleozoic and Mesozoic vertebrates, which are most in demand for
research purposes. This program will involve 1) installation of the appropriate
specimens in proper storage units; and 2) specimen identification, conservation,
reassociation with field data, and cataloging. Recovery of the collection will
restore its capacity as a resource for research and education, will permit
projected levels of institutional support to maintain high standards in
collections management for the future, and will enable the collection to
experience renewed growth.
