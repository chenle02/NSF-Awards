9412071 Murphy This equipment grant requests funds for an automatic six degree-
of-freedom ultrasound scanning system to be assembled in the Mechanical
Engineering Department at Louisiana State University. In situ, nondestructive
measurement of the geometry of biological surfaces, including skin, skeletal,
cartilage, and subchondral bone, will be possible with resolution on the order
of 10-20 micrometers with the proposed system. This level of resolution is
essential for developing mathematical models of the kinematics and dynamics of
human joints. In the typical joint, short stiff ligaments and articular surfaces
act as passive constraints, complementing the active constraint and control of
the muscle system. Ligament elongations are thought to be on the order of one
millimeter in normal movements of the knee joints and significantly less in
finger joints. Thus surface geometry must be measured with high accuracy in
order to develop meaningful mathematical models of passive constraint behavior
of the articular surfaces and ligaments which form parallel systems. ***
