The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) Education and
Human Resources Programs is providing resources for the Robert Noyce Teacher
Scholarship Program by identifying and sharing information about effective
programs, practices, and strategies for attracting and preparing science and
mathematics teachers and retaining them in the teaching workforce.

The objectives of the project include: (1) Co-sponsoring and implementing two
NSF Robert Noyce annual conferences for faculty, administrators, student
scholars, and STEM teachers who are supported by the program; (2) Co-sponsoring
and implementing proposal preparation workshops for prospective Noyce grantees;
(3) Producing a journalist style general publication that highlights the
accomplishments of the NSF Noyce projects and Scholars and Fellows; and (4)
Developing and maintaining an NSF Noyce Program website that includes:
conference information; an online project locator with information about the
projects; profiles of Noyce Scholars and Fellows; and resources that include
evaluation and research reports.

The project is providing conferences, meetings, and online and print resources
that help science, engineering, technology, and mathematics (STEM) faculty to
develop and/or strengthen science and mathematics K-12 teacher education
programs and to form partnerships with high-need schools. Meetings and resources
focus on (a) recruiting and preparing STEM undergraduate majors and
professionals for teaching careers in elementary and secondary public schools;
and (b) building effective partnership with public schools, particularly with
high-need school districts. In addition to the conference and proposal
preparation workshops, other dissemination activities include: (a) a project
website with an online project locator, scholars' and fellows' profiles, and
Noyce project news; (b) the production of a conference program guide, with
project workshop abstracts and poster abstracts from the project leaders and the
scholars and fellows; and (c) a project publication that highlights the projects
and the scholars and fellows.
