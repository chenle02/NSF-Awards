This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
Informatics for FY2002. The fellowship supports research and training at the
postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational,
computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the
fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a
career in biological informatics in which research and education will be
integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics
at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through
these fellowships will play important roles in training the future workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Inferring
evolutionary importance of genes from the shapes of multi-species gene
genealogies." It is predicted that loci causally involved in divergences of
incipient species have gene trees that are monophyletic within species and
concordant with species phylogenies. This research develops coalescent-based
probabilistic models to describe shapes of multi-species gene genealogies. These
models are being applied to genomic sequence data to identify loci potentially
involved in species divergences.
