While tremendous progresses have been made in theory and algorithms, certain
numerical propoerties of the RLS problem such as sensitivity of the solution and
its condition number are not well understood, and solving large-scale problems
remains a challenging task.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This propposal will further
efforts to establish the eigenvalue reformulation as a numerically stable and
efficient method for solving large-scale RLS problems and to develop robust
Krylov subspace type methods for solving the related quadratic eigenvalue
problem. It is also proposed to investigate eigenvalue formulations of other
related constrained quadratic optimization problems to which this research may
be applicable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work would advance theoretical
understanding and develop efficient algorithms for RLS problems. This approach
via an eigenvalue problem would lead to algorithms that could better exploit
future developments of eigenvalue algorithms. Another potentially important
implication of this research is the establishment of a framework for justifying
the use of a direct eigenvalue formulation for an optimization problem.
