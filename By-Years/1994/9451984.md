9451984 Walters A computer laboratory at the University of Tennessee at
Chattanooga allows the Department of Mathematics to increase substantially
student use of mathematical software in a variety of courses. The lab is being
used in single and multi-variable calculus to support the work being done in
calculus reform, using, adapting, and enhancing the Ostebee and Zorn materials.
The other primary uses of the lab are in Linear Algebra, expanding upon the
ATLAST materials, and in two upper division courses, Discrete Mathematics and
Graph Theory and Combinatorics. The lab is used by students during some regular
class meetings and outside of class time for longer projects. The use of the lab
enhances current curricular efforts and offers the possibility of publishing the
results together with new teaching materials. The revision of courses for the
use of the lab builds upon the work of several faculty members who are actively
