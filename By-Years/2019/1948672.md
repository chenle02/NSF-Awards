The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to empower
retailers with tools that enable them to make a meaningful reduction in the
number of returns generated from e-commerce purchases. It is anticipated that a
valuable opportunity will emerge to leverage the newly generated data for better
recommendation algorithms, improved forecasting, and enhanced marketing efforts.
The retail industry is at a pivotal point because physical locations are
becoming increasingly difficult to sustain, leading retailers to develop a
stronger online presence. A major challenge preventing fashion retailers from
expanding their online presence is the high rate of returns for e-commerce
(30-50%) vs. in-store (8.9%) purchases. In addition to the monetary cost of
returns ($40 B), there is a significant impact on the environment with billions
of pounds of goods going to landfills due to returns. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
I-Corps project will deliver accurate human body analogues from minimal user
inputs, realistic clothing simulations from non-standardized design and
manufacturing files, and an automated integration into credible fit
visualizations. The technology provides 1) an automated process for turning
design files into photo realistic 3D simulations, 2) an automated process for
generating an accurate shadow avatar, and 3) a process by which the avatar and
simulation can be combined and multiple meshes layered using position-based
dynamics. The technological implementation of this team's approach utilizes deep
learning and machine learning algorithms, 3D modeling, mesh generation and
mapping, a custom rendering engine, and advanced fabric simulation
techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
