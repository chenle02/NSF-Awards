This project will investigate the behavior of ill-conditioned regressors with
correlated response generalized estimating equations (GEE) framework. This ill
conditioning occurs when the Fisher's Information matrix is nearly singular, a
situation that leads to traditional problems of 'multicollinearity'. The
resulting effect is poor prediction, large variability in the population
parameters that are being estimated and poor testing. The Principal Investigator
will subdivide the alternative estimators and will then propose well-defined
estimations techniques for the subclasses.

The estimators are used to understand regression under ill-posed conditions. The
procedures to be developed under this grant are primarily for the purpose of
understanding the fundamental aspects, but also will have application to large
longitudinal data sets and provide a unifying framework for generalized models
and the expectation/maximization algorithm, chemometrics and genomics. The
Principal Investigator will enable many students from a large number of
disciplines to participate in his education/research efforts.
