The principal investigator will develop a Morse theory of minimal two-spheres
analogous to that of closed geodesics. A goal of the project is to construct
large numbers of minimal two- spheres of low area using a result of the
investigator concerning Morse theory at low energies. The investigator will also
exploit the relationship between minimal two-spheres in Riemannian manifolds and
holomorphic vector bundles over the Riemann sphere. And an extension of
Hilbert's theorem to n-dimensional submanifolds of constant negative curvature
in odd-dimensional Euclidean space will also be investigated. This goal of this
project is to understand minimal surfaces with low area. Soap bubbles are
examples of minimal surfaces which minimize energy. The principal investigator
will use Morse theory to study these surfaces and their generalizations to
higher dimensions. This theory is an extension or our concept of elevation,
where basins and mountain passes undergo separate mathematical interpretations.
