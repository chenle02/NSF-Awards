Due to the broad usage of social media and the ease of sharing content, it is
crucial to apply novel strategies to understand the underlying mechanisms of
online content dissemination. The principal investigator and her team tackle
this problem by studying a class of mathematical models of opinion dynamics
called bounded-confidence models. These models provide an excellent framework
because they are relatively simple models with surprisingly rich dynamics, and
they are grounded in research from social science. The theoretical advances in
the early stages of this project will in the final stages provide a strategy for
fitting these models to real data, which is an important development that has so
far gone largely unexplored. This work will contribute to the understanding of
the mechanisms that shape information dissemination, including the spread of
misinformation. In addition, this project supports extensive undergraduate
student involvement and research training.

This research will be pursued from two complementary perspectives. First, using
a combination of agent-based modeling and mean-field integro-differential
equation models, the principal investigator and her team will study the effects
of external forcing on networks where opinion states evolve via a synchronous-
updating bounded-confidence mechanism. This allows for the characterization of
the stationary states and bifurcations in the relevant order parameters. In
parallel, the research team will study information cascades on networks using a
novel twist on bounded-confidence mechanisms. The goal of this research is to
provide insight into the study of competition, heterogeneity, and homophily on
information dissemination and create a clear framework by which to compare these
models with data.
