This Minority Research Initiation award supports the research in algebraic
geometry of Professor Ronald Biggers of Kennesaw College. Dr. Bigger's project
is to make a computer- aided attack on a number of basic problems in the theory
of moduli of algebraic curves. The results that he aims for are of considerable
interest and importance in themselves, but a byproduct of his work will be a
package of routines for computing in group theory that will be of use to other
mathematicians as well. This is research in the field of algebraic geometry, one
of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one that has had a revolutionary
flowering in the past quarter-century. In its origin, it treated figures that
could be defined in the plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials.
Nowadays, the field makes use of methods not only from algebra, but from
analysis and topology, and conversely is finding application in those fields as
well as in theoretical computer science and in robotics.
