This project supports research in algebraic geometry (which studies solutions to
systems of polynomial equations in many variables). This subject is thousands of
years old, and provides a systematic language for translating statements in
geometry (such as "a doughnut is more curved than a ball") to those in algebra
(such as "an elliptic function field is not rational"). A dominant theme of this
project is to use this dictionary to better understand the variation in the
geometric structure of a solution set of a certain system of equations as one
perturbs the coefficients of the defining equations, especially in an arithmetic
sense (i.e., in passing from usual arithmetic to modular or ``clockwork''
arithmetic). A better understanding of the geometric structure of solution sets
of equations in modular arithmetic is fundamental to many applications of
mathematics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI shall study the interaction between
techniques coming from number theory (such as cohomology theories in p-adic
Hodge theory) and algebraic topology (such as topological Hochschild homology)
in the context of algebraic varieties over a p-adic field. A deep relationship
between the two is expected: they should be related in the same way that motivic
cohomology and algebraic K-theory are related (i.e., via an Atiyah-Hirzebruch
type spectral sequence). The PI shall also use tools coming from number theory
and p-adic geometry (such as perfectoid geometry) to approach problems in
commutative algebra.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
