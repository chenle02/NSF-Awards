This project is to investigate, via numerical model techniques, a number of
important oceanographic processes. A model recently has been made of the ocean
circulation with eddy- resolving capability, and will be compared with ocean
measurements in several regions, including the Leeuwin Current off Western
Australia. This project is a Research Opportunity for Women.
