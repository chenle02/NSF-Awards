Data breaches and cyberattacks are becoming increasingly common and it is
imperative that networks and computers are protected from malicious actions by
outside entities. Unfortunately, businesses and organizations in rural settings
are at a higher risk for cybersecurity incidents given the lack of trained
cybersecurity technicians to protect the computing systems these organizations
rely on. The goal of this project is to help address the Nation’s need for
skilled cybersecurity professionals by developing an educational pipeline that
will produce skilled cybersecurity technicians capable of protecting vulnerable
computing assets in rural Iowa and beyond. The focus of the project will be to
redesign and add new hands-on training tools to an existing cybersecurity and
systems administration AAS program at Indian Hills Community College, which is
located in rural southeast Iowa.

The goals of the project will be accomplished by: (1) revamping the college’s
cybersecurity and systems administration AAS program by integrating courses,
modules and laboratory exercises developed by the National CyberWatch Center;
(2) procuring and operating a cyber range for hands-on training; (3) launching a
Capture the Flag competition to provide rural postsecondary students, secondary
students and secondary educators with in-depth exposure to the field; and (4)
hiring dedicated personnel to focus on increasing enrollment, retention and
graduation in the AAS program. This project will advance our understanding of,
and develop and test strategies aimed at increasing enrollment, retention, and
completion among rural, two-year college cybersecurity students. This project is
funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the
education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the
Nation's economy.
