9401943 Bart The Tulane University Fish Collection, a "National Center" category
collection with over 6 million fluid-preserved specimens in over 167,000 lots,
is the largest collection of post-larval fishes in North America. The type
collection contains 33 holotypes, and 127 paratypes (40,252 type specimens
total). The collection also contains 1352 skeletons, 2010 radiographs, and 2428
scale and otolith samples. The Tulane Fish Collection is unique among North
American fish collections in having a large average number of specimens per lot,
high numbers of large specimens form many taxa, comprehensive regional coverage,
an extraordinarily high quality of preservation, and high repetition of
material, mostly from long-term surveys of major rivers in the Gulf-South
region. The long-term survey samples provide a wealth of material for population
and community studies, and studies of feeding, reproductive biology, and
toxicology, in addition to more traditional uses in fish systematics. Funding
provides support for personnel, equipment and supplies to (1) consolidate
material in the main collection to smaller containers where appropriate and
begin the task of changing preservatives, (2) establish a new facility for large
specimens and long-term survey material to improve their accessibility and
conditions of storage, and (3) provide walk-in freezer.
