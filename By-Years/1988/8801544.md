Weisberg and Cook will explore the use of real time, computationally intensive,
graphical methods in statistics. The primary focus of this work shall be on
developing new diagnostic tools for use in building statistical models and on
the use of high quality graphical workstations for constructing likelihood-
based confidence regions in nonlinear and generalized linear regression. Data
spinning, multiple plots, and animation are the principal graphical tools to be
used. Methods for augmenting plots of fitted models with real time computation
of confidence bands will be explored. This research is in the general field of
parametric statistical modeling, especially in regression. The work aims to
create noveal approaches to assessing statistical models that take advantage of
modern computational and graphical capabilities. It is expected that this work
will have a significant impact on the analytical process used throughout the
scientific community, since regression is one of the most widely use statistical
techniques.
