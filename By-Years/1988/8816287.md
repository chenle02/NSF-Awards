The Altiplano-Puna of the Central Andes is one of the foremost continental
plateaus of the world, and it makes an ideal laboratory for studying the
relationship between topography and orogenesis. Prior studies have produced an
extensive data base on brittle fault orientations and slip directions that show
an apparent regional counter-clockwise rotation of shortening during the last 10
Ma and a change from a thrust regime to a strike-slip regime. This project will
continue regional studies northward to assess the possible causes of these
changes and to develop further faulting analysis methods.
