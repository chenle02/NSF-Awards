The project is developing a comprehensive career pathway for rural technicians
and women, the cornerstone of which is a new mechanical engineering technician
associate's degree program. The program includes field-based experiences, hands-
on practice with modern instrumentation, integration of technical and 21st
century skills, and establishment of clear pathways from secondary schools to
Northeast Iowa Community College (NICC) to four-year programs. The project is
developing a curriculum that includes problem-based learning scenarios in
partnership with business and industry and providing professional development
for educators to increase the availability of rural instructors for advanced
Project Lead the Way (PLTW) classes to assist in career pathway development for
area high schools. The project demonstrates intellectual merit by improving
student learning through a program based on evidence-based best practices and
business and industry input; building on a body of evidence documenting the need
for students to develop both technical and 21st century skills; utilizing an
evaluation plan clearly tied to project outcomes and developed in collaboration
with a well-experienced evaluator; and planning for ABET-accreditation of the
program. Broader impacts include replicable models of collaboration with local
employers, recruitment of women and rural technicians, and an engineering talent
pipeline from secondary school to associate's degree to bachelor's degree.
