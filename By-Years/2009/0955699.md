The challenges of achieving a sustainable future for humanity are among the most
crucial facing society today. To understand the complex and dynamic
interconnections among human and environmental systems, and to mobilize that
knowledge to inform effective management and policy making, will require
increasingly powerful quantitative tools, building upon but expanding
dramatically the approaches available for modeling, prediction and analysis of
climate systems, ecosystems and socio-economic systems. To address these
challenges, the organizers will hold a workshop in Winter 2009 to bring together
scientists and practitioners from across a broad spectrum of disciplines, to
identify crucial open research questions whose solution would advance the field
by quantum levels. Our hope is that the products of this workshop will help
guide priorities for funding of research on sustainability.
