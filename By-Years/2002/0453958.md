This is a pilot project to build a new marine sediment geochemistry database
(SedDB) that will provide new and novel access to data. SedDB will be modeled
closely after the Petrological Database of Ocean Floof Basalts (PetDB). SedDB
will feature an interactive and dynamaic user interface and a data analysis tool
set for data visualization and analysis. A special emphasis will be placed on
interoperability of SedDB with other emerging data and information systems. The
pilot phase will initially focus on collecting all of the available data for the
Equatorial Pacific and the MARGINS Subducion Factory focus sites associated
withthe Izu-Bonin-Marianas and Central American arcs.
