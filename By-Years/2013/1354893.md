Many birds and mammals are omnivorous, eating a wide variety of foods depending
on changing availability or nutritional requirements, and the production of
digestive enzymes may increase with availability of substrate in the diet. This
mode of regulation maximizes the digestibility of substrates when they are at
high dietary levels and minimizes the cost of synthesizing excess enzyme when
the substrate is at low levels. Building on past NSF-supported research, the PI
will test hypotheses about the molecular regulatory basis of intestinal
enzymatic flexibility. Research on digestive enzyme regulation in birds will
either strengthen what may be an emerging generality (if in agreement with
rodent studies) or transform current thinking about regulation of digestive
enzymes. The enhanced understanding will also improve predictions about birds'
abilities to respond to changes in diet that occur due to habitat alterations or
climate change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project I focuses on house sparrow (Passer
domesticus) juveniles, which do exhibit intestinal carboydrase flexibility, and
adults, which do not. The goal is to identify key molecular players and their
rates of change in dietary modulation of intestinal carbohydrases and
aminopeptidase-N in the juveniles, and test whether the carbohydrase expression
regulatory machinery is silenced in the adults switched between diets. Project
II focuses on comparison of wild omnivorous representatives from passerine,
nonpasserine, and rodent clades. The goal is to test for differences in
underlying gene expression regulatory mechanisms and their rates of change.
Using tissues harvested from animals fed contrasting diets, the PI will test for
molecular mechanisms underlying enzymatic patterns of response and the time-
course for regulatory responses. The research supports international
collaboration and also training at postdoctoral, graduate, undergraduates and
high school levels. Data from these studies will be shared at national and
international scientific conferences and through peer-reviewed publications.
