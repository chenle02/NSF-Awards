The objectives of this research are the measurement of the clear air field of
motion and the evolution of the raindrop spectra in selected thunderstorms.
These measurements will be made using two doppler radars at the Arecibo
Observatory, Puerto Rico, including their use as an interferometer. A third
radar (915 MHz), a portable device, will be borrowed to ensure that winds below
the cloud base can also be measured.
