ABSTRACT

PIs will explore the relationship between sediment loading, sediment size, wave
motions and slope on the formation and the maintenance of wave-modulated
turbidity currents. In a one-of-a-kind tilting wave duct, laboratory experiments
will be used to constrain the physical processes responsible for gravity-driven
transport in wave-dominated environments. Contrary to limited work related to
the effects of turbulence on gravity currents, PIs' early experiments appear to
indicate that waves can enhance gravity-driven transport owing to the "trapping"
of high concentrations of sediment there. Fieldwork in several ancient
environments will be conducted that will test this and other hypotheses
developed during the course of the laboratory experiments. The fieldwork will
also aid in the formation of new hypotheses to be tested in the lab. The field
sites (Chapel Island Formation, Newfoundland; Minturn Formation, Colorado;
Westaward Ho! and Bude Formations, southwest England) were chosen to highlight
various shelf environments where both sediment loading and wave activity is
large. These environments are one of the best records of past climate because
they are both well preserved and strongly affected by atmospheric processes. In
a broad sense, PIs work will aid research on turbulent suspensions, with
applications ranging from chemical engineering to geomorphology. It will also
help constrain the environmental conditions found in numerous shallow marine
outcrops around the world. The research program is structured such that
undergraduates will have an active role in both the laboratory experiments and
the fieldwork.
