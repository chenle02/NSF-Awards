Combinational logic equivalence checking is used extensively in various formal
verification approaches. Problems can be encountered when the candidate
functions are too large to be represented in the memory of a computer. This
motivates the need for probabilistic approaches for equivalence checking. This
project is an exploration of performing probabilistic equivalence checking based
on the Haar spectrum of two partially represented functions. Subsets of Haar
spectral coefficients are obtained from partial Haar spectral diagrams
efficiently. The probability that two logic functions differ can be iteratively
refined as additional pairs of Haar spectral coefficients with equal numeric
value are calculated. The problem of representation of very large functions is
addressed through the use of the partial Haar spectral diagram and the
probabilistic aspect arises through the use of iteratively refining the error
probability as more matching pairs of spectral coefficients are found. The use
of the Haar wavelet is desirable as compared to other transforms since certain
subsets of the coefficients are mutually independent which greatly reduces the
complexity of the probability calculations. &lt;br/&gt;
