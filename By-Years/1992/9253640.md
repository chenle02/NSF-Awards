This is a PFF award for FY 92. This five-year research program focuses on a
combined experimental and theoretical study of the use of chaotic mixing in
molten materials to create complex nanostructure solids that result in new
materials with novel properties. Methods to establish chaotic behavior in a
melt, the effect of the chaotic behavior on the solidification front and the
material microstructure, and the characterization of physical and mechanical
properties of the new materials produced will be systematically studied.
