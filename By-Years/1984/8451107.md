This research will focus on vortex dynamics including fundamental issues of
vortex motion and the development of computational methods. The theoretical work
is concerned with nonlinear dynamics description of vortex motion, such as chaos
and solitons. The computational work involves development of efficient vortex-
based algorithms and codes for following statistically evolving flows including
shear layers, wakes, and interfaces in stratified flows. Application of the
results to vorticity dominated flows will be pursued, e.g. vortex shedding from
propeller blades, sound and noise production, and coherent structure in shear
layers.
