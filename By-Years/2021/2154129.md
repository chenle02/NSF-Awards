This proposal contains central problems in additive combinatorics and Ramsey
theory. Additive combinatorics is at the intersection of number theory and
discrete mathematics, and Ramsey theory addresses the existence of order in all
sufficiently large structures. Previous progress on these and related problems
by the PI and his collaborators used powerful techniques from diverse areas of
mathematics, including from combinatorics, probability, analytic number theory,
algebraic geometry, model theory, and topology. The particular problems chosen
and the techniques that have just begun to be explored appear ripe for more
substantial progress. Graduate students will be trained during this
award.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first area in this proposal concerns subset
sums. In this area, the PI and his collaborators have recently solved some
longstanding open problems using new techniques. However, major problems remain
open. For example, the PI plans to work on better estimating the size of the
largest non-averaging subset of the first n positive integers. Another example
the PI plans to work on is the Erd≈ës distinct subset sums conjecture. Partial
progress on these problems by the PI and his collaborators suggest further
substantial progress could be within reach. The second area is on estimating
Ramsey numbers. The PI will work on proving new bounds for classical graph and
hypergraph Ramsey numbers as well as more recent problems on sparse directed
graphs. The PI has made progress using novel techniques, and further development
of these methods are expected to yield substantial progress on central questions
in this area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
