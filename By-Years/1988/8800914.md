Many migratory birds demonstrate a remarkable fidelity to breeding sites over a
period of years. In some of these species, individuals that nested successfully
in one year are more likely to return the following year than are individuals
whose nests failed. It is not clear, however, whether this difference is due to
increased dispersal or increased mortality among birds that fail. This study is
an attempt to demonstrate experimentally a causal relationship between nest
failure and dispersal. Three species of migratory birds breeding in shelterbelts
in south- central North Dakota will be examined. The research is designed so
that short-distance dispersal can be observed on the study area and so that
comparisons can be made between return rates of birds with naturally successful,
naturally failing, and experimentally failing nests. Understanding whether birds
make dispersal decisions based on previous experience yields insights into the
study of learning and long-term memory in animals. An accurate description of
how birds choose their breeding territories and move between habitat patches is
important for studies of gene flow, population structure and dynamics,
evolutionary change in small populations, and individual response to changing
conditions. The results of this study can also have practical applications in
the field of conservation biology. Because this study examines birds breeding in
isolated patches, it yields information on movements within and between small
habitat "islands." Such information can be useful in the design and management
of nature reserves.
