The Faculty Scholars Program (FSP) Network is a network of computing systems set
up in order to provide electronic mail and file transfer facilities for faculty
at a number of Appalachian Colleges, as a means of helping them to maintain
contacts with the University of Kentucky and other major research
institutions.This NSF-funded project provides equipment which allows computers
in the FSP Network to be used in five Appalachian colleges' instructional
programs, especially in computer science and mathematics. The grant is managed
by the Faculty Scholars Program at the University of Kentucky, and provides
terminals and printers to member schools for use with the FSP Network equipment
for specific instructional projects. Results of these projects are disseminated
by means of the network; projects done at one school are typically applicable at
the other schools.By taking advantage of an existing network and already
existing computer systems with an established means of software support, it is
possible with a limited budget to add multi-user state-of-the- art computing
systems to the instructional programs of several colleges. Each school benefits
substantially from the efforts of the other schools in the network.NSF grant
funds for equipment are being matched with funds from non-federal sources.
