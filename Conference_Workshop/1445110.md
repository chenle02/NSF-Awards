This grant provides support for five US-based researchers and partial support
for ten students/postdocs to participate in the 16th Latin American Mathematical
Logic Symposium (SLALM) to be held on the Campus of Universidad de Buenos Aires,
Argentina, July 28-August 1, 2014. The SLALM is the largest inter-American
meeting in mathematical logic. It was established in 1970 to strengthen working
relations between logicians in the United States and Latin America. Thanks in no
small part to the success of these relations, today, mathematical logic thrives
in Latin America. While the amount of research activity and the number of
specialized conferences of international prestige that are held in the region
continues to grow, the SLALM remains the largest inter-American logic
conference. Since inception, the SLALM's have been organized in the form of a
working conference preceded by a series of training tutorials aimed at students.
The tutorials, the plenary talks, and the special sessions aim to represent
major areas of mathematical logic. The SLALM has a strong tradition of being a
student-focused event. The tutorials that precede the conference are attended by
students from Latin America, the United States, and Canada. For the US students,
the SLALM is a unique opportunity to attend lectures and tutorials given by some
of the world's top logicians. The meeting is sponsored by the Association for
Symbolic Logic. Abstracts of the talks have been published in the Bulletin of
Symbolic, one of the three official journals of the Association.
