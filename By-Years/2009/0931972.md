CPS: Small: Collaborative Research: Foundations of Cyber-Physical Networks The
objective of this research is to investigate the foundations, methodologies,
algorithms and implementations of cyberphysical networks in the context of
medical applications. The approach is to design, implement and study Carenet, a
medical care network, by investigating three critical issues in the design and
construction of cyberphysical networks: (1) rare event detection and
multidimensional analysis in cyberphysical data streams, (2) reliable and
trusted data analysis with cyberphysical networks, including veracity analysis
for object consolidation and redundancy elimination, entity resolution and
information integration, and feedback interaction between cyber- and physical-
networks, and (3) spatiotemporal data analysis including spatiotemporal cluster
analysis, sequential pattern mining, and evolution of cyberphysical networks.
Intellectual merit: This project focuses on several most pressing issues in
large-scale cyberphysical networks, and develops foundations, principles,
methods, and technologies of cyberphysical networks. It will deepen our
understanding of the foundations, develop effective and scalable methods for
mining such networks, enrich our understanding of cyberphysical systems, and
benefit many mission-critical applications. The study will enrich the principles
and technologies of both cyberphysical systems and information network mining.
Broader impacts: The project will integrate multiple disciplines, including
networked cyberphysical systems, data mining, and information network
technology, and advance these frontiers. It will turn raw data into useful
knowledge and facilitate strategically important applications, including the
analysis of patient networks, combat networks, and traffic networks. Moreover,
the project systematically generates new knowledge and contains a comprehensive
education and training plan to promote diversity, publicity, and outreach.
