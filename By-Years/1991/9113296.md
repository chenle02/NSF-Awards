The Princeton University School of engineering and Applied Science proposes to
establish and RCMS Program, Princeton Research Opportunities for Minority
Engineering Students (PROMES), as a key part of a comprehensive effort to
enhance the recruitment and retention o minority undergraduate students and to
provide assistance and encouragement for the students to pursue careers in
engineering and applied science. The PROMES Program will focus on increasing the
number of students who prepare for graduate study in engineering, and also on
encouraging both higher academic interest and achievement among participating
minority students. Princeton will expand its academic advising and support
services to provide for academic enrichment and career motivation. These
activities will serve a broad cross-section of Freshman engineering students. In
addition, Princeton will select thirty students (five cohorts) as PROMES Fellows
over the 5 year course of the program, and match them with individual faculty
mentors beginning within the Sophomore year when they have chosen a major
department. The program will build on the strongest elements of the Princeton
undergraduate experience: faculty supervision of undergraduate independent work;
comfortable settings in which dialogue between faculty and students as well as
among students themselves can easily take place and in which students can
participate to the fullest extent; exchange among graduate and undergraduate
students in an excellent research enterprise; and close advising, mentoring, and
encouragement of high academic achievement.
