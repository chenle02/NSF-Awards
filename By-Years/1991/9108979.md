This action is to support the travel costs of American scientists to attend the
XIII International Congress of Phonetic Sciences. The meeting will be held in
Aix-en Province, France, August 19 - 24, 1991. This international meeting brings
together leading scientists from around the world to present their data and
discuss ideas on phonetics, speech synthesis, phonology, perception and
cognitive processes. This congress should be very rewarding since it provides a
congenial atmosphere for the sharing and exchange of scientific ideas and
information.
