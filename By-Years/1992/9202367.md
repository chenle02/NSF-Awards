This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program provides
support for an investigation in organometallic chemistry by Drs. Richard S.
Herrick and Ronald M. Jarret, Chemistry Department, Holy Cross College. They
will carry out a number of projects involving four electron donor alkyne
complexes of molybdenum and tungsten bis(dithiocarbamates). New synthetic
methods will be developed for complexes containing four types of ligands:
bis(alkynes), benzynes, phosphaalkynes, and oxo alkynes. The compounds will be
characterized primarily by NMR techniques, and particular attention will be paid
to the effect of substituents on the C-C bond. %%% Compounds which contain
transition metals associated with carbon-carbon multiple bonds are studied
because of their relevance to catalytic processes. In this fundamental research
project, compounds containing bonds of this type in differect electronic
environments will be prepared and characterized. The work will be carried out by
undergraduate students, and some high school teachers and students will also be
involved. Thus the work is expected to have both scientific and educational
impact.
