The American Anthropological Association will develop a 5,000-sq. ft. traveling
exhibit, website and educational materials on "Understanding Race and Human
Variation." Through an integrated, comprehensive and learner-focused educational
program, visitors will be presented with the idea that human variation is part
of nature and that race is a dynamic and sometimes harmful cultural construct.
The project will advance knowledge across the sciences by bringing together
scientists and scholars in translating research to the public and developing a
common language.&lt;br/&gt;
