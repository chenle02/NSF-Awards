9319712 Dean This award provides continued support for the operation of the
Bacillus Genetic Stock Center (BGSC) located at Ohio State University. The BGSC
houses a public collection devoted to Bacillus, maintains 1300 highly
characterized strains and a warehouse of 2500 other interesting strains. The
BGSC serves the researchers in academic as well as industrial institutions all
over the world. During the past five years, BGSC has continued to update its
collection to meet the changing needs of the research community, distributed
8200 cultures to users, published the strain catalog and newsletters, and has
published the revised B. subtilis genetic map. Under this new grant, the BGSC
will continue distributing its resources. In addition, it plans to: (1) publish
new editions of the strain catalog in both hard copy and computerized formats;
(2) continue publication of the newsletter; (3) add a DNA collection and gene
and mutant libraries; (4) confirm phenotypes for every item in the collection;
and (5) expand the BGSC Data Center to include bibliographic, genetic map, and
methods databases. The genus Bacillus includes B. subtilis, a species more
thoroughly characterized than any other bacterium outside the enterics, and
organisms utilized to produce biopesticides, food additives, antibiotics, and
enzymes. The usefulness of BGSC is expected to increase as research on and
application of Bacillus is increasing world-wide. ***
