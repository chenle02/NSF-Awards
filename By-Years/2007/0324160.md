+The objective of the project is to create an active learning community of
academically talented, financially needy students majoring in Computer Science,
Engineering and Mathematics. The project provides 25-30 scholarships per year,
and targets to increase the enrollment, retention and success of low-income and
academically talented students in these fields. It builds on a pilot project
called Galileo Scholars, which was launched through corporate support to provide
scholarships, and academic support services for academically talented students
pursuing majors in science, math, and engineering or technology fields. The
students are supported by a range of enhanced services that are designed to
bolster their success such as the Virtual Campus, the writing of an educational
plan, the field trips, and the scholars' roundtable. Through coordinated
activities, the project also provides for targeted recruiting, student support
through advising and mentoring, a transfer and career exploration opportunities,
in-person and online cohort-building activities, and assessment of these
initiatives.
