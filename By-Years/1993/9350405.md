9350405 Murnane Professor Murnane will use this Presidential Faculty Fellow
award to study the action of ultrashort X-ray pulses on plasmas and condensed
materials. The X-ray pulses will be produced with techniques she has developed
in her laboratory in which femtosecond (10-15 sec) optical pulses are converted
to the x-ray regime through plasma excitation. ***
