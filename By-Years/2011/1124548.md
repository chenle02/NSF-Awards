This project is investigating the use of head-mounted augmented reality (AR) to
improve learning outcomes among deaf and hard of hearing learners in situations
that make learning logistically-challenging for them, specifically presentation
situations where there is also some scenario that needs to be focused on
visually. The work is being carried out in planetaria, where learners wear a
monocle that displays a signer in a way that allows the learner to look at both
the signed interpretation of the presentation and the scenario of interest at
the same time. The design of the technology and way it is being used is informed
by the literature on cognitive load and by literature on multimedia learning
theory (Mayer, 2005). Results are applicable to a wide variety of logistically-
challenging situations for deaf/hoh learners, including the kinds of informal
learning venues that often excite the passions of hearing learners and perhaps
in classrooms as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Presentations, even when a signer is
available, are often logistically-difficult for the deaf and hard-of-hearing
population to take advantage of well. Moving attention back and forth between
the interpreter to the objects or scenarios being described makes it difficult
to follow a presentation and get everything out of it that a hearing person can
get. This project is aiming to ameliorate this problem by designing technology
that will project the interpreter's signs in the same field of vision as the
object or scenario being discussed and learning how to use that technology well.
