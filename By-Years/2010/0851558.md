This award supports an REU program at Texas Christian University (TCU), which
would involve 6-7 undergraduate students in 10 weeks of workshops and research
in Physics or Astrophysics. The main goal of the program is to provide a
memorable and potentially career-defining experience for student participants A
carefully mentored research program, thoughtfully-selected field trips, weekly
discussions with other students and faculty, and workshops on ethics in science,
effective presentation and planning for graduate school, culminating in a final
oral research presentation, provide opportunities for students to consider a
broad range of career possibilities in physics and engineering fields. The
expectation is that participants will give post-summer presentations of research
at a professional science conference. TCU has a reputation for providing a
nurturing learning environment with a low student-to-faculty ratio. This award
is supported by the Physics Division and the Division of Social and Economic
Sciences.
