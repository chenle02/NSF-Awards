Glycoproteins are currently receiving increasing attention because of those of
central role in biological processes, especially recognition. These ubiquitous
sustances have been implicated in many important biological functions: e.g., a
role in differentiation, growth, intercellular recognition, control of
glycoprotein uptake by cells, export of synthesize proteins, control of the
lifetime of glycoproteins in the circulating systems of higher animals and
specification of the human blood types. Found on cell surfaces, they play a
critical role in the interaction between cells and the response of cells to the
external environment which may contain biologically active substances. The
permeability of the cell surface is partially affected by the glyco moeity, thus
indirectly regulating the metabolism of the cell. There is still much to be
learned about the conformation of glycopeptides and circular dichroism (CD)
spectroscopy is one of the simplest methods of choice. Dr. Fasman will
synthesize glycosylated peptides in order to study the conformation of
glycosylated regions of glycoproteins. The conformation of the synthetic
glycopeptides will be studied by CD and then by NMR and Raman spectroscopy to
determine the influence of the glycosylation on peptide conformation.
