9505505 Becker Descriptive set theory is the study of definable sets and
functions in Polish spaces. A Polish space (group) is a separable, completely
metrizable topological space (group). Becker's reqearch concerns the actions of
Polish groups, in connection with -- or from the point of view of -- descriptive
set theory. The basic classes of definable sets are the classes of Borel,
analytic and coanalytic sets. These constitute the main topic of the project,
although other classes of definable sets are also considered. A major theme of
the project is discovery of dichotomies of the orbit space, i.e. theorems
stating that either the orbit space is "small" or else it contains a copy of
some specific "large" set. The Vaught Conjecture, a famous open problem in logic
concerning the number of countable models of a first order theory, asserts such
a dichotomy (either this number is countable or of size the continuum). Much of
the project is related to that conjecture. Becker's project employs the standard
methods of descriptive set theory together with one new method, whereby the
underlying topology is changed. Some of the topics in this project are
considered in the presence of strong set theoretic axioms. Becker's work relates
to several branches of mathematical logic, as well as to other fields of
mathematics, particularly ergodic theory and operator algebras. This research,
in the area called descriptive set theory, is of a fundamental kind, and deepens
the understanding of exactly those sets which arise in natural ways throughout
mathematics. ***
