The growing organization of partisan politics by racial attitudes suggested by
these results could have important policy ramifications. Race is probably the
most visceral issue in American public life. As such, increased polarization of
the electorate along the lines of racial attitudes would likely make the
contemporary political discourse even more vitriolic than the already rancorous
atmospheres under Presidents Clinton and Bush. Such a racialized environment
would potentially make it more difficult to achieve common ground on public
policy in the Age of Obama. That is a major reason why the last decade has
witnessed a proliferation of research demonstrating that implicit racial
communications can make racial attitudes more important in subsequent decision
making (see Mendelberg 2008 for a review). Multiple studies, in fact, show that
mass communications can make racial attitudes a more central ingredient of
opinions about ostensibly non-racial policies such as welfare, crime and Social
Security (Gilens 1999; Mendelberg 2001; Hurwitz and Peffley 1997; Winter 2008),
as well as evaluations of presidential candidates in all-white contests
(Mendelberg 2001; Valentino, Hutchings and White 2002). Research from the 2008
campaign significantly builds upon this existing knowledge by showing that
merely situating a person or policy in opposition or accordance with Barack
Obama made racial attitudes a much more important ingredient of public
evaluations of these objects than they were beforehand (Tesler and Sears,
forthcoming). This research project attempts to provide further evidence for
this Obama-induced racialization by pinpointing the extent that health care
opinions are influenced by racial attitudes and determining Obama?s causal role
in racializing public opinion about a policy that has no manifest racial
content.
