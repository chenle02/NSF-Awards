Isotopic and trace element signatures in basaltic rocks from hotspot areas hold
the key to the understanding of an important phenomenon, that is plume in the
mantle. Mantle plums are believed to have created hot spots on the globe and
with subsequent volcanism formed many sea mount chains. In this award, the
principal investigator will analyze rocks from Cobb- Eickelberg seamount chain
which is a product of near ridge hot spot activity and rocks from Marquesas
islands formed by intraplate hot spot activity. These two localities are
differnt in their geologic settings. the objective is to determine the hot spot
structures, heterogeneity and the extent of lithospheric assimilation during
melt production at these locations. This research will help us to understand
mantle geochemistry at hot spot areas. Dr. Duncan is an excellent researcher
with an established track record and the chance of success in this project is
very high.
