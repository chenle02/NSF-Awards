Software performance is critical for how end users perceive the quality of the
deployed software. Performance problems, also called "performance bugs",
typically correspond to software faults that create significant performance
degradation. Much evidence shows that seemingly harmless performance problems
can lead to severe scalability reductions and financial losses. This project
develops a set of new techniques and tools that can significantly improve
performance testing and debugging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the
project focuses on three key challenges. First, what are common patterns of
performance bugs and how can these patterns be detected during testing, before
they manifest in production runs? Second, how to ensure that code changes for
adding new features, fixing bugs, or even improving performance do not have
unintended consequence of decreasing performance? Third, how to find causes of
performance bugs from testing runs, regression checks, and in-field execution
traces? The broader impacts of the project are that improved performance testing
and debugging can substantially increase the quality of the deployed software
and thus the quality of life in a modern society that heavily depends on
software.
