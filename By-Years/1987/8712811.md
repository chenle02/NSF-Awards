Texas A&M University is being supported to establish a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) SITE. The purpose of this SITE is to provide meaningful
hands-on research opportunities in contemporary chemistry for outstanding
undergraduate students under the supervision of experienced research chemists.
The program will support 8 students for the summer of 1987, of which almost half
will be recruited from other institutions. Research activities will include the
following: o Theoretical Studies of Inorganic and Organometallic Systems o The
Reactions of Organosilicon Compounds o The Development and Study of
Multiconfigurational Techniques for the Electronic Transitions of Molecules o
Distribution Coefficients in Reversed-Phase Liquid Chromatography
