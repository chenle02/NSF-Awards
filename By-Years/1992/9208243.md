Previous studies have shown that atomic clusters of between 2 and 500 atoms can
be more magnetic than the bulk matter and exhibit entirely new magnetic
phenomena as the result of thermal fluctuactions, a large surface-to-volume
ratio and finite-size effects. This project will extend the measurements made on
cobalt and gadolinium clusters to a broad range of other metal, alloy and metal
compound clusters. The studies will be made as functions of temperature,
magnetic field, and cluster size and composition. The ultimate goal is to
synthesize clusters whose magnetic properties will be useful in applications
such as magnetic recording, electronics and optics.
