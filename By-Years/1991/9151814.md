Calculus students are enhancing their mathematics education through the use of a
computer laboratory equipped with IBM PS/2 computers running Mathematica. This
mathematical tool will be used throughout their college careers. The laboratory
is used by the calculus students in guided laboratory sessions designed to
reinforce and augment the topics being covered in lecture. The laboratory is
available on a drop-in basis to any student who has completed the calculus
sequence.
