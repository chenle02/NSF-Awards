9422539 Sarkees This Career Advancement Award for Women project has two primary
components: the expanding of the investigator's capability to conduct
quantitative research through taking advanced statistical methods courses; and,
conducting an investigation into the properties of the international system
structure. The award will allow the investigator, who has a very heavy teaching
load at her home institution, to take time off and collaborate with a senior
investigator at the University of Michigan. The University of Michigan professor
is the principal investigator on a major project in international relations
entitled the "correlates of war." The collaboration will upgrade the
investigator's skills and increase her professional capabilities. ***
