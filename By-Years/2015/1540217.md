Embedded systems currently rely on local and often insecure state retention for
process control and subsequent forensic analysis. As critical embedded control
systems (e.g., smart grids, SCADA) generate increasing amounts of data and
become ever more connected to other systems, secure retention and management of
that data is required. Attacks such as Stuxnet show that SCADA and other systems
comprising critical infrastructure are vulnerable to the compromise of
controllers and sensing devices, as well as falsification of data to circumvent
anomaly detection mechanisms.

This project develops techniques and architectures for securely storing and
monitoring embedded system state in critical infrastructure. We are examining
vulnerabilities relating to generating and storing data in critical embedded
systems, which are often resource-constrained environments. We propose the
design and deployment of 'autonomously secure storage devices' that act as
resilient storage for embedded devices. We are designing logging, audit, and
management architectures for resiliently storing system data and provenance in
the face of malicious and compromised devices. Additionally, we explore how this
data may be disseminated to other systems and to environments such as the cloud
and aim to protect data through privacy-preserving communication and querying
interfaces, and attempt to make data-driven inferences about system operation to
detect anomalous behavior. Through these active protections to generated data
and metadata, we aim to provide a new baseline for producing and storing data
generated within critical infrastructures.
