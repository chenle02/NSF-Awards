This research is funded under the Special Initiative on Coordination theory and
Collaboration Technology. This is one of eleven winners under that competition.
Traditional support for coordinating the activities of collaborative software
engineers consists mainly of version control and mail systems and does not meet
the requirements of many software engineering tasks such as interactive group
design and debugging. In this project the researchers investigate flexible
coordination of the activities of cooperating software engineers. In particular,
they develop an approach allowing: (1) a range of concurrency control mechanisms
including serial transaction, concurrent serializable transactions, concurrent
non-serializable transactions allowing other transactions to access various
types of partial results, and not control; (2) alerters automatically informing
users of events in which they are interested; (3) dynamic variable-grained
locking, and (4) live sound integrated with the concurrency control mechanism.
In the development of the approach, the researchers use results from the work
done in shared windows, long transactions, distributed interactive systems, and
other systems. The researchers also study how a particular scheme can be
automatically chosen by the system based on a minimum performance level
requested by the user. Several prototype applications will be developed to
demonstrate the novel aspects of this research.
