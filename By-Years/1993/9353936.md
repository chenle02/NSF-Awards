9353936 McGregor The project will support activities that enhance the knowledge
of faculty concerning the laboratory approach to teaching computer science.
During a summer workshop, faculty will develop laboratory activities, class-test
them over an academic year, and evaluate and refine them during a second summer
workshop. One of the content threads along which faculty will create activities
is the area of multiprocessing. ***
