9417260 Sievers This award supports the participation of eight U.S. scientists
in a U.S.-Japan seminar on New Far Infrared Sources, Detectors, and Solid State
Measurement Techniques, to be held at the University of Tokyo from October 8-13,
1995. The co-organizers are Dr. A. J. Sievers of Cornell University and
Professor Keigo Nagasaka of the University of Tokyo. The incoherent synchrotron
and coherent transition radiation sources are being explored nearly
simaltaneously in both the U.S. and Japan. But some of these sources, such as
the free electron laser and optoelectronic laser, are being developed mainly in
the U.S. while the tunable soslid state p-Ge laserKey researchers from Japan and
the U.S. will be brought together to consider potential uses for Site visits to
the Fuji training Center and the Synchrotron-orbital-radiation-ring facility
will also part of the agenda. The seminar will foster the type of contact
between Japanese and U.S. scientists that can be expected to have significant
influence on the future course of the field. The proposed participants and
observers have been selected for their past contributions and current activity
in the field and the meeting can be expected to produce concrete plans for
future cooperation and exchange. Therefore, this proposal fulfills the
objectives of the Program in its exchange and transfer of scientific knowledge
through an international collaboration. ***
