The Principal Investigator (PI) will study various geometric inequalities and
their corresponding nonlinear partial differential equations in the context of
conformal geometry and the geometry of submanifolds. One theme plans to
investigate the effect of the higher order curvatures on the validity of the
isoperimetric inequality. In particular, she intends to quantitatively analyze
the interaction between the Q-curvature and the isoperimetric constant. The PI
also proposes to study curvature inequalities of different orders for embedded
submanifolds. These inequalities, originally considered in the context of convex
geometry, have recently known to be valid on a very large class of non-convex
domains. The PI's investigation strives to look for the full generality of such
inequalities. In the meanwhile, she also aims to develop new skills to
understand the corresponding fully nonlinear elliptic partial differential
equations that arise naturally in the problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the
proposed study, the PI's research interest lies at the intersection of conformal
geometry, the geometry of submanifolds and partial differential equations
(PDEs). The study of geometric inequalities and geometric PDEs focuses on
conformal invariants, which form an important machinery from physicists' point
of view and have found applications to fundamental principles in mathematical
physics. The research project to generalize classical results of convex geometry
will improve our understanding on the rigidity of the established theory and
will shed light on a greatly larger scope of its application.
