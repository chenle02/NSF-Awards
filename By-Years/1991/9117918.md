This award provides partial support towards the cost of technical support in
the Institute of Tectonics, Board on Earth Sciences at the University of
California, Santa Cruz. The University is committed to providing the remaining
support required. The Institute of Tectonics is engaged in research programs in
earthquake and global seismology, including intensive analysis of digital
seismic data to refine models of the Earth's deep interior structure and to
understand the physics of earthquake faulting and the propagation of seismic
waves. The Institute's extensive computer systems and applications require the
services of a systems manager. This award, combined with the institution's
contribution, will provide for the services of a manager for the next three
years.
