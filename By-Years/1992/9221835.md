This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will assist the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Missouri - Columbia in the purchase
of a 250 MHz proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer. The
instrument will be used to support research in the following areas of chemistry
and biochemistry: 1. Synthetic and mechanistic investigations of organic
peroxides from alkene ozonolysis; 2. Development of new reactions for
application to problems in total syntheses; 3. Preparation and study of new
organometallic complexes which mimic heterogeneous catalysis; 4.
Characterization of the protein glycation process; 5. Nitrosamine chemistry; 6.
Development of new bifunctional ligands with application as radiopharmaceutical
agents. %%% This award will assist in the purchase of a modern nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) spectrometer. This instrument is an essential tool for faculty
members at the University of Missouri engaged in chemical research. The
instrument provides important information which in most cases can be used to
determine the geometric and/or molecular structure of newly synthesized
molecules.
