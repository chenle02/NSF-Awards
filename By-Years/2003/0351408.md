Online reputation or "feedback" mechanisms, such as those used by eBay.com and
Amazon.com, aim to mitigate the moral hazard problems associated with online
exchange among strangers, by providing the type of information available in more
traditional close-knit groups, where members are frequently involved in one
another's dealings. Trust and trustworthiness are nevertheless a much-noted
problem; a recent U.S. Department of Justice survey (2002), for example, cites
high levels of online fraud even at sites with online feedback systems. Since
alternative methods of control, such as legal enforcement, are expensive,
research into improving feedback mechanisms is important to the long-term
expansion of online markets. There are also closely associated basic research
questions concerning the nature of indirect reciprocity ('I trust you because
before you were trustworthy with others.'), and the relationship of indirect
reciprocity to direct reciprocity (I trust you because before you were
trustworthy with me.'). The significance of these issues goes beyond online
markets, extending to trust and trustworthiness in traditional markets and to
the role of reputation building in general social
interactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is comprised of three
inter-related studies. Each uses an experimental online market to investigate
important theoretical questions. The first study investigates the aspects of
online markets that hinder or enhance feedback mechanism performance including
the role of social ties, and the impact of feedback scores on pricing and number
of potential trading partners. The second study investigates the amount of
information necessary to support indirect reciprocity. Some models suggest that
reputation building can, under certain circumstances, be quite robust to
incomplete information about a person's reputation but this is unproven. The
third area of investigation concerns development of a more refined theoretical
explanation of the difference between direct and indirect reciprocity. An
experiment will investigate why present models do not capture differences
uncovered in previous investigations, and ideas from the resulting data will
used to develop a formal model. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the research,
in terms of market design, is to provide policy recommendations on how feedback
systems can be improved. The aim, in terms of our basic understanding of
indirect and direct reciprocity, is to provide a better understanding of how
people use information about the reputations of others in their decision making,
an issue of importance to institutions and organizations throughout
society.&lt;br/&gt;
