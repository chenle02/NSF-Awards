Advances in VLSI technology have made distributed systems (e.g., clusters of
workstations) suitable for parallel computing. Today's software, however, limits
the functionality of distributed systems. The goal of this research is to
discover and evaluate techniques for (1) automatic management of locality and
work distribution, (2) fault isolation, (3) high-performance communication, and
(4) fair sharing in a cost-effective distributed system. The approach is based
on shared objects, an exokernel-based operating systems, a user-level
communication unit, and gang scheduling. The project builds an experimental
distributed system that delivers performance comparable to custom-designed
supercomputers, while maintaining fault isolation and fair sharing.
