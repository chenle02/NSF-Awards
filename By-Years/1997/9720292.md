This research is to investigate new electron beam generation for achieving a
narrower electron energy distribution and low angular beam spread. When the
irradiated film is electrically insulating, positive ion impingement results in
secondary emission from the film surface, resulting in a net charge build up in
the film. However, when beam electrons impinge on the film surface, the
resulting secondary electron emission actually aids in charge neutralization of
the surface. These two fundamental issues are of importance to the new beam
curing process for low k polymer and glass films in these research activities.
In ULSI fabrication the parasitic capacitance of multi-level interconnects now
limits circuit speed. If the relative dielectric constant (k) of interlevel
dielectric films can be reduced below 3, this limitation can be overcome.
