Spheres are simple yet important objects of study in topology. One of the
central questions of algebraic topology is the classification of all possible
mappings of a high-dimensional sphere onto a sphere of lower dimension. It turns
out that this classification of mappings of spheres has wide-ranging
repercussions in geometry and in physics. Recently, this question has received
attention in other contexts: when the spheres are considered in the realm of
algebraic geometry, or when the spheres have specified symmetries which must be
preserved by the mappings in question. More recently, greater understanding of
how these various contexts impact each other has emerged. The research supported
by this award will employ these newfound connections to expand the range in
which these questions are understood, especially in the setting of spheres with
a twofold symmetry. This project provides and funds research training for
graduate students.

The principal investigator will continue joint work with Dan Isaksen on
computations of the motivic and C2-equivariant stable homotopy groups of
spheres. The R-motivic computations are more approachable, and these determine a
portion of the C2-equivariant stable homotopy groups. The main tools will be the
rho-Bockstein spectral sequence and the Adams spectral sequence. Various
techniques will be employed to run these spectral sequences, including the use
of Massey products. The PI and collaborators will also investigate
v1-periodicity in the R-motivic and C2-equivariant settings, producing finite
complexes that support periodicity operators. This will lead to periodic
families of elements in the stable homotopy groups of spheres in these contexts.
In another direction, another collaboration will analyze additive power
operations for equivariant cohomology theories.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
