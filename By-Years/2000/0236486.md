0236486&lt;br/&gt;Blake&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This U.S.-Argentina award will
support dissertation research of Mr. Lucio R. Malizia working under the
direction of Dr. John G. Blake, University of Missouri. Mr. Malizia will work
with Dr. Alejandro D. Brown, Universidad Nacional de Tecuman, in Argentina, to
conduct a study of the factors that control changes in tree-species composition
across space (species turnover). They will do this study in the Andes of
northwestern Argentina. This work will address a long-standing issue in ecology
that may have profound consequences for conservation and forest management.
Specifically, the study will shed light on the spatial structure of Argentina's
diversity, and also has the potential to improve the network of Andean reserves
through the identification of complementary areas that can maximize the number
of protected tree species.&lt;br/&gt;
