This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes a unique
rolled-ribbon cell for a Lithium-ion battery that has inherent cost advantages
for a NGV FreedomCar compact pulse-power application. It can meet the cost
requirements and deliver thousands of pulses and recharges. The battery is
formed by stacking large capacity (5-10Ah), sealed, 125mm diameter, button cells
to optimize power capability. The battery design projects power at 2-4kW/kg and
power density at 7.5kW/liter similar to a ultracapacitor, with 20 times greater
specific energy at 70-90Wh/kg . Of particular importance to high-power battery,
the rolled-ribbon design overcomes safety concerns by its unique internal heat
dissipation. Perpendicularly oriented electrode foils remove heat from the
electrode interface to the disc-cell hardware without crossing Celgard
separator. The high temperature stability of Lithium ion will be enhanced with a
flame retardant electrolyte additive.

The NGV FreedomCar can anticipate a viable safe, high power Li-ion battery using
the rolled-ribbon cell design, that is more compact and cost-effective than
ultracapacitors or other high-power batteries. Improved performance and
temperature stability for Li-ion battery can enhance prospects for the civilian
hybrid vehicle market. Gasoline savings will reduce air pollution and oil
imports.
