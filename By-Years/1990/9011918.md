ABSTRACTS This project is producing an Etymological Dictionary and Thesaurus of
Sino-Tibetan (ST), comprising Chinese and its hundreds of relatives in the
Tibeto-Burman (TB) family. The organization of STEDT is by semantic fields,
ultimately yielding a thesaurus of the proto-lexicon. During the first grant
period (1987-90), vast databases of ST lexical and etymological material were
created, incorporating over 110 published and unpublished sources (some
solicited by questionnaire). As of January 1990, the database contained over
75,000 quality-controlled records. The first fascicle of STEDT (to be completed
by the end of 1990-91) is devoted to body-part terminology. Several hundred
etyma have already been provisionally reconstructed in this key semantic area,
most for the first time. As the basic work of database creation and management
is perfected, the rate of fascicle production will accelerate. The STEDT project
is an excellent training groud for students of SE Asian linguistics and
computerized lexicography. The P.I. regularly conducts training seminars on
historical semantics and comparative reconstruction. This work sheds light on
ancient cultural patterns and thought-processes, and on long-standing puzzles
about genetic vs. contact relationship in East and Southeast Asia. The STEDTS
software will be readily adaptable for etymological work in other language
families.
