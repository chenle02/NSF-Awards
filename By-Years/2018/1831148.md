The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) project is to make the 'green' solar industry truly green. As
the deployment of solar modules expands rapidly, so will module wastes. The
International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) estimates that module wastes will
appear in large quantities by early 2030's and by 2050 they will total 78
million tonnes. Today most module wastes end up in landfills. This SBIR project
will develop a technology to maximize the revenue from module recycling. It has
the potential to enable a profitable recycling business without any government
subsidy. By recovering all the valuable components in modules, our technology
has the potential to generate up to $60 billion in revenue from 78 million
tonnes of modules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project develops
sustainable recycling processes and related equipment for silicon solar cells
and modules. The goal of the project is to separate and recover all the
valuable, toxic, and bulky components in cells and modules including solar-grade
silicon, silver, lead, copper, aluminum, tin, and glass. The target for solar-
grade silicon recovery is 85% and the target for metal recovery, especially
silver, is over 90%. The revenue from recycling, based on today's prices for
solar-grade silicon and silver, is $15/module by our technology, as compared to
$3.50/module by today's technology. The primary work of this project will be
developing a prototype for silicon solar cell recycling and optimizing the
process for a production environment. The target throughput of the prototype is
up to 50 kg of solar cell wastes per day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
