&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Evolution in response to
human activities is of great economic importance, for example in agriculture. It
would be extremely useful to be able to predict when and how such changes will
evolve. We know that mutation and genetic variation is necessary for evolution.
This project will search for simple general features of mutation and genetic
variation to use as the basis for predictions about evolution, and test these
predictions against the differences observed among species. The wings of fruit
flies (Drosophila) will be used as a model system. Surprisingly, integration of
mutation, variation and evolution in one study has never been attempted with a
multicellular organism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; If the predictions of this project
are borne out, the methods developed would be applicable to evolution in
domesticated plants and animals. If one can predict combinations of features
that are unlikely to evolve, costly breeding programs that are doomed to fail
could be avoided. Alternatively, features that are unlikely to evolve with
natural variation would be attractive targets for genetic manipulations. If the
predictions are not borne out, this will point to the need for a more detailed
understanding of the functional basis of biological traits before predictions
are useful. &lt;br/&gt;
