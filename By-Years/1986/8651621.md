This is an unsolicited proposal for the Council of Chief State School Officers
(CCSSO) to work with state education agencies to develop better indicators of
precollege education in math and science. An inventory will be conducted in the
states to identify the information they now collect on the dimensions and
quality of math and science education using the framework being developed for
such indicators by the National Research Council, the RAND Corporation, and the
University of Wisconsin. These indicator concepts and models will be applied to
a data-collection "shuttle" process to describe how each state defines and
collects such information. The project will work to meet the complementary needs
for a system of indicators in math/science education that serves program
managers and policy-makers at both the state and national levels. The project
capitalizes on the role states are playing in educational monitoring and reform,
while exercising national leadership to bring about quality, comprehensiveness,
and comparability in the data they collect and use.
