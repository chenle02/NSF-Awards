The principal investigator will study diffusion subject to the specification of
mass, a number of free boundary value problems related to combustion of solid
fuels, and will analyze a number of nonclassical inverse problems. The
qualitative analysis of the solutions of such problems is of significant
scientific interest in view of the wide spread application of such problems to
physical systems. Parabolic partial differential equations are useful as
mathematical models in many areas of engineering, chemistry, and physics. By
better understanding the fundamental theory of nonstandard models of flows,
better numerical predictions of real flows will result.
