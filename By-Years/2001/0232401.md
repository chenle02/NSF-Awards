This SBIR project will develop an integrated fire modeling software package for
use in building design and accident analysis. Modeling fires using a rigorous,
scientific approach makes it possible to predict the course of an evolving fire
and its impact on the building occupants, contents, and structure. The software
will help designers implement new fire safety codes and standards that allow the
use of Performance-Based design as an alternative to Rule-Based design.
Performance-based design and post-accident analysis offer the potential to
reduce injury, loss of life, property damage, and the overall cost of
constructing and maintaining buildings through advanced technology. The National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has developed the Fire Dynamics
Simulator (FDS) computer program. FDS is research-oriented software with text-
based input that is difficult to use for large-scale commercial applications.
This project will integrate the FDS computation engine with an interactive,
graphical interface for model setup and visualization, making the power of FDS
accessible to a broader fire safety community and facilitating responsible
engineering solutions.&lt;br/&gt; Potential markets include investigators
performing post-accident analyses, architects and fire protection engineers
designing the next generation of buildings, and local, state, and national
authorities having jurisdiction (fire safety regulators). Applications also
exist for wind-driven fire analysis, including tank-farm incidents and wildland
fires. In addition to software sales, there is also an opportunity to provide
training in performance-based design and analysis.&lt;br/&gt;
