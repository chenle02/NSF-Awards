Two related lines of investigation will be carried out in this project of
mathematical research. The work is basically geometric in spirit, focusing (i)
on a study of general extremal problems for normalized univalent holomorphic
functions in the exterior of a circle and (ii) on the analysis of complex-valued
orientation preserving harmonic planar mappings. In the first instance, work
will continue on efforts to describe the omitted set in the range of a solution
of a linear extremal problem for the functions defined and univalent in the
exterior of a disc. The omitted set is known to consist of finitely many
analytic arcs lying on the trajectories of aquadratic differential. The
structure of these sets remains elusive except in cases where the extremals were
known beforehand. Some newly developed second variational techniques will be
applied to specific extremal questions. The study of harmonic maps derives from
fundamental questions about nonparametric minimal surfaces in three-dimensional
space. The coordinate functions in their representation are harmonic and the
first two such functions give rise to univalent maps of the domain onto itself.
The extremal problems arising in this context have been much harder to work with
because of the lack of any variational principles within the admissible class of
mappings. One approach to this question is to write the mappings as solutions of
complex differential equations involving a functional parameter. It is expected
that by varying this function, one should be able to recognize how extremal maps
develop. Emphasis will be placed on mappings from a disc to itself.
