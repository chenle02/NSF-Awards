96-14447 Clement The PI proposes a comprehensive paleomagnetic study of the Cobb
Mountain subchron with the objective of formulating criteria to determine the
quality of individual sediment and volcanic recordings for any geomagnetic
polarity transition. Vocanic and sedimentary paleomagnetic records from several
locations will be studied to test the hypothesis that the degree of smoothing of
secular variation recorded during full polarity intervals can be used to
estimate the extent to which the temporal resolution has been affected in
transitional intervals. The results should provide constraints on the temporal
resolution of reversal records and could serve as a useful quantitative guide
for estimating how much time resolution is provided by these data. ***
