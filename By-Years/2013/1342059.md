This grant is to support the travel costs of students and postdocs to attend the
Sixth Coronal Loops Workshop to be held in La Roche-en-Ardenne, Belgium, June
24th-27th, 2013.

This workshop series provides a forum for researchers to discuss in detail the
basic physical processes behind the formation, evolution, and disappearance of
coronal loops in solar active regions. The schedule of the Loops Workshop is
flexible to encourage open discussion by its participants. Furthermore, the
Loops Workshops have a well-deserved reputation for allowing the younger
generation to assume relevant roles in the community and the scientific
discussions. An open mailing list developed by the Coronal Loops Workshop
community communicates with over 170 scientists worldwide, allowing those
researchers to continuously exchange ideas, new results, publications, and
information on coronal loops research. The workshop has traditionally been
supportive of the attendance and participation of Ph.D. students and young
postdocs.
