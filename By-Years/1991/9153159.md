A year-long biochemistry laboratory course will be developed for the ACS-
certified degree in Chemistry/Biochemistry. The laboratory will focus on
centrifugation, chromatography, electrophoresis, and spectroscopy in the
separation, identification, analysis, and chemistry of biomolecules. The
equipment to be acquired and used hands-on by the students includes refrigerated
centrifuges, uv-vis spectrophotometers and fluorometers, a capillary
electrophoresis system, and an HPLC system. The grantee will overmatch the NSF
grant with $98,403 of non- Federal funds.
