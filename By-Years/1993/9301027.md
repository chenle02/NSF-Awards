Dr. Sandra Greer is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program to continue her research involving structure, thermodynamics,
kinetics and dynamics of organic molecules undergoing equilibrium
polymerization. In equilibrium polymerization, the monomers begin to polymerize
as the temperature is lowered through the polymerization temperature and then
grow in length as the temperature is lowered further. If the temperature is
raised, the polymers shorten and eventually revert to monomers on passing back
through the polymerization temperature. Systems undergoing equilibrium
polymerization are referred to as "living polymers". Microscopic studies will
employ neutron scattering as well as light scattering to investigate the
structure of solutions and the motion of polymer molecules in them. Macroscopic
studies will include characterization of thermodynamic properties such as
density, heat capacity, phase diagrams as well as transport properties such as
viscosity and stress relaxation. %%% Equilibrium polymerization is a major
avenue for the synthesis of novel polymers with unique material properties.
These systems also provide a wonderful means for studying the microscopic
structure of polymer solutions as a function of polymer molecular weight since
the polymer size can be regulated by adjusting the temperature. Dr. Greer's
research will provide significant insights into the molecular level explanation
for the dynamics and thermodynamics of living polymer systems.
