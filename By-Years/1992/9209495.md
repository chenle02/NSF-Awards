The long term goal of his project is to understand the molecular mechanisms
underlying the development of the mammalian central nervous system. Many
physiological factors influence the development of the central nervous system.
Among these factors, thyroid hormones are known to be absolutely essential for
proper development. The actions of thyroid hormones are mediated through nuclear
receptors, which regulate the expression of specific target genes in response to
hormone binding. However, the genes that are regulated by thyroid hormones in
the developing brain are largely unknown. The main objective of this proposal is
to identify the targets of thyroid hormone receptor action in the brain during a
time frame that is critical for proper development. Target genes will be isolate
using subtractive hybridization coupled with polymerase chain reaction
amplification to identify genes that are expressed in euthyroid but not
hypothyroid animals. These genes will then be characterized with respect to
their patterns of expression and nucleotide sequence. Using a molecular approach
to focus on a class of genes that are likely to be important for central nervous
system development will significantly advance our understanding of the effects
of differential gene expression on the developing nervous system. The
identification and isolation of thyroid hormone responsive genes, coupled with
characterization of the proteins they encode, is an essential first step in
realizing the ultimate goals of this proposal.
