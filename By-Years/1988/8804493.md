X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) enables chemists to obtain fundamental
information related to surfaces. Areas as diverse as electrochemistry,
heterogeneous catalysis, and surface science can be enhanced by access to modern
XPS instrumentation. The Department of Chemistry of Texas A&amp;M University
will use this award from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program to help
acquire an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. Among the areas of chemistry that
will be enhanced by the acquisition are the following: 1) Use of ESCA in
electrochemical studies 2) Bimetallic complexes bridged by difunctional ligands
and trinuclear complexes 3) The role of surface oxygen ions in the catalytic
activation of methane 4) Surface coordination/organometallic chemistry of Noble-
metal electrocatalysis.
