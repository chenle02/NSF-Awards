This research focuses on transformations in regression analysis when there is a
theoretical model for the median response, but the error distribution must be
modeled empirically. The purposes of the transformation are to stabilize the
variance and to induce symmetrically distributed errors. Estimating such
timation of parameters in the theoretical model. It can also help model the
random nature of the physical system from which the data arose. This reseach in
statistical science is in the general area of regression analysis. Mathematical
theory in this area deals with measuring the degree of association between
variables and assessing the nature of such associations. This work extends the
flexibility of the mathematical models available for making such assessments and
thus will permit a richer variety of relationships to be discovered and
characterized.
