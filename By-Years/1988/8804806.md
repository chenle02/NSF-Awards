The Coast Plutonic Complex, an 1800 km long belt of Cretaceous and Tertiary
metamorphic and plutonic rocks, straddles the contact between the Insular and
Intermontane super terranes in British Columbia. These allochthonous bodies were
accreted either during mid-Cretaceous time or possibly during the Jurassic. In
order to help constrain models of the tectonic evolution of the Coast Plutonic
Complex, this project will examine the eastern margin of the belt in British
Columbia where the structural and metamorphic history of this margin can be
documented and the relative importance of transcurrent and thrust faulting be
assessed. By providing information on the timing, style and regional extent of
deformation and metamorphism, the project will contribute towards a
comprehensive model for the origin of the belt and accretion of the Insular
terrane.
