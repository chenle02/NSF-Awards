9630442 Berenbaum Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases are enzymes involved in the
metabolism of foreign compounds in organisms ranging from bacteria to humans.
Despite their virtually universal distribution, little is known about the
functional significance of variation in these enzymes. This gap in knowledge is
particularly acute with respect to P450s in insects, despite the importance of
these enzymes in the metabolism of plant toxins as well as insecticides. In the
tiger swallowtail, Papilio glaucus, CYP6B4 is known to metabolize
furanocoumarins, plant secondary substances that are toxic to a wide variety of
insects. Unlike its relatives, which feed exclusively on plants containing
furanocoumarins, the tiger swallowtail almost never encounters these toxins in
its host plants. In this project, the investigators will examine variation in
the structure and function of CYP6B4 in relation to the frequency with which
furanocoumarins are encountered in the diet of the tiger swallowtail. By
examining variation in enzyme function in the presence and absence of naturally
occurring toxins, we hope to gain insight into the process by which plant-
feeding insects develop the metabolic capability to feed on toxic plants as well
as into the process by which cytochrome P450s assume importance in the
acquisition of resistance to insecticides and other synthetic toxins.
