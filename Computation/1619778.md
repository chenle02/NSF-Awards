Physical systems are modeled at different scales and to different approximations
with different equations. The Schrodinger equation at the quantum level models
the molecular and atomic scale. Newton's laws in classical mechanics model the
macroscopic scale. The Boltzmann equation applies at the statistical level,
where systems of many particles are studied, and the Navier-Stokes equation and
others model distributed systems such as fluids in the continuum regime. A
central question in applied mathematics and physics is to understand the
relationships between the different models, and many tools (both analytical and
numerical) have been developed for this task through the years. However, most of
them idealize the systems under study and cannot tackle practical problems that
have emerged in the study of complicated systems in chemistry, physics, and
engineering. This project focuses on two longstanding challenges concerning
these connections: the characterization of quantum information in the classical
regime when chemical reactions are present, and the coupling between the
statistical and the fluid description. The project aims to develop improved
methods for the modeling of multiscale systems. Despite their fundamental
importance in physics and engineering, effective mathematical analysis and
computational techniques for multiscale problems in kinetic theory have remained
rather elusive. The multiple scales inherent in many physical systems have posed
notorious computational challenges. This project concerns development of
multiscale numerical methods in kinetic theory, including numerical capture of
the hydrodynamic limit of Boltzmann-type equations and the semi-classical limit
of the Schrodinger equation. Both have long been regarded as fundamental
problems in kinetic theory. More specifically, the project focuses on capturing
the non-adiabatic transition in the classical regime derived from quantum
mechanics, and boundary layer effects that connect the fluid description with
the statistical mechanical description. Both problems emerge in transition
regimes, the multi-physics phenomena can be captured by none of currently
available mathematical treatments, and the computation is far from being
efficient. The project aims to develop and analyze efficient computational tools
for these problems, focusing on treatment of boundary layers and interfaces and
design of asymptotic-preserving schemes. Besides leading to improved
understanding of physical systems of these types, it is expected that the new
tools under development could inspire treatments of similar problems emerging in
other areas, for example, hyperbolic type problems with random media.
