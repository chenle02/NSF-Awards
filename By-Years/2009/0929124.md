The purpose of this travel grant is to support 10-12 graduate students from the
United States, particularly those from underrepresented groups and institutions
that traditionally lack funding for such support, to attend the 10th IEEE
International Symposium on World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networking
(WoWMoM 2009) that will be held in Kos, Greece, from June 15 to June 18, 2009.
Since its inception, WoWMoM has been a high quality conference and the premier
technical forum dedicated to addressing both the theoretical and real-world
challenges in wireless mobile multimedia networking. This grant provides an
opportunity for the students to be exposed to the cutting research in the field
of wireless multimedia networking, and to interact with peers and leading
researchers from other institutions. The participation of deserving students in
WoWMoM will not only help their future careers but also will positively affect
the future of the research in wireless multimedia
networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The student selection process will consider the
following: 1) students from groups traditionally underrepresented; 2) students
from universities that traditionally lack funding to support graduate student
attendance at conferences; and 3) students who will present their papers during
the conference. Priority will be given to the graduate students from
underrepresented groups, such as women, African American, Hispanics, and Native
American students, and from universities that lack financial
resources.&lt;br/&gt;
