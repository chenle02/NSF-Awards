It is becoming apparent that among the youngest stars, multiple systems are very
common. This suggests that in the process of collapsing to form stars, molecular
clouds fragment. The collapse process will be modeled using a new three
dimensional hydrodynamics code. A range of possible molecular cloud cores will
be studied to determine what parameters favor fragmentation. The evolution of
the fragments will be followed to determine which survive as binary objects.
Finally, the appearance of the models will be compared with observations of
suspected binary protostars.
