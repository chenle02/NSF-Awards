9355614 Rowlett This project will provide content enrichment, leadership
training, network development, and on-site support to a cadre of earth science
teachers in grades 6-12 from North Carolina. Subsequently they will introduce
field-based observational projects into their earth science courses in
conformity with the state curriculum. In six regions, three week summer
institutes will be conducted by master teachers and specifically trained earth
scientists. During each of three summers two institutes, each enrolling 25
teachers as 2-member teams with LEA-support, will be held at different regional
sites. Supported by one-day pre-meeting workshops to devise site- specific needs
assessments, post-meeting site visits by staff and earth scientists, follow-up
meetings, and inservice development, the project will prepare specifically
designed manuals for implementing earth science field projects on school sites
and will model best teaching techniques for hands-on learning. Teachers will
also prepare an Earth Science Action Plan to improve their school's earth
science curriculum and to provide inservice to their colleagues.
