This research project is concerned with modeling the flow and transport in
electrochemical systems with significant shape change effects. Typical examples
are electrochemical deposition and etching processes. While the diffusion
dominated limit will be studied, the main focus is on systems with significant
convective transport effects. The research utilizes a Galerkin finite element
method coupled with an adaptive mesh technique implemented on a Class VI
computer to solve the appropriate continuum models. The development of such
techniques coupled with numerical experiments will allow the technical community
to gain new insights into the fundamentals of such processes, as well as provide
for the possibility of predicting "operating windows" and forecasting scale-up
problems in the commercialization of such processes.
