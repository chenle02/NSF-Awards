Spacecraft charging occurs when energetic particles in space interact with the
surface or internal electronics of satellites. These particles are a hazard to
both spacecraft operations and to human and robotic space exploration. This
grant funds support for an international conference focusing on the science and
technology of electrical charging of spacecraft by the space environment.
Support includes student travel to participate and present at the
conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Spacecraft Charging Technology Conference
will be held in Cocoa Beach, FL from March 30-April 3, 2020. This is the
sixteenth conference in this international series, with topics related to: Solar
Array Plasma Interactions, On-Orbit Investigations, Nano-Satellites, Ground
Testing, Internal/Surface Charging, Plasma Propulsion and Tethers, Material
Properties, Charging of Dusts and Small Bodies in Space, Charging and Arcing
Mitigation, and Theory, Modeling, and Computer Simulations. To encourage the
next generation of STEM leaders in this field, a dedicated student/early career
poster session will highlight research and scientific interests of current and
early career professionals. Student travel costs will be
supported.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
