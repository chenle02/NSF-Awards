Effective techniques to perform in-circuit reconfiguration for FPGAs may lead to
a new generation of fault-tolerant computer systems for high reliability and
high performance applications. Future programmable computer architectures could
allow software running on the hardware platform to dynamically adjust the
architecture according to the current task. This research is concerned with the
diagnosis and reconfiguration of re-programmable Field-Programmable Gate Arrays
(FPGAs). In particular, the effort focuses on the design of FPGA interconnect
diagnosis algorithms, development of in-circuit reconfiguration strategies for
fault tolerance and change of functionality, and the establishment of a
theoretical framework for self-adjustable FPGA systems. Since an FPGA contains
many connection wires and switches and requires a great amount of diagnosis
time, especially if the diagnosis has to be done often, fast-diagnosis algorithm
time implies a great saving in time and resources, and greater reliability. Fast
diagnosis algorithms will also benefit other areas where interconnect diagnosis
is important, such as VLSI, MCM and PCB production.
