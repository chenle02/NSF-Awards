Bladder function is controlled by spinal reflexes involving spinal motoneurons,
which connect to muscles in the periphery, and interneurons, which make their
connections within the central nervous system. The activity of these spinal
neurons is coordinated by higher centers in the brain. The object of the present
work by Drs. Collins and Erichsen is to identify and characterize these spinal
motoneurons, both anatomically and physiologically. At present, little is known
about these neurons, particularly the spinal interneurons; this lack of
knowledge is the result of the inability to identfy function-specific spinal
interneurons and to establish their connections within the spinal cord.
Recently, the investigators of these studies have developed both the
electrophysiological and neuroanatomical techniques which will enable them to
achieve this objective. The use of a multidisciplinary approach in this research
will allow a more comprehensive examination and analysis of individual spinal
neurons than would be possible with any single technique. The information
obtained from these experiments will provide an essential database of the
locations, functional identities, and synaptic connections of spinal
interneurons involved in the control of bladder function.
