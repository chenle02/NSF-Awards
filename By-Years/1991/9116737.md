This provides partial support for the activities of the National Research
Council's Board on Earth Sciences and Resources. The Board coordinates the
National Research Council's advice to the federal government in earth science
issues, ranging from basic research through applications, to assistance in
policy formulation. Such advice includes (1) identifying and enunciating the
opportunities for advancing basic earth science research and understanding, (2)
applying that information for hazard mitigation and resource utilization, and
(3) analyzing the scientific underpinnings and credibility of earth science
information for resource and other earth science applications and decisions. The
Board's actions address the overall health of the earth science disciplines that
are vital to the nation in maintaining and increasing its capability to make
wise use of the Earth and its resources.
