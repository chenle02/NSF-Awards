Recent research in the areas of social and health psychology has applied
Festinger's (1954) theory of social comparison to the study of coping processes.
This research has indicated that people who are facing psychological or physical
problems (e.g.,cancer, loss of a loved one) will often compare their own
situation with that of others who are thought to be worse off, a process called
downward comparison. Research by the current investigators has indicated that
this type of social comparison can improve mood states and increase optimism
about coping abilities. New studies will examine downward comparison as it
occurs in two settings. The researchers will examine specific aspects of the
downward comparison process, including when people choose to engage in it, what
types of people are chosen as comparison targets, and what effect the process
has on the perspectives of those who engage in it. Studies will look at how this
type of social comparison affect individual's perceptions of deviance, coping
abilities and problem severity. The effect it has on individual's perceptions of
others who share their problem will also be studied. Downward comparison as it
occurs naturally in community support groups for persons with medical and
psychological problems will be investigated. This study will assess group
members' preferences for (downward) social comparison targets (e.g., a desire to
have in their group others who are coping better or worse with the same
problem), and relate this preference to changes in optimism and mood and in
self-perceptions of coping ability. The research should provide useful
information about the process of downward comparison per se, as well as when it
ocurs naturally and what effects it has on the people who engage in it and on
their perceptions of others like themselves.
