This award to Ayusman Sen of The Pennsylvania State University from the
Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program is for study of
metal mediated electrophilic activation of carbon-hydrogen and carbon-carbon
bonds in hydrocarbons leading to the oxidative functionalization of alkanes and
arenes. Especially important as a potential outcome of this research would be
the catalytic oxidation of methane to methanol, an excellent and conveniently
transportable energy source. The general approach will be to employ highly
electrophilic, weakly ligated metal species such as the lanthanide(III) tri-
fluoroacetate complexes in trifluoroacetic acid solvent. The study will address
five major points: (a) the relationship between the propensity to cause
electrophilic cleavage of C-H bonds and the nature of the metal, (b) the
relative tendencies of the different classes of C-H bonds to undergo
electrophilic cleavage, (c) the ability of different types of cooxidants to
reoxidize the metal species in the catalytic cycle, (d) the possibility of using
the metal solely as an electrophile and a separate two-electron oxidant to
oxidize the metal-bound hydrocarbyl species, and (e) the possibility of
achieving the electroplilic cleavage of C-C bonds.
