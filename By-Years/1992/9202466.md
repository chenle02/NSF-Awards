Description: This project supports the participation of Dr. Roger Bilham of the
University of Colorado and Dr. V.E. Nagar of the Geodetic and Research Branch of
the Survey of India in field research in India. The objective is to use GPS
geodesy to determine the vertical and horizantal positions of survey markers
spaced at crucial locations across the active Himalayan deformation that marks
the collision zone between the Indo/Australian Plate and the Euro/Asian Plate.
This is part of a larger project in which Dr. Bilham is also conducting similar
studies in Nepal and Pakistan to cover various segments of the Himalayan
deformation. Scope: This project allows for valuable cooperation between the
Indian team and the U.S. team. Dr. Nagar is more familiar with the Indian
conditions and is better prepared for long term data acquisition in that
country, while Dr. Bilham can provide coordination with the neighboring
countries as well as supply sophisticated instruments and broader expertise in
measuring techniques. The project fits well within the U.S.-India Cooperative
Science Program criteria.
