The university and two industrial partners are developing a 2-year educational
program on Artificial Intelligence, Expert Systems Applications, Computer-Aided
Design, and Very Large Scale Integrated Circuits Design and Fabrication.
Industrial experts present significant components of the two courses involved.
The project also involves installation of a KU-band transmitter, a control room,
and a studio classroom to support satellite distribution of the university
courses to remote audiences. Satellite receivers at KU and C bands plus video
display and distribution facilities are being installed currently at the
university. The courses use the latest interactive TV and tutored video
techniques, supplemented by personal contact between all students and the course
lecturers. Detailed evaluation is to be undertaken to compare all methods
employed with respect to educational efficiency and student and faculty reaction
to their use.
