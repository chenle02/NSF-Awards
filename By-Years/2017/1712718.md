This award would support the first dedicated scientific meeting focusing on
specific needs of space weather studies using small satellite platforms. The
proposed event would bridge this gap thus fulfilling a major need in the space
weather community to have opportunities to generate and develop new projects
based upon the new ideas created by this meeting
activity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key intellectual merits of the proposed
workshop are rooted in its interdisciplinarity. By bringing together scientists
and engineers working on small satellite missions and space weather problems,
the proposed workshop would facilitate innovative insights into both fields,
provide new opportunities to brainstorm long-standing space weather problems,
identify new observational targets, and develop recommendations for future small
satellite missions serving the space weather community.
