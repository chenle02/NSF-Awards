The importance of high performance computing to contemporary issues in science
and engineering has been well documented. It is the goal of this Presidential
Young Investigator to develop efficient algorithms for large scale computing, in
particular, multigrid methods capable of solving three dimensional, nonlinear
structural mechanics problems. Some of these problems include stability of
complex structures with both material and geometric nonlinearities. These
computational tools will allow the engineers to better understand the influence
by such phenomena as mode interaction and imperfection sensitivity on bucking of
structures. Special effort will be made to implement these algorithms on both
coarse-grain (CRAY, Alliant) and fine-grain (CM, HperCube) Systems.
