The Department of Statistics at North Carolina State University will purchase
computer workstations, a compute/file server, and graphics equipment which will
be dedicated to support research in the mathematical sciences. The equipment
will be used for several research projects, including in particular: Estimation
and Inference for Noisy Chaotic Systems, Exact Conditional Tests for Contingency
Tables, Numerical Methods for Bayesian Analysis, Inference in the Presence of
Nuisance Parameters, and Probabilistic Neural Firing Models.
