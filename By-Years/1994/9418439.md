Jordan 9418439 The project's goal is to increase the understanding of the
earth's upper mantle and transitin zone through an integrated, quantitative
analysis of seismological and mineralogical data. The seismic data sets will
include the frequency-dependent travel times of direct and multiply reflected
shear waves, surface waves, and higher modes on vertical, radial, and transverse
seismograms, as well as mantle reflectivity profiles obtained from horizontally
polarized ScS reverberations. The latter will allow tight constraints to be
placed on the existance, location, and impedance contrasts across upper-mantle
discontinuities. The seismological data from each corridor will be inverted for
a path-averaged, anisotropic earth model subject to different sets of
mineralogical constraints. These constraints will be generated by self-
consistent mineralogical modeling of upper-mantle structure assuming
hypothetical compositions and phase relations, and then tested for consistency
with the seismic data. Among the hypotheses to be examined are competing
compositional models (e.g., pyrolite vs. piclogite), the hypothesis of chemical
homogeneity, and mechanisms for polarization anisotropy. ****
