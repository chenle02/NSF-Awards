The proposed project develops an interactive multimedia intelligent tutoring
system (IMITS). The IMITS will be used within regularly scheduled required
courses for electrical engineering undergraduate students. Its purpose will be
to monitor a student's interactions with multimedia learning modules. The IMITS
will analyze the student's interactions to decipher what the student is
learning, is not learning and is learning incorrectly. When learning
difficulties are discovered the IMITS will tutor the student. The tutoring will
consist of identifying any logical or procedural flaws that the student may have
assimilated and then dynamically modifying both the instructional sequence and
the amount of detail presented within the multimedia modules. These
modifications are made so that the student may understand any logical flaws and
correct them as well as clear up any misunderstanding about the material. The
project consists of three major tasks: 1) to develop and integrate the
components necessary to form an interactive multimedia intelligent tutoring
system; 2) to use existing modules as well as develop a new set of interactive
multimedia modules to be used with the tutoring system; and 3) to implement the
system as a supplement to portions of existing courses.
