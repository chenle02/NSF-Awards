The objective of this study is to determine the source and target cells for a
growth factor (EGF). Furthermore, because it has been shown to stimulate
anterior pituitary corticotropes, the aims will determine if pituitary EGF-
producing cells respond to the same stimuli that activate secretion from the
corticotropes namely stress and corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH). To
identify the source of EGF, labeling protocols that localize messenger
ribonucleic acid (mRNA) to EGF will be done. The source cells will then be
further identified by dual labeling for pituitary hormones. Once the source
cells are identified, their responses to stimulation by stress or CRH will be
determined to learn if they can be activated by increasing EGF mRNA. Aim target
cells for EGF. EGF receptors on these cells will be labeled either with a
biotinylated analog of EGF or antibodies to the EGF receptor. Then these cells
will be identified further with labels for the hormones. The source cells will
then be enriched and stimulated to secrete. The media will be used with
corticotropes to determine if the cells secrete biologically active EGF. The
specificity of the reaction will be determined by adding antisera to EGF to
neutralize any EGF activity.
