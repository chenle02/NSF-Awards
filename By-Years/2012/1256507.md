The Computational Thinking-Enabled STEM Professionals' Workshop (CTSTEM-PW) is a
collaboration between Education Development Center (EDC), the New Mexico
Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (NM-EPSCoR), Intel
Corporation, Los Alamos National Laboratory, the University of New Mexico, and
Navajo Technical College. It is a six-month project with two phases: (1) a
workshop-planning phase, in which the project team will collaborate with key
stakeholders in industry, government and academia, to adapt and apply workforce-
development tools for identifying computational-thinking needs in the workplace
and for assessing the alignment between those needs and available educational
offerings; and (2) a workshop to share the findings from phase 1 with a group of
undergraduate students from Tribal Colleges and Hispanic Serving Institutions,
and to assist those students in planning for careers as CT-enabled STEM (CTSTEM)
professionals. During the workshop, undergraduate students will become familiar
with the major job responsibilities and work activities of CTSTEM professionals.
They will also identify the courses and work-based learning opportunities
available to prepare for those careers, and will develop a career plan laying
out CT learning goals, necessary educational activities, and a timeline for
achieving targeted objectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In short, the CTSTEM-PW
project will refine and test an innovative workshop format for helping
undergraduate students from disadvantaged backgrounds to launch professional
careers in the emerging field of computation-enabled science and engineering.
The CTSTEM-PW project will engage key stakeholders from academia, government and
industry in determining CTSTEM workforce needs, in mapping those needs onto
available educational opportunities, and in translating the resulting workforce-
development vision into practical career advice for a concrete group of
undergraduate students. By situating the pilot workshop in New Mexico, and by
partnering simultaneously both with world-class technology leaders and with
local Tribal Colleges and Hispanic Serving Institutions, the CTSTEM-PW team
hopes to develop a broadly-replicable template for deepening and diversifying
the pool of CTSTEM professionals in economically and socially disadvantaged
communities across the nation.
