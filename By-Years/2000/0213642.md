This project will evaluate a class based approach to the explanation of the
growth in earnings inequality over the last two decades. It adopts a class
schema derived from the work of Erikson, Goldthorpe, and Portacarero (EGP) to
describe the relationships between class and growing inequality. It will utilize
data from the Survey of Consumer Finances to evaluate the role of capital income
in explaining the variable relationship between class position and income. And
it will analyze inter-industry wage differentials by class to examine a rent-
based explanation to growing inequality: whether some of the growing inequality
may be attributed to declines in rent payments to working-class wage earners in
industries that have historically paid higher wages.
