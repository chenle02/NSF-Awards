The goal of this research is to develop a mathematical theory for the analysis
and control of discrete event systems (DES). DES arise in a variety of areas
including, for example, multi-robot systems, manufacturing systems, data bases,
distributed computing, pattern recognition, distributed and hierarchical
optimization, and the higher level intelligent control of complex processes. The
main thrust of the research is to develop a 'real-time' extension of supervisory
control theory for DES. This will extend its scope by addressing two issues of
great interest in applications: timing and performance. In addition, the
research will expand upon and continue work on modular supervisor synthesis;
distributed and hierarchical supervisors; structured controllers and aggregated
models; the complexity of supervision, and forcing controls. The relationship of
the supervisory control framework to other models (e.g., the max-algebra model,
and stochastic models) will also be investigated with the aim of unifying, to
some extent, the tools available for the study of discrete-event systems.
