This grant is to provide partial support for a two-day workshop entitled
"Frontiers of Broad Band Seismology" jointly sponsored by the University of
California at Berkeley and the California Institute of Technology. It will be
held on January 9-10, 1991, in Berkeley, California. Recent advances in the
technology of broad-band seismic instrumentation have led to a revolution in the
design and installation of seismic arrays in the western United States. Major
advances in our knowledge of earthquakes and the interior of the earth are
possible from this new capability. The workshop will facilitate data storage and
formatting and ensure access to the massive amounts of information that will be
generated. It will also provide a broad spectrum of both U.S. and international
scientists an opportunity to develop and extend strategies for analysis in
future research. This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard
Reduction Program.
