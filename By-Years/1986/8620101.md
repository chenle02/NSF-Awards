Analytical studies will be made of the relationship between finestructure and
microstructure, using data obtained from the Caribbean Sheets and Layers
Transects Experiment (C- Salt) and from the Patch Experiment (PATCHEX). Optical
observations in C-SALT revealed horizontal, rather than the expected vertical
bands in regions favorable to salt fingers. Two analytical approaches will be
used to investogate this phenomenon: fingers stretched and tilted by shear, and
secondary instabilities due to horizontal intrusions. The larger scale CTD data
set will be used to investigate the relationship between layer thickness and
other staircase properties with the objective of better quantifying the vertical
salt flux and larger scale properties. PATCHEX data will be used to investigate
various aspects of shear instability and mixing, specifically the relationship
between internal waves and the shear and strain fields.
