Professor Battle's research involves the use of wavelet analysis in quantum
field theory. In this project, he will work on the infrared problem for spinor
quantum electrodynamics in three space-time dimensions, and on the ultraviolet
phase cell analysis of group-valued sigma models. Much of the enterprise of
mathematical physics is concerned with analysis on spaces of functions,
typically functions of several position and momentum variables. The functions
represent possible states of whatever physical system is being modeled.
Properties of the model are encoded by procedures for getting numbers out of
these functions, or for transforming them into other functions. A general
mathematical technique useful in studying these procedures is to expand in
infinite series whose individual terms are in some sense basic and well-
understood. Choice of the reference sequence of basic terms depends on context
and objectives. In the models being studied here, for instance, what happens
under change of scale is an important consideration. Professor Battle uses a
strategy called wavelet analysis to produce expansions with good rescaling
behavior. His project consists in applying this body of technique to difficult
problems in mathematical physics.
