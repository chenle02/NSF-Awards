Victor S. Batista is supported by the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational
Methods program in research that involves the development of computational
methods in dynamics and spectroscopy. These include time-sliced propagation
schemes based on dynamically adaptive coherent-state representations and
applications to studies of photochromic compounds and molecular switches
recently explored by high-resolution gas-phase and solution spectroscopy. The
projects involve interdisciplinary collaborations with E.T.J. Nibbering (Max-
Born Institut) and E.C.Y. Yan (Yale University) in a joint experimental and
theoretical effort to characterize the nature of ultrafast photo-transduction
mechanisms at the detailed molecular level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed
studies of photochromic compounds are particularly relevant to new technologies,
including optical data storage, optically controlled molecular switching,
molecular electronic logic gates, and molecular nanotechnology, including
molecular motors, molecular sensors and receptors. The research program is
integrated with the continued development of Wikidchem, established by the PI
and co-workers to facilitate the dissemination of new pedagogical approaches,
research findings, and software developments on the World Wide Web, as well as
with the Science, Technology and Research Scholars (STARS) program to foster the
participation of underrepresented minority students in the sciences.
