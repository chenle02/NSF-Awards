A three week laboratory course on gene manipulation for 16 undergraduate faculty
is being offered during the summer of 1991 and the summer of 1992. The workshop
is designed to impart up- to-date techniques currently used by molecular
biologists. The experiments involve the cloning of two bacterial genes in order
to show the mechanics of gene analysis, manipulation and sequencing. The content
is based on an advanced undergraduate laboratory course that has been taught for
nine years at the University of Minnesota. Modifications are incorporated to
provide instructors with the background to teach these techniques in their
undergraduate laboratory classes at their home institutions. Major sites for
recruitment of participants in this course are colleges and universities where a
majority of the student body consists of women or members of racial and ethnic
groups under-represented in science. //
