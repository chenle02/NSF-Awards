The analytical component of the geology program at Dickinson College is being
enhanced significantly through the acquisition of an Energy Dispersive X-ray
Fluorescence Spectrophotometer and the upgrading of an X-ray Diffraction System.
With these instruments, which complement analytical instruments already on hand,
student research projects are being conducted at three interrelated levels: 1)
Introductory required courses (Mineralogy, Petrology, etc.), 2) Intermediate
elective courses (Geochemistry, Economic Geology, etc.), and 3) Independent
Study and Research. Each level acts as a basis for the next by incorporating the
theory, operation and limitations of instrumental methods into a series of
increasingly complex geologic problems.
