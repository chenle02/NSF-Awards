This RTG is directed by four PIs in Combinatorics at the University of
Minnesota: Gregg Musiker, Pavlo Pylyavskyy, Victor Reiner, and Dennis Stanton.
It is fueled by the strongly held conviction of the PIs that young
mathematicians in combinatorics need exposure to a wide array of mathematics,
including traditional as well more recent topics, such as cluster algebras,
total positivity, and tropical geometry. Combinatorics is extremely well-suited
for training young researchers partly because its topics and problems range from
those which are elementary and can be introduced to undergraduates to those
which are highly non-elementary and have deep connections to representation
theory, algebraic geometry, topology, and mathematical physics. A cornerstone of
the RTG is a reorganization of the group?s successful REU program, with the
goals of greater efficiency and educating a broader audience, by thoroughly
involving grad students and postdocs. In addition, the funding will allow for a
larger postdoc program, as well as opportunities for postdocs to teach new
course offerings in hot topics, and to teach talented high school students in
the University of Minnesota Talented Youth Math Program. It will fund more
travel to conferences for grad students and postdocs so that they can keep
abreast of developments and disseminate their own research, and it will give
them organizational experience via the hosting of two kinds of conferences: a
series of Midwest Combinatorics Conferences, and a repeat-hosting of the annual
Grad Student Combinatorics Conference which originated in Minnesota in 2005.

The RTG leverages both the long-term mentoring experience and fresh perspectives
among its PIs to create a vertically well-integrated training environment in
combinatorics at the University of Minnesota. It builds on the previous success
in summer training of undergraduates in research, by exposing graduate students
and postdocs to research problems in parallel with the undergraduates, while
involving them in the mentoring process. In addition, it will offer wider
educational opportunities and experiences for postdocs, as well as more
opportunities for both graduate students and postdocs to travel extensively to
conferences, and learn to organize conferences themselves. The RTG expands
outreach to Minnesota's regional neighbor institutions, through a series of
Midwest conferences, outreach talks to schools in the greater Minnesota area,
including the Summer Math Program for Women run at Carleton College, and through
the University of Minnesota's Talented Youth Math Program for advanced high
school students.
