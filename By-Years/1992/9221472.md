The so-called rusts are an important group of obligately parasitic plant
pathogenic fungi. Wheat rusts are probably the best known because of their
serious effects on crop yields. Although host plant specificity is a hallmark of
the rusts, little is known about the evolutionary patterns of host tracking and
host shifting. This lack of understanding is caused by our rudimentary knowledge
of the evolutionary relationships, or phylogeny, of the rusts, both among the
rust species and genera and with related basidiomycetes. Dr. Thomas Bruns of the
University of California- Berkeley will use molecular genomic techniques to
investigate evolutionary relationships at several taxonomic levels among the
rust fungi. At the broadest level, DNA nucleotide sequences of the ribosomal
genes will be analyzed and mutational differences will be compared among the
major groups of rusts and their putative fungal relatives. At lower taxonomic
levels, evolutionary relationships among species of two genera, Cronartium and
Melampsora, that are important pathogens on pine trees will be investigated by
DNA sequencing methods. Patterns of relationship among the rust fungi will be
compared with patterns of relationship among pine species to detect lineages
where hostplant shifts have occurred. Results from this work should provide a
better understanding of host tracking and host shifting in obligate plant
pathogens, and will also develop the database and methodology needed to
facilitate rapid identification of species within the two selected genera.
