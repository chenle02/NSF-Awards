CBET-0800984, Pepper&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides partial support
for the 4th International Symposium on Advances in Computational Heat Transfer,
which will be held in Marrakech, Morocco, on May 11-16, 2008. The purpose of
this meeting is to bring together a strong, international group of researchers
in the field of computational heat transfer to discuss the current state-of-the-
art in thermofluids computing, and to help identify emerging trends.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With respect to the intellectual merit of the conference,
a broadly interdisciplinary assembly of researchers is anticipated, representing
disciplines such as mechanical engineering, chemical engineering, mathematics,
physics, atmospheric and oceanographic sciences, and computer science. Given the
ubiquity of thermal processes, and the necessity of computational simulation to
achieve new research advances, the stimulus provided by bringing together a
diverse group of computational researchers remains extremely
important.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the conference include
allowing a number of junior researchers, as well as some from underrepresented
groups, to attend the meeting and to interact with their peers. The conference
has already attracted a number of co-sponsors, which indicates a broader impact
beyond what can be provided by direct NSF support. All papers presented at the
meeting will be available on a website, and selected papers will appear in a
special issue of a new journal on Computational Thermal
Sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
