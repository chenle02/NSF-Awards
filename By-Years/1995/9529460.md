State University Robust Purposive Vision Lab A Robust Purposive Vision
Laboratory using high performance image processing and imaging equipment is
established within the Electrical Engineering and the Computer Science and
Engineering Departments at the Pennsylvania State University. This laboratory
supports research towards the development of both theoretical tools and specific
algorithms for robust vision systems. Despite their potential to reduce costs
and increase flexibility and safety, vision systems are not common in industrial
environments. This can be traced to the inability of many algorithms to handle
uncertainty. The main contribution of our on-- going and proposed research is to
develop robust purposive vision methods, by combining functional and physics
based computer vision with newly developed multiobjective robust control and
filtering techniques. We expect that this combination will result in robust
systems that can be successfully moved from a controlled university environment
into the "real world". In particular, these results will be applied to reverse
engineering, target tracking and motion detection.
