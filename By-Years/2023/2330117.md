The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development of a cooling device to improve recovery after intracerebral
hemorrhage (ICH). ICH is a devastating disease that occurs spontaneously or
because of a wide range of pathologies and afflicts approximately 70,000
individuals per year in the US alone. Mechanical stress and destruction of
cerebral tissue due to hematoma formation rapidly follows the hemorrhagic event
and is associated with swelling of the neuronal tissue surrounding the site of
injury. Studies on the therapeutic role of hypothermia after cardiac arrest and
hypoxic brain events suggest a promising role in patients diagnosed with ICH.
Unfortunately, currently available methods for decreasing temperature cannot
provide a localized, sustained, and rapid cooling effect and have undesirable
side effects such as pneumonia and septicemia. The proposed technology may
overcome these limitations and provide an effective treatment and improve
recovery for ICH patients.

This I-Corps project is based on the development of a focal cooling device to
treat intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). The proposed device is placed within the
evacuation cavity following minimally invasive endoscopic ICH evacuation. The
device may be placed and initiated during surgery, can remain operative for
weeks, and can be removed without the need for additional surgery. The proposed
approach is fundamentally different from current and traditional therapeutic
hypothermia strategies that focus on systemic cooling by creating a device and
deployment method that limits the area of temperature modulation to the area of
injury and the immediate vicinity. The proposed device maximizes the
neuroprotective properties of hypothermia via temperature reduction in the
perihematomal region and may limit the complications associated with systemic
hypothermia including shivering, coagulopathy, and infection.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
