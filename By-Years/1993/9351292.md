We are creating a new and innovative undergraduate laboratory in high-energy
physics, based on a study of catastrophic energy loss by muons which was done at
Fermilab and published this year in Physical Review D. In the Fermilab
experiment, the energy deposition spectrum of cosmic rays was studied using an
iron/scintillator calorimeter. The undergraduate laboratory version is being
constructed of lead and scintillator. Although typical cosmic-ray muons deposit
very little energy, one in 10,000 muons undergo a catastrophic energy loss and
create a high-energy electromagnetic shower within the detector. Students not
only study the electromagnetic showers themselves but also use the highest
energy showers to estimate the cosmic ray spectrum. The apparatus is small
enough to fit on a lab bench, yet exposes the student to state-of-the-art
techniques for calorimetry and data acquisition which are used in present-day
particle-physics experiments.
