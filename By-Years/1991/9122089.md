This research would study the implications of learning-by-doing in production
for theoretical models of industrial organization. The most common technological
specification of learning-by-doing is the learning curve hypothesis that a
firm's unit cost declines with cumulative output. A first research task is to
study the strategic implications of the learning curve in a dynamic model of
duopoly. The methodology is to characterize a symmetric Markov perfect
equilibrium and evaluate its properties. A second task is to derive implications
for antitrust, trade, and patent policies. A third task is to reconsider the
foundations of the learning curve hypothesis, studying industrial organization
implications of other, more general, learning-by-doing technologies. A final
task is to extend these models to investigate the equilibrium timing of
production and deliveries when buyers as well as firms behave strategically.
This research departs from previous industrial organization research in several
respects: (1) the theoretical model is new; (2) the analytical methods are
different; and (3) new questions are raised. A longer term goal is to lay
foundations for empirical work.
