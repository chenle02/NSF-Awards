This award, funded by the Office of International Science and Engineering, the
Division of Environmental Biology's Biotic Surveys &amp; Inventories Program,
and the Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems Program, supports
preliminary research to study the dynamics of climate and land-use change in the
tropical Andes region in Peru and Bolivia in collaboration with teams of
researchers from the Universidad Nacional San Antonio Abad el Cusco, Universidad
Nacional Agraria, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, Herbario Nacional de
Bolivia, Nacional Forestal Martin Cardenas, and Universidad Autonoma Gabriel
Rene Moreno.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data needed by climate, ecosystem, vegetation
researchers, and species distribution modelers will be collected and analyzed to
gain insight on how global and regional forces affect local biodiversity. It is
anticipated that this work will facilitate interaction among a variety of
research groups studying the Andes, and will provide general insight on the
unique aspects of the Andean forests, the natural processes that produce and
maintain life's diversity, and their conservation.&lt;br/&gt;
