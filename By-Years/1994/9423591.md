9423591 HOLMES This doctoral research project integrates aspects of population
biology and behavioral ecology to examine the patterns and mechanisms of habitat
distribution and their population consequences of a Neotropical avian migrant
(Setophaga ruticilla) on its wintering grounds. Preliminary data suggest that
females are found in distinct and perhaps less preferable habitats, where they
experience significantly lower overwinter persistence (survival) and lose more
weight over winter than do males in more suitable habitat. The specific
objectives of this research are to test whether social dominance is the
mechanism producing this pattern of habitat occupancy, and to determine if there
are consequences to physiological condition and survival. Results of this
research will contribute to understanding the population biology of Neotropical
migrant birds, the possible causes of their declining abundances, and
furthermore, is essential to the development of sound conservation strategies.
