Under this project, the principal investigator (PI) will develop the
combinatorics for geometric spaces (manifolds and smooth stacks) with Lie group
actions and, in a complimentary program, explore how the combinatorics constrain
the geometric objects and their classification. The focus is on Schubert
calculus in a generalized setting, and 'stacky' objects with torus actions. The
PI will also use geometry and inferential statistics on graphs to try to derive
neuronal classification through connectivity. The overarching theme is to bring
powerful geometric tools and algebraic invariants to bear on geometrically
motivated combinatorial and graph theoretic questions, and to allow the
combinatorics to inform the geometric structures. The project also supports the
PI's efforts to increase statistical literacy and public education through her
work with journalists and the public on basic statistical and scientific
reasoning. This project promotes the mutual beneficial relationship between
geometry and combinatorics, or the theory of counting; an excellent example is
describing how to count intersections of certain geometric spaces. Geometric
spaces with a lot of symmetry can be described using methods developed in
combinatorics, and these descriptions can in turn shed light on the geometry.
Similarly, geometric spaces motivate the exploration of specific aspects of
combinatorics. The project promotes the use of geometric and statistical
techniques to study an important question in neuroscience: how our brains are
organized from a graph-theoretic point of view. Finally, the project supports
the PI as Director of Research at STATS (Statistical Assessment Service,
www.stats.org), where she works with journalists on how to present mathematical
and statistical ideas to the public in an informative and honest way. These
efforts impact how public policy and legislation is formed; they encourages the
public to become more educated regarding mathematics and quantitative reasoning
concepts, even basic ones such as the difference between correlation and
causation; and they show the public that mathematics and academia have an
important impact on society.
