A group of seven investigators will purchase a microdensitometer which will be
incorporated in the Electron Microscopy and Image Processing Core Laboratory in
the Cummings Life Science Center of the University of Chicago. The densitometer
will be used in studies of the structure of sickle cell hemoglobin fibers, the
structure of Dictoyostelium discoideum membrane, DNA protein complexes, the
structure and mechanism of action of heat shock proteins, the structure of
lipoproteins and the structure of secretory granules in Tetrahymena.
