information, the mechanics of the body and the environment in which it is
embedded constitute a world of forces. Work on the mechanics of the body and on
the nervous system is rarely undertaken in a joint fashion, in part because of
the difficulty of comparing these quantities. A theoretical umbrella under which
neural information acquisition can be related to mechanics is currently lacking;
there is no science of infomechanics. This project will use the model system of
weakly electric fish to push forward an understanding of the linkages between
obtaining sensory information and movement mechanics. It has recently been shown
that, unlike most forward-biased animals which sense objects ahead better than
in other directions, electric fish are able to sense in all directions.
Complementing this unique sensory capacity is a motor system which allows them
reach locations all around the body quickly. The very high degree of coupling
between sensation and movement in these animals makes them ideal for elucidating
the principles connecting mechanics to sensory processing. The kinematics and
dynamics of this unique motor system will be studied through use of a highly
stereotyped refuge-tracking behavior and work on an advanced electric fish
robot. The neural basis of sensory-guided movement will be examined through a
study of the encoding of locomotor signals in the brain. Finally, a robotic
model of a closed-loop sensory tracking behavior present in fish will be used to
test hypotheses of how the processing of object features is connected with
movement control. This work will result in the training of one postdoctoral
associate and several graduate students in interdisciplinary research spanning
behavior, neurobiology, robotics, and fluid dynamics.
