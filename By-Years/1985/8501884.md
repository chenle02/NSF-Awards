The qualitative properties of complex dynamical systems are investigated. Such
systems could be mathematically represented by large interconnected systems of
differential equations, integral equations, partial differential equations, or a
combination of these types of equations. The work will investigate the existence
and stability of oscillations, the stability of the equilibria, and the input-
output properties of such systems. These topics are clearly of great importance
in theoretical studies and in application to specific technological problems.
The methods will involve functional analysis techniques, transformations,
results from the theory of integral manifolds, comparison theory for
differential and integral equations and the theory of resolvent operators for
integral equations. It is expected that the results of this research will
provide new methods to investigate oscillatory behavior of complex feedback
systems. They will also provide new methods of analyzing stability properties of
feedback control systems for large and complex dynamical systems.
