The Division of Chemistry supports Charina Choi of Stanford University as an
American Competitiveness in Chemistry Fellow. Dr. Choi will work on the
synthesis, chemical modification, and study of graphene nanoribbons. The PI will
collaborate with scientists at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The
ultimate goal of this research is to develop a better understanding of the
electronic properties of graphene nanoribbons, which will help lead to their
incorporation into new devices. For her plan for broadening participation, Dr.
Choi will develop an annual conference for high school students and teachers
from economically-disadvantaged areas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research like that
of Dr. Choi is aimed at developing a better understanding of the electronic
properties of nanoscale ribbons of graphene - an exciting new carbon-based
nanomaterial. This is an area of research which shows promise to lead to new
kinds of electronic devices, sensors, etc. The efforts at broadening
participation being pursued by Dr. Choi are aimed at educating and empowering
young people from groups underrepresented in the sciences.
