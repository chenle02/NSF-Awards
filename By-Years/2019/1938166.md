The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to provide a
new means for how educational content is delivered in virtual reality (VR) with
consistent impact, independent of demographics and environment. This technology
offers a higher level of personalized learning that can be administered without
requiring accompanying professional development for teachers due to the delivery
of lessons in a highly controlled virtual environment. Removing this dependence
on additional training facilitates the adoption across schools with limited
resources. The increased efficacy in learning and retention of material through
VR has made it a technology of interest for teachers and school administrators.
This technology can be used across a range of educational subjects, and with the
immersive personalized learning experience, offers a high-quality learning
solution for educators.

This I-Corps project uses biofeedback to personalize learning in virtual reality
(VR). The technology manipulates a user's environment based on their
physiological reactions. This can include the surrounding physical objects,
light source, or landscape. The auditory manipulation is a more indirect change
where the audio path of a lesson is based on the emotional reaction of a user,
such as when someone is distracted or agitated. This emotional reaction is based
on tracking numerous physiological inputs over time. The identification process
is based on existing research using the same physiological measures to classify
users' emotional states and improved through this project This level of
adaptation enables a higher degree of VR program customization and more a
meaningful learning experience while using the technology.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
