This proposal focusses on theoretical and experimental investigations on
tetrahedrally co-ordinated II-VI semiconductors (including diluted magnetic
semiconductors: DMS's) and their heterostructures as well as II-VI/III-V and
III-V heterostructures, the heterostructures being grown by molecular beam
epitaxy (MBE). The investigations will address fundamental issues such as the
nature of the ground and excited states of the transition metal (magnetic) ions
in the tetrahedral environment of the II-VI semiconductors; the spin-spin
exchange interaction between the magnetic ions and the band electrons; long
range order; and electronic states of donors and acceptors. The new physics
associated with MBE-grown quantum well structures will be studied in the context
of the reduced dimensionality, interfaces, band off-sets and elastic strains.
Raman, Brillouin, infrared and modulation spectroscopy will be exploited to
discover and delineate the collective and localized excitations, with and
without external perturbation (stress and magnetic). Theoretical investigations
in parallel will provide motivation and framework for special lines of
investigation and analysis of experimental results.
