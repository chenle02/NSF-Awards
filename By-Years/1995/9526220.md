Abstract EEC-9526220 Magee The New Jersey Institute of Technology's (NJIT)
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Hazardous Waste
Management is a multi-university Center involving NJIT, Rutgers University,
Stevens Institute of Technology, Princeton University and the University
Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey. The Center meets the criteria for the
I/UCRC Program. This award provides funding for a project in the Center studying
the control of airborne toxic metals produced during hazardous waste combustion.
The continuous emission monitor (CEM) being studied is based upon photo-fragment
fluorescence indicating the multiple metal concentrations in the exhaust stream
in real time. An instrument prototype will be tested at a pilot-scale
incinerator. Additional funding is provided to cover the additional
administrative costs associated in collaborating four universities with New
Jersey Institute of Technology.
