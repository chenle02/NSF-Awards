This award will support student travel to the seventh Midwest Verification Day
(MVD), to be held at Iowa State University on October 21-22, 2016. MVD is an
informal regional workshop with the goal of cultivating a regional research
network in verification and formal methods. The funds will help support U.S.
based students, focusing on Ph.D. students at an advanced stage in their program
and students who would otherwise not be able to attend MVD. The broader impacts
include training the next generation of researchers in this important research
area. Higher priority will be assigned to students giving presentations and a
strong emphasis will be put on supporting students from underrepresented groups.
