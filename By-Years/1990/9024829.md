The School of Oceanography of the University of Washington will acquire a sea-
going data management system and items of oceanographic instrumentation to be
placed in a pool of shared use equipment. This equipment is maintained for use
on or in association with the research vessels operated by the University. The
University will take delivery of its new research vessel THOMAS THOMPSON during
1991 and this instrumentation will provide some of the basic scientific
capability necessary to support NSF-sponsored research projects. The
instrumentation will also increase the capabilities of the institution to
support research and engineering activities. The instrumentation includes:
-DECstation 5000 computer system and components for real-time acquisition,
management, analysis, and display of large environmental and geophysical data
sets, -Climate control room outfitting to better assure data quality from
samples collected at sea, -CTD sensors, pressure gauges, and other enhancements
for obtaining detailed profiles of seawater conductivity and temperature as a
function of depth, -Scintillation counter for measurements of radio-isotope
tracers and other chemical parameters, -fume hood for removing chemical fumes
from the ship's laboratory -XBT system for obtaining temperature profiles in the
ocean without having to stop the ship, and -Replacement autoclaves for
sterilizing glassware and other tools and for preparing chemical reagents used
in experiments. These will be for use ashore by all members of the School of
Oceanography. The University of Washington is cost sharing in the acquisition of
this equipment. The instrumentation described above will increase the capability
of the University to support NSF-sponsored research and engineering projects.
