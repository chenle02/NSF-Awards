This is a cooperative agreement between the Division of Mathematical Sciences
and the American Mathematical Society for the purpose of producing rank ordered
lists of qualified applicants for the NSF Postdoctral Fellowships in the
mathematical sciences. The American Mathematical Society will receive and
organize the applications, convene a panel of distinguished mathematicians
representing the American Mathematical Society, the Society for Industrial and
Applied Mathematics, and the Institute of Mathematical Statistics, evaluate the
applications and recommend a rank ordering of applicants to the Division of
Mathematical Sciences of NSF. The American Mathematical Society is a nonprofit
organization dedicated to the support of mathematical research and scholarship.
It is critical to that Society and to NSF that there be a continuing influx of
young mathematicians possessing the advanced training and talent needed to keep
the profession strong. NSF's Postdoctral Research Fellowship program helps
provide this manpower and serves to focus attention on this need throughout the
broad mathematical community.
