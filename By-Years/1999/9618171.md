`Worldviews, Ethnicity, and Risk Perception ` PI proposes a study of the
differences in risk perception among individuals from different ethnic/cultural
backgrounds who hold different `worldviews.` The study will use Dake's measure
of worldview, self-identification of ethnicity, and Holtgrave and Weber's SCER
(Simplified Conjoint Expected Risk) model of risk perception. The basic idea is
to use the model to find the locus of ethnic and worldview differences in risk
perception. The research plan is to use four ethnic groups (Taiwanese,African-
American, Hispanic of Mexican origin, and European-American), and to obtain
equal numbers in each ethnic group who most strongly endorse each of three
worldviews (authoritarian, egalitarian, and individualistic). Subjects will fill
out a risk questionnaire involving financial and health risks. Some of the risks
to be judged involve genetic testing, an area of expertise for the PI. There
will be two versions of the risk questionnaire: (a) subjects will rate all the
theoretical variables for the SCER model for each risk, or (b) subjects will be
given values for all the SCER variables for each risk in the form of lotteries.
The goal is to determine whether agreement between overall risk rating and the
model variables is inflated by the procedure of rating the model variables.
