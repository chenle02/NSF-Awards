Molecular Taxonomy of the Fungus, Penicillium: This award recommendation is made
under the U.S.-Industrialized Countries Program for the Exchange of Scientists
and Engineers, 1987/1988 Competition. The program is designed to enable U.S.
scientists and engineers to conduct long-term research at research institutions
in the industrialized countries of Western Europe as well as Japan, Australia,
and New Zealand. Exchange awards provide opportunities for the conduct of joint
research and the utilization of unique or complementary facilities, expertise
and experimental conditions in foreign countries. Awards are selected on the
basis of scientific criteria relevant to his/her field of science, the
prospective potential of the applicants for professional growth, as well as
criteria relevant to the furthering of international cooperation in science and
engineering. The program is particularly directed to scientists and engineers
who are embarking on their research careers. This research project will address
questions on the taxonomy and molecular evolution of Penicillium species. The
proposer's study of four heterothallic Neuspora species employed restriction
endonuclease mapping of mtDNA. The preliminary application of this technique to
Penicillium species has shown high variability among closely related species. It
is felt that the examination of conservative regions of mtDNA and nuclear DNA by
restriction mapping and direct sequencing will contribute to answering questions
about organismal and molecular evolution in the genus Penicillium. The project
is under the direction of Dr. John W. Taylor, Department of Botany, University
of California at Berkely CA 94720, U.S.A., and Dr. John I. Pitt, Senior
Principal Research Scientist, CSIRO Food Research Laboratory, P.O. Box 52, North
Ryde, NSW 2113, Australia. This award recommendation provides funds to cover, as
appropriate, international travel, local travel abroad, stipend, dependents
allowance, if applicable, language training, if required, and a flat
administrative allowance of $250 for the U.S. home institution.
