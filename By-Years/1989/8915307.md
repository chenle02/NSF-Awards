Liver disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Renal dialysis,
which revolutionized the treatment of renal failure, does not have a successful
hepatic counterpart. The goal of this proposed research is to develop the
technology for an effective hepatodialylsis system using cultured hepatocytes to
function as a "bioartificial liver". The P.I.'s are developing a new hollow
fiber bioreactor in which hepatocytes are entrapped in a matrix gel within the
lumen of the hollow fibers. Simultaneous and continuous provision of nutrients
to the hepatocytes also occurs within the hollow fiber lumens while blood
continuously bathes the outer surface of the fibers. This design allows dialysis
of water soluble toxins -- including drugs -- and facilitates the metabolism of
others by the hepatocytes with conversion to metabolic forms that are then
removed with the luminal nutrient flow. The proposed research will develop the
engineering knowledge necessary for the design of a clinically applicable
"bioartificial" liver. The research plan consists of three phases: 1) Defining
environmental and engineering conditions which maintain optimal bioreactor
function; 2) Adapting the system to large scale using syngeneic hepatocytes; 3)
Large animal trials of the developed technology using allogeneic hepatocytes.
The research team includes individuals with engineering expertise in developing
successful bioreactor technology as well as biological expertise in hepatocyte
cultivation and function.
