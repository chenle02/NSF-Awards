9600584 Aronson Bacillus thuringiensis is unique in its ability to assemble
insecticidal protoxins into intracellular inclusions. Each toxin is specific for
insects from at least three Orders, many of which cause crop and tree damage or
are vectors for human pathogens. This research will investigate the properties
and synthesis of these protoxins, which have considerable potential as
biological control agents. Multiple plasmid protoxin genes are transcribed
primarily in post-exponential cells during sporulation. These genes are
expressed to different extents from dual promoters that are recognized by two
sporulation RNA polymerases. While related protoxin genes have virtually
identical overlapping promoters, their upstream regions differ substantially and
are therefore likely to be important in the differential expression of these
genes. A protein that binds to one of these upstream regions has been purified
from sporulating cells and identified as the E2 subunit of pyruvate
dehydrogenase. Purified E2 protein also was found to bind to a potential DNA
bending region, and to other regions containing a consensus sequence or upstream
from transcription start sites. This research will determine the origin of
soluble E2 protein in sporulating cells; that is, by dissociation from the
pyruvate dehydrogenase complex or by transcription of the E2 gene, which has
been cloned. In addition, mutagenesis of the E2 gene will be used to determine
its multiple functions in Bacillus thuringiensis and in Bacillus subtilis, a
non-protoxin synthesizing bacteria. Initial studies with Bacillus subtilis will
take advantage of its better developed genetic system to identify and
characterize phenotypic effects (including lethal mutations), before examining
the effects of mutations on protoxin synthesis in Bacillus thuringiensis. The
possibility that a key subunit of an important catabolic enzyme has the dual
functions of catalysis during growth and regulation during sporulation is novel,
and may be an importa nt mechanism for signaling the transition from growth to
post-exponential functions such as protoxin gene transcription. %%% Bacillus
