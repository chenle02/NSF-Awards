The focus of this research is the synthesis of methylene semibullvalene, a
bishomoaromatic system. The key synthetic transformation involves a rhodium-
catalyzed transannular cyclization which will be applied not only to the title
compound but to other compounds of theoretical as well as practical interest.
The scope of this reaction will also be studied. With this Research in
Undergraduate Institutions award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting
the the research of Dr. I. David Reingold of the Department of Chemistry at
Juniata College. Professor Reingold will focus his research on the synthesis of
methylene semibullvalene, a bishomoaromatic system of considerable theoretical
interest, using a transannular cyclization reaction which promises to have broad
applicability for the preparation of a variety of other interesting molecules.
