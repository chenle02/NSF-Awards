P I: Fred E. Lytle The objective of this project is to create standard reference
materials for a freshman-level chemistry course that will be accessible to blind
and visually impaired students. The reference packet" will consist of braille,
tactile diagrams, audiotactile diagrams, and a tactile model kit. Standard
procedures for producing tactile and audiotactile diagrams will be created,
refined, and disseminated to educators of visually impaired students. The
project will use the latest advances in adaptive technology for blind and
visually impaired people. Several different tactile media will be used,
including high- grade vacuum-molded plastics, the flexible tactile imaging paper
produced by Repro-Tronics, and various textured media as part of the model kit.
Hardware such as the NOMAD (TM) touch tablet and the Edmark Touch Window (TM)
will be used to display the information contained in audiotactile graphics. The
software to be used will consist of AudioCAD (R), AudioPiCS (R), AutoCAD (R),
and some custom software developed as part of the project. The project should
provide significant assistance to blind students in several areas. First, blind
students at many institutions will have access to standard reference materials
that can be used as a supplement to almost any General Chemistry course. Second,
standards for tactile and audiotactile diagrams will be developed. Third, a
document detailing the process by which these diagrams can be made will be
developed and disseminated.
