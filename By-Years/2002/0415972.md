Interactions between good genes and the environment in the gray
treefrog&lt;br/&gt;H. Carl Gerhardt&lt;br/&gt;University of
Missouri&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The evolution of mating preferences and of the
male displays favored by these preferences can occur if display traits are
correlated with genetic quality: offspring of males with attractive displays
should then inherit "good genes," resulting in the benefit of high quality
offspring for preferring females. Implicit in this scenario is the requirement
of ample genetic variation in the display trait and a genetic correlation
between the display and components of offspring fitness. How is this genetic
variation maintained, and how does the environmental variation that is
experienced by most natural populations affect the genetic relationships between
female preferences, male traits, and the quality of their
offspring?&lt;br/&gt;Using gray tree frogs as a model system, this study will
investigate the relationship between an attractive male display trait - call
duration - and offspring fitness in different environments. In particular, the
study will determine how the genetic quality of the father, assayed in terms of
call duration, and the quality of the environment together affect several
components of offspring fitness, including condition, expression of the display
trait, and allocation of resources to reproduction. This study will also examine
the genetic relationship between condition and call duration in offspring;
because condition may reflect many genes, and these genes may have different
effects in different environments, the relationship between condition and
display traits may help explain the persistence of genetic variation in male
displays. Thus, a central goal of this study is to understand how environmental
variation affects the genetic relationships between display traits and offspring
fitness and, ultimately, how genetic variation in sexually-selected traits is
maintained.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
