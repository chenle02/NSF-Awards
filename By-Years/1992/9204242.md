The goal of this study is to understand techniques that lead to efficient
parallel algorithms. The methodology is experimental, performance is measured in
terms of actual implementation. A wide range of parallel architectures are
considered. The current work is on shared memory multiprocessors, and the plan
is to expand the study to include non-shared memory machines and networks of
workstations. The application domains to be studied include combinatorial
optimization, dynamic computational geometry (with applications to molecular
dynamics simulation), rendering algorithms, and physical systems simulation.
