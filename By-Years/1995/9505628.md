9505628 Melville Evidence suggests that dissipation due to turbulence in a
shallow mixed layer in the presence of surface waves is larger than that in a
comparable solid-wall turbulent boundary layer by as much as two orders of
magnitude. In this project, the PI will develop an improved method for measuring
turbulent dissipation under breaking surface waves, using a single beam acoustic
Doppler profiler. ***
