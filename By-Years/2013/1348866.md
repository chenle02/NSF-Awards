WestEd proposes to study the Technical Education and Literacy in Schools (TEALS)
program. TEALS, a pioneering work-place intervention of the non-profit Microsoft
YouthSpark program, provides multi-year, on-the-job computer science education
professional development to high school teachers. The project will identify an
effective learning model to prepare in-service teachers to teach computer
science. To ensure the model meets workplace requirements, all research will
take place in an authentic high school learning context. In addition, the
project will synthesize existing research on computer science education,
integrate research with practice, and contribute to the development of theory
around computer science pedagogy.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project addresses a
major barrier to increasing the number of qualified K-12 computer science
teachers in the U.S. Few avenues currently exist for pre-service and in-service
teachers to train in computer science pedagogy and become certified to teach
computer science. As computer science is becoming increasingly important for
many kinds of careers, improving teaching in this area is in the national
interest.
