Heme is a cofactor, present in many compartments of the plant call. While the
plastid contains all of the enzymes requried for its own heme synthesis, the
role of other compartments, such as the mitochondrion and cytoplasm, in heme
synthesis is unknown. In this project we will determine the location of four
heme-synthetic enzymes (uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase, coproporphyrinogen
oxidase, protoporphyrinogen oxidase and ferrochelatase) within the cell and
within the organelle. Enzyme activities will be measured in chloroplasts,
mitochondria, and cytoplasmic fractions that have been carefully isolated and
assayed for integrity and contamination. We will further explore the possibility
that intact plastids have the capacity to export porphyrinogens for
mitochondrial heme synthesis. Recent findings suggest that plants treated with
protoporphyrinogen oxidase inhibitors accumulate extraplastidic
protoporphyrinogen. Experiments to discover if any of the enzymes which convert
5-aminolevulinic acid to protoporphyrinogen form a multienzyme complex within
the plastid are planned. Substrate channeling between protoporphyrinogen oxidase
and ferrochelatase will also be examined. Two of the heme and chlorophyll
synthetic enzymes that have not been well studied previously (coproporphyrinogen
oxidase and ferrochelatase) will be purified. The purified proteins will be used
to raise antibodies in rabbits for use in studies on complex formation and
localization of these enzymes.
