This proposal requests funding to design, construct and document
instrumentation to measure in situ geothermal/hydrogeological parameters in the
upper 10 meters of deep seafloor sediments. The measurements will include the
vertical geothermal gradient, vertical pore pressure gradient, and
temperature/thermal conductivity and will be taken by repeated (pogo)
penetration of a probe tethered with a standard oceanographic cable. A two-way
acoustic data link between the ship and the instrument will also be developed.
This instrumentation will support ongoing scientific research programs
investigating the hydrogeological nature of the ocean floor such as the Ocean
Drilling Program and RIDGE.
