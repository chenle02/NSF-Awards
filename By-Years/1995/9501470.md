9501470 Clark This CAREER award emphasizes research and educational activities
related to attenuating acoustic response of enclosed sound fields such as the
fuselage of an aircraft subjected to turbulent boundary layer excitations. A
coupled model of the aeroelastic, structural acoustic system is developed for
single-leaf and double-leaf partitions between compressible flow fields with a
mean velocity and an enclosed sound field. Turbulent boundary layer noise models
are used to generate the exogenous inputs to the system, and acoustic response
is controlled through structural acoustic control methods. Wind tunnel tests are
performed for model validation and alternate control strategy evaluation.
Educational programs include the development of an electromechanical control
system demonstration unit, outreach to a local science museum, design of a
course on adaptive structures, and integration of latest computer software
packages for dynamics and control in undergraduate mechanical engineering
instructions.***
