9450978 Narsavage The objective of this proposal is to incorporate
thermalgravimetric analysis into the undergraduate polymer chemistry lab and the
required undergraduate student research program at the University of Scranton.
The Chemistry Department is in the process of establishing a Polymer Chemistry
major which will require two polymer chemistry courses and a polymer chemistry
lab. Plans for the polymer lab are currently underway since the course is
scheduled to begin in the Spring of 1995. Acquisition of a Perkin-Elmer
Thermalgravimetric Analyzer TGA 7 and Thermal Analysis Controller TAC 7/DX will
expand our current thermal analysis capabilities and therefore allow our
students to gain significant and meaningful experience in the thermal analysis
of polymers. The instrument is capable of multi-ramp experiments with
heating/cooling rate ranges from 0.1 to 200 C/min in 0.1 C increments to allow
for kinetics experiments. Since the instrument operates from ambient temperature
to 1000 C, the study of gel processing of high Tc superconductors and polymers
as precursors to ceramic materials will also be possible.
