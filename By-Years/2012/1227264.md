This project will examine the long term and intergenerational impact of policies
in the 1970s and 1980s to reduce teen pregnancy. We analyze the effects of
interventions that were designed to influence the likelihood of teen pregnancy.
These interventions were adopted by various municipalities and affected women of
different ages in different locations, creating a quasi-
experiment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Previous studies have produced convincing
evidence that young women who have better control over family planning make
different career and lifelong fertility choices. However, we know little about
the potential long-term effects of these career and childbearing decisions on
the children born to these women. Identifying the short- and the long-term
effects of the social mechanisms at work - women's fertility and career
decisions and the impact on their children - is at the core of the intellectual
merit of the proposal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work uses individual-level
registry data on the health, education, and labor market outcomes of three
generations of Swedes to trace out the effect of these family planning policies
on the short-, medium-, and long-term health and socio-economic outcomes of the
affected women and their children. Swedish registry data link parents to
children across generations, allowing the PIs to compare sisters, who were
affected by the policies to those who were not, and their
children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the impact of health care policies
on women's and children's health and social well-being is important for
predicting the costs and benefits of a wide range of policies.
