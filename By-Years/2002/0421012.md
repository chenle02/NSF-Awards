With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at Southern Illinois University at Carbondale will
acquire a 400 MHz NMR Spectrometer. The research that this instrument will
support includes the synthesis and characterization of a variety of exciting new
materials including polar thin films prepared via liquid crystalline self-
assembly, new grafted polymer brushes prepared via surface initiated
polymerization, metal phosphonates containing charge-transfer complexes, solid-
state host-guest materials, soluble semi-conducting group (IV) metal backbone
polymers, novel nanowires and alkylthiolate protected gold nanoparticles.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of
the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the
structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to
characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the
dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-
art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier
research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in materials
chemistry and nanosciences. &lt;br/&gt;
