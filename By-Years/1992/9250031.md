The Secondary Science Teacher Education Program (Second STEP) at Miami
University will address the preparation of teachers who are competent and
willing to teach in diverse cultural and ethnic settings, assess the
effectiveness of individual accumulative program activities on teaching
behavior, and compare the effectiveness of an innovative program with that of
two traditional teacher education programs. The Second STEP project will develop
new undergraduate science content courses and revise education courses to
include integrated field experiences for prospective science teachers. The
program will be based on emerging research on science teaching and learning and
cultivate an established liaison with a predominantly minority school system.
The Program will foster the integration of content expertise, content-specific
pedagogy and teaching practice. A major focus will be to establish opportunities
for prospective teachers to gain early and practical experiences with diverse
(racial, ethnic, or cultural) learners. Although the Second STEP Program will
directly address undergraduate science teacher education, its activities are
also designed to impact the professional development of both science and
education faculty at Miami University as well as teachers of a major urban
school district.
