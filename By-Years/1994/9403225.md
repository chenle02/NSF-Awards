9403225 Auerbach This Small Grant for Exploratory Research will conduct a
quantitative analysis of ion channel kinetics using higher order hidden markov
models (HMM). Ion channels are proteins that regulate the electrical behavior of
cells. The investigators will use the HMM method to study these channels, and
will simulate these channels on a network of workstations, using parallel codes.
This high risk project should help determine the applicability of the use of HMM
for understanding ion channel kinetics. ***
