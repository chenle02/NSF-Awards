1126758&lt;br/&gt;Blekhman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CSULA is seeking funds to
purchase a multifunctional turn-key Agilent/Bruker Gas Chromatographer-Mass
Spectrometer (GCMS). This instrument is the only available system for the
quantitative determination of the hydrogen gas purity for CSULA Hydrogen fueling
facility. It is also a unique and robust assembly of detectors that can be used
to determine trace levels of a number of air and water constituents. Students
and faculty involved in the following four ongoing projects will utilize this
instrument extensively: 1) hydrogen purity research for fuel cell vehicles in
tandem with the hydrogen station; 2) polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the
urban environment; 3) cycling of phosphorous in the natural environment; and 4)
biofuel composition for controlled combustion. To our knowledge and according to
the manufacturer, only one other such system is available in California and that
is in Sacramento (a long distance from southern California).
