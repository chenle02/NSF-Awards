This proposal is concerned largely with novel variants of Hilbert's 11th
Problem, namely establishing local-to-global principles in unconventional
settings. Specifically, the PI will study integers represented by thin orbits, a
quintessential example being integral Apollonian gaskets. The PI proposes to
extend existing tools to many other situations, including Apollonian 3-gaskets
and Soddy sphere packings, with the long-term goal of better understanding
circumstances under which the circle method and exponential sum bounds for
multi-linear forms, applied to such thin orbits, can succeed. In situations
where even an "almost" local-global statement seems out of reach of current
technology, the PI will develop new exponential sum bounds to improve the number
of R-almost primes which can be produced from an Affine Sieve. The PI will also
develop numerical algorithms to explore the Laplace spectrum of infinite volume
hyperbolic manifolds, and strive to rigorously certify that numerically observed
eigenvalues actually correspond to true spectra.

Integrated with the proposed research projects are numerous educational and
outreach components. The PI will continue to advise high school through graduate
students, and organize seminars, meetings, and conferences. A new course at Yale
will be developed for non-math majors, with the goal of popularizing mathematics
to broader audiences, including discussions of recent research activity. The PI
will give lectures through the Office of New Haven and State Affairs, and
Science Saturdays at Yale, to the general public, specifically geared for middle
and high school students in the Pathways to Science program. This proposal will
also support the attendance of underprivileged New Haven area middle school
students to the MathCounts competition. Through such avenues, the PI will be in
a position to bring traditionally under-represented groups into contact with
cutting-edge research.

This award is cofunded by the Algebra and Number Theory and the Analysis
programs.
