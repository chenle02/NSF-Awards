The specific aims of the research are as follows: to systematically study the
growth kinetics of hybridoma cells in continuous culture and to examine the
applicability of the Monod model to the system under different growth limiting
substrates; to elucidate the functional relationship among growth, antibody
production, and rates of change of various environmental parameters. Special
attention will be given to the effect of cellular energy metabolism on these
relationships. The research also aims to examine the cause of sudden cell death
occurring in batch culture and to explore its relationship to the lower
viability at low dilution rates reported in the literature; and to apply the
kinetic information obtained from the above studies to manipulate cell growth
and production in the culture toward an optimum path. This research will advance
the understanding of the growth of hybridoma cells. The problems addressed by
this study are related to process technology. The kinetic information obtained
from this study will complement the biological studies in this field.
