Abstract Narrative This is a Minority Research Initiation (MRI) planning grant
to study the physiological properties and patterns of those neurons that exert a
strong influence on the motor control of the facial muscles. Pilot data will be
gathered during the duration of the award. Findings from this study may
contribute to our knowledge of Parkinson's disease. This project will provide
support for a well-trained minority scientist to prepare a competitive proposal
to submit to the MRI research initiation component.
