A fast and high sensitivity time-resolved spectrofluorometer is proposed to
develop into a commercial project. In contrast with the classical fluorometric
method, such as time-correlated single photon counting and phase modulation, the
novel instrument is based on the introduction of two recently developed
techniques: a) single pulse laser excitation and nanosecond waveform analyzing
by electronic imaging, and b) acoustooptical tunable filter as an electronically
controlled monochromator. The instruments have the capability of simultaneously
acquiring a complete set of decay and spectral curve sufficient for the
construction of a 3-D manifold within 1 second. The sensitivity of the
instrument can be as high as at femtomole (10-15 mole) and attomole (10-18 mole)
level. These are far beyond the capabilities of current instruments. The
instrument is compact, lightweight, low-cost, suitable for and will facilitate
wide applications of the fluoroscopic method. Phase I will demonstrate the
feasibility and Phase II will develop a prototype. The long-term goal is to use
the method to develop numerous specialized instruments for basic research as
well as for clinical and industrial applications.
