This project will combine undergraduate students with undergraduate faculty
into teams which will explore supercomputing through training and research.
Undergraduate students will learn the principles of supercomputing and, with
their faculty advisor, formulate and execute a research project. Undergraduate
faculty will have the opportunity to investigate supercomputing and to integrate
that technology and methodology into their curricula. Specifically, a four- week
Summer Short Course, "Supercomputing Tools, Methodologies and Applications",
will be given for students at Cornell University. Work on the research projects
designed by the attending teams will begin during the course and continue
throughout the subsequent academic year under the supervision of the faculty
advisor with the continuing support of the Cornell National Supercomputer
Facility (CNSF) staff. Progress will be monitored through a series of reports
and at a midyear convocation of the participants. Technical support and
supercomputer resources will provided by the CNSF. Administration will be
handled through this project's nationally-derived Steering Committee.
Instruction will be by qualified persons experienced in undergraduate education,
especially with respect to computing and numerical analysis. By taking the
unique approach of combining students and faculty to introduce the concepts and
practice of supercomputing into the undergraduate experience, this proposal
offers a special opportunity to those universities and colleges that may not
have an emphasis on research or computing in their curriculum. By encouraging
the integration of the materials provided through this program and the original
courseware developed by participating faculty into the undergraduate curriculum,
this program will stimulate the growth of undergraduate learning and interest in
the technologies of computing and applications in research. In addition to the
NSF grant, participants' institutions will provide about 15% in travel costs
toward the operation of the project.
