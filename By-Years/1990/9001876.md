This grant is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the
subfield of laser spectroscopy of liquid solid interfaces. Professor Robert Corn
will develop the theoretical and experimental description of monolayers of mixed
molecular species at metal electrode interfaces. The second harmonic generation
and sum frequency generation methods developed by Professor Corn will be
combined with infrared spectroscopic measurements of mixed monolayers of
molecular species controlled by electrochemical potential on a metal electrode.
These studies will allow fuller understanding of the role of interfacial
molecular structure on electron transfer processes which occur at these
interfaces. In addition, the methodology will allow more complete description of
other liquid solid interfaces of import in a variety of chemical and
technological processes. By combining second harmonic generation (SHG) on and
off resonance analysis and theoretical description of the response using Pople-
Pariser-Parr formalism to describe the molecular polarizability tensors, the
first measurements of molecular orientation response in SHG have been made.
Professor Corn will extend these measurements in combination with infrared
reflection absorption and sum frequency generation to fully characterize mixed
monolayers of molecular species at single crystal electrode liquid interfaces.
