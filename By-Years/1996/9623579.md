9623579 Letzter This award supports the research of Professor E. Letzter to work
in non-commutative ring theory with special emphasis on problems arising from
the theory of quantum groups. In particular, Professor Letzter will study prime
and primitive ideals in finitely generated noncomutative Noetherian bialgebras,
Hopf superalgebras, and iterated skew polynomial rings. He hopes to apply this
work to studying multiparametric quantum function algebras in the root-of-unity
case. This is research in the subfield of algebra called non-commutative ring
theory. Algebra can be thought of as the study of symmetry in the abstract. As
such, algebra has direct applications to areas of physics and chemistry. In
fact, much of non-commutative ring theory generalizes structures found in
quantum mechanics and this proposal continues to explore areas that connect
directly with modern quantum field theory.
