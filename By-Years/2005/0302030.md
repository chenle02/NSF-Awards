AST-0302030 Feldmeier, John

Dr. Feldmeier is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral
Fellowship to carry out a program of research and education at Case Western
Reserve University and the National Optical Astronomical Observatories. He will
carry out a multi-faceted campaign of observations and theoretical studies to
study intracluster stars, i.e. stars between the galaxies within galaxy
clusters. Intracluster starlight can be a valuable tool in understanding the
evolution of galaxies and galaxy clusters, but it has been difficult to detect,
and its detailed structure is still unknown. The campaign will consist of
imaging and spectroscopic observations of hundreds of intracluster planetary
nebulae in nearby galaxy clusters and groups to perform dynamical studies,
ultra-deep imaging observations to produce global measurements of the
intracluster light in more distant clusters, and theoretical analysis of high
resolution numerical simulations of galaxy clusters, designed to obtain
observable predictions. This effort will determine the fraction, distribution,
and metallicity of the intracluster starlight, and connect its properties to
cosmological models and known properties of galaxy evolution.

In addition to his research, Dr. Feldmeier will develop a career course for
astronomy undergraduate majors. This course will encourage early research and
thoughtful self directed career development. In addition, he will continue an
ongoing outreach program towards the unique population of homeschooled children.
In an effort to overcome obstacles towards promoting astronomical literacy in
this population, Dr. Feldmeier will produce a flexible web based curriculum and
educational publications. ***
