Laboratory work in computer control of integrated automated systems must address
the issues of distributed control and communication networks. The current focus
of the laboratory course in computer control is at device level. The intent of
this project to restructure the course around hierarchical control concepts. The
impact on the student is a change in perspective on computer control in
automation. With this new focus, students will demonstrate an ability to
integrate individually controlled devices into complete, automated systems.
Students will learn the basics of communications by developing communication
rules for control systems. These rules will be used to control work centers
consisting of a variety of machines such as robots and machine tools. The next
step for students is to control an entire factory floor. These advances will be
made through the acquisition of new laboratory equipment. The two main equipment
needs are a computer network and computer workstations. The network is necessary
to provide communications in the control system. Workstations will be used in
two ways: (1) to provide an interface between from the student and the system
and (2) to emulate physical devices such as machine tools, furnaces, conveyors,
and the like, which are too large and expensive for the laboratory facility.
