Granaas The University of South Dakota is the recipient of NSF funds to support
the renovation of the Human Factors Research Laboratory located in the 64-year
old South Dakota Union Building. The modernization of over 1,550 square feet
will provide students and faculty with the opportunity to conduct contemporary
research and research training within the Human Factors program. The role of
Human Factors Psychology has grown commensurately with modern society's
increasing reliance upon technology. As emerging technologies have progressively
increased the complexity of human-machine and human-system interactions, Human
Factors psychologists have been playing an increasingly important role in the
analysis, modeling, and design of systems to increase worker safety and
productivity. The program has trained 57 Ph.D.'s since its founding in 1965. The
multidisciplinary training program is research based and places heavy demands
upon the laboratory infrastructure which has become outmoded and crowded. As one
of only 24 universities nationally to establish a Ph.D.-level training program
in human factors, the laboratory renovation is important to understanding the
human-machine interaction and the development and use of future technologies.
