This award provides funding for US participation in the 39th annual Great Plains
Operator Theory Symposium that will be held May 28 to June 1, 2019 at Texas A&M
University. The conference focuses on recent developments in Operator Algebras
and Operator Theory. This symposium aims to be a conference covering broad areas
with large participation, including many young people, who are encouraged to
give talks.

A number of distinguished mathematicians have already agreed to attend and speak
at this conference. This award gives early career researchers, members of
underrepresented groups, researchers not funded by NSF and the like an
opportunity to attend and participate in this conference. The organizing
committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to target groups
through a number of different activities. More information will be made
