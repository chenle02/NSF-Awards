This three-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research in geophysics
involves the research groups of W. Roger Buck at Lamont-Doherty Earth
Observatory, Columbia University, and Alexei Poliakov at the University of
Montpellier II in Montpellier, France. The objective of their research is to
investigate three related areas in fault generation in mid-ocean ridges and
rifts: (1) general models of faulting; (2) distribution of faults in rift
environments; and (3) development and testing of models of low-angle normal
fault development. The project takes advantage of French expertise in numerical
modeling of continental extension and faulting. It will advance understanding of
the orientation and distribution of faults.
