The PI will measure late glacial through Holocene 231Pa/230Th in a depth
transect of cores on the Blake Ridge in the western North Atlantic, with the
objective of understanding the mechanisms that control these radioisotopes and
their relationship to sediment flux and deposition. The PI argues that this
would allow a better use of the Pa-Th method to evaluate the changes in the
Atlantic Meridional Overturn Circulation between glacial times and the present.
Currently the data relevant to this problem are scattered and thus difficult to
interpret. Broader impacts: In addition to promoting better understanding of
climate and ocean circulation systems the project will also support teaching,
training and learning. A strong outreach element is also a part of the project.
