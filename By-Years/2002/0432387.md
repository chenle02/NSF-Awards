The Measurement and Control Engineering Center is an interdisciplinary research
and educational Center directed toward the development of new sensors and
control systems. These technologies are critical to the modernization and
continued competitiveness of US manufacturing industries, including chemicals,
petrochemicals, and pharmaceuticals, inter alia. This action provides continued
funding for a multi-site Center with the lead site at the University of
Tennessee and an affiliate program in a critical needs industrial area (advanced
control, including modeling and simulation) at the Oklahoma State University.
