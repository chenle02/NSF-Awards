This project will continue an ongoing measurement program at Mauna Loa
Observatory (MLO) to collect and analyze aerosol filter samples for non-seasalt
sulfate (NSS), nitrate, sodium, ammonium, and nitric acid. The decade-long free
tropospheric observations of aerosol concentrations at MLO provide a basis for
comparison with chemical transport models from the Asia-Pacific region and for
use in global climate models.
