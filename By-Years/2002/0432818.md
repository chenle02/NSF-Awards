The Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Computational Materials
Design jointly proposed by Penn State and Georgia Tech, aims to substantially
impact progress towards systems-based materials design by promoting research
programs of interest to both industry and universities, to enhance the
infrastructure of computational materials research in the nation, to explore and
extend the interface between engineering systems design, information technology
and physics-based simulation of process-structure and structure-property
relations of materials, to improve the intellectual capacity of the workforce
through industrial participation and conduct of high quality research projects,
and to develop curriculum in computational and systems design aspects of
materials. This will be achieved by developing long-term partnerships among
industry, university and other organizations. &lt;br/&gt;
