Shape is an important cue in rcognizing objects in pictures. Shape is, however,
difficult to describe and use in computer programs for object recognition,
because objects appear different in images taken from different viewpoints. This
effect is particularly pronounced for curved three-dimensional objects. Recent
work has shown that, for some surfaces, it is possible to compute descriptions
that draw only on information from a single picture, and are the same for every
possible view of a given surface. These invariant descriptors instantly identify
an object, up to a known ambiguity. This research investigates advance systems
for object recognition that use a combination of invariant descriptors and color
information to recognize curved three- dimensional objects, drawn from a large
number of known examples, in pictures taken from an unknown viewing position.//
