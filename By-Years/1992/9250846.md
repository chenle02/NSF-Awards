Undergraduate students in the Electronics Engineering Technology program at St.
Petersburg Junior College have now the opportunity of being active learners in
three required laboratory courses. Newly acquired digital storage oscilloscopes
and logic analyzers enable the students to perform a series of hands-on
experiments to master the principles and practices associated with use of modern
equipment to increase the accuracy and resolution in electronic measurements.
Three required laboratory courses in digital circuits, electronic
instrumentation, and automatic control, are being revised to accommodate the new
equipment and learning opportunities. Additionally, a state-of-the-art
laboratory course devoted to Advanced Electronic Instrumentation is being
developed and utilizes the new equipment. The laboratory experiments conducted
in these laboratories help students increase their problem-solving skills
related to advanced measurement techniques necessary for accuracy, resolution,
and storage for the analog-to-digital conversion circuits and microprocessor-
based technology.
