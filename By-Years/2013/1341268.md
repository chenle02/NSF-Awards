The International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) is the permier
conference in Machine Learning. ICML encompasses topics on all facets of Machine
Learning, and solicits papers on problem areas, research topics, learning
paradigms, and approaches to evaluation. In addition to rigorously refereed
conference papers, it features poster sessions, tutorials, workshops and invited
talks. This award provides funds for travel scholarships for students from US
institutions to help cover their travel and costs of attending the conference.
The selection of students to be funded is based on a review by the selection
committee of their financial needs and alignment of research areas. The student
scholarships are very important for encouraging student participation in this
premier conference and for shaping the future of the field as a whole. Special
attention will be paid to broadening the participation of students from groups
that are traditionally underrepresented in Computer Science in general and
Machine Learning research in particular and students from institutions with
limited Machine Learning expertise who would benefit from the opportunity to
interact with researchers from around the world.

Attendance at the ICML represents a unique opportunity for students interested
in Machine Learning research. The poster sessions at the conference are designed
enable students to recieve feedback from leading Machine Learning researchers
from around the world and to help them become part of the larger Machine
Learning research community. The award contributes to the education and training
of the next generation of researchers and educators in an increasingly important
area. It also helps broaden the participation of underrepresented groups and
women in Machine Learning research.
