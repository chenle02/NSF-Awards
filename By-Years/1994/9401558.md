9401558 Shatah This award supports mathematical research on partial differential
equations which arise in studies of classical fields. The work involves studies
of hyperbolic Yang-Mils equations and wave maps. It is planned to address
fundamental questions on existence, uniqueness and formation of singularities
for these models. Also considered will be models defined on the n-sphere where
efforts will be made to show that, at least in the one-dimensional case,
unstable stationary solutions possess homoclinic orbits. Analysis of the
asymptotic behavior of solutions to perturbed wave equations and nonlinear
lattices will also be carried out. Decay estimates for solutions of the wave
equation on the Schwarzschild metric where there is a trapped sphere and decay
rates for the discrete wave equation will be developed. This results will be
used to study the dynamics of nonlinear multi-dimensional lattices, specifically
the phenomenon of resonance. Partial differential equations form a basis for
mathematical modeling of the physical world. The role of mathematical analysis
is not so much to create the equations as it is to provide qualitative and
quantitative information about the solutions. This may include answers to
questions about uniqueness, smoothness and growth. In addition, analysis often
develops methods for approximation of solutions and estimates on the accuracy of
these approximations. ***
