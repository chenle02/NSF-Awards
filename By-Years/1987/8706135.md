This project investigates the morphology and evolutionary relationships of the
members of the third order of the Amphibia--the Gymnophiona. Descriptive,
morphometric, developmental, and functional morphological data on bones,
muscles, nerves, skin structures, and other anatomical components will be
gathered to better understand the biology of this relatively rare tropical
group. This will provide data so that more robust analyses of the evolutionary
relationships of the species, genera, and families of the group, and their
relationship to other vertebrates, can be made; the study may provide new
insight into pattern and process of evolution.
