9508040 SAMMIS This research is to test a theory of the process leading to
earthquake failure in which a power law time-to-failure equation can be derived
from renormalization group theory where the mainshock is viewed as a critical
point. There is some evidence that the earthquake preparation process involves
the collective behavior of a spatially extended regional fault network. For
example, many large earthquakes are preceded by an increase in the number of
intermediate sized events within a large region surrounding the main shock. The
advantage of the renormalization group theory treatment is that the first order
correction to scaling can be derived which takes the form of a periodic function
of the logarithm of the time to failure, and which modulates a power law
increase in pre-event seismicity. This log-periodic correction is evident in the
regional seismicity data which preceded the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. The
analysis will continue with the Loma Prieta data and be extended to other
California sites and the Aleutian Islands. This research is a component of the
National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program. ***
