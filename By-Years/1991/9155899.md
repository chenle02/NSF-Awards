This project between the College of Education and the College of Engineering
develops models and examples that incorporate new science and engineering
materials for use in preparation of future teachers of K-12 science. The
materials which are developed are drawn from recent research in the area of
Bioengineering which focuses on such topics as : rehabilitation engineering ,
bioacoustics, biomaterials computational neurosciences, bioinstrumentation and
medical imaging. The materials which are developed are used in courses in
science teaching in the College of Education and are also integrated into the
introductory Bioengineering course in the College of Engineering. The materials
are also considered for adaptation to a form appropriate for direct use by
students in the K-12 curriculum.
