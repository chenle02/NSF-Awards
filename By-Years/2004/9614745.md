ABSTRACT EEC-9614745 GRAY Since its inception as a formal program, one of the
unique characteristics of the NSF IUCRC Program has been its commitment to a
systematic and objective evaluation effort. As it has evolved over the years,
the evaluation effort relies heavily on standardized collection of data by
independent on-site evaluators at every IUCRC Center. The purpose of this
proposal is to both support these evaluation activities and provide NSF with
program-wide analyses of processes and outcomes. An evaluation system built upon
a national network of local evaluators requires a considerable amount of support
and coordination. Although the support and coordination provided by NSF staff
and the "evaluators coordinating committee" are essential to the program's
success, these mechanisms have not been adequate to meet the needs of the
program. At the current time, the IUCRC network of evaluators involves over 34
individuals representing over 55 Centers and approximately 75 institutions. This
proposal has two primary objectives: to support and coordinate the actives of
the national network of the I/UCRC evaluators; to provide NSF with program-wide
analyses based on data collected through the evaluation.
