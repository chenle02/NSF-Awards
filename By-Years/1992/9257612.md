The research encompasses hot structure analysis and mechanics of composite
materials. Under hot structure analysis, failure theories will be developed for
materials and structures subjected to severe thermo-mechanical loadings
including the effects of thermal shock, chemical changes and phase
transformations. Undercomposite mechanics, smart materials will be considered
including their behavior, processing and applications.
