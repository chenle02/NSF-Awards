This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will investigate the
problem of generating intelligent behavior in complex settings. The need for
generating such behavior is evidenced in many areas, including game playing,
business operations, and military engagements. The objective of the research is
to identify suitable means for a self-adaptive system to explore alternative
possible allocations of resources and to learn how to respond to stimuli with
only minimal human intervention. The research will focus on the combination of
evolutionary computation and neural networks, and, in particular, will include
object networks that examine subsections of a scene and are combined to render a
decision regarding the appropriate course of action. The anticipated results
include the identification of appropriate methods for evolving these complex
object neural networks, as well as the suitability of the results for direct
application in commercial markets, particularly in the area of software
entertainment&lt;br/&gt; The possible commercial applications include strategic
assessment of dynamic combat environments, optimization of business operations
in supply-chain management and logistics, and the development of intelligent
opponents in video games. Natural Selection, Inc plans to focus on video game
products as the most direct method for bringing the research to a commercial
application with significant impact.&lt;br/&gt;
