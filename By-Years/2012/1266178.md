This proposal is for partial funding for the Fourth Conference on Computational
and Mathematical Population Dynamics (CMPD4), to be held in Taiyuan, China, May
29 - June 2, 2013. The conference will highlight significant recent developments
in these areas and provide a forum for the participants to meet and communicate
their recent work. One of the aims of the conference is to broaden the education
and stimulate the research of young and under-represented researchers, the funds
will principally support young unsupported researchers (graduate students,
postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty), NSF funding will be vital in
achieving this goal.

The Conference on Computational and Mathematical Population Dynamics (CMPD4),
Taiyuan, China, May 29 - June 2, 2013, is the fourth joint meeting of the
Conference on Mathematical Population Dynamics and the Conference on
Deterministic and Stochastic Models for Biological Interactions, with over a
25-year history of international meetings. The goal of this international
conference is to bring together leading researchers from different fields
(applied mathematics, biology, computer science, ecology, epidemiology,
medicine, etc.) to communicate with each other about their current work on
computational and mathematical population dynamics. The conference will provide
a unique opportunity for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to interact
with leading researchers in these areas. The funding requested from NSF will be
used completely to support U.S. participants, including graduate students,
minorities, women and recent doctoral students in an effort to provide young
researchers and under-represented groups exposure to current research topics and
techniques in the interdisciplinary area of computational and mathematical
population dynamics. Also, the work that will be presented at the conference
will help us to study challenging environmental and health problems, such as
pollution, invasion of species, emerging of new diseases, and surging of
existing diseases.
