Carmichael&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0228919&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Andesitic lava
and ash (52-63% SiO2) erupts along the 35,000 km global volcanic arc system,
which is associated with the subduction of an oceanic plate at an oceanic
trench. This material contains water and represents one of the principal return
fluxes of water from the earth's mantle to the crust and to the surface. Thus
estimating the concentration of water in intermediate magma is a first order
problem, as it not only affects the conditions of melting in the andesite source
region, as well as the order and variety of the crystalline phases (as the
magmas decompress on ascent), but it also is one of the fundamental controls on
explosive volcanism. Moreover constraints on the amount of water in arc related
magmas affects the global water budget and the question of whether more water is
being subducted in comparison to that released by magmatism. This project will
assess the concentration of water in Mexican andesitic magmas over a wide whole
composition range, and will provide a thermodynamically based expression for the
solubility of water in andesitic magma as a function of pressure, temperature
and composition.&lt;br/&gt;
