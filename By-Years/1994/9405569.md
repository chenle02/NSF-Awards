9405569 Diane Waddle The issue of modern human origins continues to be a source
of intense debate among paleoanthropologists. Evolutionary models that explain
the origin of anatomically modern humans include the single origin and regional
continuity models. While the merits of these two models are continually under
discussion, a test of the hypotheses contained within each model was lacking.
Earlier work by this young investigator refuted notions of a significant
contribution by Neanderthals to the modern human gene pool, and provided
information about the levels of gene flow that would be required to adequately
explain patterns of cranial variation using a regional continuity model. The
current pilot project will validate the robusticity of video techniques in
cranial analyses and enable a sensitivity test of a series of earlier results.
Should the findings of the pilot project allay concerns about the new techniques
being developed, a larger application of these techniques to a more extensive
series of fossil hominids will be performed. This innovative and very promising
work is being performed by a young professional of great promise. ***
