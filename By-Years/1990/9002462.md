This award supports the research in p-adic analysis and algebraic geometry of
Professor Diane Meuser of Boston University. Dr. Meuser's project involves an
investigation of the properties of p-adic complex powers, otherwise known as the
Igusa local zeta function. In particular, she intends to explore the connections
between the behavior of the local zeta function and the geometry of the
algebraic variety from which this function is derived. This is research in the
field of algebraic geometry, one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but
one which has had a revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century. In its
origin, it treated figures that could be defined in the plane by the simplest
equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays the field makes use of methods not only
from algebra, but from analysis and topology, and conversely is finding
application in those fields as well as in physics, theoretical computer science,
and robotics.
