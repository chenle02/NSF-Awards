This award provides funding for US based participants in the meeting "Nonlinear
Partial Differential Equations and Many Particle Systems" to be held at KTH
Royal Institute of Technology Stockholm, Sweden, from November 21-25, 2018.

The workshop is devoted to the latest fundamental and transformative trends in
nonlinear evolution partial differential equations (PDE) and applications. Two
main goals of this conference are to bring together scientists and
mathematicians working in PDE and related fields, and to train and mentor
younger generation of mathematicians working in nonlinear PDE and applications.
The main impact is to establish a closer tie between researchers in Europe and
the US and by pushing the limits of current boundaries of knowledge in nonlinear
processes described by PDE to the new level.
