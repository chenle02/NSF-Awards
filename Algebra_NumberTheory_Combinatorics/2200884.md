This award provides partial support for attendees at "50 Years of Number Theory
and Random Matrix Theory Conference," which will take place at the Institute for
Advanced Study on June 21-24, 2022. This conference will bring together people
from two different areas: Number Theory and Random Matrix theory to discuss the
ideas that are relevant to both fields. In the last 50 years there has been a
large body of compelling work that uses Random Matrix Theory and gets to the
very heart of some of the most important problems in Number Theory. The
conference will give a historical perspective but will also be very forward
looking in its emphasis on contemporary research. The award will support about
30 participants with an emphasis on supporting early career researchers as well
as members of under-represented groups. The talks will be streamed and recorded
so that they can be available to a wide audience.

Mathematicians realized 50 years ago that the zeros of the Riemann zeta-
function are distributed like the eigenvalues of large random Hermitian matrices
with normally distributed entries. That discovery set things in motion, which in
the past 20 years have really taken off. Learning how to use Random Matrix
Theory as a model and guide to understanding the interesting arithmetic
statistics of families of L-functions is indispensable for today's researcher.
This conference will highlight some of the past achievements but will
concentrate on current work, such as Paul Nelson's groundbreaking work on
subconvexity for L-functions attached to automorphic forms on GL(n), that is
paving the way for future work.
