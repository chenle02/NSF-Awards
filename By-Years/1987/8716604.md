The objectives of this investigation is to determine the presence of short-
period variability in the flow of Ice Stream B, West Antarctica and to measure
the propagation of any observable motion events along the ice stream. The
results of this study, when combined with the borehole measurements (basal water
pressure, motion at and within the bed), will lead to a more complete
understanding of the mechanisms which govern ice stream flow and fast glacier
motion in general. A linear array of high-resolution vertical wire strain meters
and geophones will continuously monitor temporal changes in the strain field and
seismic activity over a one to two-year period. The array will be centered at
the Upstream B drill site and will overlap with a strain grid. Flow velocity at
the drill site will be measured daily during the field season. Taken together,
these measurements will delineate any flow variations which arise from changing
conditions at the basal interface. As such, the proposed research will form an
important and integral part of the borehole drilling program on Ice Stream B.
