The proposed research is directed at the development of a sensor-on-a-chip to be
fabricated using MEMS technology. The chip combined mechanical and electrical
measurements of cells to potentially detect cells that are in a cancerous or
pre-cancerous state. The detection sensitivity will be enhanced by utilizing
three-dimensional microenvironments to sort cells on the basis of differences in
adhesion and deformation properties. This is a highly interdisciplinary research
endeavor, and the research team represents areas of expertise ranging from
engineering to medical science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The significant aspects of
education and outreach in the proposed effort include: development of
presentation materials for the pre-college initiative and outreach program of
the university; research opportunities for high school students and
undergraduates; and recruitment of graduate students from under-represented
groups. &lt;br/&gt;
