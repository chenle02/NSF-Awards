The overall objective is to improve the current methods used to determine the
equatorial surface velocity field. It is hoped that this will be of benefit to
the Ocean SurfaceCurrent Analyses Real time (OSCAR) project and the Centre de
Topographie des Oceans et del'HydrosphÂµere (CTOH) product. Studies of the global
surface velocity field provided by the OSCAR project and the CTOH product have
shown that the velocities in the equatorial region, especially their meridional
components, do not agree well with in situ observations. The main reason could
be that the current methods used to calculate the velocity, which is related to
SSH, are essentially based on geostrophic balance, although geostrophic balance
breaks down in the equatorial region. This study will use a quasi-geostrophic
model, which is based on the geostrophic balance relations, whereas its
equatorial counterpart is based on different balance relations. These balance
relations will be used in place of the geostrophic balance relations to
determine the velocity that is related to SSH in the equatorial region. An ocean
model will be used to investigate the properties of its equatorial SSH field,
various algorithms that solve the proposed balance relations, the sensitivity
with respect to parameter choices, and the accuracy of the results. Once a good
understanding will have been developed about the best possible methods and their
properties, the same investigation will be carried out with satellite altimeter
observations, and additional issues such as errors investigated. The proposed
project aims at improving the accuracy of global surface velocity field in the
equatorial region. This thus improves its applicability to issues that it
already helps to investigate, ranging from oil spills to the role of the
horizontal advection on the surface heat budget. Improving the accuracy of the
global surface velocity field will improve for instance the study of the surface
heat budget, which in turn is relevant for climate studies. The project will
also continue the educational activity of giving undergraduate and graduate
students in the United States the opportunity to obtain an international
research experience in coastal oceanography in East Africa.
