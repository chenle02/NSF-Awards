Abstract The Polar Libraries Colloquy (Colloquy) was founded in 1971 to provide
an international forum for librarians and others involved in the collection,
preservation, and dissemination of polar information. Colloquy participants
represent the institutions generating and housing most of the unpublished and
published information about the Arctic and Antarctic. Colloquy's purpose is to
bring these specialists together to discuss issues of mutual interest and to
promote improved and expanded collections, coordinated information systems,
improved delivery of information and materials, and other services. NSF funding
supports production of the 1996 Colloquy proceedings which will include the text
of presented papers, poster sessions, a summary of the business meeting, and a
list of participants. The published proceedings provide an invaluable and unique
reference and reach a broader audience than does Colloquy itself. They foster
collaborative projects, report on the status of polar information preservation
and dissemination, and aid in identifying information gaps. The proceedings are
important as the most comprehensive record available concerning polar
information management.
