North Dakota State University-Main Campus is being supported to establish a
Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) SITE. The purpose of this SITE is
to provide meaningful hands-on research opportunities in contemporary chemistry
for outstanding undergraduate students under the supervision of expereinced
research chemists. For the summer of 1988, the program will support 8 students
recruited from North Dakota State and other institutions. Research activities
will include studies in the following areas: o Synthesis of main group
organometallics o Electronic structure calculations o Fourier transform mass
spctrometery o Natural product organic synthesis o Laser spectroscopy of
aromatic molecules o Raman scattering and non-linear optics o Lumineescence of
transition metal complexes o Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy of surfaces
