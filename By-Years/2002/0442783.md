Mathematical Science (21). In this project investigators are developing a
collection of elementary and intermediate exercises in the mathematics of
chemistry. The development process is aligned with the natural sequence of
mathematical topics that arise in first and second year calculus. These topics
are being associated with a family of functions and differential equations
needed in general chemistry and physical chemistry, covering ideas such as
enthalpy, entropy, free energy, fugacity, etc. The target audience is students
enrolling in the standard science-engineering-mathematics version of calculus.
