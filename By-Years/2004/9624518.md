It is proposed to construct a far-detuned 3-dimensional optical lattice that can
act as an atomic trap. Cooling of the atoms in the trap will be achieved by
successive vibrational excitation and de-excitation in the vibrational wells set
up by the optical waves. Once the atoms have been appropriately cooled, they
will be used for precision measurements of atomic properties. In addition,
vibrational cooling of two atoms at a single lattice site will be used as the
starting point for the creation of cold, trapped molecules.
