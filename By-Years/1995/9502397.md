In this project, a fast simulation environment to aid code generation for
pipelined and superscalar machine will be developed. The project will develop a
specification language capable of describing superscalar architectures, and
extend current mechanisms to permit the detection of data and control hazards,
and heuristics for efficient scheduling of instructions on modern superscalar
machines. The architectural specifications will be compiled into fast table-
driven automata that accurately simulates values moving through pipelines, thus
providing adequate information to compilers to correctly predict (and avoid)
structural, data and control hazards that adversely affect the performance of
the code generated. As a part of the education goals, the PI will develop a
compiler laboratory that will emphasize not only the fundamentals of compiler
design, but also the importance of the resource utilization to program
performance. Interactive tools for learning and better understanding of
automatic parsing mechanisms will be developed and adopted for teaching
undergraduate level compiler techniques.
