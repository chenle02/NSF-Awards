This proposal will support the continuation of the experimental
research&lt;br/&gt;program of the intermediate energy experimental nuclear
physics group at&lt;br/&gt;Rutgers University. The three faculty members
collaborate with a large&lt;br/&gt;number of physicists throughout the world on
experiments at Jefferson&lt;br/&gt;Laboratory in Newport News, Virginia, home to
CEBAF, a continuous beam&lt;br/&gt;electron accelerator with energies available
up to 6 GeV. In keeping&lt;br/&gt;with the mission of the Laboratory, the
experiments of the group are&lt;br/&gt;designed to unfold the quark structure of
nuclei and nucleons. The major&lt;br/&gt;work for the coming grant period will
be concentrated on the following&lt;br/&gt;measurements at Jefferson Laboratory:
deep virtual Compton scattering,&lt;br/&gt;neutron spin structure, and the
nucleon elastic form factors. The first&lt;br/&gt;two measurements are intended
to explore the substructure of the nucleon&lt;br/&gt;measuring the position and
momentum distributions of the quarks making&lt;br/&gt;up the nucleon. The last
elastic measurements study the properties of&lt;br/&gt;the nucleon as a whole.
The combination of these measurements and&lt;br/&gt;others will help us
understand the complex region where the description&lt;br/&gt;of a nucleon as
composed of quarks and gluons transforms into a picture&lt;br/&gt;of nucleons
surrounded by clouds of mesons. This grant period will also&lt;br/&gt;see an
expansion of the group's activities to the study of
neutrino&lt;br/&gt;interactions at Fermilab, in Batavia, Illinois. The goals are
similar&lt;br/&gt;to those being pursued at Jefferson Lab. However, neutrinos
have a&lt;br/&gt;different sensitivity to the substructure of the nucleon than
do&lt;br/&gt;electrons and photons. The study of neutrino interactions allows us
to&lt;br/&gt;develop a more complete understanding of the nucleon
structure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beyond improving our basic understanding of
nature, this project will&lt;br/&gt;help train students in the techniques of
basic research. Past students&lt;br/&gt;trained by this group have gone on to
contribute to society in diverse&lt;br/&gt;fields including medical physics,
management of nuclear waste and,&lt;br/&gt;development of state of the art
vacuum instrumentation.&lt;br/&gt;
