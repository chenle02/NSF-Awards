This grant in the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program will support Dr.
Dennis Dougherty's research into the properties of a group of organic chemical
fragments known as biradicals. Biradicals can be thought of as molecules that
contain a broken carbon-carbon bond. As such, they are excellent models for the
transition states of reactions that involve bond-making and/or bond-breaking. In
addition, their unusual electronic structures often lead to novel optical and
magnetic properties. Biradicals also occur as intermediates in chemical
reactions. Thus, their chemistry is an important part in developing an
understanding of chemical structures and reactivity. The major tools of this
study will be organic synthesis, matrix isolation spectroscopy and theoretical
modeling. Fundamentally new structural types will be synthesized, often
requiring the development of new synthesis methodologies. EPR, IR, and UV/VIS
spectroscopies will be used to investigate the electronic structures of
biradicals. Such spectroscopy will also allow the evaluation of the intrinsic
reactivity patterns of biradicals by direct observation. A variety of
theoretical tools will be used to guide and interpret the experimental studies.
Specific targets include: a series of substituted cyclobutanediyls that will
provide the first systematic study of the effects of substituents on the
spectroscopy and reactivity of localized 1,3- biradicals; a new design for very
high spin organic structures; the non-Kekule isomers of benzene and naphthalene
and perturbed derivatives; and a new precursor of tetrahedrane.
