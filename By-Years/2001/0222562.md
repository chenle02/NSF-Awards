Through this award, Honolulu Community College will conduct an assessment of its
Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) curriculum and
infrastructure in order to develop an institutional action plan to improve STEM
instruction. Project activities include: development of STEM course assessment
instruments; development of a plan to recruit Native Hawaiians into STEM
programs; outreach to potential industry, community, and/or educational partners
to provide student internship opportunities; and, development of a tracking
system for STEM students and graduates who transfer to four-year colleges and
universities and for those that gain employment in STEM fields.
