Project will implement configurable and extensible semantic eScience framework.
Con&#64257;guration will require some research into accommodating different
levels of semantic expressivity and user requirements from use cases.
Extensibility is best achieved in a modular approach to the semantic encodings
(i.e. ontologies) performed in a community setting, i.e. an ontology framework
into which specific applications all the way up to communities can extend the
semantics for their needs. Over the past few years, semantic technologies have
evolved and new tools are appearing. Part of the effort in this pro ject will be
to accommodate these advances in the new framework and lay out a sustainable
software path for the (certain) technical advances. In addition to a
generalization of the current data science interface, project will include an
upper-level interface suitable for use by clearinghouses, and/or educational
portals, digital libraries, and other disciplines.
