Engineering - Other (59)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taking the Lead is a highly
participatory conference bringing together Deans of Education and Engineering to
form collaborations and to discuss the positive impact that such partnerships
can have on the technological literacy of future K-12 teachers. This is the
first time that education and engineering leaders have come together in a formal
meeting. The potential benefits of these collaborations are numerous.
Engineering programs can provide educators with technical expertise and real
world applications of science and mathematics. Schools of education have much to
contribute to engineering schools in terms of effective pedagogy, instructional
design, and assessment. The outcomes of this conference will be an overall
strategic plan that has broad impact on campus reform and specific action plans
for the individual institutions represented.
