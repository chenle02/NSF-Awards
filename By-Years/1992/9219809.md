The emplacement of large thrust sheets remains as one the most poorly
understood phenomena of tectonics. The proposed study will examine the Willard
thrust at spectacular exposures near Logan, Utah, where one is offered the rare
opportunity to view the three dimensional character of an intact thrust sheet.
Studies will include detailed mapping, laboratory strain measurement, computer
modeling and microstructural analysis. Results of this study will provide
important constraints with which to test the kinematic and mechanical aspects of
thrust sheet emplacement.
