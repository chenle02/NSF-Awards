As the amount of user generated data increases, it becomes more challenging to
effectively search this data for useful information. There has been work on how
to search text social media posts, such as Tweets, or videos. However, searching
on these sources using separate tools is ineffective because the information
links between them are lost; for instance, one cannot automatically match social
network posts with activities seen on a video. As an example, consider a set of
tweets and videos (which may be posted on Twitter or other media) generated
during a riot. A police detective would like to jointly search this data to find
material related to a specific incident like a car fire. Some tweets (with no
contained video) may comment on the car fire, while a video segment from another
tweet shows the car during or after the fire. Linking the videos with the
relevant social media posts, which is the focus of this project, can greatly
reduce the effort in searching for useful information. The successful completion
of this project has the potential to improve the productivity of people who
search in social media, such as police detectives, journalists of disaster
management authorities. This project will also strengthen and extend the ongoing
undergraduate research and high school outreach activities of the
investigators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to focus on
the fundamental research tasks that would allow for joint modeling of social
network and video data. Then, given a set of posts, the system would find
relevant video segments and vice versa, by defining a common feature space for
social media and video data. This proof-of-concept project will be evaluated on
posts and videos shared on the Twitter platform. This is the right time to
tackle this problem given the recent advances in deep learning and big data
management technologies. A key risk is that the semantics in a tweet may not be
enough to map it to a video segment; for that, the context (e.g., tweets from
closely related users) of the tweet may need to be leveraged.
