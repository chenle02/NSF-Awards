0201943 O'Day The proposed project will examine the mobilization of arsenic from
sediments where it occurs in association with iron oxyhydroxides. The project
will focus on a specific study site, North Haiwee Reservior near Olancha,
California, where the input of arsenic to the sediments is controlled by
engineering practices of known duration and magnitude and which has been the
subject of a preliminary study by the research group. The project focuses on a
specific field site because of the unique opportunities that site offers. It is
anticipated that the mechanisms of iron and arsenic mobilization at Haiwee will
be relevant to a variety of iron-dominated systems including aquifer sediments.
Further, the information that is obtained on the timescales for arsenic release
from sediments and the factors governing these timescales will increase
understanding of the kinetic controls on arsenic concentrations in contacting
porewaters and groundwaters.
