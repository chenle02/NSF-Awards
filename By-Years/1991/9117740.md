This award supports Dr. Sutton's program in interstellar spectroscopy at
submillimeter wavelenghts. Part of the work is instrumental. An existing 345 GHz
receiver system will be modified to operate at 500 GHz and, ultimately, other
submillimeter bands. This receiver system will then be used for an observational
program which emphasizes studies of galactic structure, regions of star
formation, and interstellar chemistry. In addition, further analysis and
interpretation will be carried out for several ongoing projects based on data
obtained at 345 GHz. Submillimeter observations can provide unique information
about the interstellar medium, information not available at millimeter or other
wavelengths. High frequency spectral lines sample denser, higher excitation
regions, making them vital probes of molecular cloud cores. Previously
submillimeter observations had been limited by a lack of suitable telescopes and
receiver systems. A number of high quality submillimeter telescopes have become
available in the past few years, placing greater emphasis on the need for
sensitive receiver systems such as the one to be developed by Dr. Sutton.
