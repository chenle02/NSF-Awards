9414793 Sachs Recognizing that both physical and electronic models are crucial
to the design process, the researched work will create a system wherein the
designer can manipulate either type of model and can readily translate between
the two. The impact of the project is that it will provide a systematic and
fluid approach to the design of three dimensional shapes which can be employed
for a wide range of applications. By providing a complete cycle which can be
entered at any point, the system embraces the iterative nature of design and
gains versatility. The translation from electronic to physical models is done
using a rapid prototyping technique, such as three dimensional printing. The
designer can then use hand tools to sculpt the model by carving, shaping and
adding material to the model. Once satisfied with the changes, the translation
from physical to electronic domain is done by digitizing the physical model. The
designer then uses a set of electronic tools to translate the digitized
information into changes in the electronic model. Conventional as well as novel
CAD tools can then be used to manipulate the electronic model. The cycle can
then be repeated as necessary.
