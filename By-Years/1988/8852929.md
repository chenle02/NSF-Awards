This project enriches the research experience of pschology students in
physiological psychology, increases the sophistication of data analysis and
experimental simulations in experimental psychology and assists the learning of
statistics with supplemental computer assisted instruction. The equipment
acquired, including microcomputers and instructional software, supports analogue
to digital conversion, computerized data acquisition and signal averaging. With
this award, an increased number of undergraduate students are being encouraged
to pursue graduate educatiion leading to academic and/or research careers in
psychology. Worthwhile research experiences and rigorous training in the basics
of statistics and experimental design are vital to motivating and training
students pursuing graduate education. The institution has a more than ninety
percent minority enrollment. This award will be matched by an equal sum from the
grantee.
