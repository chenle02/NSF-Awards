This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial biology for
FY2004. The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of
protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are
not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides
opportunities for recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in
microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of
established scientists, and to broaden their scientific horizons beyond the
research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These
fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their
research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves
of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign
locations.

The research and training plan is entitled "A novel antagonistic mechanism in
plant-associated microbes." An intriguing finding that the bacterium Pseudomonas
syringae can co-opt the fungal heterokaryon incompatibility (HI) pathway and
trigger a fungal programmed cell death pathway is being further investigated.
This project examines a protein in P. syringae (Phc) that has homology to the
Neurospora crassa protein Het-c, which controls HI. The generality of this
phenomenon is being examined by studying the the effect of phc on various fungal
species, the fitness advantage conferred by phc to P. syringae, and
investigating if Phc is regulated by the type three secretion system.
