As resources become scarce, large systems such as the electric power system in
the United States tend to operate nearer to their security limits. There has
been increasing evidence of this conjecture not only in the United States but
world-wide. The crucial phenomena is embedded in the system dynamics and is not
well understood. The manifestation of this operation is the increased frequency
in breakdowns in the electric supply. This proposal seeks to research conceptual
and computational tools to examine large-scale power system behavior near
stability limits.
