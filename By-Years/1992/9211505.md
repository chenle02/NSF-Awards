A Research Initiation Award will support a study of compressible squeeze film
dampers. The transient and steady state forced periodic responses of pressurized
and unpressurized compressible squeeze film dampers will be investigated over a
wide range of parameters. The study will combine analytical evaluations using
the non-linear unsteady finite-length Reynolds equation and experimental studies
in a specialized test rig to be built as part of the study.
