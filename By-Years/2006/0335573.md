The Robert Noyce program at Trinity aims to increase both the quantity and
quality of math and science teaching in the San Antonio area by awarding Robert
Noyce scholarships to seniors and post-baccalaureate candidates in their M.A.T.
year. During the M.A.T. year students intern nearly full-time for eight months
in classrooms in local schools in an apprenticeship model of teacher preparation
analogous to a medical teaching hospital internship experience. Extensive
recruiting activities are targeting all qualified candidates with special
attention to under-represented groups. Criteria for selection include: GPA
overall and within the major field; intellectual and pedagogical potential as
evidenced by references and interview; demonstrated financial need; and estimate
of the candidate's ability to be an effective role model for students in San
Antonio area schools. Students who apply as seniors may be STEM majors either at
Trinity, or they may be STEM majors from other institutions who have applied and
gained admission to the M.A.T. program as post-baccalaureate candidates. All
Noyce recipients are assigned both STEM faculty and Education faculty mentors.
During the first three years of teaching, their STEM and Education faculty
mentors will continue to provide support. Noyce scholars also participate in
other department of Education in-service programs. In addition, to help sustain
novice teachers, new and experienced teachers are linked through Trinity's
"Critical Friends" groups that enable teachers and administrators to maintain a
professional community. The department of Education will track each Noyce
recipient's career through its on-line database and monitor and enforce
compliance with program conditions.
