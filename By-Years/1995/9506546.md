9506546 Williams This project will refine and test a completely new method for
dating metamorphic staurolite and other minerals in complexly metamorphosed
regions, and will apply the method to the metamorphic rocks of the Southwestern
U.S. U-Pb dating of a suite of metamorphic minerals will be conducted in concert
with detailed porphyroblast-matrix studies, field structural analyses and
metamorphic pressure-temperature studies to unravel the complex tectonic history
of the middle crust of New Mexico, Arizona and the Colorado Front Range during
continental assembly. The results will be of great significance to workers in
complex tectono-metamorphic terranes and will have far-reaching consequences for
the understanding of tectonic events in all orogenic belts.
