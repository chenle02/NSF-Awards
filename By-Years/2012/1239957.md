The Noyce project at the University of West Georgia (UWG) in partnership with
the Carroll County School System and the Carrollton City Schools provides
scholarships to 32 undergraduate students who pursue their professional
certification as juniors and seniors and complete their STEM baccalaureate
degrees. In addition, the recruitment component of the UWG Noyce project gives
merit-based stipends of $150 each to 500 freshman and sophomore students to
test-drive STEM teaching by enrolling in an introductory teaching course,
participating in course-embedded early field experiences, and earning a B or
better in the course. It also supports 50 internships, which enables freshman
and sophomore students to work in STEM summer programs with in-service teachers
and K-12 students. Finally, the UWG Noyce project affords Noyce Scholars
induction workshops and mentoring during their first year of
teaching.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The UWG Noyce project employs the UTeach teacher
preparation model. Students major in mathematics or a science discipline and
earn their teaching credential through specially designed, inquiry-based
education courses. The project contributes to new knowledge by exploring two
broad questions: 1) What is the impact of student support systems on the teacher
preparation experience for Noyce Scholars? and 2) What is the impact of
participation as a Noyce Scholar on their teaching and on student learning? In
order to answer these questions, long term data about students are collected to
assess supports that lead to graduation; pedagogical approaches for preparing
STEM teachers; and the impact on P-12 student achievement. Some of the data from
this project contribute to UTeach national data bases on STEM teacher
preparation methods. Noyce Scholars, therefore, not only participate in
research-based preparation for teaching themselves, they also are part of
ongoing research that informs teacher preparation across the country.
