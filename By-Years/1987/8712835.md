This project is for the support of undergraduate student participation in
ongoing research programs in the Division of Physics, Mathematics, and
Astronomy. Participants have the opportunity to work with a faculty member or
with a member of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Students will collaborate with
the research sponsor to define and develop the project, to carry out the work,
to submit a final written report, and to make an oral presentation of the
research. This project is supported under the Program of Research Experiences
for Undergraduates to help ensure an adequate supply of scientists for the
future.
