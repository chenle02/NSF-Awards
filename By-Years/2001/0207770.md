Guggenheim&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0207770&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The working hypothesis of
this proposal is that clay/methane-gas hydrate complexes will form under
appropriate water-saturated conditions at low temperatures and high gas
pressures. In a series of preliminary experiments, we obtained evidence that
these complexes indeed can form at these conditions. In these experiments we
used an environmental chamber, capable of temperatures from -100 to 200 oC and
gas pressures to 75 bars. This chamber, which we developed in-house, allows
X-ray scans from 0 to 70 degrees two theta.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We propose to
examine Na-exchanged and Ca-exchanged montmorillonite and methane under the
appropriate conditions to form clay/methane-gas hydrate complexes. In addition,
we will examine possible interactions between methane and NH4-exchanged
montmorillonite. Our intent is to determine the compositional range of clays
that allow gas hydrates to intercalate into clay structures. We will then
determine the P-T conditions where these clay/gas-hydrate complexes form, as
well as the amounts of gas hydrates that are incorporated in the clay.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The discovery of clay/gas-hydrate complexes introduces a
new class of materials, which should be of interest in mineralogy, geochemistry,
and materials science. As with gas hydrates, these new complexes: (1) may be
expected to occur in deep ocean and polar regions (e.g., permafrost, Antarctic
ice), (2) may be involved in submarine sediment stability, and (3) may be
present on Mars. It is probable that the stability range of clay/gas-hydrate
complexes will extend the stability range of gas-hydrate compounds. Also,
clay/gas-hydrate complexes may store significant quantities of methane and other
hydrocarbons, and thus, these complexes may play an important role in climate
changes, much like what has been proposed for gas hydrates.&lt;br/&gt;
