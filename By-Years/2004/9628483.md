9628483 Hallgren This award provides travel support for graduate students, post-
doctoral scholars, and invited speakers who will participate in a special
workshop on computer intensive statistical techniques and their application to
the atmospheric sciences. The workshop will be held just prior to the American
Meteorological Society's 13th Conference on Probability and Statistics in San
Francisco in February 1996. The workshop has two goals: (1) to improve and
promote stronger interaction between the statistics and atmospheric sciences
communities and (2) to introduce graduate students and postdoctoral scholars
both to the latest statistical concepts relevant to the atmospheric sciences and
to the statisticians responsible for those developments. The workshop papers and
discussions will be published in a monograph that will be widely distributed.
Support for this award will be shared between the programs in the Lower
Atmospheric Research Section of the Division of Atmospheric Sciences and the
Statistics and Probability Program of the Division of Mathematical Sciences.
