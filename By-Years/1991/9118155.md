This award provides funding for 50% of the cost of acquiring a high-pressure,
multi-anvil press that will be installed and operated in the Department of
Geological Sciences at the University of Michigan. The University is committed
to providing funds for the remaining half. The equipment is to be used primarily
by the experimental petrology research group at the University of Michigan in a
program studying the behavior of water and other volatiles trapped in the
Earth's mantle under high-pressure-temperature conditions.
