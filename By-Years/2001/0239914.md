Data mining is the semi-automatic discovery of patterns, associations, changes,
anomalies, rules, and statistically significant structures and events in data.
Thus, data mining aims to extract knowledge from sensor data, and is an emerging
area with numerous commercial applications. Work in data mining ranges from
theoretical work on the principles of learning and mathematical representations
of data to building advanced engineering systems that perform information
filtering on the web, find genes in DNA sequences, help understand trends and
anomalies in economics and medicine, and detect network intrusion.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The problem gets more complicated in a distributed system
where the data itself is positioned across different sites and coordination
across the sites needed to mine information from the distributed data.
Distributed Data Mining (DDM) arises in diverse areas such as sensor stream data
generated from satellite etc. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Presently, there are several
proposed ad-hoc approaches to distributed data mining (DDM) that deal with
specific schemes and most of them do not address any real time analysis for
solving different classes of distributed data mining problems. This project will
address this very explicitly the merits of the new framework.&lt;br/&gt;
