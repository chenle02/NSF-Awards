The department is developing a program designed to attract more students,
especially females and minorities, into professional careers in Neurobiology,
modeled after programs we are just implementing in Molecular and Environmental
Biology. It begins with our introductory course in Biology (taken by biology and
science majors and premedical students) by offering optional laboratories (taken
anyplace of the regular laboratories) for the more motivated and talented
students. These special laboratories will involve the students in fascinating,
advanced experiments that more accurately represent the opportunities and
challenges in Neurobiology. Advanced undergraduate courses in Animal Physiology
and Neurobiology will attract students where they will learn the major ideas,
procedures and may "catch" the excitement of a career in Neurobiology. The
Neurobiology course will involve both structured labs, and independently planned
and executed projects by the students. This will serve as a gateway for some
into at least one year of research, working with our neurobiology research
group.
