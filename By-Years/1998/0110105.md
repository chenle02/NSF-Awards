&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will
develop a new optically transparent intrinsically conducting polymer (ICP) that
can be processed from organic solutions. Despite much information on ICPs in the
technical literature, the number of commercial applications of ICPs is still
very small because of their intrinsically poor stability and the lack of
reasonable processing methods. Phase II will address the problem of
processability. Phase I successfully prepared ICPs that are soluble up to 15%
weight in alcohols. Cast films are optically transparent, have conductivity of
1-100 Siemens per centimeter, and maintain constant conductivity when elongated
up to 30%. ICPs were made from commercially available monomers. Phase II will
bring the polymers developed in Phase I from a feasibility stage to commercial
products by optimizing their composition and synthesis and scaling up production
and purification. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These materials could be used to replace
indium tin oxide in flat panel displays and other electronic applications. ICPs
are expected to find application in the manufacture of electronic components,
inks, biomedical materials, electronic devices, and specialty
coatings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
