This is a proposal for participant support for the third CyberBridges CAREER PI
workshop. The goal of this 1.5 day workshop in Arlington, VA is developing the
next generation of cyberinfrastructure faculty for computational and data-
enabled science and engineering. The workshop brings together the community of
CAREER awardees in cyberinfrastructure with the aim of (i) facilitating
networking and discussion; (ii) providing a forum to facilitate discovery of new
synergies and research connections; (iii) provide inspiration through
interaction with keynote speakers in selected areas. Funding will be used for
attendee travel, support staff and faculty time, and facility costs.
