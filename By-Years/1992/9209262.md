Geneological records are an important resource for the study of human genetic
change over short periods of time. The primary objective of this research is to
utilize the archival records of the Aland Islands, Finland, for such two such
analyses. First, excellent archival records are available for the past 250
years, facilitating long-term demographic studies as well as the construction of
multigenerational pedigrees. Second, this population has high frequencies of
several genetic diseases that are very rare in other populations. The
investigators are interested in determining the evolutionary forces responsible
for these disease frequencies. The initial goal of this project is to complete
the computer entry of archival records from Aland so that they can be used in a
computerized construction of pedigrees for the entire population. This will
allow the analysis of inbreeding levels, nonrandom mating, the degree of genetic
isolation, and the extent to which individual ancestral founders may have made
disproportionate genetic contributions to the current generation. These studies
will have evolutionary significance, and they will help to explain why the Aland
Islands population has a high incidence of some genetic diseases.
