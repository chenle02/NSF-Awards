M. Frederick Hawthorne, Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of
California Los Angeles, is continuing his research into functionalized
carboranes with the support of the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic
Chemistry Program. Methylation of carboranes leads to octamethyl derivatives.
These methyl groups will be functionalized to give "camoflagued carboranes" with
desirable properties. The methylated carboranes will be studied as ligands for
electron-deficient transition metals analogous to pentamethylcyclopentadienyl.
Direct hydroxylation of boranes provides route into other new classes of boron
clusters with tunable electronic properties.

Carboranes and boranes have interesting structures and have led to new insights
into bonding. The functionalized clusters studied in this grant may have
applications in water-soluble catalysis, drug delivery, and molecular
electronics. The project incorporates synthesis, characterization and materials
applications, making it an excellent project for training students.
