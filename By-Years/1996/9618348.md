Telesco, Charles AST 96-18348 Dr. Telesco will carry out an observational study
into the spatial and spectral properties of the environments of pre-main-
sequence, intermediate mass stars. His study will utilize a new infrared
imager/spectrometer (OSCIR), developed by the PI and colleagues, to trace in
detail the spatial distributions of dust throughout the environments of Herbig
Ae/Be stars (those pre-main- sequence stars with masses of 2 to 10 solar masses)
to determine how much matter is in the form of circumstellar disks or stellar
envelopes. Spectroscopy of silicate particles in the stellar environments may
provide insight into the temperature history of the dust particles. By probing
the environments of these intermediate mass stars in the infrared, and
characterizing the properties of dust particles and the frequency of occurrence
of circumstellar disks, Dr. Telesco's work will provide insight into the
earliest stages of stellar evolution and, potentially, the formation of
planetary systems. ***
