This project involves the renovation of the cyberinfrastructure at Lowell
Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona. The Lowell Observatory's assets are
distributed across three separate mesas or hilltops. The proposal is to enhance
the telecommunications connections between them, by deploying long distance
microwave network links between the sites, and to renovate the data center at
the Observatory's main campus.

Lowell Observatory's telescopes are used for studies of small objects in the
solar system, including comets and the Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs) that orbit the
Sun beyond Neptune. The Observatory's new Discovery Channel Telescope will allow
a more comprehensive survey of KBOs than has ever been done. Researchers conduct
studies of selected asteroids. The Observatory's facilities are also used for
studies of the planet-forming disks of dust and gas around very young stars,
studies aimed at resolving the persistent differences in competing theories
relating stellar masses and brightness, research on binary stars, solar
astronomy, the search for and study of extrasolar planets, star clusters within
the Milky Way galaxy, and dwarf galaxies.

In addition to providing infrastructure for research, the Observatory provides
public education programs. Since 1996, several of the Observatory's astronomers
have carried out a semester-long mentoring program in middle schools on the
nearby Navajo and Hopi reservations. Through a partnership with Discovery
Communications, the Observatory is building the Discovery Channel Telescope. The
Discovery Channel's programming about the telescope and its science will is
anticipated to reach hundreds of millions of viewers worldwide and will be a
source of information about the cosmos for the general public.
