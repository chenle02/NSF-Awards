Tetrodotoxin (TTX), a naturally occurring toxin, specifically blocks the
function of sodium channels by underlying the electrical excitability in nerve
and muscle. Animals poisoned by this paralytic poison lose the ability to
control skeletal and visceral muscles and eventually die. The investigation is
designed to characterize the sodium channel receptor which binds to
tetrodotoxin. Sodium channels in different species differ in their ability to
bind TTX. Comparisons of the molecular structure of the binding sites in
different species will be made to determine the specific component responsible
for the intensive binding properties of the receptor. Biochemical and
electrophysiological techniques will be used to determine the structure of the
receptor. Once the receptor has been identified, it will be possible to develop
pharmacological agents targeted specifically for TTX, leading to the development
of a new class of anesthetics.
