The orientation and navigation behavior of vertebrate animals is remarkable in
its complexity and reliance on multiple, interacting cues. The system enables
animals to respond flexibly to the variety of environmental conditions that may
be encountered during a migratory journey. This flexibility in behavior enables
the animal to perform accurately in the face of variability and changing
availability of the cues upon which it relies. Only in birds have the
relationships among orientation cues been explored in detail. How does a young
bird come to possess a suite of compasses sufficient, on its first migration, to
successfully determine in which direction to fly? Dr. Able will employ a
developmental approach to this problem, hand-raising birds under controlled
conditions in which their experiences with relevant orientation cues (earth's
magnetic field, sun, stars, polarized-light patterns in the sky) can be
manipulated. In this way Dr. Able can delineate the interactions and
calibrations that occur during the development of compass-orientation abilities
in the young animal. As in most complex behavior, this development involves a
rich interplay of genetically-based predispositions and templates with
experience and learning. The research will contribute importantly both to
improved understanding of the development of complex behavior, and to a greater
understanding of bird migration that will be crucial in efforts to conserve
neotropical migratory birds.
