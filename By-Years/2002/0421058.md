Abstract The requested MRI equipment will enable the continued growth and
development of three SDSM&T research groups; namely, the smart structures group,
the composites group and the direct write technology group. Taken together, the
SDSM&T research initiatives mentioned above require a complementary suite of
instruments capable of highly-accurate dimensioning and profiling of components,
and the precise determination of material properties.

Given the current focus of SDSM&T research efforts it is envisioned that the
Nano-XP system would be utilized in the following research areas: 1) indentation
testing of polymer matrix composites (particularly the near fiber region called
the interphase), and 2) sensor/ circuitry durability. In addition, other
possible areas would include characterization of nano and microstructure of
friction stir processed material and characterization of nanofiber composites.
Several evolving technologies offer exciting promise, while at the same time
providing significant development challenges. Ultra-low weight design and
miniaturization are two notable examples. In both of these cases, and many
others, non-contact sensing and measurement are required. Optical methods are
among the most powerful non-contact techniques. The proposed ARAMIS 3D high-
resolution speckle interferometer featuring natural specular nature of the
imaged surface will be used with gossamer structures and direct-write,
multifunctional integrated sensors. Recent advances in materials processing
methods, such as direct-write manufacturing, have opened up the possibility of
multifunctional structural elements. Direct-write manufacturing enables load-
carrying elements of a structure to be designed to serve the additional
functions of sensing and actuation. A number of communications, medical, space,
and defense applications with tight weight and size constraints are in need of
reliable multifunctional structures. The requested dynamic MEMS optical profiler
system is ideal at the scales of these applications. Significant opportunities
exist for education and training with this suite of instruments. In this regard,
the requested instruments would be utilized in over a dozen courses, totaling
more than 400 students/year. In addition, SDSM&T hosts one summer REU site and
has a second REU site pending, both of which would utilize this equipment.
Finally, Raid City hosts a burgeoning telecommunications industry, which would
greatly benefit from the requested equipment through interaction with the
laboratory of applied electromagnetics and communications (LAEC) and direct
write laboratory.
