This project has students perform nondestructive laboratory work on truss
assemblies and members of varying geometry to verify loads and deflections that
were predicted by classroom problem solving. Implementation includes the
construction of pin-connected truss models and machine components with varying
geometry. These are instrumented with strain gages and appropriate readout
equipment in order to demonstrate load sharing and distribution in trusses and
the phenomena of stress concentration factors. The project permits the student
to manipulate physical models in the laboratory to demonstrate topics that now
rely solely on problem solving.
