Research supported by this grant is under the auspices of the Arctic Systems
Science (ARCSS) Global Change Research Program and is jointly sponsored by the
Division of Ocean Sciences and the Office of Polar Programs. Work to be
performed represents preliminary steps towards a major 5-year research project
named SHEBA, which is envisioned to study the heat budget of the Arctic Ocean
and its impact on global change. The primary goals of SHEBA are: (1) to develop,
test and implement models of arctic ocean- atmosphere-ice processes that
demonstrably improve simulations of the present day arctic climate, including
its variability, using General Circulation Models (GCMs), and (2) to improve the
interpre- tation of satellite remote sensing data in the Arctic for analysis of
the arctic climate system and provide reliable data for model input, model
validation and climate monitoring. Researchers at the University of Colorado
will use data taken from aircraft in previous experiments similar to SHEBA to
analyze the status cloud data so that the SHEBA field experiment may be planned
more efficiently. The aircraft-derived data will be used to validate the results
from remote sensing data taken from satellites so that those results may be
extended beyond the specific region of the proposed field experiment. ??
