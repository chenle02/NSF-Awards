This work aims to effectively address security concerns while maintaining the
privacy of individuals and corporations. The project analyzes subversive
attacks, develops defenses and deterrents, creates privacy tools and software,
and increases awareness and expertise through teaching, mentoring and
involvement of students in research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research
rethinks the basics of cryptographic security to provide new models, frameworks,
tools and solutions. This project considers the subversion of random number
generators and offers forms of encryption that are robust in its presence. The
project explores: (1) the subversion of certificate authorities and offer
certificate-signing mechanisms that deter it, (2) the exfiltration of
cryptographic keys by malware installed on systems and development of big-key
cryptography as a deterrent, and (3) the subversion of key distribution
protocols through infiltration of their endpoints and development of new
protocols to resist it.
