Dr. Smulyan is examining the origins and organization of the American mass
electronic media. The familiar forms of radio and television resulted from
several factors. Dr. Smulyan is examining how these factors combined to produce
the first system of broadcasting financed through the sale of time to
advertisers. Why and how did American broadcasting, which began free of
advertisements, become commercialized? How did this decision affect and how was
it affected by the choice of technology to provide a national radio service? The
technology chosen was wired networks. This choice changed programming and caused
broadcasters to seek advertising to fund radio. Wired national radio brought
larger companies as sponsors, more expensive air time, harder hitting
commercials, and big stars with proven appeal. Despite protests, the 1934
Communications Act endorsed broadcasting's domination by wired networks and by
advertisers. By working in the Division of Electricity of the National Museum of
American History, Dr. Smulyan will gain additional training in history of
technology and access to important manuscripts and periodicals in order better
to incorportate the technical with the social, business and cultural factors
affecting the course of radio's development.
