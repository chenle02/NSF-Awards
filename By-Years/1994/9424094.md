Abstract - Seborg GOALI Model-based process control strategies utilizing
nonlinear dynamic models can provide improvements over conventional PID and
control strategies based on linear dynamic models. A factor for successful
application of nonlinear control systems is the availability of a reasonably
accurate, dynamic model. For some industrial control applications, physical
models can be developed from first principles such as unsteady-state mass and
energy balances. However, it may not be feasible to use a physical model as part
of the on-line control calculations due to model complexity, unknown model
parameters, or the lack of key measurements. In many applications, accurate
physical models are not available for a variety of reasons, which include
process complexity, lack of process understanding, limited measurements, and the
time and effort required to develop them. For these situations, an attractive
alternative is to develop an empirical nonlinear model which is consistent with
available a priori physical information using nonlinear identification
techniques. In this joint academic-industrial research project, process control
researchers at the University of California at Santa Barbara and at DuPont will
address a number of issues in nonlinear identification which limit the
effectiveness of existing methods and their widespread application. These issues
include: (1) selection of the input sequence to ensure appropriate process
excitation; (2) incorporation of available a priori process knowledge; (3)
selection of key design parameters such as sampling period, amount of data to be
acquired, model orders and model time delay; (4) characterization of model
uncertainty; and (5) on-line model updating and adaptation. The identification
methods resulting from the research will be evaluated in a number of simulation
and experimental studies, including industrial applications. A case study will
provide a comparison of alternative identification techniques based, in part, on
whether they can be used to develop effective model-based control systems.
