In this effort the investigator and his student will consider developments of
discontinuous Galerkin methods suitable for solving fractional differential
equations. Motivated by a series of preliminary but very encouraging
computational experiments, local discontinuous Galerkin methods for both
fractional ordinary and partial differential equations will be considered. These
initial computational observations supports a number of conjectures and these
will guide the development and analysis of the proposed methods. While specific
target applications are not considered detail, problems of a more practical
character such as computational efficiency, multi-dimensional problems, and
alternative formulations will be addressed in the latter part of the
effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the notion of fractional calculus is as old
as that of classical calculus introduced by Newton, the development and analysis
of fractional calculus and fractional equations is not nearly as mature.
However, during the last few decades fractional calculus has emerged as a
natural and important description for a broad range of non-classical phenomena
in the applied sciences and engineering. Examples can be found anomalous
transport processes, sub-diffusion, and problems dominated by memory effects.
Applications of such models are found in wide range of areas such as porous,
visco-elastic, or biological flows, flow of crude oil in reservoirs, fusion
plasma problems, modeling of properties of complex materials, financial markets
etc. The planned activities seek to develop efficient and accurate computational
techniques to allow application scientists and engineers to more effectively
solve this important class of models.
