The goal of the Multi-Instrumented Studies of Equatorial Thermosphere Aeronomy
(MISETA) program is to improve understanding of equatorial thermosphere aeronomy
through studies that combine continuous measurements from a variety of
automatically operating instruments. The PIs propose to augment the ground-based
diagnostics at the CEDAR equatorial observatory in Peru with two automatic
instruments that would measure the zonal drift of kilometer scale irregularities
and all sky airglow surface brightness. In addition, the PIs propose an upgrade
for the Fabry Perot interferometer to modernize the data acquisition capability
for automatic measurements of the F-region neutral wind field. This particular
project will upgrade the spaced antenna drift measuring capability in Ancon,
Peru with an automatic data acquisition system.
