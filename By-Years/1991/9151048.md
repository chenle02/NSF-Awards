Six new and modified laboratory experiments for physical, analytical, and
inorganic chemistry are described that will take advantage of a computer-
assisted scanning uv/vis/nir spectrophotometer. Students will acquire kinetic
and spectroscopic data in digital format and analyze these data using a
scientific spreadsheet, such as RS/l. Both second order and enzyme kinetics will
be encountered; rate constants will be obtained using numerical methods of
analysis. The second derivative technique will be applied to electronic spectra
to elucidate the excited states of molecular systems and the composition of
complex mixtures. Sophisticated graphics and the use of statistical information
will be emphasized. The grantee will match the NSF award from non- Federal
sources.
