Currently, the design of steel plate shear walls is based on the elastic
buckling as the limiting condition. This design criterion results not only in an
uneconomical design but a system in which the building columns may yield and/or
buckle under a major earthquake before the plate panels develop a fraction of
their strength. The results from this project will be used to provide analytical
tools and a guide to design criteria for thin steel plate shear walls under
seismic loads, which take into consideration the post-buckling strength of the
plate. One-quarter scale, one bay, three story thin steel plate shear walls will
be tested. The effects of cutouts in the plate representing doors and window
placement, the method the plate is connected to the building frame, and the
effect of the axial compression in the columns will be investigated in this
experimental program. The test results are expected to show stable hysterisis
loops and high energy absorbing capabilities of thin- plate-shear-wall system as
a viable earthquake-resistant structural element. Results of this project are
expected to add new insights on the performance of thin steel plate shear walls
in areas of high seismic risk.
