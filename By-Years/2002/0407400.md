INTELLECTUAL MERIT: The Children's Museum of Houston seeks to develop a 1,500 sq
ft bilingual traveling exhibition based on their bilingual "Magnificent Math
Moments" activities. This project simultaneously addresses two very important
needs: the relative lack of mathematics exhibits for young children and for
Spanish-speaking audiences. The exhibition is based on Patron (Pattern) Point
where the visitor meets math superheroes, Subtracta, Capt. Mas in the settings
of Subtracta's Puzzle Parlor; Capt. Mas's Marina; and Formas (Shapes) Family
Shipping Yard. It will provide an inviting setting for introducing the target
audiences to mathematics through the use of characters, environments and
puzzles.

BROADER IMPACT: Fabrication of a second version of the traveling exhibition will
extend the number of institutions reached through two national tours. These
exhibitions, which target children ages 5-10 and adults, are projected to reach
some 1.4 million visitors in 24 museums over five years; sites will be selected
to reach Hispanic audiences in smaller, low-income urban and rural areas. For
further impact CMH is forming another network of museums that will benefit from
this project, even though the institutions will not be able to host the
traveling exhibition. CMH also is developing ancillary materials and services to
accompany the exhibition that include activity kits and cart, character
costumes, training guides, parent materials and other resources.
