Abstract Objective: The objective of this program is to demonstrate a non-polar
nitride cascade laser to fill the need for ultra-fast compact light sources
tunable by design in the entire underutilized near-infrared range. The approach
eliminates the adverse effects of built-in polarization fields in nitrides by
engineering quantum charge-transport along the polarization-free direction
perpendicular to the m-plane of GaN. Intellectual merit: The main scientific
contribution is to elucidate the impact of built-in polarization fields on the
performance of nitride near-infrared lasers and detectors. The program will
enable a new class of versatile and ultra-fast optoelectronic devices that will
immediately trigger practical applications. The novel near-infrared devices will
facilitate compact, affordable consumer systems and could eventually surpass the
commercial success of the blue nitride lasers. Broader impacts: The program will
increase exposure of Grade 7-12 students from economically disadvantaged
backgrounds in Central Indiana to the scientific content and method of
photonics. A comprehensive progression of inquiry-based outreach activities was
designed to maximize impact across multiple age groups. Secondary science
teachers will develop and pilot lesson plans and demonstrations that incorporate
concepts of infrared radiation into the high-school curriculum. Engaging hands-
on activities for a science summer camp for middle-school girls will be
developed and implemented. Special attention will be given to assessing the
impact of these activities on the development of knowledge about the science
content related to invisible regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. The
integrated educational plan will leverage existing web-based tools on Purdue's
nanoHUB.org for dissemination across the global research community.
