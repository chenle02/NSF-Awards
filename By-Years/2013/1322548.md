As the largest European seismic event in the historical record, the 1755 Lisbon
earthquake served as the catalyst for subsequent changes in how modern societies
mitigate and manage potentially catastrophic events. This catalytic
collaborative project, involving researchers based in the US and Portugal, will
explore the response of communities in 18th century Portugal to this event,
drawing upon contemporary reports from hundreds of parishes in Portugal which
describe how members of the clergy, military and government responded to the
disaster. Characteristics of the communities under study are available from
additional contemporary sources which, along with other sources for this work,
are held in the Portuguese National Archives. Additional research will be
undertaken to characterize the development and deployment of post-disaster
assessment tools (such as surveys) used by the Portuguese government following
the event. Combined qualitative and quantitative methods (such as content
analysis and statistical data modeling) will be used to provide a context for
the data under study and to enable testing of research
hypotheses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is expected to advance
understanding of human response to disaster by considering community response
activities in light of current understanding of the effects of the 1755 Lisbon
earthquake. It will contribute to research on how disaster response decision
making may be shaped by characteristics both of affected communities and of the
disaster itself. It will thus provide an historically grounded critique of
current theories of community resilience, and is expected to identify
opportunities and limitations to improving the response of current communities
to disaster. Finally, it is expected to contribute tools and techniques for
undertaking analysis of disaster-related data that are embedded deep in the
historical record.
