In this project, the P.I.s will analyze major and trace element chemistry of
primitive compositions (>Fo90 olivine,>An90 plagioclase). Lavas of such
compositions are rare in MORBs but have been found in off-axis areas. The P.I.s
argue that these melts could be important primary MORBs. They will rehomogenize
the inclusions to explore the effects of post-entrapment changes. Finally, they
will run 1-atm experiment on these melts. Their ultimate objective is to
determine the conditions under which such melts may be generated at MORBs.
