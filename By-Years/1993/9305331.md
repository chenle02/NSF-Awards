9305331 Dantzig This research concerns stochastic programming techniques, in
particular the combination of importance sampling and Bender's decomposition. It
is becoming possible to solve really large practical models. Problems analyzed
so far include the important class of two stage stochastic linear programs with
some extensions to the multistate case. ***
