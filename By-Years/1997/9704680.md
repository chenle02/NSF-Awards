9704680 Fricke Despite its potential to provide new inroads in the study of
marine and terrestrial paleoenvironment, the isotopic analysis of phosphates has
been hampered by the same quality that makes them so attractive; the strength of
the oxygen-phosphorous bond. Until recently, the chemical separation of the
phosphate ion was difficult and time consuming, and its analysis required the
use of relatively complex flourination techniques. A new analytical technique
has been developed which is much simpler, and it is now possible to process and
analyze large numbers of phosphate samples relatively rapidly. Nevertheless
preparing samples for this technique is still relatively labor-intensive, and it
is not possible at present to run samples smaller than -6 mg in size. The P.I.
will develop the excimer laser as a faster and microanalytical alternative to
the methods described above. The technique will drastically reduce the necessary
sample size, allowing for in situ analysis and the isotopic investigation of
small and rapidly formed skeletal structures.
