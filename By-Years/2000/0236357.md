EAR-0236357&lt;br/&gt;Wang&lt;br/&gt;This award provides partial support to
purchase a stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer system to be used for isotopic
tracer studies of geological, biogeochemical and environmental processes. The
instrumentation will consist of a dual inlet, continuous-flow stable isotope
ratio mass spectrometer and several prep-systems (i.e., a multi-preparation
headspace gas handling system, a high-temperature conversion elemental analyzer,
and a gas chromatograph combustion device). The prep-systems will be interfaced
to the mass spectrometer so as to maximize the efficiency of sample analysis and
better meet the needs of research and teaching at Florida State University (FSU)
and neighboring Florida A &amp; M University (FAMU). The instrumentation will be
capable of on-line measurements of stable isotopic ratios of carbon, oxygen,
nitrogen and hydrogen in bulk organic and inorganic samples as well as in
individual compounds. These measurements are critical in studies undertaken by
the PIs and their students including determination of paleodiet, study of paleo-
oceanography, reconstruction of paleoecology and paleoclimate, examination of
carbon and nutrient cycling in soils, forests and wetland ecosystems,
investigation of food web and trophic interactions, and study of methane
oxidation in wetlands and landfills. The mass spectrometer will be housed in the
Geochemistry Facility at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL) and
will provide routine analytical capabilities needed to support existing programs
in Earth and environmental sciences at FSU and neighboring FAMU. The
Geochemistry Facility at the NHMFL provides a modern environment for isotopic
studies and is available to scientists and students from local neighborhood and
from around the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
