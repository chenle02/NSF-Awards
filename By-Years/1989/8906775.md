This is an instrumentation proposal for the acquisition of a flow cytometer. A
unique characteristic of this instrument is its capability to measure cellular
parameters at a single cell level. This is achieved by passing the cells in a
single file through a flow chamber. Depending on the types of sensing devices
that are installed with the instrument, various kinds of cellular components can
be measured. The instrument will be shared by four research groups within the
Department of Chemical Engineering at Rice University and includes interactions
with investigators in Biochemistry at Rice, and several groups in cell biology
at the Texas Medical Center. The research topics involved include: - Dynamics of
immune systems - Study of host/plasmid interactions in recombinant populations -
Stess effects on intracellular metabolism of mammalian cells - Receptor
mediation of leukocyte/endothelial cell interactions - Characterization of
population heterogeneity inhairy root cultures
