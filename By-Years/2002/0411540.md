SGER: Wireless Techniques for Architecture and Fault
Tolerance&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will investigate the viability of
using wireless communication as a side-channel for communication in a computer
system to increase performance and reliability. The advantages of the scheme are
the reduction in the complexity and cost of auxiliary copper wiring and omni-
directional communication. Suitable bandwidth-appropriate functions such as
cache block updates, multiprocessor cache coherence, on-line fault diagnosis,
and expandable memory will be the target for initial performance and reliability
improvements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this work we will investigate the
feasibility of wireless side-channel communication for a number of different
promising functions, and identify architectural design and implementation
tradeoffs. Long-term efforts are directed towards transforming computer systems
by the use of a hierarchy of communication technologies.&lt;br/&gt;
