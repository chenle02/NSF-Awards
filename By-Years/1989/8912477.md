This award will support Professor Martin Uman of the University of Florida in
collaboration with Professor Carlo Mazzetti of the University of Rome and
Professor Carlo Nucci of the University of Bologna, Italy. The investigators
intend to develop the best possible lightning return-stroke model with which to
calculate lightning-induced voltages on power lines; and to test and improve,
given the electric and magnetic fields from the return- stroke model, the
available power line coupling models in order to arrive at an optimum one. Due
to the large diffusion of sensitive solid state electronic devices in control
and regulation systems of power and telecom- munications lines, the problem of
induced voltages by nearby lightning strokes is of increasing concern. In this
work, experimental data on lightning-induced power line voltages and associated
electric and magnetic fields from nearby natural lightning and from artificially
initiated lightning (via rocket triggering), will form the bulk of the data
base. The collabora- tion, which will involve theoretical studies done in
cooperation with Swiss researchers, will complement both experimental and
theoretical research performed at the University of Florida.
