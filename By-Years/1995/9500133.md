9500133 Szeri Grinding is used on a significant percentage of precision products
made in the US, and is the preferred machining technique for ceramics and
composites. High temperatures on the surface of the grits and the materials
being ground can lead to thermal damage or dimensional changes in precision
components, premature wear of abrasives. This project's goal is to predict the
temperature field that a workpiece surface experiences when it is ground with a
coolant emulsion. The technical approach is to model the flow and heat transfer
that occurs at the grinding interface between the abrasive wheel and workpiece
by treating oil-in-water coolants as a homogeneous mixture. Because this is a
difficult modeling problem, a experimental program to verify the model
predictions using an existing experimental rig. The research will be a
collaborative effort involving the University of Delaware, the University of
Pittsburgh, NIST, Eaton Corp.'s Research Center and Norton Co. The application
and impact of these results are: prevention of thermal damage that can lead to
premature failure of precision parts, higher productivity due to better control
of the wear of expensive abrasives, and shorter lead times in setting up new
abrasive processes. An analytical model may also be a way of assessing if it is
possible to eliminate a fluid, thereby eliminating the environmental cost of
disposal. ***
