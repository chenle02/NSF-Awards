This one year award will support U.S.-U.K. cooperative research in fluid
mechanics between Harindra Fernando of Arizona State University and Julian C. R.
Hunt of the University of Cambridge. The objective of their research is an
investigation of turbulence within and near density interfaces. The theoretical
and numerical work conducted by researchers at the University of Cambridge and
the British Meteorological Office will be complemented by laboratory experiments
at Arizona State University. Turbulent flow configurations are replete in
nature, and turbulent mixing plays a dominant role in heat and mass balances in
oceans and the atmosphere. The proposed research will study turbulence when it
is subjected to (1) differential turbulent forcing from contiguous turbulent
layers of unequal intensities and (2) velocity shear. The results of the
research will advance understanding of turbulent mixing across environmental
density interfaces and enhance capabilities for parameterization of sub-grid
scale processes in oceanic and atmospheric General Circulation Models.
