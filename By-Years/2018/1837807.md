The grant provides travel support to students and junior faculty to attend
ESEC/FSE, the result of a recent merger of two, top-tier conferences in Software
Engineering -- the International Symposium on the Foundations of Software
Engineering (FSE) and its European counterpart, the European Software
Engineering Conference (ESEC)). The travel support is aimed at attendees of the
Doctoral Symposium and first-time attendees, who will participate in a
mentorship program provided by the organizers. The grant enables participants to
engage in technical exchange of information and research
conversations/collaborations leading to advances the field. Participation is an
important education, training and mentoring experience. The international nature
of this conference helps develop a globally-aware workforce of research and
educators within the US and helps build the community of researchers in the
field of Software Engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
