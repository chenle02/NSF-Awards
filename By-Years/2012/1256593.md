This is an exploratory project to investigate, prototype, and demonstrate a
computational framework for developing science mission games or game-based
virtual worlds. Mission-oriented science is a sizable part of the national
agenda for research and development within many science, technology,
engineering, or mathematically based disciplines. These missions are complex
endeavors that articulate a life cycle of recurring socio-technical and
economics-driven processes, such as mission planning, vehicle and payload or
instrument design, launch, transit, arrival, landing and deployment, resources
collection, return, and debriefing. Increasingly, students, teachers,
scientists, engineers, technicians, and others need to become aware of, gain
knowledge about, and ultimately encourage support and enthusiasm for new
scientific missions. This research will articulate such a framework and provide
a proof of concept mockups or prototypes for science mission games that employ
this new framework. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results can serve as the basis for
developing new research projects of interest to specific science research
agencies or programs for creating new, mission-specific science games. Such
games represent a new medium for communicating, educating, and engaging a new
generation of people interested in new science missions and scientific grand
challenges. By design, the approach must be science domain-independent, and a
reusable computational framework for producing extensible science mission games
would represent a new, high-value engine for innovation that serves to address
the new grand challenges for science and technology, and to advance the
collective societal mission of producing, sharing, and applying new scientific
knowledge and technological practice within and across science
disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mission-oriented science computer games
provide game-play mechanics and play experiences that help players to (1) gain
awareness, (2) acquire scientific knowledge, or (3) participate in customizing
and extending the specified details of a scientific mission or exploratory
expedition in a specific domain of interest. Such games can afford opportunities
for the public to gain awareness of the mission and its potential consequences,
for students to learn about the scientific foundations that characterize the
domain or mission challenges, and for domain specialists or citizen enthusiasts
to participate in articulating, refining, and optimizing the scope, scale,
efficiency, and effectiveness of such science missions.
