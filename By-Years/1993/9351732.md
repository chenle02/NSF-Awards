The project involves development of a Biochemistry course within the Chemistry
Department. The course will introduce will ultimately be composed of five
modules which will include: l) purification of >-galactosidase from Ecoli; 2)
cloning of the gene for this protein; 3) preparation of site directed mutants to
investigate the mechanism of this protein; 4) use of steady state and presteady
state kinetics as probes of the mechanism of this enzyme. The fifth module will
be developed by each student with the assistance and input from the instructor.
