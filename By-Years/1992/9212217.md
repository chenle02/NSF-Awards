Partial financial support is requested for the URSI Commission G International
Symposium on "A Decade of Advances in Radiowave Probing of the High-latitude
Ionosphere and Atmosphere" to be held at the Geophysical Institute of the
University of Alaska Fairbanks from 10-14 August 1992. This symposium is timely
to assess what has been learned during the past ten years and to consider the
application and significance of new facilities. Most of the papers will be
published in a special issue of Radio Science similar to what was done for the
comparable August, 1982 meeting (Radio Science (18, Nov.-Dec., 1983).
