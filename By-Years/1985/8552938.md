The P.I. is involved with a wide range of problems fundamental to the
developing understanding of the nature of computation. He is extending the range
of application of the algebraic methods and the randomization procedures he and
his coauthors have developed for obtaining efficient algorithms. Two examples of
algorithms sought are: (1) a deterministic parallel algorithm for the maximum
matching problem, and (2) a randomized algorithm for approximating the permanent
of a matrix. He is also continuing his investigation of the complexity of
computational problems that have received previous attention. Two examples of
such problems are: (1) determining whether a directed graph has an even length
cycle, and (2) the shortest vector problem. The use of randomized reducibilities
is being explored as a tool for dealing with this second problem. The P.I. has
been judged to be an outstanding computer scientist by the Presidential Young
Investigator Panel.
