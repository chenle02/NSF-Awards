To maximize performance, modern processors attempt to execute as many
instructions as possible in parallel. This requires the use of branch predictors
to guess which instructions will be executed next in an effort to keep the
processor busy. However, the penalty associated with incorrectly guessed branch
outcomes has a great impact on performance. Despite being studied extensively
and improved steadily over the past two decades, branch prediction remains to be
critical for achieving high performance and low power.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project introduces a new direction in the design of
branch predictors by providing insights into why branch predictors fail in
predicting specific instances of dynamic branches. The research focuses on
developing Complementary Branch Predictors (CBP), which can be added to any
conventional branch predictor (BP). CBPs intelligently track the branches that
are incorrectly predicted by a BP. A CBP complements the BP by providing
corrective predictions for when and where a BP fails to predict the correct
path. Given that modern BPs are already highly accurate, CBPs end up providing
corrective predictions for the hardest-to-predict branches. Consequently,
tightly-coupled BPs and CBPs form a new class of branch predictors that are
fast, highly-accurate and power-efficient. This research explores the design
space of this new class of branch predictors to achieve higher performance,
lower power, and lower hardware budget.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The findings from
this project have the potential to significantly change the design of future
branch predictors. The PI will collaborate with industry partners to further
increase the broader impact. The research will engage graduate and undergraduate
students and promote the participation of underrepresented groups.
