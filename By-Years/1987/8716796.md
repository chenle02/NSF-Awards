Many hemoproteins, ranging from oxygen-carriers and electron- carries to heme
enzymes, utilize protoheme as their prosthetic group. Since the primary and
three-dimensional structures have been determined for a number of representative
hemoproteins, it becomes feasible to analyze and rationally predict a
correlation between the molecular structure and biochemical functions.
Cytochrome c peroxidase (CCP) was the first heme enzyme whose crystal structure
was determined. This allows a direct structural comparision of a heme enzyme
with well established hemoproteins such as myoglobin, hemoglobin and the
cytochromes to examine the structural basis for their functional diversity. Dr.
Yonetani will investigate the spectroscopic, kinetic and enzymic properties of
native and metal-substituted cytochrome c peroxidases and their interaction with
cytochrome c. He is especially interested in probing the electronic and
structural features of cytochrome peroxidase, particularly the prosthetic group
and its environment, that can be correlated with the unique reactivity of the
enzyme with hydroperoxides. This should further the understanding of the
mechanism of electron transfer between two hemoproteins.
