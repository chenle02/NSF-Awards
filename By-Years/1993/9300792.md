This project will study and classify the kinds of large-scale restructuring of
the global solar field which are related to Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs). CMEs
involve large-scale restructuring of the corona and the ejection of large
amounts of mass and energy into the heliosphere. However, we know very little
about how or where CMEs originate or how they develop, so it is important to
understand their relationship to the large-scale magnetic fields patterns near
the solar surface and in the low corona. We propose a two-part approach to this
problem. First, we will study the source locations of Skylab and SMM CMEs
determined by mapping them onto synoptic maps for each solar rotation. Such maps
are now available tracing the large-scale global magnetic fields from the
photosphere, through the chromosphere, and into the corona. When stacked in
time-series, such maps reveal large-scale patters of convergence, divergence and
shear of the fields. Second, the locations of these CMEs will be compared with
white light synoptic maps and daily coronagraphic images to determine the
relationship of CMEs to preexisting coronal streamers. This project will enhance
our understanding of the physics of solar activity, especially CMEs, of the
structure and evolution of the corona, and or the propagation of large-scale
disturbances through the heliosphere.
