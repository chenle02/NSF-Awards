This SBIR Phase I research proposal will develop a novel, spring-based actuator
that will power future wearable robots and exoskeletons. The actuator will be
designed, developed, and tested to meet the demanding requirements for lower
limb mobility. This actuator can be used in a variety of powered orthoses,
prosthetic devices, and wearable exoskeletons. Its unique ability to tune
stiffness allows it to be customized to an individual, a significant impact in
the wearable robotics field. An additional benefit of the actuator is to solve
the problem of converting rotary motion into linear motion in a lightweight
package. It will meet the demanding design requirements that include the
tradeoffs between high power, low energy usage, compliance, robust sensing of
forces, and high cycle demands. The proposed activity will lay the groundwork
for the development of the next generation of rehabilitation aids for lower limb
mobility. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of powered, lower-limb exoskeletons
is to enhance the strength and performance of the person who wears it. In the
case of gait assistance such a device will increase symmetry and duration of
walking. In fact, a below-the-knee amputee wearing a passive prosthetic device
typically uses more energy to walk and presents asymmetry in their motion as
compared to an able bodied walker. This asymmetry in gait leads to joint pain,
arthritis, and back pain. Because of the difficulty to walk, their conditions
often lead to a more sedentary lifestyle decreasing their already limited
mobility. It is documented that decreased mobility increases health risks.
