Abstract

Proposal Title: New Faculty CAREER Development Workshop Proposal Number:
CTS-0220440 Principal Investigator: Timothy Anderson Institution: University of
Florida

This CAREER workshop is intended to provide outreach to institutions that have
not traditionally received a large number CAREER awards. The PI has planned a
CAREER proposal-writing workshop in conjunction with a Southeastern Universities
and Colleges Coalition for Engineering Education (SUCCEED) Regional Conference
to be held on March 3, 2002 at the The University of Florida Doubletree Hotel
and Conference Center in Gainesville, Florida. It is a general goal of the
CAREER program to achieve a broader diversity of proposing individuals and
institutions. The establishment of regional workshops for young investigators is
one method of accomplishing this goal. The PI has invited young faculty from
about 40 schools in the southeastern region. Institutions in most of the
southeastern states are invited to send representatives. Funding will provide
travel grants for the participants. This workshop is intended to help young PIs
become more competitive in receiving initial grants, especially CAREER awards.
In addition, the PIs will be invited to stay for the remainder of the SUCCEED
conference (March 3 - 5), which will focus on educational issues such as
teaching effectiveness, mentoring, and assessment.
