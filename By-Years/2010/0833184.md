North Carolina Central University (NCCU) proposes to establish a CREST
Computational Center for Fundamental and Applied Science and Education (CCFASE)
to provide the framework required for the conception and execution of
interdisciplinary research and education in the College of Science and
Technology (CST). The center will combine state-of-the-art research and
development with an infrastructure essential to address some of the most
important questions in modern physics and materials science through five
projects: 1) Computer modeling, design, and formation of novel nanostructured
materials and nanodevices; (2) Low-energy few-nucleon interactions: computer
simulations for experimental development, data analysis, and rigorous
calculations for three nucleon models; (3) Study of hyperon-hyperon and hyperon-
nucleon interactions; (4) Intelligent systems and robotics; and (5) Integrative
Geophysical Investigation of the New Madrid Seismic Zone. The proposed Center
will enhance the participation of minority students in science, technology,
engineering, and mathematics (STEM) areas, where they are critically
underrepresented. In addition to fundamental advances in science, the CREST will
train a qualified technology work force of highly-skilled people from minority
and socially underrepresented groups. The Center involves 17 senior
investigators from five NCCU STEM departments and scientists from Duke
University, Cornell University, and the Center for Earthquake Research and
Information at the University of Memphis, and Jefferson National Laboratory. The
investigators propose to create an HBCU computational science network will that
will increase the opportunities for student participation in advanced research
and will facilitate the collaboration among HBCU faculty and students with
research institutions and industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
