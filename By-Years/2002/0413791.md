Manuel Leal&lt;br/&gt;Research Starter Grant "Teasing apart the contribution of
color and motion toward the efficiency of visual signal
displays"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lay abstract:&lt;br/&gt;Visual signals used
during social interactions commonly incorporate motion and color in their
design. These signals are used to transmit information, which influences the
behavior of the interacting animals. Surprisingly, we know very little about the
effect of color and motion in signal detection, and even less about how changes
of one of the signal components influences signal efficiency (i.e., detection
ability) and content (i.e., information ability). The multicomponent signal
hypothesis predicts that an increase in efficiency is achieved by the
simultaneous stimulation of two or more sensory pathways, resulting in an
increase in the ability of the receiver to detect and recognize the signal. This
study will examine the contribution of motion and color patterns to the
efficiency of visual signals in the lizard Anolis krugi. Experimental
manipulations of the signal design, motion, and color pattern will be conducted
to test the role of these components on signal efficiency and signal
content.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will be one of only a handful of
studies to directly test the multiple signal hypothesis in visual signals. The
findings will contribute not only to basic scientific knowledge in the area of
animal communication, but also to improving our knowledge of the interaction
between color and motion on visual perception. Furthermore, the fundamental
principles which control how detectable visual stimuli are in lizards are
similar to those which control visual target visibility in vertebrate visual
systems; thus, these studies can provide important insights into the ways in
which vertebrate visual systems process moving, colored
signals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
