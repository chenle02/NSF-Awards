This grant will support early career mathematicians from the US to attend St.
Petersburg School in Probability and Statistical Physics, to take place in June
2012 at the Chebyshev Laboratory at St. Petersburg State University, Russia.
This event is devoted to the most recent advances in the area of spatial
probability and to classical areas with current increase of activity. The topics
of the school are of a very general interest and concern random walks in random
environments, random growth models and random graphs, Gaussian free fields and
other spatial random processes as well as random matrices, concentration of
measure and Markov chains. With the impressive program of lecture courses and
invited talks given by the world-leading experts and more than 120 carefully
selected participants, this School will be one of major events in the field of
spatial probability in 2012.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spatial probability
is a wide area on the border of modern probability theory and statistical
physics that studies certain types of spatial random processes and in
particular, the dynamics of complex stochastic systems. The questions that draw
a lot of permanent attention include description of phase transitions of such
systems, their behavior at criticality, and universality of this behavior. The
progress of the last decade shows deep connections between many fundamental
models in this field, for example percolation and Ising model, and the other
branches of mathematics and physics.
