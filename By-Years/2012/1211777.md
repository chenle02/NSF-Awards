This collaborative program will conduct a multi-year project to make precise
measurements of the large scale structure of the universe using recently
developed 21 cm intensity mapping techniques. The program will create spectral
maps of 500 square degrees, spanning the frequency range 700 to 900 MHz (0.58
&lt; z &lt; 1). The principal goal is to measure the baryon acoustic oscillation
feature at these redshifts in an innovative program which is complementary to,
and competitive with, optical galaxy surveys. The acoustic scale provides a
standard ruler which measures the Universe's expansion, providing an
observational handle on Dark Energy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the
work include training of graduate student, and outreach to the public via a
planetarium show called "The Hydrogen Sky" produced in English, French and
Chinese, and distributed worldwide. Additional outreach activities include tours
of the night sky through the Universe in the Park program in Wisconsin and
teaching electronics to under-represented groups through CMU's Summer Academy
for Math and Science.
