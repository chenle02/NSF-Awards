This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY2001.
The goal of the fellowship is to prepare minority scientists for positions of
scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the
fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training of the highest
quality to recent doctoral recipients. This program is an effort by the NSF to
increase the number of research scientists from underrepresented minority
groups, thereby contributing to the future vitality of the Nation's scientific
enterprise. It is expected that Fellows trained through these fellowships will
play important roles in training of the future workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Analysis of a
host-selective toxin gene, ToxB, from the fungus that causes tan spot disease on
wheat." Toxin production is one strategy that fungi use to infect plants. The
fungus, Pyrenophora tritici-repentis, is a pathogen of wheat due to the
production of host-selective toxins. To better understand how this pathogen
interacts with its host, this research is characterizing a toxin gene (ToxB) and
its protein product(s). A similar gene (toxb) from non-pathogenic fungal
isolates is also being cloned and evaluated in comparison to the pathogenic
form.
