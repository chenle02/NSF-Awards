The principal investigator will conduct research in four areas: 1) development
and application of statistical methods for identifying and interpreting unusual
molecular sequence features and studies on related probability limit theorems of
various functionals on random letter sequences; 2) statistical studies of
inhomogeneities in DNA sequences; 3) mathematical modeling in evolutionary
processes; and 4) total positivity and applications in probability, statistics
and analysis. The first two topics will have impact on molecular biology studies
and data analysis.
