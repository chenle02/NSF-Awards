The homing of salmon to the rivers where they originated is one of the great
mysteries of animal behavior. It is known that young salmon learn the odors of
their home river and seek these odors when they return as adults. However, it is
not known whether they retrace a sequence of odors or merely seek the odor that
they experienced prior to seaward migration. It is also not known whether they
can learn odors only at specific developmental stages or at any time during
their period of freshwaterresidence. To help resolve these questions, Dr. Quinn
and his colleagues reared juvenile coho salmon and exposed them to the odors of
the University of Washington's hatchery at specific times and developmental
stages in 1988. They were released from another hatchery and are expected to
return as adults in fall 1989 and 1990. Depending on where the salmon from the
different experimental groups return, Dr. Quinn hopes to determine the ways in
which they learned the odors of their environment as young fish and how they use
these odors to return years later. Homing is an essential feature of the life
history of salmon. Knowledge of the patterns of behavior underlying homing will
enhance the ability to protect and rehabilitate populations of these extremely
valuable fishes.
