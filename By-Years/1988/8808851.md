This research will study the geometry and combinatorics of the d-cube,
particularly as these relate to optimization problems. Previous work in this
area has been motivated by linear programming problems. The framework used in
the present work will be pseudo-Boolean functions. A list of specific problems
that can be stated in terms of optimizing pseudo-Boolean functions will be
compiled. Similarities in the combinatorial properties of the pseudo-Boolean
functions will be explored.
