Faults and duplexes are two major structures which contribute to the internal
structure of thin-skinned fold-and-thrust wedges and the deformation of masses
of layered sedimentary rock. Detailed observations of these structures from
well-exposed outcrops in the central Appalachians provide the basis for a
theoretical study. Emphasis is placed on mechanical analysis based on the theory
for the deformation of an anisotropic cohesive Coulomb material. Theoretical
results will be developed for the following three topics. (1) The interaction
between intersecting wedge faults and bed-parallel faults, which controls the
initiation and propagation of thrust faults in layered rock. This requires
solutions for converget flow in wedge-shaped regions. (2) The initiation of
duplex structures by analysis of flow instability in a confined layer. (3) The
nature and orientation of velocity characteristics in an anisotropic plastic
solid is determined and used to interpret the mechanical natures of thrust
faults, kink bands, and the hinges of fault- bend folds. The analogs of these
structutes in layer-parallel extension will also be studied, and the results
applied to the interpretation of available field observations.
