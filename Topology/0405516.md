Abstract

Award: DMS-0405516 Principal Investigator: Paul Seidel

The main aim of the project is to harness the power of Fukaya categories for use
in symplectic topology. This includes developing computational tools, building a
repertoire of nontrivial examples, and also studying the relationship between
Fukaya categories and Gromov-Witten invariants. Concrete examples that will be
looked at include: Fukaya categories of Riemann surfaces; Lagrangian
submanifolds in cotangent bundles; and the symplectic geometry of Khovanov's
link invariants. Various aspects of mirror symmetry will be important sources of
intuition, and the experience gained in this way should ultimately feed back
into a better understanding of mirror symmetry itself, especially its
homological aspects.

From a wider perspective, the project is part of the reaction of the scientific
community to recent advances in theoretical physics. The contribution that
mathematics can make is to verify the soundness and consistency of physical
intuition, and to prepare the general ground on which further development can
occur. This is particularly important in those situations where developments in
physics suggest the presence of deep and complex structures, which are difficult
to detect by direct experiment. A nice aspect is that the same circle of ideas
allows one to answer some purely mathematical (geometric) questions inspired by
the "old" physics of classical mechanics.
