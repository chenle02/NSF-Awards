The Midwest Geometry Conference is taking place at the University of Oklahoma on
January 17-18, 2015. The conference is designed to enhance both the educational
and the research opportunities of the active community of mathematicians working
in the field of geometry in the Midwest and the surrounding states. This award
supports participation in the conference, which features a wide spectrum of
research topics of current interest. The main aim is to create a focused
environment, conducive to a lively exchange of ideas, in which members of this
regional community can benefit from each other's ideas, and from contact with
leading geometers from outside the region.

The conference will highlight recent developments and new research directions in
a number of areas that include: p-harmonic geometry, Lie groups and geometric
representation theory, Lp cohomology and nonlinear Hodge theory, geometry and
topology of submanifolds, uniqueness in analysis, geometry and topology,
geometric flows, stable minimal varieties, complex and Riemannian geometry,
metric and differential geometry, conformal geometry, algebraic geometry,
geometric measure theory, partial differential equations, geometric function
theory, several complex variables, symplectic geometry, mathematical physics,
and related problems. Both well-established researchers and promising junior
researchers in the field will present talks at the meeting. More information can
be found on the conference web page http://www.math.ou.edu/mgc20/
