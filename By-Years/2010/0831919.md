NeTS-NECO: A New Resource Management Paradigm for Sensor Networks with Energy
Replacement (Principal Investigators: Ness B. Shroff, Emre Koksal, and Prasun
Sinha)

Recent advances in sensor networks have resulted in a unique capability to
remotely sense the environment. These networks can be used to sense natural as
well as human-created phenomena (e.g., earthquake, fires, troop movements,
radioactive substances). These systems could be deployed in remote or hard-to-
reach areas, hence, it is critical that such networks operate unattended for
long durations. To that end, new developments in the areas of renewable energy
sources suggest that this is feasible. However, the design and control of sensor
networks with the added dimension of renewable energy makes the problem of
managing these networks challenging and substantially different from their non-
replenishment counterparts. The goal of the project is to understand the
performance limits of sensor networks with replenishment, to develop simple
distributed algorithms and protocols that approach these limits, and validate
and fine-tune the results based on experimentation. This ambitious endeavor will
be accomplished by a team that brings in expertise that spans physical layer
communications, distributed algorithms, control theory, resource allocation,
sensor networking, and implementation.

Broader Impact: Given that sensor nodes with replenishment are an emerging
technology, the techniques developed in this project have the potential to make
a significant impact on emerging industry sectors. The PIs will actively share
their results by giving academic and industrial seminars and facilitating
student internships. Students on this project will learn a wide range of
theoretical and experimental methodologies to prepare them for the workforce.
The PIs will continue their efforts to recruit and train under-represented
students.
