EAR-0229987&lt;br/&gt;Shen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is to pursue
experimental studies of (1) high pressure melting behavior of candidate core
materials, and (2) the properties of core-forming liquids at high pressure and
high temperature using new synchrotron x-ray diffraction and absorption methods.
For the proposed melting studies, the investigators will use the technique they
established of identifying the onset of melting by the appearance of diffuse
x-ray scattering from the melt with the simultaneous absence of crystalline
diffraction. Research will be conducted on core materials using a double-sided
laser heated diamond anvil cell system combined with an area detector and
synchrotron x-ray beam. At the same time, the melting studies will lead to
measurements of diffuse scattering of melts at high pressures by the brilliant
synchrotron x-ray beam, providing important information on the local structure
of melts and, further, the understanding of related macroscopic properties.
Using monochromatic x-ray absorption, densities of core forming liquids at high
pressure-temperature conditions will be determined, resulting in pressure-
volume-temperature equations of state for melts in the Earth's deep interior.
The success of these measurements will provide (1) melting curves for iron and
iron alloys, (2) the structure and density of amorphous iron at high pressures
and at room temperature, (3) the structure of crystalline iron phase near
melting and the local structure of melts above melting, and (4) densities of
melts (e.g., Fe-FeS) at high pressures. Combined these results will provide
crucial constraints for dynamic, thermal and chemical differentiation models of
the Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-- &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
