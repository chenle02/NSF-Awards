This Research Opportunities for Women Reseach Planning Grant (ROW/RPG) in the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program supports the research efforts of
Professor Robin Helburn of Northern Arizona University which are aimed at
characterizing environmentally important humic materials. The focus of this
research is the characterization of the hydrophobic binding properties of these
dissolved and colloidal phase materials using spectroscopic dyes. A series of
polarity-sensitive indicators will be used to probe the relative lipophilicity
of binding environments in natural humic acids, and in lignin- and petroleum-
based surfactants, all of which have solute transport capabilities. In a
separate study, these indicators will be used to monitor the formation of
organic aggregates as induced by divalent cations. This project combines the
PI's background in environmental analytical chemistry and her expertise in
chemometrics with her interest in these complex heterogeneous substances. In
addition to initiating this female scientist's research program in environmental
chemistry, support of this project will complement the established undergraduate
research program at Northern Arizona University.
