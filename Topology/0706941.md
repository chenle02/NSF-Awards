Professor Damon?s research will concern the geometry, topology and deformation
properties of singular structures, including stratified sets, mappings, and
nonisolated singularities, and the application of these results to develop
geometric methods for problems in computer imaging. This includes applying
methods from singularity theory to determine from an underlying "skeletal/medial
structure" the local, relative and global geometric properties of a region in
Euclidean space and its boundary. Second, he is developing, in joint work, a new
method for finding intersection of spline surfaces for geometric modeling.
Third, he is developing methods to characterize local features of objects in
natural images which include lighting, geometric features, and viewer movement.
Professor Damon will further develop his results on skeletal and medial
structures to: understand the behavior of multiple medial structures in a
collection of complementary regions or objects with geometric and physical
interaction. This will allow the time evolution of such objects, and enlarge the
class of allowable structures to include degeneracies. These ideas will be used
for investigating statistical properties of geometrical features for shape.
Second, Professor Damon will further develop methods for following the evolution
of intersection curves under flows of spline surfaces and apply them to give a
new method for computing the medial axis of regions with boundaries defined by
splines. Third, he will apply his methods to complete, in joint research, the
analysis of local features in natural images allowing shade/shadow and
specularity, geometric features, and movement of either viewpoint or light
source. He will further begin developing algorithms with imaging scientists for
their implementation.

Professor Damon?s research will further investigate properties of spaces used to
model objects and regions, and systems of equations which provide understanding
of properties of geometric spaces and their representations. These methods will
be applied to several problems in computer imaging. The first method will be
used for modeling multiple objects and their interaction, including statistical
properties of such collections. This method will allow for degeneracies of the
structures, and these resulting models will be used for analyzing interaction of
regions in medical images. These same methods will also be used for
understanding the evolution of intersections of deforming objects with
applications to geometric modeling. Third, he will analyze the properties of
equations which can be used to model the images of objects in natural images,
where lighting and viewpoint affect the appearance of geometric features of
objects. These results will be used in joint work with computer scientists to
develop procedures for identifying objects in images.
