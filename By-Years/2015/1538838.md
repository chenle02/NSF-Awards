This award provides student travel support for the 36th ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on
Programming Language Design and Implementation (PLDI 2015) that will held from
June 13-17, 2015 in Portland, Oregon. PLDI is the top technical forum for the
presentation of new and exciting advances in programming languages and compiler
research. The symposium covers a wide range of topics in the field, including:
Language designs and extensions; Static and dynamic analysis of programs,
Domain-specific languages and tools; Type systems and program logics; Program
transformation and optimization; Checking or improving the security or
correctness of programs; Memory management; Parallelism, both implicit and
explicit; Performance analysis, evaluation, and tools; Novel programming models;
Debugging techniques and tools; Program understanding; Interaction of
compilers/runtimes with underlying systems; Program synthesis. Students will be
able to attend all events associated with the conference, and a rich set of
workshops and tutorials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NSF support ensures
participation of US students while paying attention to underrepresented groups.
To broaden participation, the grant is intended specifically to increase the
number of students who cannot otherwise attend, that is, students who do not
have any financial support whatsoever, e.g., from their advisors, departments,
universities. The broader impacts include building international community and
cooperation in the research areas of the conference, and enhancing education of
students with exposure to and interaction with leading-edge research and
researchers. This award will therefore help train the next generation of
language designers, compiler implementers and systems researchers.
