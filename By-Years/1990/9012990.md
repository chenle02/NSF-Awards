Dr. Diamond is writing a biography of Charlotte Friend, a distinguished pioneer
in the study of viral oncology and cell differentiation. Friend made two seminal
discoveries that had a major impact on our understanding of the cancer process.
At a time when the concept that viruses could cause cancer was still viewed with
skepticism, she isolated a virus that produced a fatal leukemia in mice. She
later showed that tumor cells such as those induced by her virus could be
stimulated to differentiate into normal cells and lose their potential to
divide. This study is being made within the scientific, intellectual and social
contexts of Dr. Friend's time. Among the themes being examined by Dr. Diamond
are the influence of Friend's discoveries on modern cancer research, the
challenge and joy of discovery, the struggle to have one's unorthodox
observations accepted, and the importance in this struggle for acceptance of
having strong personal and institutional support. Another theme of significance
for this story is that of women's conflict between family life and a life in
science. All of these developments are framed by the "molecular revolution" and
the cognitive/technical development of Friend's research within the changing
intellectual landscape of biomedicine in the DNA era. This biography should be
of interest to scientists, historians and laymen and an inspiration to young men
and women who aspire to an exciting life in science.
