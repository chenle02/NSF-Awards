This grant provides support for a workshop on Sensing and Prognostics for
Scalability of Nanomanufacturing. The goal of the proposed workshop is to
develop a national agenda and a road map for sensing and prognostics research to
address the quality and reliability issues encountered in scaling up lab-based
nano processes to high volume nanomanufacturing. It will bring together academic
experts, industry and national laboratory leaders, and government policy makers
to look at currently available field data and to develop a research agenda.
Current research is focused on the science and engineering of the nano processes
and there is an urgent need to address production issues now in order for high-
rate/high-volume nanomanufacturing to become a reality. The outcomes of the
workshop can be used nationwide to promote sensing and quality/reliability
programs in nanomanufacturing and to stimulate related research
activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expected outcomes of the workshop are an
examination of the current landscape and research in nanomanufacturing so as to
identify the sensing and quality/reliability research needs in nanomanufacturing
and the development of a national agenda and roadmap for nano sensing and
quality/reliability research in nanomanufacturing. This will allow for the field
to move from the lab to commercialization. The results will be widely
disseminated. &lt;br/&gt;
