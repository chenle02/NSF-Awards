With this award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research program and the
Major Research Instrumentation program, Berea College will acquire an X-ray
Diffractometer (XRD) for materials research undergraduate research and
education. The scientific research is focussed on the study of high temperature
superconductivity, colossal magnetoresistance and magnetic transitions in
perovskites and ruthenites. The program includes materials synthesis and
characterization using Mossbauer spectroscopy. The XRD will enhance the
materials characterization capability at this undergraduate institution. The
instrument will also be used for training undergraduate students, including
students from underrepresented groups at this EPSCoR state.
