9321283 Wu The research projects are in the general area of several complex
variables and Riemannian geometry. The main focus will be on classes of
holomorphic symmetric 2-tensor fields called holmets. These can be used to study
the analytic and geometric properties of complex manifolds, in particular,
embedded submanifolds of complex Euclidean spaces. Other topics proposed entail
curvature properties of bounded domains in complex spaces. This research has
potential applications to algebraic geometry and complex analysis. ***
