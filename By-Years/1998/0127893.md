Cities.&lt;br/&gt;NSF/USDOT: Real-time collision Warning at Traffic
Intersections&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collisions between vehicles at urban and
rural intersections account for nearly a third of all reported crashes in the
United States. This research entails developing some of the components of a
real-time system which uses cameras to continuously gather traffic data at
intersections (e.g., vehicle speeds, positions, trajectories,
accelerations/decelerations, vehicle sizes, signal status, etc.), applies
efficient algorithmic techniques to detect potential collisions and near-misses,
and then issues suitable countermeasures. At this stage, the goal is to
establish the feasibility of this approach using both computer simulations and
field tests at actual intersections (urban intersections in the Twin Cities---
Minneapolis and St. Paul, MN). The proposed work has as main emphasis the design
of efficient and robust computer vision and collision-detection algorithms that
can address the intersection collision warning problem.&lt;br/&gt;
