Abstract&lt;br/&gt;August 7, 2003&lt;br/&gt;ITR: Solution Phase Computation with
Enzymatic Networks&lt;br/&gt;Darko Stefanovic&lt;br/&gt;Columbia University&lt;b
r/&gt;03248845&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Communication between
oligonucleotide-scale logic gates based on phosphodiesterase and ligase
enzymatic reactions as well as nanoparticle beads is being investigated in order
to achieve scalable and robust molecular computation that can be applied to
contol of autonomous molecular devices. In particular, medium-scale feedforward
(cascaded) and feedback circuits and programmable arrays are being designed and
evaluated in the laboratory. The circuits being developed include oscillators,
clocks, flip-flop memories, and counters with internal error correction.
Applications of these circuits for engineering properties of cells are being
investigated. Flow-cytometry is being used to develop methodology that will be
able to analyze massively parallel networks of individual computation
elements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through this work, which is interdisciplinary,
and involves circuit design, mathematical modeling, and laboratory work, the
engineering principles needed to synthesize large-scale molecular circuits for
in vitro computations and small circuits for intracellular and in vivo
applications are being developed. Foundations are being laid for applications of
these circuits in molecular autonomous devices which can analyze the environment
and respond in preprogrammed fashion to changes in environment. The
computational strategy which will be implemented in complex networks of digital
logic circuits-will find application in the design of various sorts of synthetic
cellular systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new generation of students from
computer science and biochemistry is being trained to understand and appreciate
the problems and approaches of both disciplines. Also, high-school students are
being introduced through participation in this project to advanced scientific
concepts.&lt;br/&gt;
