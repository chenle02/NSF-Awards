Vision is critical to the survival of many animals, both vertebrates and
invertebrates. This project focuses on the functions of photoreceptors, the
cells in eyes that detect light, and on visual pigments, the proteins in
photoreceptors that first respond to light. The levels and types of visual
pigments in photoreceptors largely determine what animals see. The PI recently
demonstrated that more than one type of visual pigment can be expressed in an
individual photoreceptor. This project tests the novel idea that the relative
levels of visual pigments co-expressed in photoreceptors change in response to
light and darkness and signals from the animal's internal 24 hr clock (circadian
clock). The project makes use of photoreceptors in the horseshoe crab, an
ancient arthropod that has remained mostly unchanged since before the time of
the dinosaurs and whose photoreceptors continue to provide fundamental
information about basic mechanisms of vision. The project applies genetic,
molecular and cell biological approaches to determine how levels of visual
pigments in photoreceptors are regulated under different conditions of light and
darkness and time of day, and biochemical and electrophysiologial approaches to
characterize the spectral sensitivities of the visual pigments and the
photoreceptors in which they are expressed. This project will likely reveal
previously unknown processes that many animals may use to optimize their vision
under different conditions of light and darkness and time of day, and which are
critical for their survival. Furthermore, this project will provide research
training in cell and molecular biology and neurobiology to undergraduate and
high school students drawn largely from underrepresented groups. The PI also has
developed and will continue to oversee a large multi-generational public
outreach program that trains volunteer, adult non-scientists to guide the
science learning of over 5000 local K-8 students each year in animal diversity
and the process of scientific investigation.
