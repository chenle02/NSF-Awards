This project supports the 8th Annual Southeastern-Atlantic Regional
Differential Equations Conference. The participants will represent research
results dealing with theory and applications of ordinary and partial
differential equations, integral and functional equations and related areas.
Applications to diverse subjects such as control theory, population dynamics and
ecological modeling are expected. The conference promotes contacts among
researchers, especially from the general southeastern region and provides a
forum for graduate students to gain exposure to current research trends.
Approximatedly 75 participants are expected to attend the meeting which is
hosted by a different institution each year. The 1988 meeting will be held at
the University of Georgia in November.
