9634227 This award will insure interim preservation of an important collection
of mutant stocks of the domestic chicken, many of which were developed at the
Davis campus. The chicken has been an important model system for basic studies
of development and immunology, as well as studies with medical and agricultural
applications. In addition to support for preservation of existing stocks, the
award will support the activities of a task force convened to develop a long
term plan for preservation of the collection.
