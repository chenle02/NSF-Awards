0117411&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;D'Asaro/UW&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a project
intended to analyze data from two deployments of Lagrangian floats in the
surface mixed layer. One deployment consisted of three floats and the other,
two. It is anticipated that additional data will come from an ONR-funded
experiment in 2002. The intention is to look at the relation between turbulent
kinetic energy in the mixed layer, the structure of mixed layer turbulence, wind
stress, and surface wave activity. The dependence of entrainment rate on wind
and surface waves will also be studied. The approach used involves examining
spectra of w, du/dz, and density perturbations at different levels in the mixed
layer (near the surface, in the interior, and near the base of the mixed layer)
where different dynamics are expected to prevail (surface waves, homogeneous
turbulence, internal waves). The project also includes an attempt to examine
vertical heat and salt budgets. As part of this project, numerical simulations
of the mixed layer, Large-Eddy Simulations will be made. These simulations will
be compared to data derived from the floats with the aim of testing new
parameterizations of the effects of surface waves and of the influence of
stratification on mixed-layer turbulence.&lt;br/&gt;
