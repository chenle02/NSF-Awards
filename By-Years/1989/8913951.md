This grant will support research in experimental condensed matter physics to
measure some of the properties of high temperature superconductors. This grant
was selected from more than 260 proposals submitted in response to a
solicitation for proposals in High Temperature Superconductivity in April, 1989.
This research may provide valuable insight into the physical processes
responsible for the unusual superconducting behavior. This research is supported
through the Condensed Matter Physics Programs with a significant contribution
from the university.
