With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Center for Laser and Optical Spectroscopy at the University of Akron will
acquire a femtosecond/picosecond laser for ultrafast spectroscopic probes of the
structure and excited state dynamics of molecular systems. This equipment will
enhance research in the following areas: 1) time-resolved optical spectroscopy
of novel nanoscale, porphyrin-containing, dendritic photosynthetic mimics; 2)
equilibrium geometries and excited-state dynamics of aromatic clusters; 3) real-
time measurements of intramolecular vibration-energy redistribution (IVR) in OH-
containing molecules; and 4) time-resolved optical spectroscopy of unusual
porphyrins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A femtosecond/picosecond laser
provides ultrafast pulses of coherent visible or infrared light, which enables
researchers to obtain important information about fast occurring chemical
reactions. Its use may enable breakthroughs in our understanding of the
properties of reactive and nonreactive molecules. This laser system will be
available to researchers from a number of neighboring universities and colleges
in Ohio.
