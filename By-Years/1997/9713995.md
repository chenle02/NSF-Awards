Hua Guo at the University of Toledo is supported by the NSF Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program for theoretical investigations of chemical
reaction dynamics. His two major areas of research are iterative methods for
solving generalized eigenproblems and classical trajectory simulations of
surface photochemical processes. New efficient numerical methods will be used to
calculate both bound and resonant spectra of systems of atmospheric and
combustion interest, as well as absorption spectra of predissociative systems.
Surface-aligned photochemical processes will be studied with classical
trajectory simulations of adsorbate-adsorbate and adsorbate-substrate
interactions. The concern of this work is understanding the spectroscopic and
dynamical properties of large molecular systems, in the gas phase and on
surfaces. The details of photo-induced chemistry, in general, and of
photodissociation, in particular, depend on the interaction energies among the
atoms in the system. However, it is not simple to correlate these to the
identity of the reaction products and to the energy distribution over these
products. The studies being carried out in this project will enhance the
understanding of the relevant relationships and stimulate new experimetnal
explorations.
