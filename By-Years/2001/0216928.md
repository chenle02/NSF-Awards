0216928&lt;br/&gt;Wolff&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Knowledge of the chemical
compositions of rocks is essential for understanding Earth processes. In
particular, chemical analysis is a major part of the investigation of igneous
rocks. X-ray fluorescence is the primary workhorse technique providing accurate
and precise analyses of the major chemical constituents of rocks, plus some
important minor and trace elements. Centralized analytical services have the
benefit of being cost-effective, and of reducing noise from inter-laboratory
discrepancies in the geochemical data used by the scientific community. The
GeoAnalytical Lab at Washington State University has offered such a centralized
XRF service for over two decades. The current spectrometer has been in operation
since 1987, and needs replacement. This grant will enable the WSU Lab to
purchase a new spectrometer, in order to continue to provide a reliable major-
and trace-element analytical service to the geochemical community. Installation
of the new instrument will improve sample throughput and turnaround time, and
significantly enhance data quality for some trace elements, as well as enabling
the Lab to continue to provide a service for the next decade or more.
