From 1969 through 1981 the National Science foundation awarded seven grants to
Dr. Anthony Marks to conduct archaeological research in the Israeli Central
Negev Desert. A number of important open air sites were excavated and the
results published in a multi-volume series. The sites are important because they
document the transitional period which led to the emergence of anatomically
modern humans and the appearance of a modern range of fundamental behaviors.
Following accepted standards of the time, the collections were divided between
the Israel Antiquities Authority in Jerusalem and Southern Methodist University
(SMU), Dr. Marks' home institution. Such a practice is no longer followed
because of the difficulty it imposes on researchers who wish to study an entire
collection. Dr. Marks is now retiring from SMU and the institution no longer
wishes to maintain either his or others' Old World archaeological collections.
With NSF support, Dr. Marks and a student will systematize and pack the SMU
material for shipping to the Israel Antiquities Authority which will reintegrate
the collections and pay the actual transport costs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project is significant because it will make an important archaeological
collection available in its entirely for scientific study.&lt;br/&gt;
