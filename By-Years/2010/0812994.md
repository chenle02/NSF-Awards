0812994&lt;br/&gt;Wojciechowski&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This dissertation research
conducted by Mr. Farruggia under the direction of Dr. Wojciechowski of Arizona
State University, will investigate the contribution of morphology, ecological
habitat selection, and biogeography to the evolution of an economically
important legume, Sesbania (Leguminosae). Research will be conducted in
Argentina and Paraguay in collaboration with the National University of Rosario
in Argentina under the auspices of Dr. Darien Prado. This study will provide key
information on the distinctive morphology, ecology, and biogeography of Sesbania
and a framework for comparison to related legumes. Specific research goals
include a comprehensive evolutionary analysis of Sesbania based on morphological
data and molecular markers, testing of dispersal history and key morphological
innovations, and the production of a monograph. Outcomes produced from this
comprehensive analysis of Sesbania will provide novel datasets for testing
current hypotheses of the evolutionary history and biogeography of Sesbania and
its nearest relatives. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study provides the opportunity
to expand collaborative ties with botanical institutions in northern Argentina
and Paraguay, a geographic region with high legume diversity. The research will
provide fundamental knowledge for further economic development of Sesbania and
will explore how the floristic composition of the legume will respond to climate
change. This proposal will support international dissertation research for one
graduate student and will also provide a research opportunity for an
undergraduate student. &lt;br/&gt;
