The PI seeks to investigate culture-based reactions of Native Americans to
technological innovations. The argument, well based on fact, is that Native
Americans have not adapted to our highly technological society as have other
citizens of this country. The question is, Why not? The investigator will also
examine whether cultural and social differences among tribes help account for
differences between them in their success at integrating technology into
existing ways of life. Another important question is why some technologies fit
Native American cultures while others do not. In this planning grant the
investigator will conduct a thorough literature review, discuss the proposed
research with selected Native American community leaders and scientists, and
conduct a pilot project based on questionaires to test attitudes towards
technology.
