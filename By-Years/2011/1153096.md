Frank Brown of the University of California, Santa Barbara is supported by an
award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program within
the Division of Chemistry (MPS/CHE) and the Division of Molecular and Cellular
Biology (BIO/MCB) for the development of theoretical tools to model lipid
bilayers and biomembranes for use in simulating complex biochemical and
biophysical phenomena. Dr. Brown's algorithms allow hydrodynamically and
thermodynamically consistent modeling of inhomogeneous membrane surfaces over a
range of "mesocopic" length scales (tens of nanometers to tens of microns) and
time scales (tens of nanoseconds to tens of seconds and longer).
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research is having a broad impact on the
interpretation of experiments that enhance our understanding of biological
phenomena such as the diffusion of membrane proteins in complex cellular
environments and the structure and dynamics of human red blood cells. Dr. Brown
communicates the excitement and importance of science to grade school children
through his participation in the Physics Circus and Chemistry Outreach programs
at UCSB. Dr. Brown also serves as co-director of the UCSB center for scientific
computing, which oversees and maintains shared scientific computing facilities
for the UCSB campus, for use in both research and classroom teaching.
