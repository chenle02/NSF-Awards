The production of the hormone progesterone is important for the maintenance of
pregnancy in the mammalian system. There are two groups of granulosa cells found
in the ovary prior to ovulation that may possibly be involved in the maintenance
of pregnancy. The PI wants to determine the function of one group, namely the
cumulus granulosa cells during pregnancy since these cells disappear right after
ovulation and their role remains a mystery. It is already known that the other
group, the mural granulosa cells, become part of the corpus luteum following
ovulation and produce progesterone. An attempt will be made here to compare the
relative abilities of these two cell populations to secrete progesterone under
simulated in vivo conditions using a newly developed technique known as the
kidney transplantation procedure. The cells will be placed under the kidney
capsule of a pregnant rat and observed for secretion of progesterone. This SGER
proposal is considered high risk because of the uncertainty that this unique
technique will provide the feasibility of assessing the in vivo function of the
cumulus granulosa cells.
