Our group of diverse biologists are actively using DNA analysis to conduct
integrative research on issues pertaining to 1) systematics, 2) genome mapping,
3) behavioral biology, 4) conservation of endangered species, and 5) ecological
genetics. We are using DNA sequence data for phylogenetic analysis and using DNA
markers for population-level and family-level questions. We currently contract
for DNA sequencing services from distant facilities at other universities or
generate our own genotype data using radioactive labeling methods and manual
autoradiogram scoring. Our proposal is for instrumentation that will bring data
generation to our university and increase our capacity for this type of
analysis. On site instrumentation would lower the cost of this analysis,
increase the use of molecular analysis by our faculty, increase the speed of
data generation, and directly expose our students to the next generation in DNA
technology that is shaping our sciences. We need this instrumentation to keep
our high quality research programs Competitive at national and international
levels.
