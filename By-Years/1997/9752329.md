This project develops a junior level biochemistry laboratory course which: 1.
Provides students with the necessary skills to become attractive candidates to
industrial recruiters or graduate schools; 2. Increases the interest and the
ability of students to successfully carry out undergraduate research projects in
their senior year; and 3. Serves as a model and guide for a variety of small
institutions who wish to implement a similar class. The model adapts for a
consortium of small HBCU's and expands to a year long format a one semester
laboratory course developed and implemented by Paul Craig of the Rochester
Institute of Technology. A number of new techniques are added to include the
investigation of authentic unknowns. Students learn cutting-edge methods in
biochemistry and molecular biology and develop the critical thinking skills to
analyze the original data they generate. Evaluation of the course is
accomplished through pre- and post-course examinations, attitudinal surveys and
retrospective follow-up of student progress. Results are being disseminated via
a series of WWW pages that include student input.
