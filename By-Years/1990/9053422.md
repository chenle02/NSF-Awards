Mathematical Scientists are assessing the current state of linear algebra
instruction in the undergraduate curriculum in U. S. colleges and universities,
laying a foundation for its improvement, and identifying priorities for further
and continuing study. This endeavor is being carried out by means of a survey of
linear algebra curricula, a workshop at the College of William and Mary, and a
conference at the 1991 Joint Mathematical Meetings. The institution is
contributing an amount equal to the award.***//
