The objective of this proposed program is to develop an affinity protein that is
specific for murine IgM. The approah for achieving this objective is to produce
a Single-Chain Antibodytm (SCAtm) protein with specificity for mouse IgM. The
SCA protein will be designed from the variable regions of the anti-mouse IgM
monoclonal antibody, Bet-2, (ATCC HB88). A gene encoding this protein will be
constucted and the protein will be expressed in E. coli. The protein will be
renatured, purified, and assayed for its binding to mouse IgM. This new affinity
protein, when immobilized, will have utility as a reagent for the purification
of murine IgM antibodies and murine IgM monoclonal antibodies. Available
affinity chromatographic methods using Protein G or Protein A are not specific
for IgM nor are classic methods such as ion exchange. This precludes the
development of IgM monoclonal-based products. An IgM specific SCA protein would
overcome this obstacle. Techniques for specific immobilization the SCA protein
to suitable separations media and various prototype murine IgM separation
products will be developed during Phase II.
