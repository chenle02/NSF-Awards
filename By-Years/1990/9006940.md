This proposal is concerned with ultralow temperature studies of heavy electron
superconductors (HFS) and sound propagation in superfluid helium-three. In HFS
they propose a number of measurements to further characterize the anisotropic
superconducting states. They will study the penetration and absorption of
electromagnetic waves and search for contributions of order-parameter collective
modes. They will correlate these mesurements with ultrasound absorption studies
on the same samples. Using uniaxial stress as the symmetry breaking field they
will search for multiple superconducting phases that can arise in an anisotropic
superconductor. These phases will be characterized by ultrasound, lower and
upper critical field, and thermal expansion measurements. They will also
investigate the effects of impurities and disorder on the anisotropic phases. In
superfluid helium-three they propose constructing various inhomogeneous states
and study the propagation of zero-sound through them.
