Chemical, biochemical and biophysical investigations of the nickel containing
cofactor, F430. will be pursued. This cofactor is a required component of the
enzyme methyl reductase, obtained form the methanogenic archaebacteria
Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum, which catalyzes the reductive conversion
of a sulfur-bonded methyl group to methane. Dr. Scott is interested in the
involvement or role of the nickel in the production of the methane. he will
first investigate the coordination chemistry of the nickel containing cofactor
both in the isolated and in the enzyme-bond state. He will use a number of
spectroscopic techniques (UV-visible, resonance Raman, magnetic circular
dichroism, and nuclear magnetic resonance) to identify the ligands to the nickel
of the cofactor in the purified enzyme. he will try to generate, isolate and
characterize the lower oxidation state nickel forms of (1) the enzyme in intact
cells, (2) the enzyme in purified form and (3) the cofactor alone to test the
hypothesis that the lower oxidation state nickel form is the actual form
obtaining in vivo.
