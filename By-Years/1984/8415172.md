The inverse frequency (1/f) noise of a superconducting quantum interference
device (SQUID) is investigated. These experimental studies will determine the
importance of factors relating to the measurement environment with the SQUID.
The environment is found to introduce greater noise than the intrinsic noise of
the SQUID. A new understanding of many of the suspected sources of the
environmental noise and their relative importance will be obtained. The
environmental sources of noise to be studied include thermomagnetic noise, noise
effects of ambient magnetic fields, sensor temperature variation effects, and
readout circuit instability effects. Technological applications are anticipated
since the SQUIDs are used increasingly in sensitive measurement applications.
