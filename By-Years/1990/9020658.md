With support from both the Organic Dynamics Program, Division of Chemistry and
the Solid State Chemistry and Polymers Program, Division of Materials Research,
Dr. Walba will study the design, synthesis, and characterization of
ferroelectric liquid crystals (FLC), a new class of thermodynamically stable,
ordered organic materials. The targets of the synthetic effort are designed to
possess useful properties for photonic devices, e.g., fast-switching, high
resolution and high contrast FLC light valves and ultrafast nonlinear optical
devices. Specific projects include the following: (i) synthesis of chiral
fluorinated alkylbenzoates and atropisomeric FLCs and evaluation of their FLC
properties; (ii) synthesis and evalua- tion of the nonlinear optical properties
of new FLC films; (iii) empirical force field modelling of FLC components (i.e.,
computerization of the binding site model); (iv) polarization- sensitive IR
spectroscopic studies of the FLC self assembly in thin films. While the powerful
techniques of regio- and sterocontrolled organic synthesis and conformational
analysis give considerable control over the constitution and spatial
relationships between atoms in organic molecules, the directed design of new
materials (i.e., molecular aggregates) with specific geometric relationships
between functional arrays of atoms is an exciting frontier in chemistry. An
important goal of this project takes advantage of the self-assembly that occurs
in ferroelectric liquid crystals (FLCs) to create in a controlled and general
manner organic materials that possess thermodynamically stable polar order. With
this objective in mind, a simple stereochemical model for the molecular level
origins of the polar order that occurs in FLCs is developed and tested via a
program of research that focusses upon the design, synthesis, and
characterization of new FLC materials.
