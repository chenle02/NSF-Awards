This proposal is to plan for a new multi-university I/UCRC that aims to promote
a research program of interest to both industry and universities on technologies
for wireless internet. This new multi-university center will be able to have a
broad impact on the industry through having its existing resources enhanced by
the addition of the partner that is also being recommended to receive a planning
grant. The two partners are this University and Columbia
University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed Center's goal is to work on two
overlapping categories: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Information delivery focussing
on software development, addressing security and robustness, and&lt;br/&gt;-
Data transmission related to management of radio resources and the management of
competition and cooperation between different
technologies&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal deals with an area of significant
need and by assembling the two institutions into one research team, the breadth
and depth is enhanced &lt;br/&gt;
