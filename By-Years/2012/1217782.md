Operating systems and networks developed largely independently, due
to&lt;br/&gt;the nature of their development -- operating systems were developed
by&lt;br/&gt;groups within organizations/companies, while networking
requiring&lt;br/&gt;interoperability was developed across organizations. As a
result of&lt;br/&gt;this development history, the boundary between the
networking&lt;br/&gt;subsystem and the rest of the operating system has remained
largely&lt;br/&gt;opaque, with little information regarding the performance or
progress&lt;br/&gt;of transfers being communicated to applications. This
research&lt;br/&gt;addresses this limitation by exploring a richer boundary
interface&lt;br/&gt;that allows programs to see the ongoing behavior of network
transfers&lt;br/&gt;and to control their operation at a fine granularity. These
interfaces&lt;br/&gt;would augment, rather than replace, the existing
interfaces, so the&lt;br/&gt;portions of programs that are satisfied with the
current interfaces&lt;br/&gt;could continue unmodified, and developers could
change only the&lt;br/&gt;portions that can benefit from richer information.
This research is&lt;br/&gt;largely experimental in nature, and will combine the
design and&lt;br/&gt;implementation of new interface abstractions along with
the&lt;br/&gt;development of new or modified programs to take advantage of
these&lt;br/&gt;interfaces. In addition to the design work associated with
the&lt;br/&gt;interfaces, additional criteria for success include examining
the&lt;br/&gt;performance and delay behavior of modified applications, and
the&lt;br/&gt;effort needed to modify such applications. The expected results
from&lt;br/&gt;this work include applications that can more precisely control
their&lt;br/&gt;networking behavior, reducing memory and processor usage,
improving&lt;br/&gt;energy efficiency, and improving delay behavior. High-
performance or&lt;br/&gt;time-sensitive applications, such as networked video,
should benefit&lt;br/&gt;from this research.
