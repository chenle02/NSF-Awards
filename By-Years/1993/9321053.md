9321053 Abowd The investigators have demonstrated that recently constructed
matched employer-employee data files for France and the U.S. can be used to
provide important new insights into the operation of the labor market. The
French data has already been used to estimate models of wage determination that
include both individual and firm effects. The firm-level averages of these
measures are related to a number of important outcomes: profitability,
productivity, capital/labor ratios and survival rates. This research will extend
the analysis of the French data and develop a comparable American analysis using
newly created American data files. The research is expected to determine whether
or not The French results, showing a strong relation between compensation design
variables and firm performance, also apply to American manufacturing firms. This
research is important because it will enhance our understanding of wage
determination and the dynamics of job creation and destruction at the level of
the firm. ***
