Students will carry out experiments which examine the atomic structure of
surfaces, investigate quantum mechanical electron tunneling and use modern
materials science methods to prepare tips and substrates. University will
develop lecture demonstrations for both freshman and upper division classes and
will use experience with commercial microscope to further develop designs for
simple teaching laboratory microscopes that are easily assembled in college
shops.
