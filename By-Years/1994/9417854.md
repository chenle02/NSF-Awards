9417854 Gidley This proposal is a renewal request for, "Investigations of Lepton
Interactions". The renewal request combines the previous grant of the same name
under Dr. Gidley with a grant for, "Precision Positronium Measurements with Low
Energy Positrons" which was previously funded under the director of Dr. Paul
Zitzewitz of the Dearborn campus of the University of Michigan. It is for
studies of the properties of positronium atoms which are formed by a combination
of an electron with a positron. It calls for measurements of positronium
lifetimes, energy levels and the presence of violation of charge conjugation and
parity. ***
