The purpose of this research is to develop a capability for: (1) calculating
two-dimensional optical diffractions for the edges of dielectric or imperfectly
conducting features on layered, silicon-based substrates; and (2) utilizing
diffracted two-dimensional fields in an inversion algorithm for shape
reconstruction of linear (line-like) features on silicon wafers and chips for
integrated circuits. The research is fundamentally mathematical in nature and is
driven by critical problems in the integrated circuit industry, although it is
important to a wider class of applications. The research objective for Phase I
is: (1) to implement a new theory of vector diffraction utilizing self-
similarity and vector boundary value problems in complex variable theory; and
(2) to begin preliminary study of the inverse optical scattering problem for
metrology of edged features on silicon substrates, considering the pros and cons
of time domain and frequency domain data, and feasibility of data acquisition.
If successful, these diffraction solutions and inversion methods will prove
technically beneficial for a variety of applied problems. However, their
greatest potential may eventually be reached in the integrated circuit industry
if they can contribute to increased yield by means of automated metrology. It is
expected that positive results from this line of research could eventually
contribute to the theory of a practical, automated inspection instrument for IC
metrology. This would have a significant impact on productivity of the
integrated circuit industry. The vector diffraction solutions sought here are
useful in their own right for sonar, radar, and optics applications.
