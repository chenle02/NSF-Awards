Proposal 0305865&lt;br/&gt;PIs: Michael Anderson, Claude LeBrun&lt;br/&gt;Sr.
Assoc.: Justin Sawon&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;STUDIES IN RIEMANNIAN AND COMPLEX
GEOMETRY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anderson, LeBrun and Sawon will pursue research on
various topics in&lt;br/&gt;differential geometry with close links to other key
areas of the &lt;br/&gt;mathematical&lt;br/&gt;mainstream, such as mathematical
physics, differential topology, &lt;br/&gt;partial differential equations,
algebraic geometry, and several &lt;br/&gt;complex variables. Anderson will
carry out research on general &lt;br/&gt;relativity, Einstein metrics, and the
geometrization of 3-manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;LeBrun will work on the Riemannian
geometry of low-dimensional &lt;br/&gt;manifolds,&lt;br/&gt;with a focus on
curvature and topology in dimensions 3 and 4, and&lt;br/&gt;on Zoll metrics in
dimension 2. Sawon will study compact hyper-Kaehler&lt;br/&gt;manifolds and
quaternion-Kaehler manifolds from the point of view of&lt;br/&gt;Rozansky-Witten
invariants, knot invariants, and topological quantum &lt;br/&gt;field
theories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is expected that the broader impact of this
research program will &lt;br/&gt;be significant.&lt;br/&gt;Many of the problems
under study are of great interest&lt;br/&gt;to theoretical physicists working in
general relativity, &lt;br/&gt;supergravity, and&lt;br/&gt;string theory;
moreover, members of the group are actively developing&lt;br/&gt;links with
physicists working in these areas through&lt;br/&gt;participation in
conferences, seminars and collaborative projects.&lt;br/&gt;The project will
also directly contribute to the training of a&lt;br/&gt;new generation of
mathematical researchers, as&lt;br/&gt;members of the research group are
actively engaged in the supervision&lt;br/&gt;of many graduate students,
including women and minorities.&lt;br/&gt;
