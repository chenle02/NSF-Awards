The overall approach of the proposed work is to fundamentally understand the
mechanisms of cell damage in contrast to the phenomenological/correlation type
of approach which has been historically used to address this problem. The
proposed approach requires the identification of the processes responsible for
cell damage through initial visualization studies. Theoretical and correlational
studies are then to be carried out in actual bioreactor operations to confirm
that these mechanisms account for the observed cell damage. Once these
mechanisms are confirmed, computer simulations of the hydrodynamic events, such
as bubble rupture, will be used to determine the actual "strength" or
"sensitivity" of cells to hydrodynamic forces.
