This is an award for a workshop on "Coupling Theories of Learning and Research
on Practice". The workshop will consist of three panels each focusing on a
single position paper related to one of three conceptual learning theories for
studying learning practices, participation/identity theory as developed in the
writings of James Greeno, the dialogic theory of learning as duscussed in the
writings of Jim Wertsch, and transactional inquire as described in the writings
of Bill Clancey. The work of each panel will be threefold: to summarize a
particular framework in such a way as to facilitate comparison, to demonstrate
how the framework might be applied to the analysis of interaction within a
concrete setting, and finally, to illuminate how the framework might contribute
to a larger practice-based proram of research. The broader impact of this
research will be in improved instructional practice grounded in strong theory
