9622912 Li The goal of this project is to study enumerative geometry of moduli
spaces in algebraic geometry. As the first step, this project will investigate
how excessive intersection theory based on normal cone construction can be
applied to study enumerative problems on moduli spaces whose dimensions are
bigger than their expected dimensions. Afterward, Li will apply this technique
to study Gromov-Witten invariants of smooth projective varieties, to study
enumerative problems of rational curves in Calabi-Yau manifolds and Fano
varieties and to derive recursion formulas for Donaldson polynomial invariants
of algebraic surfaces. Some of them are known using analytic method. Li believes
that progress along this line will provide new insight to these problems, new
technique to attack similar problems and will be a source of good mathematical
problems in the future. This is research in the field of algebraic geometry.
Algebraic geometry is one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one
which has had a revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century. In its
origin, it treated figures that could be defined in the plane by the simplest
equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays the field makes use of methods not only
from algebra, but from analysis and topology, and conversely is finding
application in those fields as well as in physics, theoretical computer science,
and robotics.
