The research proposed here is in the area of monolithic high- frequency
communication circuits and is directed at exploring new ways to use silicon
integrated-circuit technology to improve the performance and reduce the cost of
communication systems of various kinds with primary emphasis on data
communications. Particular emphasis is placed on circuit techniques applicable
to clock recovery in high-speed communications systems, optimization of the
sensitivity in fiber-optic communication receivers, and the application of
BICMOS technology for the particular needs of high?speed communications
applications. We feel that continuing efforts in this area are likely to produce
results which will have significant impact on integrated-circuit design for
communication systems.
