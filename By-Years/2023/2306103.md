At the Annual meeting of the GRC in Panama the group endorsed a Statement of
Principles (SOP) on Research Ethics, Integrity, and Culture in the Context of
Rapid Results Research following a year-long series of discussions at each of
the regional meetings on the topic. The discussions and break out groups at the
Annual Meeting in Panama were productive and well-received and generated
widespread interest in continuing these conversations. This proposal furthers
these efforts and will fund a workshop adjacent to the upcoming Americaâ€™s
Regional Meeting in Uruguay in 2022. Workshop participants would develop a model
for exchange of best practices on Research Integrity that is specific to the
Americas but that could be modified for use in other regions. This effort will
both continue ongoing discussions and provide an important contribution to other
bilateral and multilateral conversations about research security and research
integrity taking place across the world. A particular focus will be how to
support responsible internationalization of research that attends specifically
to research integrity and security considerations.
