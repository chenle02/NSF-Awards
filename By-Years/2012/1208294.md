This action funds Grey Nearing of the University of Arizona to conduct a
research project, entitled "An approach to evaluate the value of data
assimilation," during the summer of 2012 at Tsinghua University in Beijing,
China. The host scientist is Dawen Yang.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is the development of a method to
estimate the utility of a general probabilistic data assimilation filter or
smoother and to disassociate effects data assimilation inefficiency due to
filter assumptions from inefficiency due to observations and the model, e.g.
non-injectivity of the observation function and nonlinear state correlations.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
