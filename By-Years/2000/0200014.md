This project, in conjunction with similar support from American Automatic
Control Council will support travel expenses to facilitate participation of
roughly 50 students to the 2002 American Control Conference. It will provide a
setting for exchanging ideas, cultivating friendships, building networks,
educating students, and for preparing students for their professional careers in
control engineering. Special sessions that should be of particular interest to
students, including a session for graduate students seeking academic positions
that will focus on proposal writing and the NSF CAREER program. Every effort
will be made to select both an ethnically and scientifically diverse group of
students to represent all areas of control engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
