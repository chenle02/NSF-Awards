This proposal from Massachusetts Institute of Technology requestssupport to
enhance the planning of a Science and TechnologyCenter for Scientific and
Engineering Applications of ParallelProcessing. Five departments from two major
institutions areinvolved in this multidisciplinary proposal. The
intellectualtheme of the proposed Center will be computational simulationfrom
both the "demand disciplines" of engineering and science,and the "supply
disciplines" of mathematics, computer science andelectrical engineering, and
hardware vendors. The research focuswill be on topics dealing with computer
architectures, operatingsystems, languages, algorithms, and problem
specificcomputations. The Planning Grant activity will enable the institution
tocomplete the assimilation of a group of qualified personnel,identify the most
important scientific issues, plan theadministrative and scientific structure of
the Center, andestablish industrial participation and government linkages.
