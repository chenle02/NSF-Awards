The U.S. Interagency Arctic Buoy Program (USIABP) will provide the Management
structure and coordination necessary to establish and maintain a baseline
network of drifting buoys of sufficient spatial resolution and longevity to
define surface synoptic scale atmospheric pressure, air temperature and sea ice
drift fields in the Arctic. This data can separated into two separate
categories: A) Near real-time data for operational use in weather and sea ice
forecasting. These data are processed by System Argos and distributed via the
World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Global Telecommunication System (GTS).
B) "Historical" data that are processed, quality controlled and archived to meet
the established needs of the scientific research community. //
