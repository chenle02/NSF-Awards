This grant will focus on extending previous theoretical studies on dynamical
properties of hydromagnetic Alfven waves in the Earth's magnetosphere. A short
wavelength gyrokinetic formalism will be employed to study 1) the wave
excitation mechanism in anisotropic, high-beta magnetospherice plasmas, and 2)
the corresponding particle flux oscillation including the crucial finite Larmor-
radius effects. Results from (1) and (2) will then be compared with
observational data to provide some definitive answers to the wave free energy
source(s) and generation mechanism(s). In addition, feld line resources in
magnetospheric plasmas including finite plasma pressure and effects of field
line resources on wave excitations will be studied. The theoretical results
should therefore provide significant new physical insight and quantitative
predications about geomagnetic pulsations in the Earth's magnetosphere.***
