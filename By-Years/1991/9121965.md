This award will support a two-year U.S.-Japan Cooperative
Photoconversion/Photosynthesis Research Program project between Professor Ronald
Christensen, Department of Chemistry, Bowdoin College, Brunswick, Maine, and
Professor Keitaro Yoshihara, Department of Electronic Structure, Institute for
Molecular Science, Okazaki, Japan. The collaboration will focus on the
spectroscopy and dynamics of the S1 and S2 excited states of simple tetraenes
and trienes in supersonic molecular beams. The goal is to obtain a more detailed
understanding of photoisomerization in phototypical polyene systems. This
project to study the electronic spectra of polyenes involves cooperative
experiments between scientists with complementary skills and facilities. Their
studies using fluorescence and fluorescence excitation techniques promise to
make substantial contributions to ongoing research and will complement other
methods based on multiphoton ionization. Professor Christensen will travel to
Okazaki to purify his compounds there and will participate in the conduct and
interpretation of the spectroscopic experiments.
