Henikoff 9419221 Abstract The second international meeting on Drosophila
Heterochromatin will be held in Honolulu, Hawaii, January 3-7, 1995. %%%
Chromatin, the DNA-protein complex which contains the genetic information of
eukaryotic cells, is divided into euchromatin and heterochromatin. The
euchromatin has been the focus of genetic studies since those regions contain
most of the active genes. Until recently, heterochromatin was thought to be
largely devoid of genes and those that were contained within the heterochromatin
were thought to be silenced. The newer technology has made it possible to
demonstrate that much of what was thought to be true is not and the study of
heterochromatic structure and function is a rapidly changing and expanding
field. This meeting will provide an opportunity for scientists at all levels and
from all parts of the world to communicate in both formal and informal ways. ***
