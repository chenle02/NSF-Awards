This proposal requests funds for the development of a pulse field-sweep EPR
(PFSEPR) and to extend its application as a simple but powerful tool for probing
electron nuclear and electron-electron spin interactions. This technique will be
a simple, economical alternative to technically complex ENDOR, ELDOR, and spin
echo methods. The prinicpal investigator proposes to improve the EPR sensitivity
of PFSEPR, improve its resolution of both large and small hyperfine couplings,
and improve its time resolution for resolving dynamic interactions. He will also
develop a minimal PFSEPR modification so that the PFSEPR technique will become
more accessible to the nonspecialist. Dr. Scholes, one of only a few EPR/ENDOR
experts, has the expertise necessary to develop this tool that could be of wide
use in chemical and biochemical problems.
