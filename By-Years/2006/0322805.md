The development of transgenic crops and marketing of their products raises
important ethical and social questions, which have evoked a wide spectrum of
responses. Fundamentally opposed values and ways of life are at stake here, and
they have profound implications for agricultural and food security policies.
Also at stake are matters that are broadly open to scientific investigation,
e.g., about the risks of using transgenics and the productive potential of
alternative forms of agriculture. There is dispute, however, about the
appropriate methodological approaches to adopt in scientific research in order
to address such matters. It derives (in part) from the complex ways in which
ethical and empirical issues are intertwined, and it underlies not only the
apparently intractable controversies that have arisen about transgenics, but
also questions about whether public policy has been well informed by the full
range of socially and scientifically relevant issues. The principal goal of the
present project is to complete the research for a scholarly book and develop
some materials and presentations for a broader audience, with two principal
interrelated objectives: 1) To consolidate the philosophical view that
methodological strategies may be adopted in scientific inquiry in part because
they link with particular values, but in a way that does not discredit the
soundness of the scientific results. Thus, because of their differing value
implications, where there are alternate sound strategies, it is important for
research to be conducted under more than one strategy. 2) To display the
structure of ethical controversies about transgenics and competing forms of
agriculture such as agroecology. This will involve identifying key assumptions
that are in contention about values, scientific judgments and philosophy of
science. Once alternate methodological strategies and their ethical implications
have been identified, scientists, policymakers, and citizens can consider the
approaches to scientific inquiry that may best inform food-related policies,
especially in developing countries, and how to make decisions pertaining to
these questions in democratic societies. Special attention will be paid to the
controversies insofar as they bear upon food security and agricultural policies
in the "developing" world, and recent Brazilian contributions to the discussion
will be drawn upon extensively. Results will be included in undergraduate
curricula in the United States and Brazil.
