Bertram Kostant will continue his research in the theory of Lie groups. The
work will proceed in three directions 1) a plan for carrying out geometric
quantization of certain nilpotent orbits by use of quasi-invariant differential
operators; 2) an approach to determine generalized exponents by the use of
special Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials in the affine case and new information on
the equivariant K-theory of the corresponding infinite dimensional flag
manifold; 3) an approach to establish the positive definiteness of the Hermitian
structure on the space of physical states. The determination of representations
whose wave front set is the closure of the Joseph orbit is an important and
difficult problem. These representations are generalizations of the oscillator
representation for the two fold covering of the symplectic group. The study of
the Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials for Lie groups associated with affine Lie
algebras using geometry of the corresponding flag variety and its relationship
with K- theory is a very important aspect of this research.
