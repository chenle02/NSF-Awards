The ability to correctly perceive the physical world around us is to a large
part dependent on hooking the eye up to the brain in a very precise fashion. Dr.
Debski's goal is to understand the process whereby the neurons from the eye
choose the cells in a target structure with which to connect. In order to study
the problem of how the eye connects to the brain, Dr. Debski will use the visual
system of a amphibian model system. In this system, the eye connects to the
optic tectum, the main visual area of the animal. There the neurons from the eye
form a map of the visual space. This brain structure is similar to the visual
maps found in mammals and primates. One of the distinct advantages of the
amphibian is that development of the visual system occurs during a stage when it
is readily accessible. Therefore the developmental processes which lead to the
formation of these maps can be studied. Dr. Debski's study will focus on the
NMDA receptor, a type of receptor found on some neurons. This receptor is known
to play as role in determining where the optic tectum neurons from the eye
connect. She will determine whether the activity of this receptor can be
modulated by the neurotransmitters glycine, serotonin and VIP and to what extent
the latter two of these transmitters are found in the visual system and
therefore are likely to provide such modulation in the intact animal. Dr. Debski
will also determine the degree to which the developing system changes with
respect to NMDA receptor activity and serotonin- and VIP-like immunoreactive
neurons as it matures. The results from these studies will allow us to better
understand how to modulate NMDA receptor activity as a means to correct error in
visual connectivity when they occur.***//
