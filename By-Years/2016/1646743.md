This award supports development of the program for a 2.5-day workshop to be held
on Jan 9-11th in Arlington, Virginia. This meeting brings together principal
investigators from across the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program.
The investigators identify topics and establish a workshop agenda, including
speakers and panelists. Specific objectives of the PI meeting
include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- to stimulate coordination and collaboration
amongst SaTC PIs working on different projects;&lt;br/&gt;- to foster new
collaborations between SaTC researchers and researchers in other
disciplines;&lt;br/&gt;- to share experiences and learn from others' experiences
in transitioning research into practice; and&lt;br/&gt;- to develop ideas and
share methods for improving education, recruitment, and career development in
cybersecurity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Building a strong community among SaTC
researchers helps identify new research topics, avoid duplication of existing
research, and improve educational opportunities for graduate students.
