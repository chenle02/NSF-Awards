9625424 Prokop This award is to support the participation of four graduate
students in the Engineering Foundation conference "Bioartificial Organs: Science
and Technology" to be held July 21-26, 1996 in Nashville, Tennessee. The
objective of the meeting is to explore current and emerging approaches to the
science and technologies associated with artificial organs and how the different
fields of investigation interact. It is expected that new innovative and
proactive interactions will develop among the three specialist groups
participating in the meeting: materials and polymer scientists; bioprocess
engineers; biologists. The young scientists to be supported by NSF funds will
have an excellent opportunity to engage in such interactions. The results of the
conference are to be published as a separate volume in Annals of the New York
Academy of Sciences, thereby making the results of the conference available to a
large audience.
