The Fostering Careers in Engineering and IT Scholarships project provides
opportunities for exemplary students to pursue a degree in one of 9 STEM
associate programs: Engine Research and Development Technician, Mechanical
Design Technology, Tool and Die Designer, Civil Engineering Technician,
Engineering Technologist, IT Micro Programmer Specialist, IT Network Specialist,
IT Technical Support Specialist and Water Quality Technician. Three types of
scholarships, as well as student and academic services, are available for 68 to
140 academically talented, professionally motivated and financially needy
students. Three types of scholarships are offered including: 1) Standard
scholarships for 10-20 students: 2) Demonstration scholarships for up to 10
students not meeting one of the Standard scholarship criteria, such as returning
adults with a GPA slightly below 3.0 but demonstrate credible professional
motivation; and, 3) Transfer scholarships for up to 5 students pursuing
bachelors degrees.

The recruitment plans include targeting high school students and returning
adults, and new efforts such as faculty visiting high school classrooms to
provide information about STEM programs and careers. Services include faculty
mentoring, industry visits, job shadowing, tutoring and cohort building
activities. Career placement services include counseling, TechConnect (online
job notices only for program students) and skill workshops.
