ABSTRACT

Three problems will be investigated, related by the common thread of
oscillatory integrals with degenerate (or singular) phase functions. First,
estimates for Fourier integral operators associated with two-sided Morin
singularities, both symmetric and asymmetric, will be considered. This will be
attempted by using new decompositions of the operators that reflect the
underlying geometry of the phase functions. Secondly, global uniqueness will be
considered in the Calderon problem for low-regularity conductivities and
potentials in dimensions greater than two, using Radon transform decompositions
of the potentials. Finally, a detailed microlocal analysis will be made of the
problem for low-regularity and/or conormal conductivities in two dimensions.

The operators to be studied in this project transform functions on one space to
functions on another space (possibly the same, possibly different) in a way in
which oscillation (cancellation caused by high-frequency waves) plays an
important role. This general type of operator has been central to progress in
the last thirty years in the understanding of a wide range of partial
differential equations governing, e.g., wave propagation of sound and
electromagnetic waves. It turns out that the mathematical analysis of CAT
scanners and other noninvasive medical imaging technologies falls under the same
framework. The current project should give a better understanding of the
mathematical foundations of these techniques. In the longer term, this might
contribute to refinement and improvement of these imaging methods.
