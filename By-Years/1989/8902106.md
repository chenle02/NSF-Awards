This machine translation research is joint work of Ralph Grishman at New York
University, Michiko Kosaka at Monmouth College and Virginia Teller at Hunter
College of CUNY. Progress in machine translation has been hampered by the lack
of clear development methodologies. The goal of this work is the creation of
such a methodology. These investigators suggest an approach based on the cross
linguistic sublanguage analysis: the systematic collection and correlation of
the patterns of work usage in the source and target languages (in this case,
Japanese and English) for a particular subject domain. These comparative
linguistic studies will be based on an operator argument formalism, which in
most cases reduces corresponding English and Japanese sentences to structurally
identical representations. The results of these studies can then be used to
create a translation system, consisting of an analysis phase (creating operator
argument trees), a transfer phase (to synthesize target language sentences). A
prototype system will translate computer manuals from Japanese into English.
