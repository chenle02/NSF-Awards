This award is for support for a study to sample surface snow in pits and to
drill shallow cores in the vicinity of South Pole to look for evidence of the
June, 1991, eruption of Mt. Pinatubo in the Philippines. Extensive measurements
and observations by satellite, ground-based and airborne atmospheric instruments
are available regarding the amount of sulfur dioxide emitted from the eruption,
as well as the global distribution and decay of the stratospheric aerosols
derived from the volcanic sulfur dioxide. Ground-based and airborne measurements
in Antarctica clearly indicate that the stratospheric sulfate aerosols from this
eruption reached high southern latitudes in late 1991 and persisted in the
Antarctic atmosphere through 1993. Preliminary results from snow pit samples
recently taken in the South Pole area indicate that the Pinatubo signal exists
and can be separated from the signal of another volcanic eruption (Cerro Hudson)
which occurred in mid-August, 1991. Combined with the known total sulfate
aerosol production from Pinatubo, the proposed sampling and analyses will yield
the quantitative information necessary to establish empirical relationships
between the explosivity of a low-latitude eruption and the amplitude of its
corresponding signals in Antarctic snow.
