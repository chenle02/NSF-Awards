The awardee will construct and deploy two eight-panel radars as the next step in
the continuing engineering development of the Advanced Modular Incoherent
Scatter Radar (AMISR). These radars will use production-level hardware, as
opposed to the engineering prototype subassemblies constructed for earlier
development efforts. The proposed deployment locations in Gakona, Alaska and
Jicamarca, Peru will allow testing the radar hardware in actual operating
conditions, using realistic pulse patterns and data acquisition algorithms. The
locations were chosen because they each provide coherent scatter targets of
scientific interest and with anticipated return strengths that should be readily
detectable by the smaller radars. The two locations are also ideal in that they
represent two very different environmental conditions, providing a good test of
system integrity. Furthermore, they both have sufficient local infrastructure to
keep the deployment costs reasonable. This project will help reduce risk and
enhance capability for future construction and deployment of incoherent scatter
radars based on the AMISR design.
