One of the classic goals of probability theory is to understand how the
interaction of small individuals (internet users, particles, investors) in
seemingly random ways translates to novel behavior of the entire system. The
goal of this proposal is to analyze such systems where the interactions have
high-dimensional dependence structures and where the extremes (network hubs, low
energy configurations, optimal trajectories) play a significant role. As well as
being important to probability theory, the results obtained in this proposal
will be relevant and applied to many branches of science, as most of the
questions were introduced to understand the behavior of various optimization
problems in physics, computer science, theoretical biology, and social networks.

More specifically, the proposal involves projects on first-passage percolation
(an example of fluid flow in a porous medium) and on mean field spin glass
models (example of disordered magnets with frustrated interactions). The major
questions are tied to the complexity of the models, that is, the presence of a
large number of extremes and their location in space. In particular the proposer
plans to investigate the role played by the functional order parameters in the
Sherrington-Kirkpatrick, mixed p-spin and bipartite models and its relation with
the number and location of extremes of the corresponding Hamiltonians. The
proposal further addresses fundamental questions on growing interfaces and
fluctuations of long chemical chains in a random potential (polymer models).
Predictions from physics indicate that, in many of these models, fluctuations
should scale sub-linearly with limiting laws that deviate from the standard
Gaussian (for instance, which relate to the Tracy-Widom distribution from random
matrix theory). This proposal continues and expands the research of the PI on
these systems outside the scope of integrable models. In particular, this
proposal aims to investigate the universal behavior of scaling exponents, the
nature of the limit shape and the geometry of geodesics.
