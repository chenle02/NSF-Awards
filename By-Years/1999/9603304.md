The proposal is for a collaboration between two active research groups with
complementary skills. The PI's group specializes in transition and main group
reagent synthesis; the foreign group in the synthesis of main group
heterocycles. The work focuses on extending a methodology that uses titanocene
compounds as reagents to one that uses zinc reagents with the goal of preparing
new sulfur-rich compounds. There is a natural synergism between the U.S. and
German groups, and the graduate students involved in the work will be able to
broaden there scientific and cultural perspective through their work in the
foreign laboratory. │┐%¥` />┤ %?>ÀÁ╝ ¥Á╝_ Á┬│©/>ÀÁ¢ ?Â ¢¥┐┤Á>¥¢ ┴©? ┴╣%% %Á/╝>
