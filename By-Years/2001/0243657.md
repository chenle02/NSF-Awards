The goal of this research program is to develop compiler optimization technology
for emerging software applications. Compared to the current state-of-the-
practice, the new software applications will be written in type-safe languages
(e.g., Java), will contain millions of lines of code, will often be built from
components distributed across multiple machines, and will run on processors that
will have multiple threads of control, but will take hundreds of cycles to
access the main memory. Modern software will require modern optimizations that
will need to be scalable in three ways: with the size of the program, with the
number of distributed components, and with the growing memory latency. This
research proposes to achieve scalability by exploiting radically novel forms of
speculation, profiling, demand-driven analysis, run-time checks, and hardware
support. To develop these technologies, three specific efforts will be
undertaken: elimination of array-bounds checks, demand-driven pointer analysis,
and prefetching for pointer-based data structures.
