The goal of this project is to address fundamental issues in the analysis of
random quantum many-particle operators. So far, most of the mathematical
research in the field of random operators has been focused on the spectral
theory of random single-particle operators. A key theorem here addresses
localization for large disorder: any given interval of the almost-sure spectrum
belongs to the pure point spectrum provided the randomness is large enough; the
corresponding eigenfunctions are exponentially localized. The PI's research
program aims to investigate the fate of this strong localization regime in the
interacting case. The influence of many-particle correlations will be examined
for both fermionic and bosonic systems.

Random quantum many-particle operators arise in models of semiconductors, dirty
superconductors, or Bose-Einstein condensates in disordered media. In such
systems, the interplay between quantum and statistical fluctuations due to the
disorder gives rise to interesting physical phenomena like the suppression of
electronic transport or of Bose-Einstein condensation. The mathematical study of
these phenomena involves combining techniques from different areas of
mathematics, in particular, functional analysis and probability.
