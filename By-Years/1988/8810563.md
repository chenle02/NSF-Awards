This is a Research Initiation project for FY 88 1. The objectives of this
research are: (1) to calibrate the overstrength of typical building structures;
and (2) to incorporate the overstrength into the derivation of inelastic seismic
design spectra. A series of typical multi-story building structures in high
seismic risk regions will be designed according to the ATC 3-06 seismic
provisions. The strengths of these structures will be calculated using nonlinear
structural analysis computer programs. The overstrength will be evaluated by
comparing the actual and the nominal design yield strengths. Then the inelastic
response spectra will be constructed for different earthquake records by
considering the damping, ductility and overstrength evaluated from the first
stage. Without considering the overstrength, current procedures for generating
inelastic design spectra are semi- empirical. Rational inelastic seismic design
spectra for buildings will be developed through this research.
