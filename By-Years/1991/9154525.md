This work will permit preliminary planning activities prior to submitting a
full research proposal. The work integrates population ecology into a larger
research framework that examinesthe impact of human land use on biodiversity in
agroecosystems. The specific planning objectives are 1) to develop a better
understanding of landscape ecology and ecosystem concepts as applied to
agroecosystems, 2) learn new analytical and technical skills to facilitate the
work, and 3) expand detailed knowledge of the biology and land-use history of
the study site.
