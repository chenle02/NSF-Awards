This research project will investigate the social organization of a population
of Sanguinus mystax, or mustached tamarins, on Padre Isla in the Peruvian
Amazon. Tamarins have long been recognized as unusual primates due to a number
of rare sociosexual traits, such as the restriction of breeding to a single
female, the tendency to bear twins, and the extensive participation of males in
infant care. Until recently, however, little was known of their social behavior
in the wild; all inferences of social organization were based on observations of
captive animals. During the course of fieldwork the reseracher will document the
composition of troops and analyze patterns of interindividual interaction. The
student will then test the implications of parental investment theory with
regard to group composition, mating systems and interindividual behavior.
Research on different primate species is informative with regard to the
biological spects of the human experience. Primate studies provide a comparative
context for investigating human origins. Information on callitrichids is
especially important since it provides information on male care of infants:
care- giving relationships between adult males and young represent a prfound
difference between human and great ape social organization.
