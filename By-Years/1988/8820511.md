Support is requested for the purchase of a computer-interfaced CD
spectropolarimeter for use by several investigators within three different
departments of the university. A common interest among the primary users is the
determination of the conformation and structure of both water-soluble and
membrane-bound peptides and proteins. Several users also have strong research
efforts directed toward the investigation of the thermodynamics of protein
stability and the kinetic mechanism of protein folding and unfolding. Thus, an
instrument has been chosen based on its capabilities to obtain high quality far-
UV spectra as well as the ability to make measurements as a function of
temperature and on a rapid time scale. Access to this instrumentation, which is
presently unavailable, would enhance the research efforts of several groups, and
would foster new collaborative efforts to study protein structure and function
relationships at UAB.
