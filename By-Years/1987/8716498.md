This award will enable collaborative research between Professor Rodolfo Llinas
of the New York University Medical Center and Professor Kazuo Sasaki of Kyoto
University, Japan. These investigators will use magnetoencephalography (MEG) to
localize the site of the onset of prefrontal and motor cortex activity that
precedes movement in a human subject instructed to produce a well defined phasic
motor response to a short visual stimulus. Magnetic recordings in a set of
individuals will be compared with the actual anatomy of the brain as studied
with Magnetic Resonance Imaging. The investigators will be applying newly-
developed instrumentation to the study of the human brain. The use of MEG, as
compared to standard electroencephalography (EEG), should provide better
localization of neural events preceding and accompanying movement in humans.
Drs. Llinas and Sasaki bring well-established and complementary expertise to
this project. The excellent facilities of the Medical Center at New York
University and the Institute for Brain research at Kyoto University will be used
mutually by the investigators.
