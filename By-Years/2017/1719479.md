Implementation projects provide support to Historically Black Colleges and
Universities (HBCUs) to design, implement, and assess strategies that can lead
to comprehensive institutional efforts to increase the number of students
receiving undergraduate degrees in science, technology, engineering and
mathematics (STEM) and enhance the quality of their preparation by strengthening
STEM education and research. The project at Elizabeth City State University
seeks to further strengthen programs for building STEM student success. The goal
of the project is to design pathways to increase the numbers of students
pursuing STEM majors and the quality of their preparation into graduate programs
and careers. Activities that are part of this project are: a pre-college summer
program that includes incoming freshmen, K-12 teachers and parents; a sophomore
bridge program to address the critical transition from the freshman to the
sophomore year; a STEM innovation lab to develop creative approaches to teaching
STEM undergraduate courses; and hierarchical mentoring for undergraduate
students. The activities and strategies are evidence-based and what is learned
through this project can serve as a model for other small liberal arts
institutions.
