This is an award under the Research at Undergraduate Institutions program. The
objective of the research is the investigation of the surface and electronic
properties of zirconium boride system. Single crystal specimens are being grown
by an arc-induced zone melting technique. Scanning Auger spectrometry is used to
determine the chemical composition of the surfaces. Thermionic projection
microscopy is used to measure work function of the various crystallographic
planes. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy is used to determine the electronic
band structure. The work function of these materials is being modelled. A high
emphasis is being placed on the training of undergraduate students for future
careers in graduate education and research.
