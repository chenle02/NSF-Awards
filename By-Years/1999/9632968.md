9632968 Avallone This Small Grant for Exploratory Research is being awarded for
the testing and deployment of a prototype instrument for detecting halogen
oxides in the troposphere. An existing and proven instrument that has made
measurements of chlorine monoxide and bromine monoxide in the stratosphere has
been modified to perform under the higher total pressure and larger water vapor
partial pressure conditions characteristic of the troposphere. Bromine species
are believed to play a dominant role in the observed sudden depletions of ozone
over the arctic region during springtime. Bromine monoxide has been detected in
large abundance during these events. The PI will participate in the ARCTOC '96
campaign which is being sponsored by the European Community during March-May
1996. During this campaign, bromine monoxide will be measured using other
techniques as well, thereby providing an opportunity to test the modified
instrument. If this instrument works as anticipated, halogen oxide measurements
will be provided with faster time response and lower detection limit than other
techniques currently in use.
