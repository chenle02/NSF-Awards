This international workshop will be held in Bellagio, Italy, under the
sponsorship of the Rockefeller Foundation. Researchers from the US, Tanzania,
and Europe and Japan, as well as representatives of private and multilateral
funding agencies and appropriate ministries in Tanzania, will discuss
preservation of the sites and their use as both field schools for training
future scientists and as touristic destinations. Preservation of the Olduvai
Gorge, Laetoli footprints, and rock art and other paleoanthropological resources
of Tanzania is an urgent concern for the scientific community. It also promises
potential economic benefits to Tanzania, if the preservation provides for access
by tourists and others who would bring in foreign exchange. The partial support
provided by NSF focuses on actual researchers, and ensures the participation of
the younger generation of Tanzanian scientists, who will in the future have
responsibility to carry out the action recommendations of this workshop.
