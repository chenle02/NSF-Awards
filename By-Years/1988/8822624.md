This award supports observations of the completion of the surge of West Fork
Glacier, Alaska, and its effects on the Susitna River, into which it drains. The
results will be analyzed in the context of pre-surge studies of the flow regime
of the glacier, and the sediment regime of the river. Observations of the surge
and of the damage system were begun early in the surge using resources from an
ongoing project. It is anticipated that the additional information will be
particularly important when compared with that from the detailed studies of
Variegated glacier. Also, it will be the first time that the effects of a major
surge on a large river have been studied. Results will impact our understanding
of the rapid glacial surge mechanism, and will have significance for
understanding the dynamics of large continental glaciers, such as the West
Antarctic Ice Sheet.
