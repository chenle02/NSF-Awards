This award supports cooperative research in polymers to be conducted by Harry
Frisch of the Research Foundation of New York (SUNY-Albany) and Glaucione de
Barros of the Federal University of Ceara in Fortaleza, Brazil. They will study
novel methods of polymer modification by the formation of interpenetrating
polymer networks. Such networks could result in more valuable modified natural
polymers with significantly enhanced physical properties. Improved mechanical
properties of natural rubber such as increased strength, frictional and impact
resistance will be sought in work that requires little sophisticated equipment
or materials. For example, ionic or electrical conductivity can be improved by
suitable material doping. Network composites made of carnauba wax can produce a
material of lower crystallinity. This collaboration represents an excellent fit
between the research interests of the investigators. Additionally, the proposed
interaction between them will result in new graduate programs for students at
both institutions. The project is expected to result in a new polymer research
capability in Brazil and in substitute products from natural sources, of mutual
benefit as petroleum supplies become scarce or prices rise.
