The physiology and anatomy of human cognitive processing are among the most
complex and compelling problems in biology, owing to a lack of a technique for
measuring the activity of populations of cortical neurons within the intact
human brain. Neuromagnetometry, a newly developed imaging technique, promises a
solution to this dilemma. By measuring the magnetic field produced by brain
electrical currents, it is possible to localize the intracranial sources of
these currents with millimeter precision. However, the presence of contaminating
environmental magnetic noise has necessitated extensive signal averaging. Thus,
the neuromagnetic study of the weak signals associated with higher cognitive
functions has remained a difficult problem because higher cognitive processes do
not remain static for long periods of time. The solution is to reduce the
background noise through the use of a magnetically shielded chamber. This
proposal requests funding for the purchase of such a chamber to be used by
investigators studying the neurobiology of cognition. Specific research topics
include early vision, early audition, language, and selective attention.
