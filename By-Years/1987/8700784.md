This project is the third bridge workshop under the auspices of the UJNR Panel
on Seismic and Wind Effects. The objective of the Workshop is to continue the
cooperation between Japan and the United States on the general topic of research
pertaining to bridge structures. The major considerations to be discussed at
this Workshop are the evaluation of performance and strengthening of bridges of
various types, in order to arrive at a coordinated program of research. The
researcher is qualified to perform this project by past experiences on
conducting previous Workshops and by his highly regarded technical competence.
The project is recommended for an award. This is a one time award for 12 months.
