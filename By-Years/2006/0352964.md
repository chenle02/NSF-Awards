This dissertation proposal will support research by a young CoPI to investigate
the issue of climate change in Arctic Alaska through research on both indigenous
knowledge and western scientific knowledge and the possible synergies that can
be created between them. This is a model project, well defined with a clear
statement of methodology and plan for analyses. Through classic ethnographic
methodology (open-ended interviews and participant observation) among the
Inupiat, the researcher will gain insight into core questions about the people
and their relationship to the environment, the existence of a core set of
variables that determine how the Inupiat experience and analyze their
environment, and identify common issues between indigenous communities and
scientist in order to create opportunities for collaboration.
