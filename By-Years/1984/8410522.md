The Large EddySimulation (LES) method results in turbulence models whose
predictions show marked improvement in calculating not only the mean flow
features, but also in calculating the theoretically expected features of the
statistics of the turbulence fluctuations. These calculations are made with very
coarse grids. The LES method will be adapted to time-varying flows and to
irregular meshes. These adaptations will be tested by formulating a two-
dimensional model of Lake Erie and comparing the results to an extensive library
of field data andprevious model computations. A full turbulence simulation will
also be used to test calculations made with various proposed modifications and
subgrid scale expressions.
