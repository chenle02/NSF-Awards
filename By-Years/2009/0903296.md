The GIS Faculty Institute at the Community College of Aurora provides training
for a group of thirteen community college faculty and supports them in
implementing a GIS module in their classroom. This project addresses regional
workforce needs for GIS-related skills by introducing students to GIS via an
experiential, modular unit within a course of study. The GIS Faculty Institute
uses a two-pronged approach: (1) faculty learn to use basic GIS applications and
receive support in designing and delivering their own module for use in a class;
and (2) faculty learn about occupational applications of GIS in the Denver
Metropolitan region through guest lectures and industry field trips. Several
hundred students are using the GIS modules in classes taught by the faculty and
are gaining problem solving and collaborative skills while becoming aware of GIS
career opportunities. GIS occupational information and learning experiences are
also being included in a variety of student activities throughout the year, thus
impacting the entire college. While the GIS Faculty Institute is impacting
faculty and students at the Community College of Aurora, this project also
contributes to ongoing national efforts to develop models of ways to incorporate
GIS into existing community college curricula. In coordination with the ATE
GeoTech Center, this project is disseminating its findings to the broad academic
community working to address the challenge of igniting interest in, and
knowledge of, GIS as an occupational option for students.
