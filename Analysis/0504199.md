Abstract Asaeda

The Jones polynomial arose from the study of subfactors. A key element in the
study of the Jones polynomial is its description in terms of skein relations and
state sums. Other subfactors give rise to other quantum invariants of knots and
links. The PI and U. Haagerup discovered subfactors that are not associated to
any other known objects like quantum groups. She will continue her study of
quantum invariants associated to those subfactors as well as the type {cal D}
and {cal E} subfactors (via the quantum double construction) by exposing the
skein relations and state sums underlying them. In another direction, Khovanov
homology theories are homology theories of knots and links in S^3 whose Euler
characteristic yields quantum invariants associated to the quantum groups
U_q(sl_n). The PI proposes to continue her study of these by extending their
definition to quantum invariants coming from subfactors, and to knots and links
lying in manifolds besides S^3. The PI also continue her work on quantum double
of subfactors and a generalization to quantum multiples. Subfactor theory is
among operator algebra theory one of the most influential subjects in the sense
that it has relations and applications to topology, representation theory, and
quantum physics. However its merit has not been understood, particularly in
topology. The proposed research will make the results in subfactor theory
accessible to topologists, and thus give a new bridge between subfactor theory
and topology, and increase collaboration between them. So far subfactor theory
has not been very accessible for undergraduate students, not even for most
graduate students due to the amount of prerequisite in analysis. The proposed
research will reveal combinatorial structures of subfactors, that may be easily
handled without strong background in analysis. It will provide suitable topics
for undergraduate research and thus activate interaction among students of
various level and faculty, including women and minorities.
