This project will analyze hydrographic and current meter data collected as part
of the Abyssal Boundary Current Studies. Two hydrographic cruises and 14 current
meter mooring were located at the southern end of the Argentine Basin between
January 1986 and April 1987. The primary goals of this projects are to determine
the spreading paths and volume transport of the Weddell Sea Deep Water entering
the South Atlantic Ocean and interaction between North Atlantic Deep Water and
the Antarctic Circumpolar Current.
