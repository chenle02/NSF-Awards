Research in membrane and thin film science has been identified as a critical
need in a recent NSF Workshop report and in three recent NRC reports. Eleven
faculty in the Department of Chemical Engineering at the University of Colorado
at Boulder will participate in this Research Experiences for Undergraduates
(REU) program. Recruiting for the REU will be done in cooperation with the
Minority Engineering, Women in Engineering, and Summer Minority Access to
Research Training programs. The REU program will involve training in research
methods, safety, information retrieval, professional ethics, problem-solving
skills, oral and written communication skills, analytical techniques, and
preparing for graduate school. A significant institutional commitment is made in
terms of funds contributed to REU stipend support, travel, housing, laboratory
supplies, and student benefits.
