The broader impact of this SBIR Phase I project is to help manage water quality
at the boundaries of cities and watersheds. The proposed work develops a
financial system to help cities and public utilities build infrastructure
projects. This system integrates physical data with artificial intelligence and
advanced monitoring systems. It will serve as a scalable analytics platform
using environmental, economic, and social data for financing projects in water
quality management.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project develops analytics
and a financial instrument for environmental adaptation and water restoration
projects. It uses open-source data management, sensors and interfaces, and
mathematical models in a system with state-of-the-art artificial intelligence-
enabled digital twin technology. The environmental data will be used in an
integrated watershed model using principles of uncertainty analysis and neural
network-based learning. The econometric model combines uncertainty analysis with
reinforcement learning where accuracy in prognostics is
incentivized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
