This award will aid in the establishment of a parallel processing research
laboratory based on a pool of heterogeneous parallel processors. The laboratory
will connect shared memory and message- based parallel systems via a pool of
shared memory. Users will access this heterogeneous parallel system, called
Tapestry, via a high-speed network from workstations and existing facilities in
the department. The Tapestry research encompasses architecture, system software,
and parallel applications. A reconfigurable, heterogeneous system composed of
shared memory and message passing parallel processors will provide the testbed
for the Tapestry operating system, for work in performance evaluation, and for
studies of selected parallel applications including numerical solution of
partial differential equations.
