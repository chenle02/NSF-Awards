9423532 Glashausser Research will be carried out in high energy electron
scattering knockout reactions, photonuclear reactions, nuclear structure studies
based on polarization transfer, and hyperon- nucleon interactions. Research in
these areas will advance our understanding of the structure of the structure of
the nucleus, nucleon structure, the short range processes dominating lambda-
nucleon interactions, and the transition from non-nucleonic and mesonic degrees
of freedom as effective descriptions of processes to description based on
quarks. These topics are high priority activities in contemporary nuclear
physics. Development, construction, and utilization of major state-of-the-art
equipment, including a focal plane polarimeter and specialized detectors is
integral to this activity. Education of graduate students and postdocs is a
strong component in every aspect of this grant for this Rutgers Nuclear Physics
group.***
