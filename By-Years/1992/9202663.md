This award will provide supplementary support to enable Dr. Paul Berkman of the
Ohio State University to conduct collaborative research with Dr. Yoshio Yoshida
for 12 months at the National Institute of Polar Research in Japan. Berkman and
Yoshida will compare modern and fossil samples of scallops and clams in order to
interpret the environmental and sea level variations of Antarctica during the
Holocene period. The shells of modern scallops and clams provide a record of
their environmental conditions, reflecting hydrochemical variations associated
with glacial meltwater stream impacts in the nearshore marine environment.
Berkman and Yoshida believe that these same hydrochemical signatures exist in
fossil molluscs around Antarctica and can be used to interpret glacial melting
and sea level variations in the past. The team will collect modern and fossil
samples of A. colbecki and L. elliptica near Syowa Station, an Antarctic
research facility run by the Japan Antarctic Research Expedition, and will
analyze the shells back in Japan. Dr. Miyai's experience in interpreting
Antarctic coastal geomorphology complements Dr. Berkman's expertise in Antarctic
scallops. Their collaboration will help determine how the Antarctic ice sheets
have responded to changes in the earth's climate for the past 10,000 years and
how they have contributed to the changes in seal level throughout the world.
