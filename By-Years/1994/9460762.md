This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will explore the
feasibility of building a practical tool for software maintenance based on
theory. Maintenance presently consumes most of the lifecycle costs of most
software, yet current methods used for this work are at best ad hoc. Building on
a formal theory of Transformational Maintenance by Design Reuse 0, Semantic
Designs (SD) intends to demonstrate, by construction and validation, the utility
of a semantics-based Design Maintenance System (MS) in installing incremental
changes to software for functionality, performance and portability. DMS would
enable a nearly continuous software modification process, unifying both software
design and software maintenance activities. While the theory requres software
generated transformationally from a specification, DMS would be augmented with
(transformational) design recovery mechanisms to enable its application to
existing code. During the SBIR Phase I research effort, SD will establish the
feasibiity of a practical DMS by designing `nonlinear` transformation dependency
networks, choosing suitable internal representations for code schemas and
translation methods for converting code transformations to/from those schemas,
defining an initial ar chiteture for the DMS, and evaluating it by manual
simulation on sample real codes.
