The area of research of this project is set theory, in particular, large
cardinals and forcing. Set theory may be viewed as containing mathematics, that
is, every theorem of classical mathematics may be formulated as a statement
about sets, and then formally derived from the standard collection ZFC of axioms
for set theory. Beginning with the work of Godel (1936) and Cohen (1963), set
theorists have shown that problems on which mathematicians have worked are
independent, i.e. neither provable nor disprovable from ZFC. The first and most
well-known example of this is the Godel-Cohen result that Cantor's continuum
hypothesis is independent. Some statements independent of ZFC are nevertheless
known to be provable when ZFC is augmented by axioms asserting the existence of
large infinite cardinal numbers. The project has three parts: first, to continue
the study of a class of very large cardinals; second, to continue the study of
the relation of these cardinals to problems in finite combinatorics; and third,
to study some unrelated topics. While the details of proofs in this area are
mainly meant for experts, it is a remarkably intriguing discovery that some very
basic mathematical propositions not only have not yet been proved or disproved,
but can be proved to be unprovable (or disprovable).
