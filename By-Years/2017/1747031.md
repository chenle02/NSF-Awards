The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to bring to the
market a high-resolution digital fingertip: an easy-to-use, compact, and
compliant sensor that will provide human-like tactile sensing. Such a sensor can
be used to automate assembly tasks in next-generation factories, enable smart
objects to understand their tactile environment, and equip scientists with a
finger-like sensor for studying human touch. Industries have been transformed by
the digitization of our auditory and visual worlds. A high-resolution digital
fingertip will provide the mechanism for digitizing the tactile world leading to
applications and technological developments that will touch many
industries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
Phase I project will develop a compact, compliant, and high-resolution tactile
sensor based on GelSight elastomeric imaging technology. This project proposes a
modular optical and illumination architecture for GelSight imaging that will
create the appropriate conditions for 3D measurement in a compact package. The
modular system can be tiled to cover a large field of view without increasing
the device thickness. This effort will lead to new insight into illumination
design for shading-based 3D measurement as well as optimizations to allow for
real-time tactile information. The system will be coupled with a software
development kit (SDK) that provides real-time tactile information, including
contact locations, contact force and contact shape. The SDK will make the system
accessible to researchers and engineers from other disciplines, which is
essential for the successful commercialization of the technology. The high-
resolution digital fingertip, together with the SDK, will provide a foundation
for further exploration into digital touch as well as applications that benefit
from tactile information.
