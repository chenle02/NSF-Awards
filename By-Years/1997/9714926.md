Abstract OPP-9714926 MASCHNER UNIV. WISCONSIN This workshop will address the
processes for sharing, disseminating, and standardizing ecological,
archaeological, and paleoecological data obtained from the Aleutian Archipelago
for human behavioral studies. The goals are to establish a common research
agenda that would address the relationship between humans and their environments
in the southern Bering Sea and Aleutian region; to develop an overarching
research design to investigate some of the "big issues" in northern social
sciences; and to ensure outlets for integration and collaboration. The
organization of the workshop will include short research-based presentations by
participants, task groups that will document key issues in Aleutian research,
and colloquia which would outline a monograph of Aleutian ecology, archaeology,
and paleoecology to establish a knowledge baseline for future research.
Participation is planned to included academic researchers and local people
knowledgeable and interested in the Aleutian environment.
