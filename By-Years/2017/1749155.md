Title: Student Travel Support for Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop at
POPL 2018&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Seventh Programming Languages Mentoring
Workshop (PLMW) will take place on January 17 2018, as part of the flagship
programming language conference, Principles of Programming Languages (POPL),
which will be held in Los Angeles, California. This grant will support
approximately 10 students to attend the PLMW event, in addition to the POPL
conference. While there is other funding available (through ACM SIGPLAN PAC) for
students who are presenting papers at POPL, this proposal is intended
specifically to increase the numbers of students from underrepresented groups
and gives priority to US citizens and permanent residents. The broader
significance and importance of the grant relate to the need to broaden
participation, provide opportunities for students to receive mentoring from
leading members of the programming languages community, and build the next
generation of researchers and knowledgeable practitioners in this important
research arena.
