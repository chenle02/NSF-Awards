This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
will assist the Department of Chemistry at the University of Nebraska--Lincoln
in the purchase of a parallel computational facility using IBM SP2. This
equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including the following:
(1) Theory and Computer Simulations of Phase Transition, (2) Crystallography,
Molecular Modeling of Macromolecular Systems, (c) Molecular Simulations and
Modeling of Supramolecular Clusters, (d) NMR-related Theoretical Studies, and
(e) Molecular Modeling of Catalyst-Substrate Interactions. A workstation network
of fast, modern computer workstations is a new way to satisfy the computing
needs of chemistry departments. Such a "computer network" also serves as a
development environment for new theoretical codes and algorithms, provides
state-of-the-art graphics and visualization facilities and supports research in
state-of-the-art applications of parallel processing.
