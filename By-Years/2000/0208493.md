0208493&lt;br/&gt;Zoback&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a project to provide
management and support for selected scientific activities associated with a
pilot hole to be drilled at the site of the San Andreas Fault Observatory at
Depth (SAFOD). SAFOD is a component of EarthScope. The SAFOD pilot hole is a
separate, 2 km deep scientific drilling experiment to be carried out at the same
surface location as SAFOD. This site is ~1.8 km SW of the San Andreas fault near
Parkfield, CA. The pilot hole project will be carried out as a collaborative
effort between the International Continental Drilling Program (ICDP), NSF, and
the US Geological Survey. The ICDP has made available $1.5M to pay the costs for
drilling, coring, logging and other rig-related activities. NSF is providing
support for science activities involving core and cuttings and measurements of
various kinds in the hole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
