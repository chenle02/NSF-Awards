This award provides for approximately 22% of the total amount needed to acquire
a gas chromatograph-isotope ratio mass spectrometer. The additional funding
necessary for this acquisition has been committed by DOE and the University of
Oklahoma. This instrument will be used to determine the isotopic composition of
individual components in complex organic mixtures in sedimentary detritus
derived from diverse geologic source materials. Individual components in Recent
sediments, oil, source rock extracts, or pyrolysis products can be separated via
GC, combusted to carbon dioxide, and their isotopic composition determined in
real time. Isotopic data currently in the literature for organic matter in
sediments of varying age are typically average values of all organic components
in the mixture;it has been impossible or exceedingly difficult and expensive to
determine the isotopic composition of individual components using traditional
techniques. The isotopic composition of the individual components will be used
as biomarkers and may be valuable in reconstructing the paleohistory of
sediments containing these materials.
