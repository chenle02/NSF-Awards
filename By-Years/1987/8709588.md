In magnetic disk files and tape drives, the read/write element is separated from
the magnetic medium by a thin air bearing. In present "state of the art" disk
file, the air bearing flying height is approximately .33 um, and a reduction to
less than .2 um is anticapated in the near future. At those small spacings,
contacts between the read/write head and the magnetic medium are unavoidable. In
addition contacts occur during start/stop of the file and during track seeking.
Since these contacts cause wear of the head/disk interface, a thorough
understantding of head/disk tribology is required, and extreme care must be
exercised in the design of the individual components to guarantee sufficient
life time. This project is concerned with the mechanisms of wear and boundary
lubrication of oxide coated rigid magnetic disks. Friction and wear experiments
will be conducted on unlubricated and lubricated magnetic medium, and
accelerated wear tests will be designed. Analytical surface instrumentation will
be used to investigate lubricant distribution on the disk, and theoretical
modeling of the head/disk wear mechanism will be conducted.
