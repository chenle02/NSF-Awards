Computational Complexity is a modern discipline which analyzes the inherent
difficulty of a given task. A great deal of progress has been made in
classifying the time and space requirements of certain combinatorial problems.
The complexity classes L, NL, P, NP-logarithmic space, nondeterministic
logarithmic space, polynomial time, nondeterministic polynomial time,
respectively-have been studied extensively. Nonetheless little is known about
the comparative strengths of different resources-it is yet to be proved that the
above classes are not all identical. These classes will be studied from a
mathematical viewpoint, and have examined the inherent difficulties of
expressing conditions and shown that a robust alternate view of complexity
ensues. The computational complexity of a property is closely tied to the
complexity of expressing the property in first-order logic, and a series of
languages have been introduced which express exactly those properties checkable
in a series of computational complexity classes. The existence of such natural
languages for each important complexity class sheds a new light on complexity
theory. These languages reaffirm the importance of the complexity classes as
much more than machine dependent issues. The research will concentrate on the
following specific proposals: (1) Order-Independent Languages, (2) First-Order
Interpretations, (3) Applications to Databases and Incremental Complexity, and
(4) Tradeoffs in Descriptive Complexity.
