The introduction of environmental trace analysis into the curriculum of
undergraduate biology and chemistry courses has been made possible with the
addition of a Gas Chromatograph/Mass Spectrometer system (GC/MS). The biology
and chemistry curriculums place a heavy emphasis on environmental and aquatic
analysis as a result of the location of the campus. A GC/MS is increasingly
important for analysis of organics and, in particular, trace organics in
environmental samples. The fundamentals of GS/MS are introduced, followed by
hands-on use of the instrument in projects in Environmental Analysis, Organic
Chemistry, Marine Ecology, Freshwater Ecology and Instrumental Analysis. A total
of seven courses are affected by this project. In addition, the GC/MS can be
extensively used in ongoing undergraduate research projects and a long-term
project to monitor the sediments and aquatic environment of Mt. Hope Bay.
