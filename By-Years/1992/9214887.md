This project is to address the issues of accessibility of computer equipment by
persons with visual disabilities. Concern is expressed that the current trends
in visual interfaces may significantly inhibit access by such individuals.
Within this project input will be obtained by potential users, prototype systems
will be developed and tested by users, and based on feedback, appropriate
revisions in the system will be implemented. Finally, the materials developed
will be distributed to individuals and organizations who can benefit from it.
The work is an extension of the previously funded "UnWindows" project.
