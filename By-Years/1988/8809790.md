This project will assess the potential of developing ceramic matrix composites
with various two dimensional (2-D) and three dimensional (3-D) reinforcements
for high temperature structural applications. Silicon carbide fiber reinforced
silicon carbide matrix composite will be used as a model system. Composites with
different reinforcement geometries including 2-D woven, knitted; 3-D braided and
3-D angle lock structures will be fabricated. The experimental part will include
characterization of the interface microstructure, damage development, failure
modes, and toughening mechanisms under static fracture, impact and creep
loadings. The analytical program will establish the constitutive relations, and
the theoretical model of the response of the composite to various mechanical
loading. In addition, the performance and deformation mechanism maps of various
ceramic composites with the combination of different fiber/matrix/reinforcement
geometry will be constructed. The results of this work will serve as the
knowledge-base for processing and design of tough ceremic matrix composites
based upon 2-D and 3-D reinforcements.
