9624753 Himpsel This project aims at finding new, universal methods for
obtaining self-assembled one- and zero-dimensional metal structures by
decorating step edges at vicinal surfaces. The surface energetics and the
conditions for smooth, row-by-row growth will be determined by coupling STM with
sophisticated growth and spectroscopy techniques. Particular emphasis is placed
on magnetic nanostructures for use as magnetic sensors and storage media. %%%
The goal of this project is the design of artificial materials that consist of
ultrafine wires, about one hundred times narrower than those produced with
current micro- structure fabrication techniques. New patterning methods will be
developed where atoms arrange themselves automatically at a stepped crystal
surface. Applications of the new materials in magnetic data storage will be
pursued. ***
