The objective of this faculty internship project is the development of an
automated sales order system and its integration with other management systems
within an industrial environment. The design of the system is such that no
specialized knowledge of products, components or prices is required by the
client. The structure of the system allows machine orders to be placed and
confirmed without human intervention. This effort draws heavily from concepts of
knowledge-based systems and its applicability extends to both manufacturing and
construction systems. The project is viewed as a major step in the development
of a long term relationship between the researchers and the sponsoring
organization.
