This project will host a 2-day workshop in Alexandria, VA which will bring
together the community of Cyberinfrastructure for Sustained Scientific
Innovation (CSSI) awardees. The meeting will help to (1) showcase the diversity
of projects within the CSSI program, specifically with respect to their
scientific applications; (2) significantly advance networking among funded CSSI
projects; (3) analyze lessons learned pertaining to sustainability of project
outcomes and products; (4) identify requirements and leading practices for data
integrity and provenance; (5) create vision and identify tangible steps for
creating a diverse and inclusive workforce for CI; and (6) develop
recommendations for a sustainable organizing committee process and future
meeting structures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting will foster networking and
cross-pollination between CSSI and CSSI-related projects and their larger
communities to broaden awareness about ongoing developments in this community,
identify synergies, catalyze new collaborations, and advance knowledge transfer,
coordination, and convergence among these projects. The meeting will serve as a
focused forum for PIs to share technical information with each other and NSF
Program Officers; to explore innovative topics emerging within software and data
infrastructure communities; to discuss emerging best practices and solutions
across the supported software and data infrastructure projects; to stimulate
thinking on new ways of achieving software and data sustainability; to gather
the shared experiences in an online web portal; and to identify ways to increase
diversity in the CSSI and broader CI community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
