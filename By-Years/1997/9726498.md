The investigator continues to provide data for atmospheric species at relevant
energies, as accurate cross section data are needed to model the behavior of the
upper atmosphere. His experiments focus on collision of keV-energy oxygen,
hydrogen, and helium atoms and ions, with atomic oxygen and atomic hydrogen, and
on electron-impact ionization of molecules. Finally, he conducts a new
experiment measuring energy loss in keV-energy collisions of neutral and ionic
species.
