This is funding to partially support a research symposium that is expected to
attract approximately 100-150 participants. The behavior of social insects is a
growing source of inspiration for computer scientists, especially those
investigating algorithms for multi-agent systems and robotics. The goal of the
workshop, which will be the second in the series but the first to be held in the
United States, is to bring computer scientists, biologists, robotics
researchers, mathematicians and engineers together to share ideas: on how
mathematical and algorithmic models of insect behavior might inspire solutions
to problems in computing, planning and logistics; and on how methodologies and
techniques from computing and engineering might be applied to the problem of
understanding social insect behavior. The PI's hypothesis is that such
collaborations among computer scientists, roboticists and biologists may well
lead to a cascade of new science in all these disciplines. To this end, the PI
intends to make special efforts to foster diversity among the participants, and
to include a mixture of senior and junior researchers, practitioners, and
students. In particular, because it is likely that there will be some graduate
students who may find it hard to justify the cost of attending a non-mainstream
workshop to their departments or advisors, or who simply do not have the funds
to attend, a large chunk of the funds will be earmarked for supporting
participation by bright, interdisciplinary students and members of under-
represented groups, who might not otherwise attend but who may have a
significant impact upon the delegates. The PI is soliciting funding from
industry and from European agencies; the PI expects NSF funding will be used to
support attendance by approximately 15 faculty and 20 students.

Broader Impacts: The workshop will help shape ongoing and future research
projects in several disciplines, and will support timely cross-fertilization
among them. In particular, the meeting will help expand the involvement of
graduate students in this synergistic effort, by providing them an opportunity
to gain wider exposure in the community for their innovative work and to obtain
feedback and guidance from senior members of the research community. It will
further help foster a sense of community among these young researchers, by
allowing them to create a social network both among themselves and with senior
researchers at a critical stage in their professional development. Because the
students and faculty constitute a diverse group across a variety of dimensions,
including nationality/cultural and scientific discipline, the students' horizons
are broadened to the future benefit of the various fields.
