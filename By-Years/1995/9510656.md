9510656 Jonckheere Traditional robustness issues in uncertain feedback systems
analysis and design can be approached by considering the space of uncertain
parameters cut into two pieces by the crossover hypersurface separating that
part of the uncertainty where specifications are met from that part where
specifications are not met. A crucial observation is that this separating
hypersurface can get very complicated and complexity bounds on its homology can
be found. In addition to the possibility of computing the u function from this
geometric situation, structural instability of the hypersurface has indeed
appeared to be the only way to explain the embarrassing problem of lack of
continuity of the real u-function relative the "certain" parameters. A prototype
code for simplicial algorithm construction and display of the hypersurface -
using the emerging computational geometry technology - is already on the verge
of becoming operational. The first objective of this proposal is to further
develop this code into a more powerful, user-friendly one using state-of- the-
art computational geometry, anisotropic gridding, etc. The second objective of
this proposal is to develop algebraic code (Grobner basis) for singularity of
the Nyguist map that could reveal the potential for structural instability of
the hypersurface or lack of continuity of performance relative to rounding
errors. Special attention will be devoted to singularity over a stratified
uncertainty space. ***
