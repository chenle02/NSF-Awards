This project from George Mason University (Mason) creates an NSF I-Corps Site
that will have a close affiliation with the Washington DC I-Corps Node.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded
entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support
multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the
marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking
opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their
work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants.
&lt;br/&gt;I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and
contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers,
entrepreneurs and investors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An NSF I-Corps Site at Mason
will aid in the creation of a commercialization facilitation infrastructure that
will enhance the impact of existing and future entrepreneurial training and
support activities and will demonstrate the value of entrepreneurship education
to the Mason community. The I-Corps Site will impact the preparedness of
university talent for roles in technology-based entrepreneurial enterprises and
as such will be a critical ingredient of the economic success of Virginia and
the United States as a whole. With an I-Corps Site, Mason's commercialization
facilitation activities will support a shift from an economy dependent on
traditional employers to an entrepreneurially-driven economy. As more startups
begin to flourish, new jobs will be created and the career prospects of future
graduates will be strengthened. On the national level, there is valid concern
that the US is losing its standing as the global leader in technology. Mason's
activities will counter this trend by teaching university researchers to think
beyond traditional academic boundaries, thus enabling this group of highly-
talented scientists to become drivers of innovation within technology-based
entrepreneurial companies that they help to create.
