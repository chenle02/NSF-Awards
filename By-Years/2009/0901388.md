Objective: The PI proposes using palladium and metal oxide nanoclusters as
catalytic coatings for fast, high sensitivity/specificity, chemical to optical
transduction. Coated, optically pumped, nanoscale VCSELs amplify and encode gas
induced changes into an output power and/or wavelength shift for remote readout.

Intellectual Merit: This effort merges new research in nanoscale materials and
device architectures to transform current scientific understanding of
nanophotonic sensors. Gas induced lattice expansion of palladium nanoclusters is
a hot research topic for electrical hydrogen sensors, but due to potential
sparking, optical sensors are advantageous. The PI proposes expanding current
research by characterizing the complex refractive index change caused by lattice
expansion and testing sensors based on this effect.

Broader Impacts: Hydrogen is an attractive alternative fuel, but there is
widespread public concern about its safe production and usage due to hydrogen's
low flammability point of 4% in air. Poor response speed, sensitivity, and
reliability of current hydrogen sensors could derail the future hydrogen fuel
economy. Thus, this project can produce broad societal impact by demonstrating
high performance sensors. Additionally, the research offers rich opportunities
for teaching and training of graduate and undergraduate researchers in several
disciplines. Participation of underrepresented groups will be broadened through
on campus recruitment, REU internships, and K-12 outreach activities.
