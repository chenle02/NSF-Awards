It has been well established that gonadal steroids regulate reproductive
behavior in primates. The main steroid involved in this regulation is
testosterone which acts at specific sites in the brain. Although it is known
that testosterone stimulates male behavior by acting on the brain, very little
is known about the neurobiology of the interaction between the endocrine system
and the central nervous system. The goal of Pomerantz's research program is to
elucidate this relationship in primates. This research will use state-of-the-art
neuroendocrine techniques to study the role of specific areas of the brain that
regulate reproductive behavior. The data generated by this research will provide
a solid foundation for future research aimed at understanding hormone-mediated
neuroendocrine and neurochemical processes that modulate the reproductive
behavior of male primates.
