Recent advances in social choice theory point to the importance of institutions
in leading to consistent and coherent collective outcomes. However, not all
instances of social choice can be characterized as taking place under strong
political institutions. There is a particular lacuna in the area of internal
politics, where topics such as what to do about CFC emissions, what tariff and
trade policies should be formed, or how to collectively eliminate weapons
stockpiles, are all questions of social choice. Rather than relying on
institutional explanations, this research explores a different source of
structure: the role of knowledge systems. The complexity of most decision
contexts forces participants to rely on knowledge structures such as mental
models or cognitive schemas. This research combines cognitively-realistic
assumptions about individual preference formation with abstract social choice
theory. The resulting research illustrates the importance of shared knowledge
structures for collective choices.
