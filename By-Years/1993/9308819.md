9308819 Williamson The main goal of this research is to advance understanding of
government intervention in monetary and financial affairs. The research consists
of three projects. The first will be a study of the quantitative importance of
monetary policy for economic welfare and business cycles in the United States.
This topic has been neglected in macroeconomics over the last ten to fifteen
years, as macroeconomists focused much of their attention on the role of "real"
or supply-side factors in business cycle behavior. This project will answer the
following questions. What is the magnitude of the welfare loss from long-run
inflation relative to the loss from uncertainty about monetary policy? Could the
behavior of the Federal Reserve System over the period 1954-1992 be
characterized as "close" to optimal? If the answer to the last question is no,
then how might policy have been improved? The second project will study the role
for government-provided deposit insurance and the optimal design of deposit
insurance schemes. Recently, it has become painfully clear that something is
dramatically wrong with the system of deposit insurance in the United States,
while economists have had surprisingly little to say about the provision of
deposit insurance. The modeling framework is capable of explaining why U.S.
deposit insurance appeared to work well for a long period of time prior to
failing miserably in the 1980s, and of showing how the system could be improved.
The third project will examine the link between monetary policy and credit.
Recent evidence suggests that "credit crunches" have played an important role in
transmitting changes in Federal Reserve behavior to real activity, yet there is
little agreement on the mechanism by which central bank actions affect the
allocation of credit. The modeling framework to be used here builds on recent
advances in information economics. Credit crunches arise as period where
monetary policy can interact with f inancial regulations to produce an
undesirable allocation of credit.
