9416342 Zhang This research is to determine source parameters of the Northridge
earthquake that can be best resolved with broadband and long-period regional and
teleseismic recordings. Parameters include total seismic moment, total rupture
duration and the overall source geometry. Techniques to be used include complete
waveform inversion of body wave and surface wave signals using an aspherical
earth model with a centroid-moment tensor inversion approach; spectral inversion
of fundamental mode surface waves with propagation corrections for an aspherical
model; body and surface wave deconvolutions using empirical and theoretical
Green's functions; and a combined broadband body waveform/surface wave spectra
inversion for extracting a very broadband source model. The analysis will
provide characterization of the long-period far- field source radiation,
yielding basic constraints on the energy release, duration, and geometry of the
faulting, which must be satisfied by more detailed models striving to match
observed near- field motion. This project is a contribution to the National
Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program and is supported by the Northridge
Earthquake Emergency Appropriation. ***
