9354813 Jungck This project will enable post-secondary biology faculty to
examine, critique, and change their biology curricula by providing the
philosophy, tools, resources, support, and sharing network essential to such a
process. This is being accomplished through a variety of mechanisms including
the publication of a book and the hosting of three learning tools development
workshops. The book will be a multi-authored, collaborative work on the BioQUEST
3P's philosophy with specific examples of use of materials in the BioQUEST
Library, use of the 3P's in wet labs and field work and in situations where
computers are not necessary, and discussions of the specific issues related to
the development and implementation of open-ended, research and research-like
experiences for students. The project will also support curricular reform and
learning tools development through three summer workshops in three additional
major areas of biology. Materials and information dissemination will occur using
a variety of methods including the book, BioQUEST Notes, the BioQUESTLibrary,
presentations and workshops at conferences, the Introducing BioQUEST Hypercard
stacks, field testing of materials as part of the three-stage review process for
publication in the BioQUESTLibrary, through other publications such as journal
articles and labs in labbooks, electronic networks, the monthly consortium
status reports, and responses to general inquiries via phone, e-mail, and U.S.
mail.
