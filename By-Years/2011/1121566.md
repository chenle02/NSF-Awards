A hallmark of memory is that events that are fleeting or might occur only once
can be remembered for a lifetime. How this is accomplished in the brain is thus
of critical importance for understanding brain function and its dysfunction in
disease. Environmental stimuli drive the rapid remodeling of neural circuitry in
part by inducing the activation of genes to make proteins that modify how nerve
cells respond to stimuli and how nerve cells are connected. Traditional studies
to examine how neural activity drives gene activation rely on the time-averaged
behavior of thousands or millions of cells. These suffer from several
limitations. For example, the stimulus is poorly controlled, and averaging
across cells obscures how individual cells respond to stimuli offers only a
static snapshot of a dynamic process. This proposal will develop a novel
platform for single cell analysis of neuronal activity-dependent transcription
by combining light-gated, temporally precise activation of neuronal firing with
real time, quantitative imaging of intracellular calcium and transcription.
Neurons will be engineered to express a light-sensitive ion channel,
Channelrhodopsin 2, to drive neural activity with millisecond precision.
Intracellular calcium will be measured with fluorescent imaging to study the
extent of cell activation. Finally, the brain specific gene, Fos, will be tagged
to produce a fluorescent signal at the moment it is transcribed into messenger
RNA, which provides a blueprint for protein synthesis. This experimental
platform will allow interrogation of the quantitative relationship between
neuronal activity and transcriptional regulation in different activity-dependent
genes. The cell lines developed as part of this project will be made freely
available to other investigators following their publication. The training of
graduate and undergraduate students will be an integral part of the work.
