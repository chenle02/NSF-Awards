The goal of this research project is to create an integrated, interactive, 3-D
virtual environment consisting of anatomical parts, and physiological and
pathophysiological processes. The approach consists of modeling: 1) Deformable
soft tissue for anatomical organs, 2) Anatomical parts that are responsive to
physiological changes, 3) Physiological behavior models, 4) Formal methods for
integrating anatomical parts and physiological process variables and parameters,
5) Recovery of patient-specific data for anatomy (through computer vision
techniques) and physiology, and 6) Real-time simulation and visualization
methods. The results of this research will contribute: 1) New methodologies to
enhance medical education through immersive visualization and interaction, and
2) Clinically-relevant and patient-specific models of acute injuries in trauma.
The goal of the educational plan is the use of the software that will be
developed from the proposed research in courses at the University of
Pennsylvania. Through the exposure to a sophisticated and formal approach to
science, new students are expected to appreciate and develop a deeper
understanding of mathematics, physics, computer vision, computer graphics, and
virtual environments, and their synthesis.
