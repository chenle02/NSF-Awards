Despite many efforts to increase diversity among electrical and computer
engineering (ECE) faculty, the number of women and underrepresented minority
(URM) ECE faculty remains alarmingly low. Only 15.5% of electrical engineering
and 22.9% of computer engineering faculty are female identifying. Only 3.2% of
electrical engineering and 4.4% of computer engineering faculty are African
American. Similarly, 3.3% of electrical engineering faculty and 6.2% of computer
engineering faculty are Hispanic. Research suggests that role models are
extremely important in attracting URM and women students to engineering. The
lack of faculty role models is one of the major contributing factors to low
persistence of women and URM students in ECE programs, thus perpetuating the
cycle of underrepresentation. The goal of the iREDEFINE workshop is to 1)
motivate and prepare women and URM PhD students to pursue ECE faculty positions
in US universities; 2) gather preliminary data on what motivates them to pursue
either academic or industry careers; 3) collect preliminary information about
the institutional support services currently offered to women and URM PhD
students to help them with their career choice.

The iREDEFINE workshop is being held in conjunction with the annual meeting of
the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department Heads Association (ECEDHA)
thus providing a unique opportunity for the iREDEFINE Fellows to network with
department chairs and learn about their programs, potential faculty positions,
and expectations from new faculty, as well as participate in mock academic
interviews with department heads. The iREDEFINE Fellows will also present their
research accomplishments and engage in dedicated programming including sessions
on negotiation strategies; different types of academic institutions; balancing
teaching, research, and service; and navigating the academic job search. By
directly impacting 12 women and URM participants, the iREDEFINE workshop will
help to increase the number of diverse students applying for academic positions
in ECE departments and prepare them for successful academic careers. I addition,
this initiative will also advance the knowledge about successful strategies to
broaden the participation of women and underrepresented minorities in the ECE
professoriate.
