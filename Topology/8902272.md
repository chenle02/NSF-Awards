8902272 Bousfield Professor Bousfield will continue his research on homological
localization of spectra and spaces, together with his research on the general
homotopy and homology properties of mapping spaces and other homotopy inverse
limit spaces. He is working toward a complete algebraic modeling of
K-theoretically localized stable homotopy theory using a united K-homology
theory which combines the complex, real, and self-conjugate theories, and he
plans increasingly to investigate unstable K-localizations. In other work,
Professor Bousfield has established an array of strong convergence theorems for
homotopy and homology spectral sequences of cosimplicial spaces, and is
developing a general cosimplicial obstruction theory. Building on this, he plans
to investigate further unstable Adams spectral sequences for inverse limit
spaces, as well as their homology analogues and the associated obstruction
theories.
