9416868 Webster This is a proposal by two faculty members at Vanderbilt
University to do a very high statistics study of charm mesons in the wide band
fixed target beam at Fermilab. They are finishing the analysis of two
experiments which took data in 1990-91 and are part of the E831 collaboration
which is building the apparatus to take date in 1996-97. They anticipate over
one million reconstruct decays of charm mesons from which they will measure the
form factors, lifetimes and find or set new limits on CP violation in D+ decays.
Vanderbilt has a lead role in building a new inner muon detector system. ***
