0106808&lt;br/&gt;Murphy&lt;br/&gt;Strike-slip faulting clearly dominates the
western margin of the Tibetan plateau, and thrust and normal faulting dominates
the southern margin, but how these two systems interact is unclear. This has led
to two distinct classes of models, one emphasizing orogen-parallel strike-skip
faulting and the other emphasizing southward extrusion of Tibetan crust along
the southern margin. This project will examine the timing and kinematics of the
Karakoram fault system and other faults in the juncture between the western and
southern margins of the Tibetan Plateau in order to discriminate between the
viable models. Results should clarify the role that strike-slip faulting may
play in controlling the dynamics of the southern margin of Tibet in the High
Himalaya of Nepal.&lt;br/&gt;
