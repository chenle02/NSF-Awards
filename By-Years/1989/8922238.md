The Duke University Marine Laboratory will acquire several items of
oceanographic instrumentation to be placed in a pool of shared use equipment.
This equipment is maintained for use on or in association with the R/V CAPE
HATTERAS, a research vessel owned by the NSF and operated by Duke University. A
substantial part of the ship's operating schedule during 1990 is in support of
NSF-sponsored research projects. The instrumentation will also increase the
capabilities of the ship and of the institution to support research and
engineering activities. The instrumentation includes: -Computer and other
hardware upgrades for the SAIL shipboard data logging system, -Niskin bottles
for collecting discrete samples in the water column, -precision graphic recorder
with crystal delay unit for displaying acoustically derived data of seafloor
bathymetry and sedimentary profiles, -a fume hood for removing chemical fumes
from the ship's laboratory, -10 kHz hydrophone for receiving acoustic signals
from deployed instrumentation packages, -Vibration free table to dampen out ship
vibrations while doing microscopy work, -Diving air compressor and dive tanks to
provide a safe and reliable source of breathable air for scientific diving
operations at sea, and -Radio Direction Finder beacons to facilitate locating
floating instrumentation at sea. The instrumentation described above will
increase the capability of the organization to support NSF-sponsored research
and engineering projects.
