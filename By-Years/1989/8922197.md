Travel funds are requested for the 22nd International Liege Colloquium on Ocean
Hydrodynamics to be held May 7-11, 1990 in Liege, Belgium. The colloquium's
theme is Ice Covered Seas and Ice Edges: Physical, Chemical and Biological
Processes and Interactions and will address recent problems and advances in most
aspects of polar oceanography. This colloquium will provide a forum for
discussion of important oceanic processes and their impact on environmental
problems such as long-term climatic changes caused by natural and man-induced
factors, and resource management. The reviewed, published proceedings will
summarize many facets of polar oceanography and the Colloquium's international
representation will foster interdisciplinary exchanges and future international
collaborations. Attendance by United States scientists is consistent with U.S.
policy in the maintenance of an influential research presence in polar regions.
