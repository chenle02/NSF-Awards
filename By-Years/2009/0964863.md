Symposium&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Melosh Medal
Symposium is an internationally recognized graduate student-paper competition in
finite-element analysis that is currently in its twenty-second year. A
distinguished panel of judges selects the finalists that compete in the event,
through a double-blind format. The objectives of this project are to increase
access to the Symposium as well as its visibility for a much broader set of
participants than in previous years. This will be effected by providing travel
assistance to all participants, including the finalists, the judges, and
additional students identified as honorable mentions through the review process.
In anticipation of this assistance opening up the applicant pool to a much
broader class of students, promotional flyers will be sent to engineering
programs at historically black colleges and universities. A call for papers will
also be placed on the web at iMechanica, with particular emphasis placed on the
availability of travel support. The winner will be selected on the basis of a
combined paper/oral presentation score, and the results of the Symposium will be
widely disseminated on the web and local news media.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
benefits of this project are largely educational in nature. The Melosh Symposium
is the only competition of its kind in the area of computational mechanics. It
provides a unique opportunity for top graduate students in engineering to
interact with leading scholars in their field, and is completely separate from
any technical conferences. &lt;br/&gt;
