The primary cell wall of higher plants is a focal point for growth regulation
and disease resistance. This wall is a cell organelle; it has structural
integrity, enzymic autonomy, and self-organizing properties. This research
focuses on one set of macromolecules, the extensins, which, because of their
location, shape, chemistry and especially their tacticity (orderliness), may
play a crucial role as organizers by virture of their ability to form highly
ordered crosslinked networks that mechanically couple the cellulose load-bearing
polymers. Previous work demonstrated extensin peptide periodicity and
isodityrosine as a short intramolecular link; identified a putative crosslink
domain; and purified a cell wall enzyme, extensin peroxidase, which specifically
crosslinks extensin monomers in vitro. This project will define both the
properties of extensin peroxidase and its product, the extensin network. In
particular it will define substrate specificity to identify the minimum
structure required for crosslinking. The work supported by this grant continues
a long term effort to understand the role of one type of protein in the primary
cell walls of plants. The PI has proposed a "warp-weft" model for cell wall
structure based on the idea that the structural protein extension mechanically
couples the load-bearing cellulosic polymers.
