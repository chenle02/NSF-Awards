ABSTRACT AST-9322779 Kenny, Jeffrey The Principal Investigator will investigate
the effects of both local dynamics and the cluster environment on the properties
of massive star formation in galaxies by a detailed examination of high
resolution images and rotation curves of Virgo cluster and isolated spiral
galaxies. By first understanding how the properties of the star-forming disks
depend on local dynamics, he will identify environmental factors which
influences star formation. This study will increase our understanding of the
factors which control star formation and spiral structure in all galaxies. ***
