Professor Bercovici will study the properties of free additive and
multiplicative convolution of measures in the convex plane, as well as
applications of these operations to the calculation of spectral invariants. He
will continue the study of spectral versions of the Nevanlinna-Pick,
Caratheodory, and Nehari problems and explore their relations with control
theory. Another topic of study will be the structure of dual algebras with an
emphasis on algebras generated by a finite number of commuting operators.
Professor Bercovici's research concerns operators on Hilbert space. Hilbert
space operators are essentially infinite matrices of complex numbers. These
operators have applications in every area of applied science as well as in pure
mathematics. Research of this type is an attempt to classify certain important
families of such operators.
