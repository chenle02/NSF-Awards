This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr Dave and his team will use computer
simulations to follow the formation of galaxies through the period 1-2 billion
years after the Big Bang, when the cosmic gas was reionized by ultraviolet light
from newly-formed stars and the active nuclei of galaxies. He and his team will
combine an existing code that computes the motion of dark matter and gas with
their recently-developed radiative transfer code. They will include a treatment
of cooling below 10,000K, and implement adaptive mesh refinement for the
radiative transfer calculation. The effect of star formation on the surrounding
gas is calculated with a momentum-driven wind model that is tuned to match the
evolution of galaxies and the gas around them at more recent times. The team
will produce catalogs of simulated observations of newly-forming galaxies and
the intergalactic gas. These will be made available to the community for
planning observations with the next generation of ground- and space-based
telescopes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A graduate student will be trained by
participating in the research. Dr Dave will develop a course for non-astronomy
majors on the use of astronomical data archives. This will be presented first as
part of a U. Arizona Study Abroad program based at the University of Cape Coast
in Ghana, which he is helping to organize. The budget includes travel grants for
US students, selected on the basis of minority status and academic record.
Students from the University of Cape Coast will also attend. &lt;br/&gt;
