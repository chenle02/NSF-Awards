The focus of this project is to develop access control models, mechanisms and
systems for spatial databases, in particular, geospatial and moving object
databases. Low-cost commercial high-resolution satellite imagery, when coupled
with the publicly available data, may pose significant threats to national
security and privacy. Similar security and privacy concerns exist in moving
object databases when sharing the location and profile&lt;br/&gt;information of
mobile users. To address these issues, the proposed research will make several
novel contributions including: development of a comprehensive authorization
model for specifying access control policies for geospatial data based on the
resolution and spatio-temporal attributes of the images, and based on the
tabular data; devising a unified indexing structure to manage the geospatial
authorizations as well as geospatial objects for efficient processing of access
requests; development of an access control model for moving object databases to
ensure the privacy of mobile consumers by protecting their profile, current
location and movement information; and development of a combined index for
authorizations and moving objects. The solutions to be developed, if successful,
will help in building robust and powerful access control modules for geospatial
and moving object databases, that may influence applications in satellite
industry and mobile
commerce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
