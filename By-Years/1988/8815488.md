This award will support Professor Malvin Kalos of New York University in a
research collaboration with Professor L. Reatto of the Universita degli Studi di
Milano, Italy. The investigators intend to continue their studies in the
computational quantum mechanics of solid and liquid helium. Our current
understanding of low density solid and of the liquid-solid phase transitions of
highly quantum systems is still incomplete. Both experimentally and
theoretically, such transitions are strongly affected by quantum effects. Using
variational calculations and a Green's function Monte Carlo (GFMC) method, the
investigators have obtained important results about liquid-solid transitions and
about basic properties of two-dimensional liquid and solid helium which will be
extended through this collaboration. The proposed work is complementary: the
U.S. side will contribute the methodology of computational many-body theory,
especially as it applies to quantum problems in their ground states and finite
temperature. The Italian side will work on theoretical and analytical results
based on the numerical results obtained by the U.S. researchers. Given this
degree of complementarity, it is likely that the collaboration will lead to
increased understanding of quantum effects of liquid-solid transitions and
materials.
