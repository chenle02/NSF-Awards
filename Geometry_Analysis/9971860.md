Abstract

Award: DMS-9971860 Principal Investigator: Richard A. Wentworth

The Principal Investigator's main interest is the study of geometric structures
arising from equivariant harmonic maps to R-trees, especially where the domain
is a compact 3-manifold or a symplectic 4-manifold. Harmonic maps to non-
positively curved metric spaces have had many applications to rigidity-type
questions. At the same time, group actions on R-trees (a particular example of
such a metric space target) have played an important role in combinatorial group
theory and 3-manifold topology. This proposal seeks to understand the
relationship between the analytic and topological aspects of these problems. The
research will explore the interaction between harmonic maps and incompressible
surfaces, taut foliations, and essential laminations in 3-manifolds. A second
part of this project will study the notion of an SL(2,C) Casson invariant.

Mathematicians have long been interested in classifying the possible shapes of
geometric spaces. Of particular relevance to the physical world are spaces of
dimensions three and four. These are, perhaps surprisingly, also intimately
related to the study of knots. Classically, the methods used for research in
this area have come from algebra, topology, and analytic function theory. More
recently, in part motivated from the physics of vortices, new techniques have
been developed involving maps which minimize energy. This project seeks to
explore the topological ramifications of this approach.
