The primary objective of this U.S.-Poland research project between Dr.
Constantine Georgopoulos of the University of Utah and Dr. Maciej Zylicz of the
University of Gdansk is to examine the molecular mechanisms of action in three
E. coli heat shock proteins. The role of these proteins in replication of the
bacteriophage lambda will be studied under stree and non-stress conditions using
approaches involving protein purification and direct biochemical analysis of
protein interaction. Results should contribute to our understanding of basic
protein physiochemical properties and modes of action. In the process, the
researchers expect to test general hypotheses concerning protein involvement in
binding to hydrophobic domains of other proteins and preveting or disrupting
certain protein-protein interactions. This project in biochemistry fulfills the
program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts
in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and
pool research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
