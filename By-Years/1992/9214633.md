The University of Tennessee requests funds to renovate existing research space
assigned to the Department of Physiology and Biophysics. The renovation intends
to modernize two existing research labs, create two additional labs and develop
multi-user areas for class B tissue culture, data processing, molecular biology,
and image analysis. The facilities at the Nash Building date from 1952 (40
years). The proposed space renovation will: 1) enhance the established
departmental research programs; 2) increase the training opportunities for
predoctoral and postdoctoral fellows; 3) increase the research activity for
faculty and studnets from LeMoyne-Owen College and Fisk University, historically
black liberal arts schools; and 4) augment the educational activities for
minority high school and undergraduate students in the program entitled
"Advancing Science Education through Research for Underrepresented Groups."
