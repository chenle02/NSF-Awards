An analytical model will be constructed to determine details of the physical
mechanisms which govern the behavior and performance of lip seals. The model
will consist of an analysis of the deformation of the lip surface, an analysis
of the flow field within the lubricating film between the lip and the shaft, and
an iterative computational procedure. The flow field will be analyzed using a
finite differences approach to the Reynolds equation, an approach which is
capable of handling cavitation. For small scale apserities and rough surfaces an
averaged Reynolds equation will be employed in the analysis. The deformation
analysis will rely on an influence coefficient approach based on finite element
analysis. The effects of lip geometry will be determined and the results
compared with published experimental data. The possibilities of microengineering
lip surfaces for improved performance will be evaluated.
