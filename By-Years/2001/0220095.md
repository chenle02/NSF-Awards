As the demands on portable embedded systems increase with the incorporation of
high-bandwidth wireless data along with multimedia and speech processing, it is
becoming increasingly difficult to achieve the required performance and power
requirements with programmable solutions. Current platforms for high-end
embedded systems typically comprise one or more RISC or DSP processors, along
with an increasing number of application-specific (ASIC) components that are
necessary to deliver high performance at low power. As more and more
functionality is implemented using ASIC components, the platform's range of
application decreases and its vulnerability to obsolescence
increases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coarse-grained adaptable architectures bridge
the gap between traditional processors and ASIC solutions and can be used to
replace many of the ASIC components in high-performance embedded platforms. The
goal of this research is to make these adaptable architectures accessible to
programmers via a high-level programming language interface. This project will
develop a compiler comprising a standard front-end combined with a parallelizing
backend that performs scheduling and optimization using a simultaneous place and
route algorithm based on those used in physical design automation. Posing the
scheduling problem as a place and route problem allows the many constraints
imposed by adaptable architectures to be solved by a single phase of the
compiler. &lt;br/&gt;
