This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
compact source for lithography. As a synchrotron equivalent, this proposal
presents a single-stepper, XUV or soft-x-ray source, which offers high
brightness, high collimation, modest operating vacuum, excellent spectrum and
moderate cost. The x-rays are generated inside a compact betatron by the
electrons passing through thin radiators made of thin metal foils, crystals or
multi-layers producing a forward-directed beam of x-rays whose photon energies
can be XUV, soft and hard x-ray depending upon choice of radiator. As a
synchrotron mimic, the source can have many applications. For lithography the
x-ray wavelength can be optimized for highest photo-resist sensitivity, e.g.1.4
nm. In a proof of principal experiments, tunable monochromatic x-rays from thin
crystal and multi-layer radiators mounted inside a betatron have been observed.
Pulse-height spectra were obtained and tuned by rocking the crystal or multi-
layer relative to the electron-beam direction. We will use our existing
experimental apparatus to demonstrate high x-ray flux at soft x-ray wavelengths.

Potential commercial applications effort will demonstrate the capability of
generating XUV and x-rays for lithography and crystallography. It can also
function also as a medical source for imaging and as a laboratory source for
scientific purposes now relegated exclusively to synchrotrons.
