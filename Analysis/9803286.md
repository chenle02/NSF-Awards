The principal investigator plans to work on various problems in the theory of
several complex variables and complex dynamics. With Professor Sibony, the
principal investigator will work on a systematic development of the theory of
iterations of holomorphic maps. This depends on the use of pluripotential theory
to construct invariant measures as well as a broad range of function theoretic
tools from the theory of several complex variables. One of the main problems in
the theory of dynamical systems is that the equations are too difficult for
rigorous study. Holomorphic maps have enough structure so that many results can
be proved rigorously thereby giving an idea of phenomena that can occur also in
more complicated systems. The principal investigator also plans to work on
several problems in the theory of several complex variables. This includes
generalizations of the Bochner-Hartogs extension Theorem to more general
manifolds and to solutions of the Cauchy-Riemann equations in singular spaces.
The principal investigator plans to continue work with Professor Gavosto on
investigation of iterations of holomorphic maps near homoclinic tangencies and
other bifurcations relying heavily on use of the computer for graphics and
rigorous proofs. The Principal Investigator plans also to continue joint works
with Brendan Weickert, Greg Buzzard and Araceli Bonifant on various questions in
the theory of complex dynamics.

The goals of this proposal are to study problems in complex analysis and in
dynamical systems using techniques of complex analysis. Complex numbers were
introduced to solve algebraic expressions that could not be solved with real
numbers. With time, complex numbers have proved to be necessary to explain
fundamental physical phenomena like electromagnetisms, vibrations in mechanical
systems, etc. Complex analysis studies the changes of quantities that depend on
complex numbers. Dynamical systems is the study of systems that change over
time. Examples of dynamical systems range from the weather to the study of
populations. Dynamical systems are in general very hard to model and to
understand. The simplest models involve using real algebraic expressions to
represent the system. Considering the algebraic expressions over the complex
numbers allows one to see and study the problems in a higher dimensional setting
using more powerful tools. In this setting, a very intricate and fascinating
scenario appears. Computer generated pictures show the geometry of this
phenomenon: a very complicated fractal structure. Proper understanding of this
geometry will lead to a better understanding of real dynamical systems.
