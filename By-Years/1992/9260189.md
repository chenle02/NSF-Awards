Tools and techniques for content-based organization and retrieval of electronic
images from large databases will provide a greatly needed relief from the ever
growing among of visual information gathered by industries and individuals
alike. Current applications of image information systems do not provide the
functionality necessary to manage image data. This requires mechanisms for
determining semantic content of the data at storage time, and representation in
effective manner for retrieval. We propose to develop an interactive content-
based image archiving system in which domain-specific knowledge is explicitly
represented separate from domain-independent knowledge. This system will be used
for creating image databases in different applications (e.g. animal specimens,
art, flora, maps, industrial parts, medical image, experimental results, etc.).
We propose to employ a new layered data model which allows complex structural
representations. This model provides the user with the different levels of
interaction, and with the tools for generating semantic entities from image
portions, and for defining relation between entities as higher level constructs.
The development of such a tool will lead to a significant improvement in
managing visual electronic information in particular and multi media information
in general. In the first phase of our research, we will identify requirements of
content-based image databases, study the suitability of current relational and
object oriented databases, and study a tasks domain, face database, for
implementation.//
