9508620 Bose The spark generated by Kharitonov's result on root clustering of
interval polynomials has influenced the robust control field in a significant
manner in a relatively short time. The property studied in the setting of
Kharitonov theory and its various generalizations is primarily concerned with
robust stability of continuous-time and discrete-time one dimensional systems
and, to a lesser extent, multidimensional systems. The achieving of robust
stability is crucial in the design of control systems when a plant, possibly of
high order and with uncertain parameters present is targeted for stabilization
by a low order compensator. In the control of flexible large space structures
such as solar power satellites and orbiting telescopes, for example, the
objective is to achieve robust control of a plant of high order with a
controller of lower order. Robust control is necessary because of elastic mode
truncation (modelling error) and parameter uncertainty. The effect of mode
truncation is possible instability due to the incorporated either in the plant
transfer matrix representation or the state-space representation. Usually, the
coefficient perturbations will not be independent of each other so that the
Kharitonov-type results, if used without any modification, would have the
advantage of simplicity in application but the disadvantage of yielding only
sufficient conditions, which may not be as tight as desired for robust
stability. Furthermore, though robust stability is crucial to performance
evaluation of control systems, other measures of performance like robust
frequency response, robust pole placement, and minimax control or rate feedback
systems are necessary in important applications like control of large space
structures. ***
