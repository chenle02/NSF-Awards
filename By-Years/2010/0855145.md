The University of New Hampshire (UNH) plans to acquire a high-performance
computer from IBM, funded by the National Science Foundation and supplemented by
an IBM University Research grant. This machine is powered by 84 PowerXCell 8i
processors with a total of 756 computational cores. Beyond substantially
increasing UNH's scientific computing capabilities, it provides access to a
state-of-the-art accelerator-based architecture, as employed in the world's most
advanced supercomputers like Roadrunner at Los Alamos National Laboratory. This
research involves grand science challenges in the fields of
magnetospheric&lt;br/&gt;physics (space weather), plasma physics, and
computational fluid dynamics, lattice quantum chromodynamics and
genomics.&lt;br/&gt;The investigators on this project conduct research on
algorithms and program-&lt;br/&gt;ming models for modern hardware architectures.
Since computational capabilities have advanced from being driven by enhancements
in speed to increasing the number of processors and computational cores,
efficient exploitation of highly parallel machines challenges conventional
programming models and increases the complexity of algorithms. The researchers
plan to develop and deploy new computational approaches for describing, at a
higher level of abstraction, the equations to be solved and then uses specific
computer software,&lt;br/&gt;including source-to-source translation, to generate
highly optimized implementations tailored to the hardware to be used. The
program also provides first-hand experience using a cutting-edge supercomputer
to students in UNH.
