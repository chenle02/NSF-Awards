This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of separations science. In an innovative program of synthesis and
physical chemical characterization, Professor Pirkle and his students will
develop new stationary phases for the liquid chromatographic separation of
chiral molecules on both analytical and preparative scales. The ability to
design and and implement chromatographic systems capable of resolving
enantiomers of many compounds is of immense fundamental, practical, and
technological significance across a broad front of disciplines. Of particular
note is the importance of this research to the pharmaceutical industry and in a
variety of biotechnological applications. Fundamental studies of the mechanisms
of molecular interactions between stationary and mobile phase components are
expected to give rise to new insights that will be applied to the design of new
technologically important membrane-based separations systems.
