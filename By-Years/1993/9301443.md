This research concerns the development of a diamond anvil cell (DAC) that will
enable the attainment and accurate measurement of static pressures above 1 TPa
(10 Mbars). (The current peak that has been attained is 5.6 Mbars, exceeding
that at the center of the earth). At such levels of static pressure, major
changes in the properties of materials take place (e.g., in binding and
structure, and in electronic behavior .. e.g., oxygen becomes metallic). This
new, high-performance DAC (HPDAC) will allow studies of the properties and
behavior of materials in pressure regimes never before achieved. The main focus
of the project will be to develop and implement numerical simulation and
optimization tools that can be used for the best design of the HPDAC. A
combination of boundary element and finite element methods will be used to
create this simulation tool. Numerical simulations of the operation of the
optimized HPDAC will be compared to experimental results and to simulations
based on other designs optimized heuristically.
