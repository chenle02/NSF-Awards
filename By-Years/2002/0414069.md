This action funds a third year extension for a Minority Postdoctoral Research
Fellowship for FY 2002. The Fellow will complete studies using the cystic
fibrosis transmembrane conductance factor as a model system to understand the
general mechanisms that control alternative splicing of exons and the underlying
principles that determine whether a sequence is included or omitted from a
message RNA during protein synthesis. These mechanisms are important in
development, tissue specificity determination, and apoptosis in eukaryotes.
