The National Science Foundation (NSF) Nanoscale Science and Engineering (NSE)
Grantees Conference is a program review and research networking workshop that
highlights the ongoing research and educational activities of the NSF NSE grant
programs. The goals of this conference are to promote dissemination of
innovative research progress, facilitate research partnerships, and identify
future research directions. Oral presentations with question periods, panel
discussions, and poster sessions are planned as platforms to promote inter-
university and academic/industry/national-laboratory
interactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These interactions help to advance the goals
of the US National Nanotechnology Initiative (www.nano.gov). The conference will
aid in the development of the skilled workforce and supporting infrastructure
needed to advance research and development of nanoscale science, improve
understanding of the social, ethical, health and environmental implication of
nanotechnology, and facilitate the transfer of developed nanotechnologies into
commercial products. &lt;br/&gt;
