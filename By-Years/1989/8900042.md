One of the major concerns in the study of the upper atmosphere is the height
variation and density of the neutral atmosphere around the globe and its
response to solar and geomagnetic inputs. This information is critical input and
necessary for all of the global ionospheric and thermospheric circulation
models. This is one of the highest priority areas of interest to the CEDAR
program. This award concerns the development and implementation of a new method
which maps the neutral upper atmosphere density in height, latitude, and time
using the simultaneously acquired incoherent scatter radar data and optical data
from stations distributed at different latitudes. The results of this study will
allow enhanced use of the existing data base and guide data acquisition from
these systems in the future.
