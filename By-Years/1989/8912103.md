This project provides matching funds to allow the Baruch Field Station of the
University of South Carolina to modernize its seawater facilities for rearing
and maintaining marine organisms under controlled conditions. To realize its
research potential, the Station's present antiquated seawater system must be
replaced. Short- and long-term experiments requiring the maintenance of marine
organisms under environmentally controlled seawater conditions are necessary to
answer basic biological questions, including those relating to genetics,
reproduction, bioenergetics, population dynamics, and life history phenomena.
Improved seawater facilities are also necessary to address many of the questions
which are part of the Long-Term Ecological Research Program underway at North
Inlet Estuary. In addition, the new facilities will create many new research
opportunities both for visiting scientists and for those from the Baruch
Institute.
