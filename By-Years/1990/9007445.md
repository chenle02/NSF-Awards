Dr. Kit Bowen is supported by a grant from the Experimental Physical Chemistry
Program to study photodissociation and photodetachment spectroscopy in size-
selected gas-phase cluster anions. Chosen clusters are representative, on a
microscopic scale, of real macroscopic solvent-solute systems. These studies
will provide a wealth of useful information regarding the chemical physics of
the solvation process. Bowen plans to apply various spectroscopic tools
including photoelectron, photodissociation and photodestruction spectroscopy to
probe size-selected gas-phase cluster anions which include anion-neutral
complexes, solvated electron-like cluster anions, and metal cluster anions. The
planned experiments will map the variation of sequential solvation energies and
electron affinities as a function of cluster size as well as the evolution of
anionic basicity with increasing degrees of solvation. One emphasis of these
studies will be to compare various solvent systems, with water and ammonia
cluster anions receiving continued attention and with cluster anions of
alcohols, amines, ethers, and xenon being studied spectroscopically for the
first time.
