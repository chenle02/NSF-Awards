9304560 Silver This PASSCAL field project will examine the deep structure of
the South American Altiplano, one of the world's highest and largest plateaus
with an average elevation of nearly 4 km, a crustal thickness of 65 km and area
of over 600,000 square km at the intersection of southern Peru, western Bolivia,
and northern Chile. The investigation will test theories of formation of this
plateau and of mountain-building in general. The investigators will deploy 20
PASSCAL seismic stations across the region to determine variations in crustal
thickness, structure of the underlying mantle wedge, and shear wave splitting
which is an indication of the fabric and distortion history of the rock. A
collaboration in deployment and analysis is planned with the French ORSTOM
Program and with South American scientists. This active seismic area, where the
oceanic plate is subducted under the continent, is an analog to the U.S. Pacific
Northwest tectonic regime. This research is a component of the National
Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program. ***
