A self-contained non-recirculating dilution refrigerator is the hub of a modern
low temperature laboratory facility suitable for undergraduates. The
refrigerator gives students the ability to perform dramatic experiments dealing
with many contemporary research topics, such as quantum mechanical tunneling,
quantum Hall effect, quasiparticle dynamics, and the behavior of mesoscopic
systems. In addition, the design of experimental apparatus for the machine
allows students to use the physical concepts introduced in formal coursework:
temperature and thermometry, heat capacity, blackbody radiation, and thermal
conductivity. The principal users of the equipment are junior-year honors
students and senior-year physics students participating in an advanced
laboratory program. By providing a rich, up-to-date research laboratory
experience for students, the project is broadening their exposure to
contemporary topics and experimental techniques, thereby preparing them better
for graduate study and/or industry. The refrigerator also captures the interest
of younger physics majors, and so provide a powerful incentive for early
participation in research and further study in physics. The college is matching
the award with an equal amount of funds.
