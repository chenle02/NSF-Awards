Research in theoretical physics will include work on planar and self-dual gauge
theories and magnetic screening in the quark-gluon plasma. Gauge theories are
the basis of all fundamental forces and research on the elucidation of their
theoretical structure is thus important in taking us to the next level of
understanding of all forces. Magnetic screening is important in analyzing
experiments on the quark- gluon plasma which will be performed using the
Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) being built at Brookhaven.
