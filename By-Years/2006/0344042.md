In the past few years the agility of radio systems, in all their aspects, has
significantly&lt;br/&gt;increased. In today's world antennas are controllable;
there are several options for&lt;br/&gt;compression, encryption, and error
control; spread-spectrum (among other techniques) is&lt;br/&gt;available to
reduce the radio frequency power spectral density; there are elaborate multi-
dimensional modulation techniques; and there is interference reduction using
multiple&lt;br/&gt;user detection and other techniques. New radio architectures
that exploit many of these&lt;br/&gt;techniques are proposed It is clear that to
achieve maximum utilization of radio&lt;br/&gt;capabilities, innovative networks
will be involved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Kansas proposes to
continue to support the National Science&lt;br/&gt;Foundation in developing a
comprehensive research program in innovative and advanced&lt;br/&gt;wireless
networking systems. This project proposes to extend our initial work in
eliciting&lt;br/&gt;research problems through the NSF/FCC Workshop on the Future
of Spectrum:&lt;br/&gt;Technologies and Policies to (1) a workshop addressing
the issues of radio technology&lt;br/&gt;and network protocols and (2) a
Principal Investigator Meeting involving the leading&lt;br/&gt;researchers
contributing to NSF wireless networking programs.&lt;br/&gt;
