Dr. Michael W. Rathke and other members of the Chemistry Department of Michigan
State University are being supported to continue a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site in chemistry. For the period 1995-1997, sixteen
undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in a
variety of research projects. The focus of the research experience is synthesis,
modeling, and characterization of materials. In addition, students participate
in weekly seminars on materials and materials characterization, brown bag
lunches on career options, and field trips to industry. Ten students are
supported by the NSF award, with an additional six students supported by the
University as a feature of its cost-sharing.
