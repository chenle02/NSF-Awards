The proposed research has three aims: 1) to describe the relations among
children?s behavioral, emotional, and cognitive engagement in mathematics
instruction; 2) to use observationally-based approaches to examine what occurs
inside the classroom to describe the contribution of classroom processes to
student engagement; 3) to examine the relation between students? engagement in
learning and mathematics proficiency, considering the extent to which students?
engagement serves explains the relation between classroom social processes and
student mathematics achievement. Work is situated in the context of the presence
or absence of two instructional approaches: inquiry-based mathematics
instruction and the Responsive Classroom Approach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
