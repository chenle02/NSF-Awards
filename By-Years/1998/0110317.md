This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop
innovations pertaining to optrodes (optical sensors) and electro-optical
instrumentation for advanced material characterization. Specifically, this
project will develop the first commercially available high-resolution volumetric
dilatometer. In addition, the innovations will allow for: (1) a linear
dilatometer that possesses a resolution that is 2-3 orders of magnitude better
than its conventional linear counterparts; (2) an optical control system for
micro-translation stages; (3) an optrode for thin film characterization that
possesses a linear resolution exceeding 1 nanometer; and (4) an ultra-fast,
high-resolution spectrometer that will enable commercialization of three optical
sensors (pressure, temperature, and load) suitable for harsh environments.

Potential commercial applications are expected in electronics and
microelectronics manufacturing for dilatometry, thin films analysis, micro-
translation stages, ultra-fast spectroscopy, and various optical sensors.
