This award is for partial support of a workshop on physics and experiments with
linear e+e- colliders. It is sponsored in part by KEK and SLAC, two of the most
active laboratories involved in R&amp;D on linear colliders. Participation is
international in scope. It's the second in a series on the subject, following on
the September 1991 workshop that took place in Finland.
