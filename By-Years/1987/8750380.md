Electrophoretic equipment is being used to improve undergraduate Biology and
Chemistry laboratories associated with courses in Biochemistry, Molecular
Genetics and with the Undergraduate Research program. Among the major new
instruments acquired through this award are vertical and horizontal slab gel and
transfer electrophoretic apparati (with their respective power supplies), a
scanning densitometer, transilluminator and photodocumentation equipment. Their
purchase is making it possible for the undergraduate women in these classes to
gain experience with techniques that are central to modern Biology, Biochemistry
and Molecular Biology, and for the College to continue to provide instruction
and research experience at a high experimental level.
