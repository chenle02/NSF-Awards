Transcription and replication of influenza viral genomic RNAs are mediated by a
unique virus coded polymerase that consists of three polypeptide subunits,
namely, PB1, PB2 and PA. The synthetic steps catalyzed by viral polymerase,
which are also influenced by other viral and cellular proteins, are not well
understood. Temperature sensitive (ts) mutants of influenza virus that are
defective in transcription and replication will be systematically analyzed for
specific defects in nuclear transport, polymerase complex formation, polymerase
RNP complex formation and catalytic function using the recently developed
reagents and methodologies. The mechanism of anti-termination mediated by
nucleoprotein (NP) in the synthesis of full length cRNA templates will be
examined to determine if free uncomplexed NP binds to nascent cRNA strands to
facilitate this step. In vitro translated NP and polymerase proteins will be
used in vitro reactions to determine if free NP alone can cause antitermination
and if individual P proteins can complement ts functions in vitro. This study
will provide us an unique opportunity to understand how the viral polymerase
subunits interact with each other and with other viral components to perform
many complex functions in an infected cell. Since influenza virus
transcription/replication differs markedly from non-segmented negative strand
viruses like VSV, detailed study of its replication may reveal many yet
unidentified strategies employed by viruses in general, and will provide
valuable comparative data.
