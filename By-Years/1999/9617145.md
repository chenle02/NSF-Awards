Ellingson, Erica AST 96-17145 Dr. Ellingson will investigate the effects of
cluster environment on the star formation and AGN activity of galaxies at
intermediate redshifts. The first project is a detailed spectroscopic and
photometric study of 12 galaxies to determine whether gas stripping or galaxy
interactions is the dominant physical mechanism for galaxy evolution in
clusters. The second project is to investigate the effects of cluster
environment on AGN activity in cluster cores. Imaging surveys and spectroscopic
observations will confirm the association of quasars to host clusters and
determine physical properties such as velocity dispersion, gas content and
interaction rates.
