Evolution equations are basic objects in the sciences, describing how natural
phenomena change over time. For instance, the modeling of a wide class of
physical phenomena, such as crystal growth and flame propagation, involves
tracking fronts that move with curvature-dependent speed. When a surface evolves
with speed that is proportional to the curvature, this results in one of the
classic degenerate nonlinear differential equations called the mean curvature
flow. For nonlinear equations like this, it is possible that solutions may
develop sharp points and corners, so it is natural to ask "what is the
regularity of solutions?'' Optimal regularity for mean curvature flow was
recently proven by the PI and Minicozzi. The proof weaves together analysis and
geometry. It is expected that many of the new ingredients and techniques should
lead to many other results for a wide range of equations that the PI will
investigate in this project.

This project has two parts. The main part concerns geometric evolution
equations, like mean curvature flow (MCF) and Ricci flow. It deals with optimal
regularity and applications. The PI has, together with Minicozzi, settled a
number of long-standing open problems and conjectures for mean curvature flow
and expect that the results and ideas developed will have significant
applications also to other flows and plan to pursue them. Rigidity of prevalent
singularities and uniqueness of blow-ups has had a wide range of applications
for mean curvature flow from optimal regularity of the level set equation to
optimal estimates on the singular set of the flow. The PI plans on investigating
similar conjectures for the Ricci flow. The second part of the project will deal
with other (non-geometric) evolution equations that are motivated by questions
in social science and engineering. One particular focus will be on a natural
evolution equation that describes how the opinions of a group of people evolve
as they are influenced by each other.
