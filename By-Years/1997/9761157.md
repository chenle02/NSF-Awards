*** 9761157 Wang This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to
develop an active strain gauge, to directly address the requirements of a new
generation of sensor technology. Monitoring the performance of structures during
earthquakes using sensors is very important for earthquake hazard mitigation.
Existing strain gauges, both the foil and fiber-optic types, with their
excitation and signal conditioning are relatively expensive, require long lead
wires to get to the interrogating point, have high power requirements, all of
which makes instrumenting a large civil structure prohibitively expensive. The
choice of an active material such as polyvinylidede flouride (PVDF) as a strain
gauge provides basic advantages in terms of the signal processing requirements,
low power requirements, low noise threshold, and above all the ability to
eliminate the usage of lead wires to interrogate the gauge. The objectives of
the current research is to prove the concept of a PVDF strain gauge and pave the
way for the development a true self contained wireless strain gauge. The
potential commercial applications will be in the area of infrastructure
monitoring. The choice of PVDF will provide a relatively inexpensive material
for the sensor, The active nature of the sensor will help in keeping the design
of the basic signal processing rather simple, which will result in a low cost
signal processing which will be easy to integrate with a RF circuit. ***
