GER-9554561 Rozenblit Hardware/Software Codesign is receiving increasingly
widespread attention. Codesign provides methods and techniques which can
effectively and efficiently manage the diversity and complexity of applications
employing embedded systems. They result in a decreased development cost of
complex systems and their time to market deployment. Our proposed research
targets are: a)implementation independent specification and modeling of embedded
systems, b) associated partitioning, based on iterative refinement, c)
construction of modules for mixed software/hardware components, and d) component
mapping to target implementations. These key target areas will form the
foundation for the development of a graduate research training program. The
baseline for the proposed effort is our internationally recognized research in
the areas of codesign, computer systems engineering, design and synthesis of
VLSI systems, and advanced work in multi-chip module (MCM) partitioning and
behavioral synthesis. Technical Innovation: In the proposes research, concepts,
techniques and tools for the design of high-performance, low-cost systems that
consists of hardware and software components will be developed that transform an
implementation independent, model- based description into a working prototype.
Structural Innovation: Joint work and continuous interaction with local (State
of Arizona) industrial partners, international collaborators, student exchanges,
and industrial mentorship. The development of a state-of-the-art graduate
program in codesign providing a broad based, academic and industrial experience
and thus training future science and engineering leaders.
