9627053 Winsten The Rhode Island Zoological Society will develop, prototype,
install, and evaluate "Habitrek", a 3000 sq. ft. exhibit to be placed in their
new Education Center. The center is a circular building and as visitors go
through it they will encounter habitat displays of a Urban Providence,
Woodlands, Wetlands, and Desert. In addition there will be giant scale replicas
of a wormhole, a bat cave, a prairie dog colony, and a stream. Their intent is
to use live animals, animal replicas and interactives to shift the visitor's
emphasis from simply finding and identifying species to learning about habitats
where animals live and where animals and humans often have to interact. In
addition to the exhibits, several complementary educational activity packages
will be developed. These include a family activity pack of activities that can
be completed both at the zoo and in the home. They will relate many natural
history stories not obvious from the exhibit alone. To streamline the
development process, materials developed by the Bronx Zoo's Habitat Ecology
Learning Program (an NSF-supported teacher enhancement activity) will serve as
the basis for these family packs. The HELP materials will also serve as the
basis for activities developed for use by teachers to complement the already
existing Kits in Teaching Elementary Science (KITES) program (another NSF-
supported program). The zoo also has cooperative programs with the Rhode Island
Girl Scout Council and materials will be modified for their use as well. Of
special interest is the attention that is being given to going beyond minimum
ADA standards to make the exhibit broadly accessible. Ambient sound will be an
important part of all exhibit settings, design considerations will be made for
those with limited vision, and sightlines will be consistent with wheelchair
standards, are a few examples. The anticipated exhibit opening is early 1998.
