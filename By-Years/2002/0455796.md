The project is a five-year professional resource development project centered on
the "Diagnoser" software previously funded by NSF. The software allows for the
identification of alternative conceptions that students have in multiple science
content areas. Previous research had shown an increase of up to 15% in student
achievement based upon using the software with students and teachers in the area
of kinematics. The project is developing extensions of the software into three
more content areas: Properties of Matter, Heat and Temperature, and Physical and
Chemical Changes for students in grades five to ten. In addition to the
software, the project is developing a framework for using diagnostic classroom
tools in the delivery of professional development to deepen the subject matter
content knowledge, enrich the pedagogical content knowledge, broaden the
curricular content knowledge, and hone the diagnostic skills for science
teachers, especially those who are new to the intentional use of assessment in
science instruction. The project involves university partners, three school
districts and multiple schools in the state of Washington. Approximately 20 to
50 teachers spend substantial time working the software and serve as the pilot
sites for the new content modules. Additional teachers are introduced to the
software and the concept of diagnostic testing both in workshops and online
environments. &lt;br/&gt;
