This grant in theoretical physics supports the research of Professors O.W.
Greenberg and J.C. Pati at the University of Maryland. The work will address
foundational issues in field theory (Greenberg) concerning the possible
violation of Fermi-Bose statistics and the problem of color confinement and the
important physical issue of the possible substructure of quarks and leptons
(Pati).
