The goal of this project is to improve the resolution of numerical algorithms
for the recovery of sources, obstacles, and medium characteristics from exterior
measurements of various physical fields found in biomedicine, economics,
geophysics, and material science. In particular, the results will dramatically
enhance the quality of a cheap, fast, and safe diagnostic method called
electrical impedance tomography. Examples of specific applications include
deriving algorithms for finding volatility of financial markets and monitoring
the economy, performing the non-invasive evaluation of protein in ion channels,
and prospecting elastic structures for residual stress, which can determine the
aging or defects of materials and the elastic parameters of the Earth.

Currently, there is a great need for better resolution in electrical impedance
tomography. This project seeks improvements for this method using higher
frequency data for the complete Maxwell system by its reduction to a vectorial
Schroedinger equation and using complex and real geometrical optics solutions of
this system. To make progress, the principal investigator uses anisotropic
reductions to mainly upper-triangular systems and uses the second large
parameter in scalar Carleman estimates. At present, there are few analytical
results on Carleman estimates, describing the uniqueness and stability of
anisotropic systems, including the challenging and important case of
transversely isotropic elasticity. Inverse problems for complicated drift-
diffusion systems, such as semiconductors and ion channels, abound with
mathematical challenges including analytic conditions for uniqueness and
reliable numerical algorithms. The principal investigator addresses these by
using various asymptotic simplifications, dual problems, and methods similar to
those used in inverse obstacle problems for scalar elliptic and parabolic
equations.
