Valdosta State University is providing 20 scholarships to academically talented
but financially needy science majors who commit to teaching at high-needs school
districts including Valdosta City School (VCS) system. The program assists
worthy students in obtaining teaching certification though a post-baccalaureate
program designed to prepare future teachers for high-needs school districts in
Georgia. In part, the project manifests this by reducing professional isolation
through collaborative learning, enhanced mentoring and involvement in
professional science education societies, and by enhancing STEM and pedagogy
content competencies by providing enhanced information dissemination, content
delivery, field experiences at VCS, and by including an induction budget for new
scholars entering the teaching profession. The project also provides
professional development opportunities including a summer research project
internship where mentors from the discipline and master high school teachers
collaborate with pre-service teachers to provide guidance and support through
the induction period. The project also addresses the challenge of attracting and
retaining highly qualified teachers in a geographic region where recruiting new
teachers has been difficult. The program's intentional design of integrating
research with educational experiences enables new STEM teachers to adopt similar
models in their own classrooms, infusing education with the excitement of
discovery and sparking their students' interest in STEM.
