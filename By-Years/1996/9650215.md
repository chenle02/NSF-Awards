This project is designed to provide necessary equipment for a coherent, focused
set of molecular genetics laboratory exercises for undergraduates. In
particular, the project allows students to learn about important principles and
techniques in molecular biology, including nucleic acid isolation, cloning,
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifications, DNA sequencing, and DNA sequence
analysis. The primary audience for this project is undergraduate biology majors
and preservice biology/education majors. Improved laboratory capabilities are
expected to enhance the department's ability to attract and retain students in
molecular biology and the biological sciences.
