9224553 Karimabadi Of the six types of shocks (fast, slow, and four types of
intermediate shocks) allowed by magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) Rankine- Hugoniot
relations, intermediate shocks are the least understood. Besides being of great
theoretical interest, the study of intermediate shocks (ISs) is essential to the
understanding of diverse space plasma phenomena, such as the magnetopause and
shock fronts associated with coronal mass ejections. ISs provide an important
dissipation process in space plasmas and are one of only two plasma
discontinuities that allow for the rotation of the magnetic field, with the
other being the rotational discontinuity (RD). Although the existence of ISs has
recently been established within the resistive MHD framework, far less is known
about their properties in collisionless plasmas. This work is to investigate the
formation and properties of ISs and their relation to RDs in collisionless
plasmas with applications to space plasmas. For the first time many important
effects, such as temperature anisotropy, will be included in the calculations.
We will examine the hypothesis that field rotations at the magnetopause and in
the solar wind are due to ISs rather than RDs. Two approaches will be taken. One
is the study of ISs as a single structure removed from external perturbations.
The other approach involves the formation of multiple discontinuities and their
interactions, much as would occur during reconnection events. The goal of this
study is to determine the conditions under which ISs can be formed, and whether
they can remain stable in the presence of perturbations. The primary tools of
our investigation are state-of-the-art kinetic numerical simulations, although
for comparison, MHD simulations will also be performed. ***
