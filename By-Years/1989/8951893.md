Computer workstations with advanced graphics will allow students to access the
UNIDATA program which is managed by the University Corporation for Atmospheric
Research. It gives students hands-on experience in data collection, analysis,
display and graphic rendering. Students will be able to manipulate and visualize
the weather data in four-dimensional (space and time) perspective of the
atmosphere to understand the structure and development of weather systems. Two
new interdisciplinary courses will also be developed to teach the applications
of microcomputers in meteorology and broadcasting meteorology. The university
will provide 50% matching funds.
