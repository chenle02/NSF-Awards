This research aims at demonstrating that visual motion analysis can be improved
(1) by replacing the analysis of optical flow (the motion of image points) with
that of image deformations (their motion relative to each other) and (2) by
spanning a wider field of view. The advantages of image deformations are akin to
those of differential amplifiers for the detection of weak signals in a noisy
background: if noise affects both inputs equally, it is canceled by taking their
difference. In the analogy, image motion caused by camera rotation is the noise,
and that caused by translation is the useful signal. As to the field of view,
the literature shows that a viewing angle of 60 degrees or more leads almost to
a quantum improvement in the conditioning of the reconstruction problem. This
lead is being pursued by a theoretical and empirical investigation of shape
reconstruction from the deformations of wide-angle images induced by camera
motion. The two ideas of image deformations and a wide field of view, already
proven successful in preliminary studies, are being investigated theoretically
and experimentally. The final contribution will be a multiframe shape and motion
reconstruction method that works reliably and for perspective images.
