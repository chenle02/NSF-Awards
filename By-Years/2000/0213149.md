&lt;br/&gt;In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry
Program of the Chemistry Division, Janda will study IVR processes in molecules
and clusters embedded in liquid helium droplets at a temperature of 0.4 K.
Appropriate pico-second pump-probe techniques and pulsed valve technology will
be developed for both reactant preparation and monitoring the chemical dynamics
inside the clusters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When gases are cooled to very low
temperatures they usually condense into a liquid or solid form. When trapped
into ultra-cold droplets of liquid helium, molecules and clusters largely retain
their rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom. Their properties apparent
at ordinary temperatures are only slightly modified owing to the weak
interaction that couples them to the surrounding bath of liquid helium. The
studies of these modifications are of intrinsic interest as they provide
fundamental data about the properties of liquid helium and may be relevant to
eventual chemical reactions that take place in the ultra-cold environment of the
droplets. This research will be conducted with graduate and undergraduate
students and postdoctoral research associates. They will acquire knowledge and
training in one of the forefront areas of physical chemistry in preparation for
entry into the scientific/technical workforce. &lt;br/&gt;
