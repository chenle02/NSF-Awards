The P.I. will study the analysis and design of large- scale stochastic systems,
specifically binary neural networks and adaptive distributed detection systems.
He will work on a theoretical framework for these systems, and on demonstration
of the application of the theory in assessing existing designs and in devising
synthesis techniques. The expected applications are in Machine Intelligence and
in Sensor Fusion. The objective is to provide designers and users of neural
networks and distributed-detection systems with a set of reliable polynomial-
time algorithms, for calculating in advance (at least a bound on) the expected
performance. In particular, such assessments are important when the designer
using suboptimal or "intelligent" (i.e. heuristic) design algorithms. Often, a
close-form optimal architecture is not available, or the implementation such
design is prohibitive from the computational or the hardware- complexity
viewpoints. A related objective is to synthesize and assess on- line learning
algorithms, since the common assumptions on availability of environmental
statistics and on stationary of the statistics are often not realistic.
