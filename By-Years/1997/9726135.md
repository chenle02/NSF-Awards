Achenie CTS-9726135 The aim of this research is developing novel mathematical
support and the associated software for doing simultaneous optimization, and
flexibility analysis of chemical processes. Specifically, the following problems
will be addressed: (I) estimation of chemical process flexibility, (ii) chemical
process optimizaion under uncertainty at the design stage and (iii) optimization
of existing chemical processes under uncertainty. The research effort and the
resulting software will allow a process engineer to solve the following
industrial problems: (1) an estimate of the ability of a chemical process to
sustain an acceptable level of performance even when external internal factors
change in an unpredictable fashion (for example, a change of catalyst activity
in chemical reactors or a change in feed flow rate), (ii) calculation of optimal
design margins for process equipment at the design stage, and (iii) calculation
of optimal values of control variables (used for example to satisfy
environmental and safety requirements) for existing chemical processes under
uncertainty. The proposal is being funded under NSF's Cooperative Research
Program for Cental and Eastern Europe and the Newly-Independent States. This
work is a collaborative effort between the PI and two researchers at the Karpov
Institute of Physical Chemistry in Russia.
