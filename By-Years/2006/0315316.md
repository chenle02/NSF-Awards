This project dissects how the bacterial transposon Tn7 recognizes targets
associated with DNA replication and recombination. Transposons are discrete DNA
elements that are able to move within the genome of an organism. Transposons are
important in the evolution of bacteria and are often responsible for allowing
their host organism to live in new environments through resistance to
antibiotics and metals or by novel degradation pathways. The transposon Tn7 is
of special interest because of its highly evolved ability to select insertion
sites associated with active DNA replication. Tn7 uses the element-encoded
protein TnsE to preferentially target transposition into plasmids capable of
moving between cells by recognizing factors associated with DNA replication. The
ability of Tn7 to recognize mobile plasmids as insertion targets likely aids in
the dispersal of the element to other bacteria. Tn7 transposition also
recognizes structures associated with the repair of DNA double-strand breaks and
allows Tn7 to preferentially direct transposition where DNA replication
terminates. Work in this project will focus on understanding the various
biochemical activities of TnsE and where these activities reside in the protein.
In the project, previously identified mutations with increased transposition
activity as well as newly isolated TnsE mutations will be dissected. Additional
work will determine the molecular process that accounts for the distribution of
TnsE-mediated transposition events around induced DNA double-strand breaks. A
clear understanding of how Tn7 recognizes certain targets will lead to a better
understanding of the role of transposons in evolution and the processes of DNA
replication and repair in all living organisms. The utilization of
undergraduates is an important component of this research project.
