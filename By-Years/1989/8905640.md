This research calls for (1) building a comprehensive conceptual model of the
flow of work in groups, (2) using that model as a framework with which to
integrate existing theory and evidence about the impact of technological
enhancements on groups, and (3) using that integration as a basis for planning a
systematic program of research to assess the model and evaluate proposed
technological enhancements. Task one, building the conceptual model, will be
based on recent work by the principal investigator and colleagues on temporal
factors in group interaction and performance. The fully articulated conceptual
model is one end-product of the research. Task two involves review and
integration of research on technological enhancements in groups. An up to date
assessment of that body of research is the second end- product of the research.
Task three involves using the model and the integration to formulate a
systematic research program for subsequent empirical research on the flow of
work in technologically enhanced groups. That detailed formulation of a program
of research is the third end-product of the research.//
