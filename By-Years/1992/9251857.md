This project adds a hands-on laboratory component to an environmental
assessments course taken by ecology majors and some education majors, thus
improving student knowledge of techniques and problems in monitoring and
assessing environmental issues. The students are largely Alaskan natives, many
of whom become elementary teachers in rural Alaska. The course emphasizes the
study of the local environment. The equipment added includes: a portable and a
stationary gas chromatograph (GOW/MAC), ion analyzer electrodes, an electronic
balance, a water purification system (Millipore), a benchtop sterilizer
(Barnstead), and 8 each stereo and compound microscopes. The laboratories are
designed to help students develop competency in environmental monitoring and
sampling, laboratory analysis of samples, the use of descriptive and inferential
statistics and report generation. Projects include: 1) Analysis of water for a)
bacteriologic contamination, b) dissolved oxygen and biological oxygen demand,
c) nutrients such as ammonia and nitrates; 2) Analysis of water and land
habitats for community structure, species diversity and indicator species, and
3) Monitoring of air quality for noxious gases (NO2, SO2, NO, CO) and
particulates.
