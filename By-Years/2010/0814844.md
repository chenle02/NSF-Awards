Dr. Dan Breecker is awarded an NSF Earth Science Postdoctoral Fellowship to
carry out a program of research and education at the University of Arizona. Dr.
Breecker will determine the concentration of CO2 during the precipitation of
carbonate minerals in soils. The research goals will be accomplished by
measuring CO2 concentrations, carbon isotopes, moisture and temperature in soils
from different regions in Arizona, New Mexico, and Kansas; these soils have
developed under different climate and vegetation conditions. These results will
be used to calculate atmospheric CO2 concentrations in modern settings as well
as to reconstruct paleoclimate models. This investigation will also provide
information on how much CO2 soils can store in soils and it will contribute to
the overall understanding of carbon cycle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, Dr.
Breecker will interact with high schools students by giving lectures on CO2 in
the atmosphere and its role in the carbon cycle, engaging volunteer students in
monitoring sampling sites, and assisting with science fair projects. &lt;br/&gt;
