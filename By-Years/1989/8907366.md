The Dupin condition can be naturally formulated in Lie sphere geometry. It is
known to be invariant under certain Lie transformations. Using this knowledge
several theorems were proven which concern hypersurfaces whose principal
curvatures are constant along their corresponding curvature surfaces. Recently
the principal investigator and a collaborator successfully used these
transformations to partially solve the problem of classifying all Dupin
submanifolds. The principal investigator will continue his work on this
classification. Spheres and tori as they appear in three-dimensional space are
examples of what mathematicians call two-dimensional submanifolds. These are
Dupin if they satisfy certain curvature requirements. The principal investigator
has made substantial progress towards the classification of such submanifolds.
He will continue his work on this deep and renowned problem.
