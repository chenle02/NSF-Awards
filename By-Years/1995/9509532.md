This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
will assist the Department of Chemistry at North Carolina State University in
the purchase of a modern single- crystal diffraction system. This new
instrumentation will enhance greatly research in a number of areas, including
the following: (1) Organosulfur Complexes as Highly Conducting Materials; (2)
Synthesis of Natural Products and Biologically Active Compounds Via Homochiral
N-Acylpyridinium Salts; (3) Synthesis, Structure and Reactivity of Vanadium-
Protein Model Systems; (4) Stereocontrolled Nucleophilic Addition Reactions to
Acyclic Acetals; (5) Metal Halides at the Interface of Molecular and Solid State
Chemistry; and (6) Synthesis and Characterization of Organic-Based Magnetic
Materials. The X-ray diffractometer is used to make accurate and precise
measurements of the full three- dimensional structure of a molecule. The
information obtained gives the precise values of all the bond distances and bond
angles of a given molecule and it gives accurate information about the spatial
arrangement of that molecule relative to the neighboring molecules.
