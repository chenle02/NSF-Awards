9318983 This project involves the research of a cultural anthropologist at a
predominantly undergraduate institution, Cal State Long Beach. The researcher
will study of immigrant Maya Indians from Mexico have changed their conceptions
and expectations of aged people as a result of their experiences in the U.S.
Using technical quantitative sorting analyses of terms denoting aging, the
anthropologist will describe the cognitive models of aging of a sample of
Mayans. This analysis will then be combined with more traditional interviewing
and observational data to provide a description and analysis of the condition of
aging among this immigrant community. This research is important because as both
the aged and immigrants become a larger proportion of U.S. society, the need
becomes greater to increase understanding of their condition. These
understandings will be valuable to planners in any community where immigrants
form a distinct population. ***
