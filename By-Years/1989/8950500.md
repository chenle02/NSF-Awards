The purpose of this project is to design and implement 18 modern hands-on
experiments for the laboratory components of the two semester course sequence:
mechanics of solids (statics and strength of materials) and dynamics (particle
and rigid body motion). In each course, students in groups of three select and
perform five of these experiments. The aims are to give engineers two
significant experiences. (1) Students learn first-hand modern measuring
techniques using equipment that includes fully instrumented material testing
machines, digital storage oscilloscopes, equipment for interfacing experiments
with computers, automated data retrieval systems, and computer graphics. (2)
Students validate classical theories; but also gain new insights into physical
phenomena that are introduced in classroom lectures and then taken for granted.
From experiments, for instance, they learn first hand the limits of elasticity
for engineering materials, and measures of motion. With the laboratory
experiences civil and mechanical engineering students will gain some
experimental expertise, but equally important, will learn about the experimental
method and the philosophy of engineering experimentation.
