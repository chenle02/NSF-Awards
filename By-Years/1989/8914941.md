These studies are designed to investigate the effects on learning and memory of
the selective loss of specific neurons in the basal forebrain of rats. The basal
forebrain may play an important role in many cognitive functions related to
attention, learning and memory. The lesions will be produced by injection of two
different neurotoxins. These studies will provide valuable information on the
selective vulnerability of selected basal forebrain cells and the biochemical
and behavioral consequences of their loss.
