Building on experience in programs to upgrade the educational background of
personnel working in industry, Dutchess Community College will develop an
integrated curriculum which could become a certificate program in basics for
industrial technicians. A faculty team will develop a single, unified course
integrating elements from what are currently separate courses in introductory
mathematics, chemistry, physics, English and reading. Modern manufacturing will
be used as the integrating theme. The project will significantly change the
undergraduate learning experience through the employment of new curricula,
innovative laboratories, new delivery systems, and fresh instructional
materials. It is hoped that the project will be a blueprint for the development
of an industrial technology certificate granting program which could be
replicated by other institutions of higher education, particularly technical
colleges.
