The proposed reseach concerns a laboratory investigation of ion heating in the
acceleration region of the fast solar wind. A number of mechanisms for ion
heating in the fast solar wind have been proposed and this project will examine
the possibility that either counter-propagating, low-frequency, Alfven waves
generate a turbulent cascade that heats ions by exciting higher frequency waves
that damp on the ions or that the ions are directly heated by ion-cyclotron
damping of Alfven waves. &lt;br/&gt;
