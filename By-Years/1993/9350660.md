9350660 Hanson Enhancement and Extension of Chromatography and Spectroscopy
Modules in the Curriculum This project improves chemistry instruction by
enhancing and extending the department's chromatography and spectroscopy
laboratory capabilities by providing a modern, computer- controlled gas
chromatography/mass spectrometer GC/MS and associated mass spectral library to
be used in the majority of the chemistry courses. Students have hands-on
experience with GC/MS as early as the freshman year. GC/MS use is integrated
into the laboratories of 9 courses where GC separation and MS identification is
used by students to identify components in environmental samples and student
synthetic products, determine isotope ratios, and analyze the structure of
unknown chemical compounds. A unique feature of this project is the initiation
of a program to instruct all junior-level chemistry majors in GC/MS theory and
train them to become competent users of this and other computer-controlled
instruments. ***y
