This is a laboratory study to investigate the regime of turbulent geostrophic
flow, which is relevant to the zonal flows being observed in Earth's oceans. A
numerical simulation will be set up appropriate to the laboratory parameters.
Much is known about the nature of the forcing, energy sources, and circulation
in the ocean, providing a great background of information with which to assess
laboratory and numerical results. The focus will be on the ocean circulation in
the Southern Ocean around Antarctica where a multiple jet regime appears to
exist. Frontal formation and transport in the geostrophic turbulence regime will
be investigated in a laboratory setting. A unique, large rotating table facility
exists at FSU dating from the early classic baroclinic wave experiments. This
facility will be used to achieve the appropriate parameter ranges. Complementary
numerical simulations of the laboratory experiment will also be carried out. The
numerical simulation will help to understand the influence of topographic beta
in the laboratory compared to the planetary beta in the ocean; it will also
enable studies in more detail of the influence of the wind stress. Using the
model the team will initiate tests of the parameterization of mass and heat
transport in the multiple jet regime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impact:&lt;br/&gt;The proposed study involves one undergraduate student funded
separately, a research associate and one postdoctoral position. The Geophysical
Fluid Dynamics Institute at Florida State University is a multi-disciplinary
facility that will provide access to experimental facilities to the broad
community; this proposal helps to maintain this contribution. A close
collaboration with Ruby Krishnamurti will help transfer knowledge from a long
career in GFD experimentation and maintain this capability within the Institute.
She will help advise a student and postdoc who will perform the experiments and
data analysis on the proposed project.
