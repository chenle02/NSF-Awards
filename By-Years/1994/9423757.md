9423757 Markow The purpose of this small grant for exploratory research is to
attempt to restore an extremely valuable blood DNA data base from a population
of the Havasupai tribe in northern Arizona. Since 1980, the PI and collaborators
had sampled blood for DNA from every living member of the tribe. This has
provided a genealogy and genetic history that extends back to the late 1800's.
The blood samples were accidentally mismanaged and the PI proposes to use PCR
techniques to restore the supply of remaining DNA. %%% This project meets two of
the criteria for exploratory grants, it is high risk and urgent. This blood DNA
data base is unique and invaluable because of its extent and completeness. All
attempts to restore the data base should be explored.
