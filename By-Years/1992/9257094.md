Dr. Chi Mak is supported by an NSF Young Investigator Award from the Theoretical
and Computational Chemistry Program to perform theoretical studies of tunneling
processes in condensed phase systems. Mak will employ a spin-boson model which
involves a two-state system coupled to a harmonic bath as a primary model for
dissipative tunneling reactions. This model system has been chosen as one which
embodies the essence of the physical contents of the real system, but at the
same time retains sufficient simplicity to be tractable. Mak will employ this
model to study: 1) aqueous electron transfer reactions; 2) light particle
diffusion in solids; and 3) quantum electron devices. %%% A number of important
chemical processes and materials properties depend on a phenomenon known as
quantum tunneling. Biological reactions which involve electron transfer, the
diffusion of hydrogen atoms through metals, and the operation of electronic
devices such as the resonant tunneling diode and the quantum interference
transistor are all examples of phenomena which involve quantum tunneling. The
theoretical studies performed by Dr. Mak will enhance our understanding of these
molecular processes, and help us to put that understanding to use in designing
new materials with important chemical and physical properties.
