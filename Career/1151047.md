The PI proposes to research algorithms for cohomological automorphic forms and
the arithmetic of curves parametrized by congruence semi-arithmetic groups. This
proposal interrelates abstract theory and practical computation, linking
research with the development of tools and concrete projects which will be
integrated into undergraduate and graduate education. In the first proposed
activity, the PI will prove that there exists an algorithm to compute the
cohomology of an arithmetic group as a Hecke module. The PI will implement the
proposed algorithm robustly in a computer algebra system, collect and analyze
data, and conjecture and prove results based on the discovered phenomena. In the
second activity, the PI will study arithmetic applications of Galois Belyi
covers that arise from a modular embedding of a triangle group into a
quaternionic unit group. The PI will investigate questions of modularity,
parametrization of elliptic curves, and special points arising from this
construction. The proposed research will allow explicit investigation of the
Langlands correspondence--the deep connection between automorphic forms,
algebraic groups, and Galois representations--in both classical and novel
settings, exploring exciting new ground.

Classical unsolved problems often serve as the genesis for the formulation of a
rich and unified mathematical fabric. Diophantus of Alexandria first sought
solutions to algebraic equations in integers almost two thousand years ago.
Today, mathematicians recognize that geometric properties often govern the
behavior of arithmetic objects. Furthermore, computational tools provide a means
to test conjectures and can sometimes furnish partial solutions; at the same
time, theoretical advances fuel dramatic improvements in computation. The
theory, design, and implementation of algorithms in arithmetic geometry is a
burgeoning area, and there are many exciting applications of these methods to
diverse fields. The PI further proposes many specific projects at the
undergraduate and graduate level, and the proposed algorithmic tools will be
integrated into teaching, training, and learning. The PI will continue
undergraduate outreach, mentoring of undergraduate and graduate students, and
expository writing and extensive lectures aimed at communicating high level
mathematics to a student audience. Finally, the PI will design a course on the
mathematics of cryptography for teacher leaders who have graduated from the
Vermont Mathematics Initiative (VMI)
