Research in atomic spectroscopy will continue to approach the fundamental
limits of resolution and accuracy in optical spectroscopy, one part in 1018. The
best "accuracy" and 1000-day stability realized in the past is 10-13 or 105
times less. The new "accuracy" means that independent frequency measurements on
the same atomic line by two different groups in the same laboratory agree to
better than 10-18 and long term (108 sec or 1000 days) stability is as good.
This follows on the first observation in an individual Ba+ ion of the forbidden
6S1/2 5D5/2 transition at 1.76 microm of 0.005 Hz natural line width. Further
work will continue to improve on these basic measurements of atomic parameters.
