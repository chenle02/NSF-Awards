9521888 Mukhopadyay This project is aimed at exploring a new and innovative
method of tailoring the superconductor-metal interface by doping the surface of
the superconducting oxide with bromine which was found to modify its chemical
interaction with metals. Ag-superconductor composite samples with undoped and
halogen-doped superconducting oxides will be prepared and comparison of their
physical properties (Jc , Tc , microstructure and how each property changes with
thermal and electrical cycling) will be made. This study if successful, will
provide a new dopant for superconductors, which will improve the overall oxide-
metal composites. %%% Surface treatment of oxide superconductors by bromine will
be tested. If successful, it will provide a new method for achieving high
quality and of better properties superconductor: metal composites.
