In this theoretical project, the principal investigator (PI) will study the
dynamics of low-dimensional systems, including the dynamics of tunneling in
time-dependent fields with and without noise and static random fields, the
dynamics of hysteresis in the AC field, the dynamics of creation and
annihilation of topological excitations such as skyrmions and bubble domains.
The PI will also extend his study of the heterogeneous ferromagnetic-
superconducting systems to their transport properties and nucleation of new
phases. Also to be investigated is a new class of coherent phenomena appearing
in anisotropic superconductors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These theoretical studies
relate to a broad variety of physical systems: nanomagnets, magnetic dots and
rings, thin magnetic films and wires, ferromagnetic-superconducting bilayers and
multilayers, narrow thin stripes of anisotropic superconductors. For all of
these new physical phenomena are indicated that can be used in technology for
creation of nano-scale digits in magnetic memory or elements of fast-acting
electronics regulated by relatively weak magnetic
fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part of the research has a more general character,
specifically, the part related to tunneling processes and to hysteresis
dynamics. They relate to a much wider class of physical phenomena including
chemical and biological reactions, electronic transitions at atomic and
molecular collisions and surface phase transitions. Research will be conducted
in collaboration with experimental and theoretical groups throughout the USA and
the world.&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;Theoretical research will be conducted on a
variety of systems and phenomena that have both fundamental and applied aspects.
The common theme of these studies is their dynamics, or behavior when driven by
an external force. Applications include various types of nano-scale magnetic
configurations.&lt;br/&gt;*** &lt;br/&gt;
