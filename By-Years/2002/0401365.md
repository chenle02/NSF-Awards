This award provides partial support for the purchase of an automated
16-capillary DNA sequencer, ancillary hardware, and data analysis software to be
housed in the Center for Biosystematics and Biological Diversity (CBBD) at Texas
A&M University (TAMU). The equipment will allow for high throughput nucleotide
sequencing and automated genotyping in support of research projects in molecular
phylogenetics, population genetics, biogeography, genetic toxicology, and
comparative genomics. Examples of research areas that will benefit from this
award include: (1) phylogenetics and population genetics of insects, many of
which are pest species; (2) conservation genetics of fragmented and threatened
species; (3) molecular based studies of microbial biodiversity in ocean systems;
(4) integration of molecular phylogenetics and ecological studies of South
American fishes; (5) comparative genomics, molecular phylogenetics, and
population genetics of mammalian and avian systems; (6) plant phylogenetics and
population genetics; and (7) genetic toxicology of natural populations. This
acquisition will enhance traditional graduate and post-graduate research
training, as well as research experiences for undergraduates involved in REU and
UMEB programs.
