In recent work a new and widely applicable approach to the theory of large
deviations has been developed by Paul Dupuis of Brown University and this
investigator. In this approach many aspects of the theory of large deviations
are reduced to the theory of weak convergence of probability measures. This
research treats new applications of this weak convergence approach to a number
of important problems. The method also gives rise to several computational
questions that are currently under investigation. Areas of application include a
general class of queuing networks and several models in statistical mechanics.
The theory of large deviations is an important area of probabilistic research
having applications to a number of areas including statistics, statistical
mechanics, and queuing theory. In recent work a new and widely applicable
approach to the theory of large deviations has been developed by Paul Dupuis of
Brown University and this investigator. This approach may give new insight into
large deviation phenomena and allow researchers to determine computationally the
accuracy of the theory. A main area of application of will be to queuing
systems, which arise in the modeling of computer networks.
