9421823 Masek This grant supports the research of 2 senior faculty, a senior
research physicist, a postdoctoral scholar and the training of 3 graduate
students with CLEO collaboration group. They continue experimental operations at
the CESR electron-positron collider, the facility at Cornell University
supported by NSF. Their particular interests are first, in photon-photon
collisions among whose products they search for evidence of putative glueball
production, and more recently, B-meson decays. Those studies are important for
strengthening the understanding of the fundamental particles and their
interactions. ***
