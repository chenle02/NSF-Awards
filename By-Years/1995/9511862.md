The World Wide Web (WWW) and the Internet are the cutting edge communication
environments for engineering and science, and are fast becoming the environment
of choice for education innovators in other disciplines as well. This project
will construct on the WWW an Ethics Center for Science and Engineering. The
center will serve as a model web ethics center, demonstrating the potential of
the web to bring together a variety of existing materials and make them
available to a diverse population of users. The subject matter will include
research ethics, professional ethics for engineers and scientists, and policy
questions that bear on research ethics and professional ethics, including
questions of research ethics which arise in medical research. The WWW Ethics
Center will serve students, practitioners, researchers, and science and
engineering instructors, as well as scholars in science and engineering ethics.
The Center will provide support for developing responses to ethical problems;
information and informed reflection on the ethical issues that commonly arise in
engineering and science; access to educational resources in science and
engineering ethics; and a forum for educators to disseminate their educational
innovations.
