Here is a puzzle: a group of people is told to each shake the hand of someone
they like; how can they quickly have many simultaneous handshakes? And what if
some can use both hands, others are chimps that can use their feet, or even
octopi that can shake with 8 others? This silly puzzle (b-Matching) has a
serious purpose, since this type of decision is often faced in computer systems
where entities can interact or communicate with a limited number of other
entities, and they need to negotiate quickly to maximize interaction. A related
puzzle (b-Edge cover), of having every hand holding another, arises in the data
privacy concept of b-Anonymity. In this project, the PI will work with a PhD
student to design and implement fast approximation algorithms for b-Matchings
and b-Edge Covers, and apply them k-Anonymity.

A b-Matching M is a set of edges in a weighted graph such that at most b(v)
edges in M are incident on each vertex v; the weight of a b-Matching is the sum
of the weights of the matched edges. This project aims to design a fast
approximation algorithm that achieves at least half the weight of the maximum
weighted matching. A b-Edge Cover is a subset of edges C such that at least b(v)
edges in C are incident on each vertex v in the graph; this project aims to
design a 3/2-approximation algorithm for the b-Edge Cover problem. These
algorithms will be implemented on multicore architectures that support multiple
threads of concurrency. The impact of the algorithms in application areas such
as data privacy (k-Anonymity) and preconditioning will be evaluated.

To ensure broad applicability, the PI and PhD student will work also with
collaborators from industry and national laboratories, and will produce modules
for a graduate course in advanced graph algorithms. The PI will also present
matching algorithms applied to the medical resident matching problem to students
at the West Lafayette Jr/Sr High School and Harrison High School with the
assistance of the Purdue Computer Science department's K-12 outreach program.
