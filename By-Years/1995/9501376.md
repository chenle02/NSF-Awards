9501376 Mooney This project is on research to develop a model system to engineer
smooth muscle tissue from cultured cells and to use this system to study the
role of mechanical stimuli in regulating smooth muscle cell proliferation, gene
expression, and tissue formation in engineered three dimensional structures.
Specific aims include: (1) design and fabrication of three dimensional templates
for formation of 3D tissue from cultured cells, (2) determination of the
interaction of smooth muscle with these templates, and (3) determination of the
relation between externally applied mechanical stimuli and gene expression in 3D
templates relative to that in 2D cultures. ***
