The aim of this project is to develop and empirically test strategic bargaining
models applied to union contract negotiations. A prominent feature of the
contract data is the holdout: negotiations often continue without a strike after
the contract has expired. Production continues with workers paid according to
the expired contract. A model was developed that accounts for the union's threat
choice. A key prediction of the model is that variation in strike incidence is
caused by shifts in the composition of disputes. Strike activity varies with
economic and policy variables that change the attractiveness of the strike
threat relative to the holdout threat. Preliminary empirical results generally
support this prediction. Also there is some evidence of a structural shift in
negotiations after 1981. This project will build on these preliminary results.
First, the data for empirical tests will be added to and refined. Second,
estimation strategies that incorporate the main features of the theory will be
developed and implemented. Third, the issue of permanent strike replacements
will be studied. In particular, the role that permanent replacements played in
the structural shift in negotiations after 1981 will be addressed. A theoretical
and empirical analysis of strike replacements will add to the current policy
debate on whether firms should be able to permanently replace striking workers.
