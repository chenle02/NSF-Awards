Rapid prototyping systems composed of programmable gate arrays present many
technical challenges affecting system utilization and performance. The objective
of this research is the development of engineering methodologies which address
these currently unresolved technical issues. Current rapid prototyping systems
suffer several shortcomings, including engineering bottlenecks caused by time-
consuming mapping processes, inadequate performance for real-time emulation of
high-speed systems, and high cost resulting from poor system utilization due to
the severe IO limit of programmable devices. The proposed research targets these
key areas. Both hardware and CAD algorithm issues will be addressed. The
proposed project will contribute to identify the bottlenecks of current
prototyping systems and discovering novel solutions. This research will
contribute to faster mapping processes, low cost - high utilization systems, and
real-time emulation.
