Aggressive behavior is pervasive in the animal kingdom. It is the result of
interactions between stimuli from the environment and internal activity of the
brain. Although aggression is influenced by the environment, genetic differences
between animals also play an important role in this behavior. In this project,
aggression is studied in the laboratory fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Male
fruit flies display obvious aggression responses in the presence of food
territories and females. Even in the absence of these triggers, aggression can
be observed albeit at lower frequency. The aggression responses are measured
with simple and reproducible assays. Moreover, the fruit fly offers the
advantage of a large number of genetic and neurobiological tools to analyze this
behavior. Using these tools, the behavior will be dissected to better understand
the mechanisms. Preliminary studies suggest that the basic molecular machinery
regulating the drive to display aggression appears to be very similar between
flies and mice. In addition, these studies also show that the neurons that
regulate the behavior in the fruit fly are also surprisingly similar to neurons
in mice that are known to regulate mammalian aggression. The function of the
conserved machinery in these functionally similar neurons will be further
studied in this series of experiments. These studies may identify a basic
mechanism involved in the regulation of aggression in all animals. These studies
will drive the field of study of aggression in a new direction: from a main
focus on hormonal control and modulation to transcriptional control in specific
neuronal targets to integrate environmental responses that result in optimal
adaptive behavior. The laboratory uses state of the art technology and resources
for training the next generation of scientists. The lab actively participates in
the training of minority students through the SMART program and the Houston
Community College Science Intern Program.
