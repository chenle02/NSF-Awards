This proposal is in response to NSF Program Solicitation for Small Business
Innovation Research (NSF 86-19) and is requesting support for Phase I research
of this program. The overall goal of the proposal is to demonstrate the
feasibility of measuring on-line the density of mammalian cells in bioreactor
suspension cultures with the use of an optical sensor. The optical sensor is
designed to be inserted into a reactor through a sampling port and will be
connected to a Helium Neon laser source and a microprocessor. Research
objectives for Phase I research are as follows: 1. Build a prototype optical
sensor as described in the proposal. 2. Test the system using plastic
microspheres as test materials. Different sizes of calibrating microspheres at
various particle densities will be studied to optimize the technique for
determination of particle concentration and mean particle size. 3. Obtain number
density and size measurements from samples of mammalian cells and then optimize
the instrument for the range of values which will be representative of
bioreactor suspension cultures. If successful, this optical sensor would be a
significant new tool in the analysis of mammalian cell cultures. The Panel
reviewing this proposal rated it second of the 36 proposals reviewed and
recommended it highly for funding. The investigators are considered to be very
capable of carrying out the proposed research and I recommend funding of this
proposal in accordance with the budget submitted with the proposal.
