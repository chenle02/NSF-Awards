*** 96-60960 Sibold This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project will develop a low cost process for toughening alumina ceramics, which
are widely used in wear, corrosion, and electrical insulation applications in
virtually all industries and markets. Presently, brittleness of these ceramics
and their high cost sharply limit their use. This research will examine a low
cost, water based ceramic precursor that can be used to toughen conventional
aluminas. Porous commercial alumina preforms will be infiltrated with the
precursor to develop a platelet toughened alumina. The only new processing step
that this would require is infiltration prior to final firing in a commercial
ceramic production line. Commercial applications are expected in tougher low
cost alumina ceramics. ***
