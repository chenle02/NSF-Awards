AST-0307558&lt;br/&gt;Goodman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is a
dynamically self-consistent model for accretion in quasars. The outer parts of
quasar accretion disks are prone to gravitational instability, and the problem
is to explain why the gaseous disk does not fragment entirely into stars rather
than feed the quasar. Some fraction of the gas may form stars or small black
holes and heat the disk, postponing further fragmentation, but the energy
required to stabilize large disks is probably more than can be made available
this way. Preliminary calculations by the PI and students suggest that local
heating can maintain marginal stability, and this work will further investigate
this effect and its possible sources, as well as explore alternative (faster)
accretion modes that could yield greater gravitational stability. Predictions
from this partly analytical but mostly numerical work will be tested against
observations, and the comparisons will feed back into the modeling. A
combination of energy inputs and alternative rapid accretion may be
required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will train graduate students in
research and in the communication of their results by publication and by
conference and institutional presentations. Pedagogical accounts of super-
massive black holes, orbital motions, accretion, and other concepts related to
this research, will be used to capture the interest of
schoolchildren.&lt;br/&gt;
