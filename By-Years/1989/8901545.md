This research concerns the area of interacting particle systems in probability
theory, the theory of random walks in random environments, and the understanding
of branching processes. This project should contribute to understanding the
general theory of particle systems, the rate of diffusion of random walks in
random environments, and the limiting density of branching random walks. Work on
particle systems dates to about 1970 and has been motivated by examples of such
systems from the biological sciences, statistical mechanics, and cybernetics.
Typically, large numbers of particles are assumed to interact according to some
rule; one is interested in the limiting behavior of such systems after a long
time. Basic systems such as the contact process, voter model, and coalescing and
annihilating random walks are simple models for the propagation of a species,
the spread of disease, or the state of a chemical reaction.
