Abstract Gursky 9623048 The research to be supported by this grant is concerned
with the study of fourth order differential equations and systems of equations
from differential geometry. The equations under consideration are Euler
equations for functionals that are connected to certain sharp Sobolev
inequalities. The systems of equations arise in differential geometry when
studying the problem of prescribing curvature and the existence of critical
points of a functional introduced in relativity. Historically, the most fruitful
applications of pure mathematics to very real world problems are often the
result of the interaction of two different fields within the subject. The work
to be supported here attempts to use methods of mathematical analysis to study
certain problems in the field of differential geometry. At least one of these
problems is relevant to physics, but it is often the case that the mathematics
precedes the application by many years, so that it is difficult to assess the
immediate use of the problems posed here: except to say that they are very basic
questions that hopefully will increase the depth of our understanding of a
subject that has seen many applications in the past.
