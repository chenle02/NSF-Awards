Paleoecological reconstructions at archaeological sites are important for
understanding the environmental forcing mechanisms behind human expansion into
various environments, and subsequent adaptation strategies. Fossil ostrich
eggshell is often associated with human occupational levels in semiarid and arid
regions of the Old World, and is a new material from which paleoecologic data
can be extracted. This study will examine the isotopic relationships among the
various components of ostrich eggshell, food and water under controlled
conditions, and will examine the isotope composition of fossil eggshell from
sites in southern Egypt and South Africa, where the paleoecology has been
assessed independently of the isotopic record. It will be important in assessing
the utility of this new technique, as well as training doctoral candidates in
new techniques.
