This proposal seeks funding to deploy 7 temporary broadband seismograph
stations in a north-south profile at a longitude of about 123oW in western
Washington for the purpose of recording teleseismic body waveforms. We intend to
undertake a receiver function analysis of the recorded P-waves in order to
delineate variations in the amplitude and timing of Ps conversions from the
oceanic Moho of the subducted Juan de Fuca plate that are indicative of
variations in the geometry of the subducted slab along its strike. Specifically,
we will attempt to confirm and refine a working hypothesis recently proposed
that suggests that the Juan de Fuca plate may be deformed in a broad arch
centered in the vicinity of Puget Sound. This model explains certain aspects of
the seismicity beneath this region as well as a number of other geological and
geophysical observations. We have recorded teleseismic P-waveforms along an
east-west profile at about 47oN latitude that demonstrates that the oceanic Moho
of the Juan de Fuca plate has a characteristic signature in teleseismic receiver
functions. Results from these earlier deployments are consistent with our arch
model. Further refinements in this model will have important implications in
terms of the tectonic evolution and earthquake hazards potential of the Cascadia
Subduction Zone. This research represents a collaborative project between the
University of Missouri-Columbia (T.J. Owens) and the University of Washington
(R.S. Crosson).
