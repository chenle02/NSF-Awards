In this project the principal investigator will study the structure of waves
that arise in a number of physical systems through the action of temporally
periodic driving forces. The research will follow two directions. First of all,
the principal investigator will study how the effect of temporal driving in
exciting the system is balanced by the influence of spatial symmetries. This
will entail using some recent methods of bifurcation theory with symmetry to
derive and analyze the amplitude equations. Secondly, the principal investigator
will study the dynamics of parametrically driven waves in large aspect-ratio
systems. Such waves exhibit different types of instabilities that can lead to
spatio-temporal chaos. The transitions to this chaotic behavior will be studied
analytically as well as numerically.
