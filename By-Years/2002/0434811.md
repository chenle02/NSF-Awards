A grant has been awarded to the University of Rhode Island, under the direction
of Dr Jennifer Specker to support modernization of the mechanical infrastructure
of the Ann Gall Durbin Marine Research Aquarium at the Narragansett Bay Campus.
Seawater is the lifeblood of any marine facility, upgrading the seawater system
will improve the reliability, capacity, and safety of the Aquarium.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Durbin Aquarium is a critical element of the marine
research program at the Narragansett Bay campus of the University of Rhode
Island (URI). This facility has a long history of internationally recognized
research and a strong history of research funding. The location of the aquarium
at the water's edge of the biologically rich Narragansett Bay estuary allows
access to organisms and flowing seawater essential to the collection,
maintenance, and study of marine life by students and scientists resident at the
URI's Kingston and Bay Campuses and for many of the visitors to URI and the
Graduate School of Oceanography. Its location, adjacent to estuarine waters, has
facilitated the acquisition of some of the longest biological time series in the
world. Plankton and fish time series date back to the 1950's and a nutrient
dataset dates back to the mid 1970's. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI's have
proposed an excellent long-term plan and are beginning to implement the
broadening participation in research activities of the Graduate School of
Oceanography (GSO) and more broadly disseminating the excitement of discovery.
These efforts include: K-12 teacher's education; offering fellowships each
summer to journalists who participate in research with scientists; and ongoing
Research Experiences for Undergraduate (REU) programs. The proposed facility
improvements will maintain the infrastructure to continue and expand these
activities and impacts.&lt;br/&gt;
