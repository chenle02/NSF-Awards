Planning Grant for an I/UCRC for Surveillance Theory

0934250 Ohio State University; Randolph Moses 0934293 Wright State University;
Brian Rigling The Center for Surveillance Theory (CST) will develop a mature
theory and advanced body-of-knowledge for modern surveillance systems. Ohio
State University (OSU) and Wright State University (WSU) are collaborating to
establish the proposed center, with OSU as the lead institution.

Surveillance and situational awareness are critical technologies needed to
address societal needs of safety and security. Surveillance is used to provide
our nation with both international and homeland security, and situational
awareness for disaster mitigation and management (e.g. Hurricane Katrina). The
main motivation behind the proposed center is to address the theory behind the
complex surveillance systems mostly based on sensors and sensor systems. The
proposed Center is expected to generate research that significantly advances
current surveillance theory and technology and to become a focal point within
the surveillance community. The inherent multidisciplinary nature of
surveillance systems means that the Center will include researchers across a
broad spectrum of disciplines, including signal processing, computer science,
sensor technology and human factors. OSU and WSU plan to use the NSF planning
grant fund to hold a meeting with prospective industrial partners to establish
the proposed Center's organizational framework, and to establish research
projects of greatest relevance.

The research advances in surveillance technology developed by CST will be
transitioned to applications of significant societal and national interest. The
Center plans to develop and promote a collaborative, focused scientific
community in surveillance theory, including short courses, cross departmental
and cross-university graduate course offerings, and internships with member
organizations. CST will recruit underrepresented groups, and plans to leverage
existing programs such as the Ohio STEM Ability Alliance, the ADVANCE program at
OSU, and through collaborations with the Air Force Research Laboratory Sensors
Directorate's Minority Leaders Program.
