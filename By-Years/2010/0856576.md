When a crisis occurs many organizations must work with each other in order to
provide an effective response. But these organizations may have only limited
familiarity and experience with one another. This makes coordination difficult,
resulting in delays and duplication in the critical hours after an event. The
research project will examine how responders coordinate with one another amidst
crisis. To do so, the research will examine examples of crisis response in the
United States, including response to terrorist attacks, natural disasters, and
animal disease outbreaks.

This project will help us to understand how different levels of government, non-
profits and private actors can prepare to respond to crises. In 2004, the
Department of Homeland Security mandated that all levels of government had to
use the Incident Command System, which centralizes authority over multiple
response organizations into the hands of a single commander. This research
project will help us to understand how well the Incident Command System has
worked in practice, what challenges it faces, and how it can work more
effectively. More broadly, the research will provide knowledge about how
traditional hierarchical organizations find ways to quickly form a network.
