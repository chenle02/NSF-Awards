A non-intrusive laser doppler interferometer for measuring vibratory motion of
mechanical components and a computer-based data acquisition and analysis system
will be used to initiate a research laboratory at UCLA dedicated to the
development of analytical and experimental techniques for the investigation of
machine dynamics, and the analysis and control of noise and vibration in
electro-mechanical systems. For its first application, the instrumentation will
be used as part of a fully coordinated experimental and theoretical effort to
study the modal and self-excited vibration phenomenon of a magnetic head
suspension system in a high-performance floppy disk drive. Future applications
will be related to the investigation of chatter vibration experienced in high-
precision manufacturing processes.
