9314094 Ianna Parallaxes and proper motions of stars form the foundation for
the cosmic distance scale and consequently the foundation of our understanding
such diverse topics as the evolution of stars, the distances to other galaxies
and the age of the universe. These investigators are conducting the only long
term parallax and proper motion program for stars in the southern hemisphere. In
the continuation of this work, the parallaxes of white dwarf stars, subdwarf
stars and low luminosity cool main sequence stars will be emphasized. ***
