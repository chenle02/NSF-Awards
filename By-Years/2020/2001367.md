With the advent of widely available fast computing, computational experiments
have become more important in every branch of science and mathematics. Macaulay2
is a software system that leads in facilitating the use of symbolic and
symbolic-numeric computation in multidisciplinary investigations. The
computations it can perform have uses in many fields of mathematics, computer
science, and natural sciences. The research under this project extends the
computational methods built into Macaulay2. The project will promote
collaborations between Macaulay2 developers from the research community, on the
one hand, and applied scientists and pure mathematicians, on the other. This
project provides research training opportunities for
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Macaulay2 is an open-source computer algebra
system dedicated to solving systems of polynomial equations in many variables as
well as computing and processing data that describe the underlying geometry of
the solution sets. The three major aspects of this proposal are: research on
core mathematical topics and applications outside mathematics; the maintenance
and development of Macaulay2 as part of the infrastructure of research; and the
development of manpower through training, conferences and collaborations,
especially involving young researchers. The impact outside mathematics includes
investigating problems from physics, biology, computer vision, and other areas
where nonlinear algebra is a key ingredient. The project will maintain and
develop Macaulay2 as a major tool for research, especially by improving the core
algorithms for Groebner bases and free resolutions and by improving its
facilities that combine symbolic and numerical
computation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
