The ongoing work involves the analysis of the structural behavior of the
Pentagon building on 11 September 2001. There are two poignant questions about
the observed behavior of the building that deserve investigation:

1. Immediately upon impact of the Boeing 757, the reinforced concrete building
lost approximately 30 columns in the ground story. Instead of an immediate
collapse the structure remained standing to allow its occupants to be rescued.
What were the structural attributes that prevented progressive collapse? 2. The
Boeing 757 crashed into the building at a speed exceeding 750 ft/sec. It had
enormous kinetic energy. The debris was stopped in 300 ft. What characteristics
of the structure were the main factors in absorbing the energy?

The insights gained are made available a Group. The final report will include
the development of a web site containing the data and their studies.
Presentations are made at professional society meetings.
