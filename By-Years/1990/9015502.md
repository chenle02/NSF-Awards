Pultruded fiber reinforced plastic (FRP) structural shapes are beginning to see
use in Civil Engineering practice. The design and performance of pultruded FRP
structures is considered in this research. Particular attention is paid to the
influence of the transverse properties of the anisotropic pultruded material on
the structural response. Experimental and theoretical techniques will be used to
obtain nonlinear moment-rotation data and failure information for typical
pultruded FRP connections; and buckling, postbuckling and failure data for
transversely loaded pultruded FRP beams. The use of FRP stiffeners will be
considered as a means of improving performance of pultruded structures. The
recommendations will be transmitted to the Civil Engineering community and the
pultrusion industry through an ASTM committee.
