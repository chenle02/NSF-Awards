Chemical reactions in closed system consume initial reactants monotonically to
produce products. If fresh reagents are constantly flowed into a stirred
reactor, very complicated regular or even oscillatory patterns of product
formation may be observed. This research will continue the study of such
systems, which can be considered models of complex chemical systems far away
from equilibrium. Theoretical models will also be developed to explain the
observed phenomena. Simple systems involving halate ions with organic species
such as malonic acid, reactions of silver ions and halide ions to form insoluble
precipitates, reactions of bromate ions with HS ions, catalyzed autoxidations,
and thresholds for nucleation of gas bubbles are among the systems to be
studied. This is part of experimental physical chemistry/chemical kinetics
program.
