This awards supports the participation of eleven U.S. scientists in a
U.S.-Japan Seminar on Physics and Chemistry of C60 and Related Compounds, to be
held in Honolulu, Hawaii July 18-24, 1993. The co-organizers are Professor John
Fischer of the University of Pennsylvania and Professor Yusei Maruyama of the
Institute for Molecular Science, Okazaki, Japan. In addition to the U.S. and
Japanese participants, scientists from France, Portugal, and the Netherlands
will be invited. Research on fullerenes and fullerene-based materials continues
to expand at a rapid pace. U.S. and Japanese researchers are very active in this
new field. Several individual national scientific meetings have emphasized this
topic, but this is the first opportunity for discussions between researchers
from the two countries. The objective of the seminar is to achieve a more
detailed understanding of the unusual physical properties of fullerene-based
materials, in particular the structural and electronic properties of various
doped and intercalated phases. Attempts will be made to reconcile data obtained
from powder, single crystal and thin film samples, with a view to establishing a
general model for explaining the evolution of crystal structure and electronic
ground state with doping and the mechanism of superconductivity. The seminar
will emphasize new fullerenes, chemical modification at the molecular level, and
the superconducting alkali metal-intercalated C60 compounds.
