AST 9530478 The Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment. Dr. Paczynski will
lead a group of international researchers in expanding and extending the Optical
Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) to a second phase. The group will
utilize a new 1.3 meter telescope being built by the Warsaw University
Observatory at the Las Campanas site in Chile. They will use a CCD camera with
2000 x 2000 pixels to obtain multi-band photometry of 100 million to 1 billion
stars towards the bulge of our Galaxy, the Magellanic Clouds and to make stellar
catalogs for an area of up to 1000 square degrees on the sky. The group will
also search for microlensing events in the densest stellar fields. Microlensing
data will be provided in real time on the Internet, and stellar catalogs will be
distributed on CD ROMs. =========================================
