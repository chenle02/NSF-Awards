This collections project addresses one of the most difficult problems in
teaching computer vision, developing good assignments. The PI is gathering the
best materials from several institutions into a comprehensive digital library
collection for computer vision education. This resource contains links to
assignments at a variety of institutions and hosts a set of vetted assignments,
complete with data sets and solutions. In addition, it contains educational
resources such as lecture notes, links to other computer vision courses, and
reviews of textbooks, software, and hardware. The PI is accomplishing this
objective by collecting materials from computer vision educators, developing new
materials, and organizing and building a comprehensive web site to serve them.
An initial version of the site is available at
palantir.swarthmore.edu/extra/cved. He plans to engage computer vision educators
directly in the collection and review process through a small collection
development workshop. The PI plans to use several processes to ensure that the
collected material is high quality, including a formal review mechanism and less
formal approaches where workshop participants and course instructors prepare and
post reviews on his website. Dissemination activities include major efforts to
involve a large number of potential users in the development of the collection
and to promote the site through conference papers and presentations, through
direct contact with potential users, and by cross-linking the web site with
course instructors' websites. The PI's institution has agreed to maintain the
equipment and the website beyond the ending date of the project.&lt;br/&gt;
