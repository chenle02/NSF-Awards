Since 1973, Case Western Reserve University has provided programs designed to
increase the number of minority students entering the fields of engineering and
science. By combining certain components of our existing programs with the Young
Scholars Program, we will create an outstanding opportunity for a select group
of approximately thirty-five minority students. Twenty-five students for Greater
Cleveland and ten from other areas throughout the United States will be
identified as NSF Young Scholars. All of the students will have completed the
eleventh grade and will have demonstrated interest and ability in mathematics
and the sciences. The Young Scholars will participate in a five-week summer
program at CWRU. The program will emphasize mathematics, physics, expository
writing, speech, and engineering. Hands-on projects are related to the student's
specific engineering interests.
