This work will determine the thermal history of Tanzanian continental crust to
understand mantle and plate tectonic processes. Rocks of the Mozambique mobile
belt formed in the Archean, but were strongly heated and recrystallized during
two separate mountain-building events: the ~2.0 Ga Usagaran orogeny and the ~600
Ma pan-African orogeny. The craton-mobile belt boundary also forms the site of
present-day continental rifting, along a presumed site of pre-existing weakness
in the plate. Samples from the Mozambique Belt will be studied with various
techniques to determine their pressure-temperature history, especially dating
uranium-rich minerals whose radioactive clocks are reset at different
temperatures. The measurements will track the evolving thickness of the plate
through time, and the amount of hot, mantle-derived magmas that intruded the
crust during the mountain-building events. These results will shed light on the
behavior of continental plates during mountain building and rifting, as well as
the parameters responsible for localization of weakness within the continental
plate. The work will involved scientists from the University of Maryland, the
University of Dar-es-Salaam, and MIT.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
