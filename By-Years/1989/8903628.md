Recognition of 3-D objects continues to be a difficult task for robotic vision
and automated inspection systems, even when computer models are available for
all objects of interest. This grant will support a graduate student studying the
use of "wing features," or surface/edge/surface descriptors, for the
identification of rigid 3-D objects from range data. The work includes
experimental software development for image segmentation and feature extraction,
database indexing, and pose determination.
