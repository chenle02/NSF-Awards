In this award, funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the
Division of Chemistry, Professor Purnendu Dasgupta of the University of Texas at
Arlington and his graduate student researchers will be supported to develop
broadband multipath spectrometry using cavities with diffuse but high
reflectivity. The key feature of the devices that will be developed is an
increase in the effective path-length for absorption achieved by having the
light pass through the sample multiple times. In comparison to other multi-path
optical methods, the method being developed by Prof. Dasgupta and his students
is not reliant upon optically flat surfaces. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spectrometry
is a workhorse method for quantitatively measuring the concentration of species
in solution. It fails when the analytes of interest are weakly absorbing, when
the pathlength through the sample is small, or when the concentration of the
absorbing species is very low. Methods like that being developed in this project
aim to overcome these problems, thereby increasing the utility of this robust
analytical method. The technique being developed in this project can be useful
in a number of important applications, including the determination of low levels
of contaminants in ultra-high purity water. The students working on this project
will gain useful experience in building new kinds of analytical instruments, and
they will be well-trained for employment in the science and technology
workforce.
