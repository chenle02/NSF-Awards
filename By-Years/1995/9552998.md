9552998 Shubert This three year project would provide hands on enhancement of
20 teachers of chemistry each year at one of four geographically distributed
sites across Kansas. Each workshop would be four weeks in length with two days
of follow-up during the academic year. There would be a total of five separate
workshops each serving 20 teachers for a total of 100. These teachers will
experience learning about the various experiments by a combination of
cooperative learning and traditional lecture. Each group of 20 teachers will
share 3 complete ChemKits via mail. There is in place a system for continuing
the project after Foundation funding ceases. The cost share is 39% of the
request from the Foundation.
