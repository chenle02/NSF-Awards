This data analysis project is to complete the interpretation of the measurements
made during the Arctic Haze 86 campaign which was sponsored by the Arctic Gases
and Aerosol Sampling Program (AGASP). The data was taken over the Arctic Ocean
and Northern Greenland. The proposers measured sulfer dioxide and carbonyl
sulfide concentrations with high precision and 10 minute time resolution, which
will allow determination of sulfur compound variations within the haze layers.
The results will yield greater understanding of how these sulfur species are
transported from industrial regions, how they interact with other gases and
aerosols and how they are removed from the atmosphere.
