Srihari 9315006 This is a standard award in the NSF/ARPA Human Language
Technology for cooperative research on how to utilize new and improved
approaches to the recognition of handwritten text with the support of language
models based on linguistic knowledge, involving researchers at the State
University of New York at Buffalo and the Eastman Kodak Company. The approach
concerns the use of contextual constraints to improve the recognition and, at
times, override the results of classical pattern recognition. This includes the
use of lexicons and holistic filtering, of dictionary statistics, and of high-
level syntactic and semantic post-processing. Although the research focuses on
models of the English language, with emphasis on the linguistic component rather
than on the pattern recognition component, and utilizes statistical training
with representative corpora, it can be extended to other European languages and
to the recognition of printed text.
