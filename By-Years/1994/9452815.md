9452815 Canton The dilemma of student retention has always plagued educational
institutions, especially community colleges. Although many community colleges
directs some of its efforts toward student retention, many such efforts are, at
best fragmented and ill planned. This has also happened in the initiation of
mentoring programs developed by community colleges to combat the problem of high
dropout rates, especially among minority students. Thus, the purpose of this
proposal is to develop a "Mentoring Guide for Community Colleges." This guide
will be designed as a resource to assist administrators, faculty, staff,
students and other decision makers to understand the factors involved in
developing a planned mentoring program. The "Mentoring Guide for Community
Colleges" will be developed and written by Dr. Marcia Canton and Dr. David James
and edited by Mr. William Brescia. Among the major objectives of the guide are
the following: (1) essential components of a planned mentor program and (2)
specific examples of successful mentor programs in community colleges as well as
potential pitfalls that can lead to the demise of mentor programs. The projected
outcome of this proposal is the production and distribution of 5,000 "Mentoring
Guides for Community Colleges," of which 1,000 copies of the "Mentoring Guides
for Community Colleges," will be provided to the National Science Foundation.
