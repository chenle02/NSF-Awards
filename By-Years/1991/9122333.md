In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry
Division, Robert Dunbar of Case Western Reserve University will study the
properties of gas-phase ions interacting with laser light using an ion cyclotron
resonance ion trap. "Medium-to-large" hydrocarbons, organometallic compounds,
clusters, and complex ions are targets for study. Time-resolved
photodissociation kinetics, measurement of radiative cooling rates of excited
ions, infrared multiphoton dissociation kinetics, the determination of radiative
association efficiencies and of partitioning of vibrational energy in the
products of complex ion dissociation will all be examined. The temperature
dependence of some of these processes will be determined using an ion trap
cooled to 77 K. Theoretical studies will be conducted dealing with infrared
multiphoton dissociation and radiative association in conjunction with an expert
versed in statistical mechanics. %%% The development of the technique known as
Ion Cyclotron Resonance Spectroscopy has enabled scientists to trap electrically
charged atoms or molecules, known as ions, for relatively long times, on the
order of seconds or longer. With such long storage times, various processes
involving ions which last up to seconds in time can now be studied more easily.
Examples of such processes include the breakup of an ion after the absorption of
light with just enough energy to sever the bonds between atoms (near-threshold
photodissociation) and the emission of infrared radiation. Professor Dunbar's
work will allow him to study several of these "slow" chemical processes for a
variety of fairly large molecular ions.
