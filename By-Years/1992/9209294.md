This research seeks to apply interior point optimization methods to network
modeling and state estimation problems involving unmeasured external network
states. In addition, it will improve the efficiency of interior point methods
for power systems problems. The basic approach will minimize the injected power
mismatch at buses on the boundary of the local network. Alternate strategies for
choosing the barrier parameter of the interior point algorithm will be
investigated to improve efficiency. The outcome of this work will be a set of
robust, rational approaches to large scale network modeling as well as an
expanded set of powerful state estimation tools ready for practical
implementation.
