Symplectic geometry is a branch of modern mathematics lying at the crossroads of
many other subfields including differential topology, algebraic geometry,
dynamical systems, and theoretical physics. Its equations describe many natural
phenomena, including the motions of classical mechanics, yet its mathematical
structures are surprisingly rich and subtle, necessitating a wide array of new
tools. This project seeks to construct new mathematical objects called
"symplectic invariants", and apply them to several geometric problems to help
understand when symplectic dynamics can distort one shape into another. This
project will also contribute to dissemination and education by organizing large-
scale seminars and workshops, mentoring graduate students, and crafting new ways
to visualize abstract geometry via computer visualizations and 3D printing.

More specifically, this project will focus on exploiting higher algebraic
structures in Floer theory and symplectic field theory. These structures have
been known to experts for some time, but only recently have been shown to play a
powerful role in embedding obstructions and other geometric problems. The PI
will continue their investigation of "higher symplectic capacities", developing
new algorithms to facilitate computations and exploring the resulting
enumerative combinatorics. This project will also expand the foundations and
purview of these higher algebraic structures, including their role in Weinstein
geometry and connections with Fukaya categories and homological mirror symmetry.
Furthermore, the PI will continue to develop a framework for studying numerical
simulations in symplectic geometry, with an emphasis on both theoretical ideas
and practical computer software.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
