This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program
provides support for research on the magnetic properties and synthesis of
transition metal carboxylate clusters by Dr. George Christou of the Chemistry
Department, Indiana University. Some families of manganese carboxylate clusters
have been found to exhibit single-molecule magnetism (SMM). Research will
determine the influence of the molecular environment on the observed magnetic
properties and the factors responsible for SMM behavior. Detailed studies will
include both DC and AC magnetic susceptibility measurements. New examples of
complexes exhibiting SMM will be synthesized, including cobalt carboxylate
clusters. In addition, metal carboxylate clusters will be incorporated into
supramolecular assemblies using a variety of polyfunctional ligands. The
resulting compounds will be tested for magnetic properties in an attempt to
provide synthetic access to new magnetic materials. Some molybdenum and rhenium
species with alkoxide functionalities will also be prepared. Magnetic materials
are technologically important in many areas, including electronics and
manufacturing. Miniaturization and finer control of devices continue to be
desirable goals. This research will lead to better understanding of magnetic
phenomena at the molecular level and possibly to increased ability to design
molecular- and nano- scale devices with specific magnetic properties.
