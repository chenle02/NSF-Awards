This is an individual award for the Postdoctoral Fellowship in Plant Biology.
The applicant received his Ph.D. from the University of California at Los
Angeles in molecular biology studying the regulation of membrane protein genes
in Lemna. He plans to carry out his postdoctoral fellowship research in the
laboratory of Dr. Arthur R. Grossman at Carnegie Institution of Washington at
Stanford. His research entitled "Generation and Characterization of mutants in
chromatic adaptation In Fremyella diplosiphon" will broaden the applicant's
scientific training into photobiology and environmental biology.
