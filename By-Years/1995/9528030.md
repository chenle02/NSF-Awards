This project will continue investigating excitation cross section measurements
of molecular oxygen by electron impact. Previously, the PI studied the Schumann-
Runge continuum, and longest and second bands. Under this proposal, the pseudo-
continuum region will be studied. This program will determine absolute electron
impact cross sections for all the important electronic transitions of molecular
oxygen in the pseudo-continuum region. Differential cross sections for
excitation of the identifiable electronic states in this region will be measured
by a crossed-beam method.***
