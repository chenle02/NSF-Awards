9409590 Osheroff Technical abstract: Helium three will be used as a model system
to study various aspects of the nature of phase transitions and complex order in
important classes of physical systems. Work on superfluid helium three A-B phase
nucleation will probe how surface roughness increases the nucleation rate,
possibly paving the way for the use of this system in quantum tunneling studies.
Study of the magnetic order in thr second layer helium three films adsorbed on
graphite will be continued. The emphasis of this work is to search for a
possible finite temperature phase transition in low magnetic fields for this two
dimensional Heisenberg system. Third sound studies will be carried out to search
for a second superconducting state of sub-monolayer helium three films adsorbed
on superfluid helium four. Finally, new studies of the spatial dependence of
noise correlations in spin glasses will be carried out. Non-technical abstract:
Helium three will be used as a model system for studying various aspects of the
nature of phase transitions and complex order in important classes of physical
systems. Studies of the phase transitions between two liquid helium three phases
which are neutral analogs to electrical superconductors may help produce a
highly effective particle detector, as well shed knowledge on a broad class of
phase transitions in general. Thin helium three films which exhibit effective
magnetic interactions between the atomic nuclei will allow test theoretical
predictions that thin liquid helium three films on appropriate substrates may
exhibit still more novel forms of order, possibly related to those seen in the
oxide superconductors. ***
