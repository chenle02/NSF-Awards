Linear partial differential operators or linear delay time systems are effective
models for many physical phenomena. Perturbations of these systems can often be
modelled by white noise. Typically these models have unknown parameters and the
systems must be controlled so there is the problem of stochastic adaptive
control for linear, stochastic distributed parameter systems. In many
distributed systems there is boundary control. In this proposal some problems of
adaptive control for linear, stochastic distributed parameter systems with
boundary control are described for investigation. Apparently no results are
available on this topic. The problem of stochastic adaptive control for these
systems include the exhibition of a consistent family of estimates of the
unknown parameters, the continuity of the solution of a Riccati equation with
respect to parameters, a generalization of the Ito formula and the verification
of the self-optimizing property of a family of adaptive controls. Furthermore
the initiation of an investigation of adaptive control for stochastic semilinear
parabolic equations is proposed.
