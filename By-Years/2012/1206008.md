This project aims to further the study of stable homotopy theory by methods and
machinery developed in algebraic geometry. There are four main goals. The first
goal is the study of specific examples of spectra of topological automorphic
forms, focusing on computations for the Shimura curve of discriminant 15 and
Picard modular surfaces at chromatic level 3. Second, joint work of Michael Hill
and the PI aims to extend the theory of topological modular forms to the log-
etale site of the moduli of elliptic curves, and in particular to functorially
produce topological modular forms with level structure. Third, the PI hopes to
further develop machinery employing Zink's theory of displays to produce highly
structured multiplications on various spectra of importants in chromatic
homotopy theory. Finally, joint work with David Gepner will study Picard and
Brauer groups in the derived setting using recently-developed machinery in
higher category theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main focus of this research
field is to systematically study qualitative properties of shape by methods from
algebra. In the past, these methods have led to surprising connections between
many disparate fields of mathematics, and developments in these fields have
translated into genuine information about geometric structures which is
difficult to obtain otherwise. The goal of this research project is to take some
of these most recent advances, taking place in subjects like higher category
theory and algebraic geometry, and develop them into concrete tools that can
advance our knowledge further.
