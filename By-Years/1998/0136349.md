The Climate Research Committee (CRC) of the Board on Atmospheric Sciences and
Climate (BASC) of the National Academy of Sciences is conducting a special study
on the major uncertainties associated with climate change feedbacks. This award
will enable an enlargement of the study panel to include experts in climate
research beyond the specific members of the CRC. It will support a major
workshop plus follow-on correspondence, meetings and report
writing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This subject is important to NSF and other federal
science agencies because it will enable better informed planning of climate
change research agendas. &lt;br/&gt;
