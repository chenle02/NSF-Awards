The project incorporates a "Self-Electro-Optic-Effect Device Laboratory" (SEED
Lab) into the existing Photonics B.S. degree program at the SUNY Institute of
Technology. The SEED Lab allows undergraduate photonics technologists to
evaluate prototype optoelectronic switching and logic devices invented by AT&T
Bell Laboratories. Students conduct laboratory experiments illustrating set up
requirements, operating characteristics (including dynamic behavior) of single
devices, and performance of interconnected devices and arrays of devices. A
laboratory manual detailing these experiments is available.
