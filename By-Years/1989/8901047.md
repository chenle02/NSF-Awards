This proposal is for the continuing operation of Febry-Perot Inferometer (FPI)
instrument at Svalbard, Norway (78.2o N, 15.6o E). This project is a component
of CEDAR campaign and the spectral observations will be used in conjunction with
other data sets. The FPI technique has proved to be very important in studying
new and innovative topics in the ionosphere/thermosphere polar atmospheric
dynamics. The dynamics of the F-region in the cusp and polar cap will be studied
through measurements of 63000 A. OI emissions will be used in the study of upper
and middle thermosphere. The simultaneous observations of 7320 A OII and 6300 A
OI emissions will provide a data base for the study of the dynamics of ion drag
on the thermospheric wind. The solar maximum sunspot activity will provide
unusual opportunities through enhanced spectral intensity for the study of the
polar atmospheric dynamics.
