9321517 Smith Boltonia decurrens, a perennial member of the Asteraceae endemic
to the Illinois River floodplain, appears to be disappearing from its native
habitat. The number of naturally occurring populations, which fluctuates
annually, continues to show a net decline. In 1988 USF&amp;WS declared B.
decurrens to be nationally threatened species. It is currently listed as
endangered in Missouri and threatened in Illinois. The proposed study will
enable Dr. Smith to use the extensive data base developed to study a threatened
and endangered floodplain species, Boltonia decurrens. Emergency funds are
needed to conduct immediate post flood surveys of population sites where plants
were known to exist from 1990 1992. This will enable assessment of the impact of
wide spread, prolonged flooding on natural and restored populations, and
recommendations concerning construction of new levees where populations have
survived. The information can be used in the formulation of an amended recovery
plan to enable government agencies to make scientifically valid recommendations
and optimize site management.
