Within this proposal, a novel gas sensor based on the surface conduction
tunneling mechanism will be developed to address the above issues of
semiconductor- based gas sensors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed gas sensor
technology is based on the surface conduction tunneling mechanism through the
nanogaps in the metal oxide semiconductor thin films. Since the proposed sensor
measures the current, the signal can be amplified to increase the sensitivity.
It also allows detection of each gas by measuring the tunneling threshold
voltage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The education plan focuses on the PI's activities
in five key areas: (1) mentoring and training of graduate students in a
multidisciplinary environment to become creative and independent researchers who
have the background and skills to discover and develop new ideas in the areas of
nanomaterials and nanotechnology, (2) encouragement and support for
undergraduate and high school students research participation, (3) recruitment
and retention of high school students, minorities and women in engineering
education through a high school outreach program, (4) enhancement of the
Materials Engineering curriculum by the addition of a new graduate course and a
short course, and (5) development of research activities at Western Michigan
University by collaboration, team work, and diversity.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research plan is designed to get technical/laboratory
assistance from regional universities, government laboratories (i.e. Argonne
National Laboratory), and international institutions in Japan and Denmark at the
initial stage. The PI also intends to reach out to the regional automobile
industries for future academic and industrial partnerships.&lt;br/&gt;
