1158784&lt;br/&gt;Neel S. Joshi&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All biosensing platforms
rest on two pillars ? specific biochemical recognition of a particular analyte
and transduction of that recognition into a readily detectable signal. Most
existing biosensing technologies utilize proteins that passively bind to their
analytes, and therefore require wasteful washing steps, specialized reagents,
and expensive instruments for detection. The PI proposes to develop a new class
of engineered protein switches that can actively sense peptide-based analytes
and directly produce an output signal only when the analyte is bound.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Combining the actions of sensing and
output signal generation into a single protein will result in protein switches
that are suitable for use in portable biosensing devices that can be used in the
field and by untrained individuals, significantly simplifying the quantification
of peptide-based analytes in biological samples. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts: The technology developed in this proposal will serve as a foundation
for the further development of devices capable of rapid detection of disease
biomarkers in biological samples or pathogenic toxins from environmental
sources. Funding for this project will support a team of undergraduate
researchers to participate in a unique international research competition for
biomolecular design (biomod.net) and also support an ongoing outreach program to
promote interaction between local high school students from communities
underrepresented in the sciences and researchers at the Wyss Institute for
Biologically Inspired Engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Project is jointly
funded by CBET program at Engineering and Molecular Biophysics in the Division
of Molecular and Cellular Sciences.
