9417168 Mitchell Delta State University request support from NSF for connection
of their campus network to SURAnet. SURAnet is the midlevel network located in
the southeastern United States. It will provide operations management and
information services and it will give Delta State University a 56 thousand bits
per second connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per
second) National Backbone network. The University needs greater functionality
and network speed to be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file
transfers along with being able to implement a more reliable mail system.
Students and faculty research will benefit from the link. This is also a unique
opportunity for the school to explore innovative educational resources.
