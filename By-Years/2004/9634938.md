To investigate coordinated information gathering. The vast amount of information
available today on the National Information Infrastructure has a great potential
to improve the quality of decisions and the productivity of consumers of this
information. Rapid expansion of the amount of available information and the
number of sources is expected over the next 5-10 years. Improved information
retrieval and information extraction technologies will become available. The
large number of information sources that are currently emerging and their
different levels of accessibility, reliability, and associated costs present a
complex information gathering coordination problem that a human decisionmaker
cannot possibly solve without high-level filtering of information. To be able to
exploit the great potential of the NII we propose to develop the next logical
step in automation of information gathering tasks: to organize information
gathering activity based on its marginal contribution to the quality of the
user's decision or task. This approach emphasizes the fact that information
gathering is an intermediate step of a decisionmaking process. This research
will provide a system with an explicit representation of the user's decision
model, so that information gathering activity can be organized on the basis of
its effect on the quality of the decision. To automate the information gathering
planning task, the research will investigate an innovative extension to the
standard value-of-information theory, that addresses the problems of information
reliability, retrieval costs, real-time operation, and uncertainty. When
operating under resource constraints (related to the cost of communication and
database access, limited computation power, and limited amount of time) this
approach should achieve a significant performance improvement over current
techniques
