This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a
molybdenum disilicide (MoSi2) nanoparticle coating with antibacterial properties
that are comparable to those imparted by silver nanoparticles, but with
significant lower cost. The approach is to deposit and optimize MoSi2
nanoparticles coating on substrates such as 316L stainless steel and polyvinyl
chloride (PVC). Antibacterial, wear and erosion performance of the coating will
be studied. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impacts of this project
will be the potential to provide low-cost solutions to meet the demands in
antibacterial applications. Given the problems of bacterial infections in
society, the development of cost-effective antibacterial films on metallic and
polymeric substrates that are significantly cheaper than current technologies
could potentially be disruptive and would have broad applications in health
care, food preparation and delivery, residence such as home kitchens and the
transportation sectors. &lt;br/&gt;
