DMI-9505382 Bai The objective of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase
II project is to develop and demonstrate zeolite based inorganic membrane
modules that carry out gas separations using a molecular sieving mechanism. In
Phase I, TDA Research Inc. (TDA) developed the techniques necessary to grow
dense continuous films of ZSM-5. ZSM-5 films were successfully grown on single
crystal silica and alumina substrates. The films were approximately 100 Am thick
and remained bonded to the substrate even when thermally cycled. ZSM-5 films
were then grown on porous silica discs. Before calcination, the films were found
to be gas tight. Following calcination, permeation measurements were carried out
using Ar, N2, i-C4H,o, and SF6 as the test gases. The membranes were adherent,
defect free, and the permeance data and calculated separation factors were
consistent with a molecular sieving mechanism. In the Phase II project, TDA will
develop techniques to coat Membralox alumina monoliths in order to develop
efficient cost effective inorganic gas separation membranes. In order to improve
the gas separation properties of the membranes, the pore sizes will be optimized
using chemical means. Nineteen channel Membralox alumina modules will be
modified with ZSM-5 and mordenite films, the pore sizes optimized for selected
gas separations, and the performance of the module will be evaluated. Zeolite
membranes have high separation ratios, extremely high fluxes, and can operate in
high temperature and aggressive chemical environments that would destroy
polymeric membranes. Therefore, zeolite modified alumina membranes will find
their first applications in gas separations under aggressive conditions. Other
potential high value applications include use as solid electrolytes in advanced
bakeries, as selective films in chemical sensors, and in advanced optical and
electronic devices.
