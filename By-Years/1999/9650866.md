This project introduces improved organic laboratory experiments, new analytical
laboratory projects, and enhanced undergraduate research experiences through the
use of hyphenated gas chromatography/Fourier-transform infrared (GC/FTIR)
spectrometry. Traditional macro- and micro-scale lab projects in organic
chemistry can benefit from shorter analysis times, reduced chemical waste, and
higher sensitivity when GC/FTIR replaces the traditional, sequential application
of these techniques. New lab projects are being developed for analytical
chemistry laboratories which examine both fundamental and applied aspects of
this important hyphenated technique. Finally, ongoing and planned research
projects involving undergraduate students also benefit from the use of GC/FTIR.
The implementation of this project can yield a meaningful enhancement of the
laboratory experiences for students. Beyond the practical benefits of time
efficiency and waste minimization, the use of such a modern, computer-controlled
analytical system provides valuable training to undergraduates, better
qualifying them for entry into the chemical workforce or advanced study
programs.
