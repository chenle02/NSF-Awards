This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project describes the
development of a Capillary Breakup Rheometer (CaBER) from a proven breadboard
design to a commercially viable instrument for both analytical and process
control functions. In this document the results of the successful completion of
a Phase I SBIR are outlined. The fundamental operation of the CaBER's component
parts is supported by data that validates the chosen components and verifies the
suitability of the design. In addition, sample data from model fluids will be
used to both illustrate the functionality of the CaBER and to highlight the
broad applicability of the instrument. Ongoing developments of the CaBER include
more robust software analysis, cheaper manufacturing costs and a more intuitive
user interface. These improvements will result in an instrument that is
invaluable to industry in both a research laboratory and a process control
environment. &lt;br/&gt; Currently there is only one commercially available
extensional rheometer and a handful of academic rheometer designs. By providing
a virtually unique tool for the determination of extensional viscosity in a
freely draining fluid thread, this instrument will fill a segment of the
instrumentation field that as here to fore been neglected.&lt;br/&gt;
