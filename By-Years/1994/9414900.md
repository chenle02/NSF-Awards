9414900 Wallace, Douglas The utility of using mitochondrial DNA variation to
assess genetic variation in human populations and to reconstruct human migration
patterns has been demonstrated by many studies, going back to the well-known
"Eve" hypothesis. For this reason, recent investigations of human origins in the
New World and Asia have used mtDNA variation to trace genetic links between
populations in these regions. While it is clear that New World populations are
derived from northern Asian populations, it is not so clear how many migrations
there were into the New World, and from how many source populations (variously
argued as one, three, or even four separate migrations). Analysis of northern
Asian populations is required to address these issues. This project to collect
and analyze samples from Siberian populations is timely and will provide
critical information for further investigation of these issues. The graduate
student has previous field experience in this area, and has established the
groundwork for collecting the samples, is well versed in the analytic
techniques, and has alrealy co- authored important papers in this area. The
project will return important and intersting information. ***
