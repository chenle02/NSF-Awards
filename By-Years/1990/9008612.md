This is a multidisciplinary effort involving metallurgy, physics, and chemistry
to explore a new approach to the processing of primary aluminum-lithium,
magnesium-lithium, and copper-lithium alloys. The process employs an impinging
lithium vapor on the metal surface with subsequent movement of the lithium into
the alloy by solid-state diffusion. The process is unique in that it introduces
the reactive element into the alloy in the final stages of the production of the
wrought product. Risks involved include the ability to reach a homogeneous
distribution of the diffusing lithium in a reasonably short time frame and
possible problems associated with unintended oxidation of the alloy during
processing.
