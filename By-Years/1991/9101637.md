This award supports the research of Professor H. Jacquet to work in automorphic
functions. Professor Jacquet intends to study certain period integrals related
to Gelfand triples using the relative trace formula. Modular forms arose out of
Non-Euclidean geometry in the middle of the nineteenth century. Both
mathematicians and physicists have thus long realized that many objects of
fundamental importance are non-Euclidean in their basic nature. This field is
principally concerned with questions about the whole numbers, but in its use of
geometry and analysis, it retains connection to its historical roots and thus to
problems in areas as diverse as gauge theory in theoretical physics and coding
theory in information theory.
