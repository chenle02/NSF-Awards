In recent years, computer systems designed to understand ordinary language have
improved rapidly. These advances depend in part on improving the language
resources that help systems recognize different senses of individual words and
how the parts of a sentence fit together. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;People
understand words largely by relating them to common situations; in 'She tossed
the letter across the table to Jerry', one recognizes that the main idea comes
from 'toss', and understands the different roles that 'she', 'the letter',
'across the table', and 'to Jerry' play. For the past fifteen years, the
FrameNet team at the International Computer Science Institute has been defining
situations, called semantic frames, and labeling examples with semantic roles on
the constituents of illustrative sentences. The FrameNet knowledge database
contains over 1,100 semantic frames, ranging from getting a job to curing a
disease, and almost 200,000 labeled sentences. Other researchers have created
software to automatically label sentences in open text based on FrameNet data;
these automatic semantic role labeling (ASRL) systems facilitate the automatic
recognition of events and their participants in documents ranging from news
stories and military reports.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award funds a one-week
workshop, September 9-13, 2013, introducing FrameNet to a wider range of
industry and academic participants. Speakers include the FrameNet team as well
as developers and users of ASRL systems. Topics covered range from implications
of FrameNet for protecting privacy to using frames in understanding metaphor.
Software developers have a hands-on coding session using the new FrameNet
library for NLTK; other participants perform hands-on frame definition and
annotation.
