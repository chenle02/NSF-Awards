The technique of X-ray crystallography is a powerful tool for the determination
of the molecular structure of compounds as diverse as small polypeptides and
complex metal clusters. When combined with the latest computer hardware and
software, the technique is becoming remarkably easy to put into practice. The
acquisition of X-ray crystallographic instrumentation markedly improves the
ability of chemists to cary out frontier research. The Department of Chemistry
at Washington University will use this award from the Chemistry Shared
Instrumentation Program to help acquire a single crystal X-ray diffractometer
and an associated computer system. The areas of chemical research that will be
enhanced by the acquisition include: 1) Synthesis and reactivity of pentadienyl-
metal-phosphine complexes 2) Molecular routes to phosphorous-rich clusters and
inorganic materials 3) Analogs of triplet carbenes, polyadamantalized molecules,
and metallasilacycles 4) Calixarenes as enzyme mimics 5) Structure-activity
relationships in bioorganic and bio- inorganic chemistry 6) Metal chelates as
diagnostic imaging agents.
