Understanding how the brain's neuronal networks perform computations remains a
difficult challenge. The interaction of large populations of neurons leads to a
complex repertoire of high-dimensional activity patterns that is difficult to
analyze. The dimension of the space of connectivity patterns among neurons is
likewise astronomical. To understand the behavior of neuronal networks, one
would like to analyze the relationship between these connectivity patterns and
neuronal activity. This project will develop an analytical approach to distill
both network connectivity and activity down to first and second order
statistics. This simplified framework will facilitate studying the relationships
between key features of connectivity and activity. The project centers around a
kinetic theory framework to represent populations of neurons by capturing the
first and second order statistics among the states of neurons. The evolution of
the kinetic theory equations will be determined by the first and second order
statistics of the connectivity. An approach to estimating these first and second
order connectivity statistics from experimental data will link the analysis with
biological networks.

The central objective of this project is the development of mathematical tools
to analyze the interrelationships between simplified descriptions of neuronal
network connectivity and simplified descriptions of neuronal activity. When
linked with experimental data, the analysis may provide insight into the
behavior of the neuronal networks underlying the brain's computations. As this
research may provide tools that help scientists better understand the effects of
the degradation of neural connections, such as in neurodegenerative disease, it
may eventually lead to strategies to mitigate or reverse these effects.
Integrated into the project is interdisciplinary training in conjunction with
the research as well as a plan to help young people discover exciting ways of
applying mathematics to biology, with the goal of inspiring them to pursue
further applications of mathematics to biology and other sciences.
