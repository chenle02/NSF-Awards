The September, 1985 Mexico earthquake provides potential data on actual injuries
in a major earthquake of the type expected in the U.S. Such data could help
modify current injury-prevention recommendations, which are currently too
general. A retrospective study of victims of the Mexico earthquake will be
conducted. This research, involving perspectives and methods from architecture,
structural engineering, and epidemiology, will be done to identify patterns of
injury and possible associations between specific types of injury and specific
physical settings and/or occupant characteristics. This interdisciplinary
investigation is expected to: (1) significantly increase the data base on human
injury in earthquakes, and (2) serve as a basis for the formulation of building-
specific planning, design, and occupant response guidelines.
