This research will be in the cohomology of arithmetic groups and the related
automorphic forms. It will concentrate on three areas. The first is the
generalized modular symbols and the ghost classes. They will be studied via the
representation theory of certain finite groups. The second is the congruences
between cohomology classes with different coefficient modules and between the
associated eigenvalues of the Hecke algebra. This leads to construction of
torsion cohomology from cusp forms. There is a conjectural link with large
representations of the Galois group of the rational numbers. The third area is a
computer-aided calculation of cohomology groups. This research contains an
interesting blend of algebra and analysis which is used to study questions in
number theory. This is an important and very deep study which the P.I. has been
very successful at in the past. He will undoubtedly continue to produce striking
results during the tenure of this award.
