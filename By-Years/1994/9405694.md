The overall aim is to examine the roles that signal transduction molecules play
in determining cell fate in sea urchin embryos. The specific aims are based on
experiments showing that agents that alter signalling through protein kinase C
(PKC) cause dramatic changes in cell fate, and that these same treatments cause
an increase in expression of a transcription factor homologous to the forkhead
(FH)class of transcription factors. The PI has cloned a number of cDNAs which
encode sea urchin PKCs. The PI intends to isolate more cDNAs encoding PKC
isotypes and study the temporal and spatial expression of the different PKC
isotypes during sea urchin development. In addition, the PI has designed methods
to alter the activity of PKC in vivo, and he will use these methods to study PKC
function. These studies will make use of inhibitory pseudosubstrate peptides
which will be injected into sea urchin eggs or individual blastomeres of early
sea urchin embryos. The effects on cell fate will be assayed using a variety of
tissue specific markers of differentiation. Second, the PI will use a sea urchin
genomic DNA fragment encoding a FH domain to isolate cDNAs encoding FH
transcription factors, and he will study their spatial expression during
development and with and without lithium and TPA. The PI will also isolate
genomic clones containing FH genes as a first step in linking their expression
to PKC activity.
