Males and females of many organisms differ in size. The explanation usually
assumed, but rarely tested, for that difference deals with different roles in
reproduction. However, these researchers have gathered preliminary data which
indicates that the differences may often be due to evolutionary pressures
dealing with survival rather than reproduction. The proximate goals of this
project are to determine the relative contribution of evolutionary forces
(primarily selection) that act upon reproduction compared to those that act upon
survival. This project will also identify the nature of those evolutionary
forces whenever possible. Differences between males and females of many
organisms are of both basic and applied interest. Contributing to the
understanding of the actual mechanisms that have caused these differences will
be an important step. Currently there is a great deal of controversy about the
relative roles of environmental and evolutionary forces as sources of
differences between males and females. This project will provide important data
that will help the debate.
