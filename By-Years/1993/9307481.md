The objective of the researched work is to develop compact, efficient equipment
capable of generating ozone at very high concentrations for the semiconductor
manufacturing and materials processing industry. Emerging process technologies
using ozone chemistry have created the need for such equipment. A novel
experimental generator, constructed in phase I, has produced high concentration
ozone at three times the yield (efficiency) of conventional generators. Full
scale generators incorporating this novel design are expected to be one-forth
the size of conventional generators. The four goals for the phase II research
are construction of a new laboratory scale generator which incorporates the
design improvements suggested by the phase I research utilization of the
laboratory scale generator to explore several promising approaches to obtaining
additional yield improvements, design and construction of a commercial scale
generator, added design of modular ozone generation systems with a nominal
production capacity of 2 to 8 kgm/day at 10 to 15 percent concentration. If
successful, this research will lead to the development of a critical
manufacturing resource for use in the fabrication of the next generation of
semiconductor devices.
