In this project supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic
Chemistry Program, Richard D. Adams of the University of South Carolina will
investigate the synthesis, structures, bonding and reactivity of new
heteronuclear tran- sition metal carbonyl cluster compounds. Transition metal
cluster compounds may be models for metal surfaces which are catalytically
active and the platinum containing clusters, which are the principal thrust of
this work, may be related to conventional petroleum reforming catalysts. The
synthesis of the platinum clusters will involve the reaction of
bis(cyclooctadiene)platinum(O) with various metalcarbonyls of iron, ruthenium,
osmium, molybdenum and tungsten. Chiral clusters will be synthesized which
contain, for example, three different metals and a sulfur in a tetrahedral
structure, and the behavior of these compounds as stereospecific catalysts will
be investigated. X-ray crystallography will be used to structurally characterize
the new compounds.
