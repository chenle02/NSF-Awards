The High Pressure Rapid Freezer (HPRF) will be used to freeze samples of
relatively large dimensions without the formation of large ice crystals, making
it feasible to study complex cellular systems, tissues, using rapid
cryofixation. This opens new frontiers in the exploration of rapidly fixed
eukaryotic organisms. Coupled with freeze substitution, rapid freezing will
allow study of labile structures, short lived events, and other advances over
conventional preparations already shown when single cell suspensions have been
studied using this approach. Projects will use the superior characteristics of
freeze substituted tissues prepared with the HPRF to investigate short lived
events (neural tissue alterations due to ion concentrations, secretion in
salivary glands of ticks, secretion of calcium in plant cells), labile
structures (oocyte cytoskeleton, cotton fiber cytoskeleton), osmotic-sensitive
structures (mitochondria in chemotherapy, symbiotic interfaces),
immunolocalization of various antigens (cytskeleton, cytokinin, anticancer
agents), and symbiology between dinoflagellates and sea anemone, and plants and
nitrogen-fixing bacteria. The project involves research in several regional
institutions, and will examine plant, animal, and microbial systems that have
been recalcitrant to cryopreservation using previously available equipment. The
instrument will be the only one in the southeastern United States, and would be
made available to qualified regional users.
