We propose to conduct a study of the sources due to mesoscale variability of
gravity waves at mesospheric heights. The mesospheric wind data for this study
will be obtained from an HF radar installed on the island of Kauai, Hawaii in
September of 1990. Gravity wave activity observed from this radar will be
examined with reference to possible frontal, convective, and jet stream wave
sources. We intend to use synoptic, radiosonde, and satellite imaging data in
the search for these sources. We will also conduct a critical examination of the
spaced antenna drift (SAD) technique in regard to measuring winds in the middle
atmosphere.
