This award provides travel funds for students and young faculty to travel to an
important meeting in the field of microelectromechanical engineering. The
meeting is Transducers '91, which will be held in San Francisco, CA, in June of
1991. These travel funds will make it possible for many graduate students to
prepare and present papers at this conference, and it will enable young faculty
beginning their research careers to attend an important meeting. Participation
by students and young faculty at previous meetings has been highly beneficial
both to the people involved and the field. This field is very young, and not
many researchers are well established with research support. Thus, these travel
grants play a key role in the development of the field.
