Abstract Narrative This is a project in historical linguistics, an effort to
reconstruct a key portion of the grammar of Proto-Tibeto- Burman, the ancestral
language of a family of several hundred present-day languages spoken in Asia.
The investigator is also attempting to reconstruct comparable grammatical
systems for a number of the intermediate languages between the parent language
and the present languages, and to delineate the historical development of the
family and the proper sub- grouping of the present-day languages. The results of
the project will constitute a significant contribution to our understanding of
the early history of that part of the world, and also to our general
understanding of the processes of linguistic change. The Principal Investigator
is an internationally renowned authority on the languages of the Tibeto-Burman
family, as well as on some of the languages of native North America. He has been
enormously productive, and his work is recognized as thorough, rigorous, and
insightful. He is entirely well qualified to undertake the proposed research and
carry it through to a successful conclusion.
