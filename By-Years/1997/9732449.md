9732449&lt;br/&gt;Prentiss&lt;br/&gt;This research focuses on three projects
that utilize light to manipulate particles. The first uses spatially dependent
optical pumping to create nanostructures on surfaces. The second uses a series
of nanowires created by lithography to deflect the motion of helium atoms. The
third uses optical tweezers in the analysis of adhesion properties of biological
systems.&lt;br/&gt;
