The proposed research involves research in Nuclear Phenomenology, Particle
Phenomenology, String Theory and Cosmology. We propose to develop the most
general Nucleon -Nucleon parity violating potential using an effective field
theory approach. We propose to study virtual Compton scattering, which is an
important tool for understanding hadronic structure. This will be done using
light-cone methods. We propose to investigate higher-order terms in chiral
perturbation theory and diagrams for electroweak processes, such as the so-
called penguin diagrams. Numerical lattice gauge calculations are being
improved, and can now treat a number of nonperturbative effects, such as QCD
corrections to electroweak decays. We propose to use these chiral perturbation
theory techniques to augment present lattice gauge calculations. We will also
study charm-anticharm meson mixing, a CP-violating phenomenon which is of
current experimental interest. We intend to study the fate of tachyonic
instabilities in string theory by studying topological solitons for orbifold
tachyons.
