Abstract

Award: DMS-0504792 Principal Investigator: Lei Ni

The principle investigator proposes to study the interplay between the geometry
and the analysis on complete Kaehler manifolds. The focus will be the linear and
nonlinear parabolic equations on complete manifolds with various curvature
assumptions. These equations includes the linear heat equation and Laplacian
operator, harmonic mapping heat equation, mean curvature flow, Hermitian-
Einstein flow, Ricci/Kaehler-Ricci flow, etc. These equations have various
physical and geometric origins. But they share many common features such as
geometric symmetries and identities, monotonicity formulae, entropy like
considerations, differential Harnack (also called Li-Yau-Hamilton) inequalities.
They also connect to each other in various ways. By studying them together, more
light is shed on all of them.

Differential Geometry is the study of the relationship between the geometry of a
space, a manifold in the mathematical notion, and the analytic properties of the
functions and the differential equations, on the underlying space. Geometric
analysis is the study of the overall geometric and topological properties of a
space by piecing together the local information. Since the spaces are usually
curved ones, the ``curvature" was introduced to measure the deviation from the
Euclidean space and the techniques are often `nonlinear' even dealing with a
linear problem. The study of this area of mathematics has close connection with
the general relativity and string theory in physics. The applications can be
found in the study of thestructure of complicated molecules, liquid-gas
boundaries, and even the large scale networks. This project on studying the
Kaehler manifolds via linear and nonlinear parabolic equations will enhance the
understanding of geometric analysis, linear and nonlinear partial differential
equations, algebraic geometry and mathematical physics.
