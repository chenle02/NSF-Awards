This project treats algebraic (and analytic) actions on affine varieties from
the viewpoint of smooth (differentiable) transformation groups. The subject of
smooth transformation groups has been strongly influenced by the following two
central problems: LINEARITY PROBLEM. Which groups act nonlinearly on affine
space of some dimension? (An action is linear if it is conjugate to an action
defined by a representation of the group.) FIXED POINT PROBLEM. Which groups act
without fixed points on affine space of some dimension? The tools used to settle
these problems and the further problems they generated have been important
themes in the field of smooth transformation groups. During the last few years
researchers from algebraic transformation groups as well as those from smooth
transformation groups have recognized the importance of these two questions in
the algebraic category, and in that case the groups dealt with should be
reductive (which includes as a special case the finite groups). Petrie will
continue his work in this direction, bringing topological methods to bear on
algebraic questions.
