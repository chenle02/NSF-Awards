The investigator studies combinatorial, probabilistic and analytic concepts,
theorems and algorithms for analyzing stochastic models coming from social
choice theory, from the theory of biological networks and from theoretical
computer science.

The proposal aims to provide rigorous models answering questions from molecular
biology, from the theory of voting and from theoretical computer science. Some
of the biologically motivated problems we study include: Which biological
networks can be reconstructed from genetic data? How can they be efficiently
reconstructed? What genealogical relations between individuals can be recovered
from their genomes in an efficient manner? In the theory of voting the questions
we address focus on minimizing the ability to manipulate voting and ranking
methods and to increase their robustness against voting errors.
