This planning project examines the potential for systematic research on the
impacts of national security controls on the conduct of research and the
dissemination of unclassified scientific and technical information. The
objectives of the proposed assessment are (1) to determine the extent to which
scientists and engineers understand the restrictions; (2) to assess how
scientists and engineers attempt to balance the values of openness with
protection of the national interest; and (3) to document the impact of such
restrictions on research and the dissemination of scientific and technical
information. In this planning phase, a team of consultants with expertise about
the substantive issues, the methodological aspects of the proposed assessment,
and the perspectives of concerned constituencies, will assist the project staff
in addressing the conceptual and technical difficulties associated with
undertaking such an assessment. Project staff will circulate a preliminary
discussion paper to the team, whose members will meet to define and refine the
research questions and design. Staff will then circulate a draft of the agreed-
on research instruments and plans for data analysis to team members and two
independent consultants for further refinement. Following this work, AAAS will
submit a final report, including the key research questions, instruments, and
plans for analysis to NSF. The report will also address uses which the
assessment could serve. Issues of openness and secrecy in the communication of
scientific and technical information are central both to scientific progress and
human well-being. Little systematic research has been done to them. The project
sponsor, staff and planning group members are very well qualified to begin these
efforts. This project should provide useful results by itself and stimulate
future efforts in this field. For these reasons, support in the amount of
$10,000 is recommended.
