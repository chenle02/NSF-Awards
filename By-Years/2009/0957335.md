The Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry (MSN) program of the
Division of Chemistry will support the research program of Prof. Mostafa El
Sayed of Georgia Institute of Technology. Prof. El Sayed's research program
focuses on the development of plasmonic nanocatalysts, a new generation of
materials at the frontier of the field of chemical catalysis. Prof. El Sayed and
his students will examine the effects of two new properties of nanoparticles on
the rates of chemical and photo-chemical reactions: 1) the cage effect on the
rates of chemical reactions when they occur inside a nano-cage and nano-frame
type nanoparticle; 2) the effect of plasmonic fields and other properties of
nanogold on the rates of some chemical and photochemical reactions. The project
will provide excellent educational opportunity for trainees desiring to work at
the forefront of catalysis research.
