In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry
Program of the Chemistry Division, Craig Hawker of the University of California
at Santa Barbara will develop strategies for utilizing ketene chemistry as a
synthetic tool for creating modular polymer and soft materials. The approach is
to discover reaction conditions for the low temperature, quantitative generation
of ketenes from Meldrum's acid and its derivatives. The precursor moieties would
then be placed at the side chains, chain ends and interiors of polymers and on
surfaces in order to explore the modular chemical functionalization of such
substrates, exploiting the rich chemistry of ketenes. The broader impacts
involve advancing teaching, training and learning through the development of a
course on communication and presentation design, organizing an ACS Symposium on
"click" chemistry approaches to polymer and materials synthesis, and funding
local minority undergraduate students to attend the Dow Foundation Lecture
Series.

This work will expand the repertoire of chemistry that can be used to create new
polymers and materials. The results of these studies could have many important
long term impacts on a variety of applications and industries in which polymeric
materials are important, including fine chemicals, coatings, electronics, and
biotechnology.
