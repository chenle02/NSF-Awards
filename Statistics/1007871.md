The current proposal builds upon the P.I.'s experitize in variable selection and
summarizes her current and future directions in the development of Bayesian
methodologies. In particular, the P.I. plans to consider extensions to
generalized models and to models that allow arbitrary nonlinear associations of
a set of variables to a response. Inferential strategies for the proposed models
are more challenging than the typical linear settings addressed by the P.I. in
previous work. In addition, nonparametric priors will be investigated with the
purpose of sharpening the selection and relaxing distributional assumptions of
the models, such as those on random effects and on the error terms, often
questionable in real-data applications.

Methodologies developed through this project carry potential for significant
impact in statistics and in applied fields in which high-dimension/low-sample-
size data arise. Applications to data arising from interdisciplinary
collaborations will demonstrate the practical usefulness of the proposed
methods. In particular, the P.I. plans to build upon her recent interest in
brain imaging data by investigating applications and extensions of Bayesian
methods for variable selection to generalized linear and mixed models currently
used for the analysis of such data. The broader impacts of this proposal are in
its educational and training objectives, in its efforts to disseminate results
and in the collaborative nature of the proposed research. The P.I. maintains an
updated webpage on her research activities where papers and accompanying
software are posted in a timely manner.
