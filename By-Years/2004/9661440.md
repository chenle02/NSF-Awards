*** ABSTRACT 9661440 Prohaska This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
project will develop a low-cost, on-line, integrated multiple-parameter gas
sensor for reformer and fuel-cell-powered electric engine control with the aim
of optimizing engine safety and efficiency. Initially, the multiple-parameter
gas sensors are proposed for engines operating on a methanol reformate. Where
H2, CO, methanol and other electrochemically oxidizable or reducible gases are
present, the sensor design and measurement concept will also be applicable to
engines which operate on distillate fuels or natural gas to power hybrid
electric vehicles or building and utility equipment. Feasibility of the
miniaturized sensor design and monitoring concept will be demonstrated during
Phase I for hydrogen, methanol and carbon monoxide concentration measurements in
the fuel stream. The electrochemical cell will be based on Giner's membrane
electrode assembly techniques, using polymer electrolytes in combination with
thick-film electrodes. During Phase I, collaboration with industry and research
laboratories actually involved in reformer and fuel cell development will be
sought in preparation for the Phase II product development program and for
funding of Phase III product engineering and manufacturing transfer. The
anticipated products resulting from this project are reliable, robust, stable,
and inexpensive electrochemical gas sensors for use in fuel-cell-powered
electric engines. Reformer efficiency control, fuel cell poison protection, and
emission monitoring will be the main applications of these devices. A
multimillion-dollar market is expected from this market segment. It is
envisioned that these devices may also have broad application in environmental
monitoring and industrial process control. ***
