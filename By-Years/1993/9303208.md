9303208 Wand This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II Project
deals with the design, synthesis, formulation and evaluation of new
ferroelectric liquid crystals (FLC) which are low in both viscosity and
birefringence. These materials will be used in high speed, multistate electro-
optic and flat panel display device applications.. The specific approach will be
to synthesize new materials with high degrees of fluorination or dioxaborinane
cores which will be low in both viscosity and birefringence. The long range
objectives of the research are to increase understanding of the correlation of
molecular structure with physical properties of new FLC phases. ***
