The Alliance for Graduate Education in Mississippi (AGEM) proposes to continue
and expand its comprehensive, state-wide consortial program for enhancing the
entry into and successful completion of minority students in STEM1 graduate
programs. AGEM will continue to be led by the University of Mississippi (UM) and
will involve the three other Ph.D. granting universities in the state2 and
informal partnerships with several regional colleges (including several HBCUs3).
The program will build upon the solid accomplishments of the first round of
funding and on the record of collaboration between institutions. Because the
population of Mississippi is 37% African-American and because there are several
HBCUs in this region, a primary focus of AGEM is the training of African-
American graduate students, with an emphasis on preparing these students for
academic careers in STEM areas. UM has made a major commitment to increasing the
access of its graduate programs to minority students. UM, working with its
partnering institutions, has aligned resources and has coordinated the current
partnership to create a comprehensive approach to the recruitment, mentoring,
retention, and degree completion of minority students, with counseling aimed at
encouraging academic careers. Thus the entire program addresses the broader
impacts imperative of the NSF AGEP program. The specific goal of the first five-
year grant was to triple the number of minority students who received STEM
doctoral degrees (triple, as compared to the previous five-year baseline) from
the four doctoral-degree granting institutions in the state. From our baseline
of 13 minority STEM PhDs produced from 1993-1997, the AGEM program has seen an
increase to 48 minority STEM doctoral graduates produced from 1998-2003. Another
goal of the AGEM program was to bring about a systemic change in attitudes of
faculty, administrators, and students with regard to minority pipeline issues.
Evidence is presented for such systemic changes. The current five- year program
has made a significant start toward enhancing minority student success in STEM
graduate education. Continuation of the mission is imperative. A thorough
analysis of programmatic successes, as well as an analysis of those academic
disciplines where more can be done, has been conducted. New strategies will be
presented to address targeted areas. The intellectual merit criterion of NSF is
met via the research produced by the students as they pursue their degrees, by
the future research produced by these doctorates when they enter the
professoriate or other research positions, and by our studies of the factors
that lead to success for underrepresented minorities.
