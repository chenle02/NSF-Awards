This award supports a study to use biological indicators, namely fossil records
of cryptoendolithic microbial colonization of Beacon sandstone and
microorganisms in permafrost, to reconstruct paleoclimate history of the Late
Plio-Pleistocene period in the McMurdo Dry Valleys. The work will attempt to
address the stabilist versus the dynamicist view of the Antarctic ice sheet
using past and present occurences of distributions of climatically sensitive
living and fossilized biological indicators in the Dry Valleys region.
Specifically, soil derived from Beacon Sandstone and permafrost cores will be
analyzed for the occurence of living and fossilized microbial groups whose
viability zones are already known or will be determined by mapping the
distribution of present occurences. This information will be integrated with the
distribution of characteristic exfoliation patterns (recent and fossil) caused
by microbial activity to reconstruct relative age sequences. The sedimentology
of the permafrost cores will be characterized and integrated with
microbiological and chronostratigraphic data. Absolute chronologies will be
provided (where appropriate) by carbon-14, thermoluminesence dating and analysis
of cosmogenic radionuclides.
