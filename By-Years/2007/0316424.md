The focus of this research is the synthesis and study of a series of macrocycles
that consist of urea groups linked by rigid spacers. The hydrogen bonding
interactions between the cyclic urea monomers drives their self-assembly into
tubular structures that contain sizeable homogeneous tubular channels. A number
of analytical, biochemical and physical chemistry methods will be used to
evaluate the success of these assembled nanotubes. Materials with tubular
channels are sought for applications as sensors, templates for directed
reactions, and in ion and small molecule transport systems.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this new award, the Organic and Macromolecular
Chemistry Program is supporting the research and educational efforts of Dr.
Linda Shimizu of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University
of South Carolina, Columbia, where she is a Research Assistant Professor. Dr.
Shimizu will focus her research on tubular assemblies, which have recently been
shown to have antibacterial properties. Undergraduate and graduate students
trained in this program will receive a broad multidisciplinary background that
will empower them to pursue a wide range of scientific careers. This award also
supports the enhancement and continuation of the chemistry outreach program that
fosters interactions between K-12 students and teachers and skilled scientific
researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
