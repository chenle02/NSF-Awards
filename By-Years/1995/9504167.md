9504167 Hanan Hanan is the PI on this request for 12 months of support for each
of two years for postdoctoral Magenheim to prefect the technique of measuring
chlorine isotopes in basalts. With this technique Magenheim will determine the
effects of assimilation of oceanic crust on chlorine isotopes and evaluate the
contribution of hotspots in chlorine isotopes in MORBs. This may be useful in
determining the amount of crust that has been recycled into the mantle. It could
also be used to determine what part of the subducted crust is returned to the
surface in back-arc volcanism. This is an emerging technique that Magenheim was
instrumental in developing and which has great potential for telling us about
major geological processes. This project is part of the RIDGE initiative (Ridge
Interdisciplinary Global Experiment). ***
