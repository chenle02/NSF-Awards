Chorus waves are naturally occurring whistler waves and are nearly monochromatic
and discrete in time. Hiss waves are broadband and incoherent. This proposal
addresses the relationship between these two types of waves and in particular
will evaluate the idea that chorus waves evolve into hiss as they propagate. The
proposal will use ground based instruments, laboratory experiments and numerical
ray tracing. This research is important for magnetospheric physics because both
types of wave emissions are thought to control the population of energetic
electrons. &lt;br/&gt;This is a CAREER proposal and as such it has an extensive
education and outreach element. It includes training of K-12 students as well as
undergraduate and graduate students. It will involve the use of Capstone Senior
Design projects to develop applications for smart phones. These waves are in the
audio frequency range and can be received and recorded by using smart phone
technology.
