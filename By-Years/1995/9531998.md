9531998 Engel This award is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER)
project. The objective is to investigate the resin transfer molding of class,
two dimensional fiber reinforced plastic grids for use in reinforced concrete
panels such as curtain walls and bridge decks. The investigation will focus on:
specifying the perform architecture and grid pattern for the resin transfer mold
production of a two-dimensional fiber reinforced plastic grid and test
performance in panel under transverse loads. ***
