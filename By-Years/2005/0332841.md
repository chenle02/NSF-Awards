When educators read the AAUW Educational Foundation's Tech Savvy: Educating
Girls in the New Computer Age (2000) report they generally have two responses,
We must change the way we teach, and then How can I change the way I teach? The
report highlights the critical need to encourage girls in technology from early
childhood through middle and high school. It was instrumental in creating a
movement to change technology education. Tech Savvy summarizes research that
shows that girls do not perceive technology as interesting nor technology
careers as appealing. The way technology is currently taught often dissuades
them. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new Tech Savvy video and teacher's resource guide
were designed as tools for educators, parents, students, and community-oriented
professionals to change girls' experience of technology. AAUW Educational
Foundation will use its national network of 100,000 members (parents, educators,
students), 1,300 Branches, and 600 College/University member institutions to
distribute copies of the video, guide and the report. In addition, the video
will be broadcast via Fairfax County Public School satellite television network
and others. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dissemination project will leverage the
value recognized in the original Tech Savvy report and intensify its reach, with
the ultimate aim of closing the gender gap in technology education and in the
information technology workforce. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
