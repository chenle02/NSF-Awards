A four-day workshop on parallel knowledge systems and logic programming will be
held in Tokyo, Japan, during September 18-21, 1990. The workshop will be
coordinated jointly by Argonne National Laboratory and by the Japanese Institute
for New Generation Computer Technology (ICOT). This workshop is a follow-up to
the one held in October, 1989 at Argonne National Laboratory. The purpose of the
meeting is to provide an informal basis for exchange of ideas between U.S. and
Japanese researchers on topics relating to logic programming, parallelism, and
knowledge systems. It will also provide a medium for demonstration of key system
and language principles. Approximately 15 presentations will be given, as well
as a number of demonstrations, by participants of both countries. Discussion
sessions will provide time to collect comments and ideas on future direction of
the fields represented. Overall, the on-going cooperative spirit between the two
countries will be enhanced by this opportunity to convene.
