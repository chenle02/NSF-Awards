The Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division of the National Science
Foundation will support the research program of Professor Francisco Zaera at the
University of California, Riverside. Dr. Zaera and his students will examine the
hypothesis that the structure of the metallic catalyst surface affects the
selectvitiy of the reaction even for mild catalytic hydrocarbon conversions such
as the hydrogenation and isomerization of heavy olefins and the oxidation of
glycerol. Kinetic investigations using an in situ nanoliter sized reactor,
coupled with infrared spectroscopic investigations of the surface intermediates
will be used to probe these ideas. The fundamental understanding obtained from
these studies will impact the design and utilization of heterogeneous catalysts
for industrial processes. New experimental methodology will be developed in the
application of the nanoliter reactor technology. Collaboration with research
groups in Latin America will continue, and increased participation by students
in underrepresented groups, Hispanics in particular, will be pursued.
