9421856 Evans The National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the
National Science foundation have established a competitive awards program for
participation in a network of collaborative research in plant biology. The focus
of the research will be on plant signal transduction and cell differentiation in
response to environmental stimuli, especially gravity. The goal of the program
is to encourage a coordinated interactive approach to studying important
problems in plant biology with the conviction that collaborative research
activities between a number of network participants with complementary strengths
in related research areas will have a synergistic effect on scientific advances
in these areas. This award supports activities that help coordinate laboratories
selected to participate in this program over the 5-year tenure of the network
grants. ***
