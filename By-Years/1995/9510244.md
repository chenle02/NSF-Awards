9510244 Bach The goal of this project is to study the computational complexity
of number-theoretic problems. Algorithms for solving these problems are useful
in the design of systems for random number generation, cryptography, and
computer algebra. In addition, many of the classic questions in complexity
theory (such as whether randomization helps in efficient computation) are
motivated by computational number theory. Our proposed investigations fall into
three categories: a) Computations and explicit bounds in analytic number theory.
b) The design and analysis of number-theoretic algorithms. c) Constructive
techniques in algebraic geometry and commutative algebra.
