The objective of this research is to construct a physical- based plasticity
theory that takes account for the plastic anisotrophy due to large plastic
deformation and rotation as well as to study necking and failure criteria due to
the growth of material inhomogeneity and/or geometric imperfection in sheet
metal forming processes. The plasticity theory will be implemented into a finite
element code to simulate sheet metal forming processes and the computational
results can directly indicate the formability of the sheet metal forming
processes. This project will allow the more efficient calculation of
deformations in sheet metal forming, allowing industry to design and build more
efficient sheet metal forming dies.
