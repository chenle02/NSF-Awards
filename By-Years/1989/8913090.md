This is an AIT.CCNAA collaborative joint seminar on mechanical design. This
seminar is organized by Dr. Terry Shoup, Santa Clara University and Dr. Hong.Sen
Yan, National Cheng Kung University. This is an important subject in
engineering. The participants to this seminar are the top rated scientists in
design research in both the U.S. and Taiwan. Mechanical design is a field which
has been expanding rapidly in Taiwan, and one to which the U.S. scientific and
engineering communities need to pay particular attention. This seminar will
enable U.S. scientists in mechanical design to understand the present state and
future direction of this field in Taiwan, and collaborative research between
scientists in the U.S. and Taiwan in this field.
