9728563 Sussman The main objective of this research project is to identify the
proteins required for the uptake of potassium into plants, from the soil. Gene
coning and sequencing experiments have identified key candidates for he uptake
proteins. Using the sequencing information, mutant plants will be obtained to
provide a direct test for the protein's proposed potassium transport functions.
