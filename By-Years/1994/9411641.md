With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program Professor Menger at Emory
University will study the hydrophobic association of various long-chain organic
materials containing carboxylate, amine, imidazole, hydroxyl, and metal
functionalities into complex assemblages called "clumps." These substances will
be screened for potential catalytic activity in water toward a variety of
organic reactions. Methods related to combinatorial chemistry will be used to
identify clumps that exhibit catalytic activity approaching that of enzymes.
These methods will be extended to the study of substances bonded to colloidal
gold and to substances bonded to polymers. This study will measure the ability
of a mixture of organic molecules containing long chains of chemically bonded
carbon atoms and other reactive atoms to associate together in water solution to
form microscopic spherical balls called clumps. These clumps are expected to
behave in a manner similar to naturally occurring enzymes. Because organic
reactions do not occur readily in water, these clumps may help to enhance the
reaction of organic compounds in a water environment. This could help to reduce
the amount of hazardous wastes generated from industrial production of organic
compounds that normally require organic solvents that must be recycled or
burned.
