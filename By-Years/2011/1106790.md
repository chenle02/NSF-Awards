The goal of this project is to establish a systematic asymptotic theory for
estimates of large dimensional covariance matrices in time series; a fundamental
problem in high-dimensional inference. In particular, the investigator plans to
study properties of sample covariances and sample covariance matrices for
stationary processes; deal with consistent estimation of covariance matrices of
stationary processes and its applications in prediction and other problems; and
explore non-Gaussian features of random processes by estimating higher order
cumulant tensors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Covariance matrices play a fundamental
role in various fields including environmental science, engineering, economics
and finance. Estimation of covariance matrices is needed in analyzing, testing,
monitoring and predicting of seismic, economic and financial and other time
series. Results developed from this project can provide a theoretical foundation
for estimation of covariance matrices and can potentially improve time series
processing algorithms that are used in various applications.
