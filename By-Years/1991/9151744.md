This project will introduce the capabilities of 200 MHz Fourier transform
nuclear magnetic resonance (FT-NMR) spectroscopy into our courses in organic
chemistry and advanced experimental techniques. In organic chemistry the
instrument will be used for structural analyses via proton and carbon-13
spectroscopy. The greater sensitivity of FT-NMR to characterize products will
find use in the microscale organic laboratory. Experiments will be introduced to
increase student awareness of NMR applications. The high magnetic field and
chemical shift reagents will be utilized to resolve spectra of complex molecules
and optical stereoisomer mixtures. In the advanced course a variety of
experiments will be offered which illustrate and explain currently used NMR
techniques such as nuclear spin decoupling and measurement of nuclear relaxation
times within a molecular structure. Reactions of organic ligands in transition
metal coordination compounds will be monitored via carbon-13 observation.
