One of the fundamental results in computational complexity theory is the linear
speed-up theorem for turing machines. This theorem states that for every
multitape turing machine of time complexity T(n)&gt;n and for every constant
c&gt;0 there is a multitape machine that accepts the same language in time
cT(n). One question is, could linear speed-up be a pathological artifact of the
turing machine model? This project involves the determination of which
properties are not artifacts of turing machines. Specifically, the computational
complexity of the random access machine (RAM) and two related models, the
storage modification machine (SMM) and the parallel random access machine (PRAM)
will be investigated.
