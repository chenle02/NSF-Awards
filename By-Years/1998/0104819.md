Despite a widespread belief that phosphorus (P) availability poses a strong
constraint on ecosystem dynamics in tropical forests, direct tests of this
belief are rare. Furthermore, most studies that have addressed this issue have
focused on P limitation to the plant community; virtually none have addressed
the possibility that the microbial community is P limited. Mr. Cleveland's
dissertation research to date suggests that decomposition of carbon in a lowland
tropical rainforest in southwestern Costa Rica is P limited, although the extent
of this limitation is still unknown. Early findings have revealed that in spite
of the apparent P limitation to microbial processes at this site, the production
and activity of phosphatases, enzymes responsible for the mineralization of
organic P, are relatively low. This Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant will
support experiments that address the following two basic questions: 1. Does
phosphorus availability limit the decomposition of native carbon in moist
tropical forests? and 2. At a site where the mineralization of organic P should
be important in offsetting deficiencies in available inorganic P, is phosphatase
activity directly limited by the availability of another element?
