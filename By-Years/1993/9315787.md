9315787 Schuster The Pis will develop a new radar inversion method for
extracting the sub-surface conductivity and dielectric distribution from
transient radar data. The radar experimental geometries will be both the surface
source receiver configuration and the crosswell configuration (i.e., radar
sources in one well and electromagnetic receivers in an adjacent well). The
first step of this new method, denoted as Maxwell Equation Tomography or MET is
the computation of radar electrograms by finite-difference solution to the full
2-D or 2.5-D Maxwell's equations. The second step is to compute both a radargram
waveform misfit function and a first arrival traveltime misfit function.
