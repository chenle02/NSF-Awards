The acquisition of the FT-IR spectrophotometer allowed the introduction and
development of microscale laboratory experiments at all levels of the chemistry
curriculum. Continued conversion to and an increase in the variability of
microscale experiments occurred in the organic laboratory sequence. The
instrumentation strengthened the development of the organic laboratory projects
which have greatly stimulated the students' interests in chemical and biological
research. New experiments were introduced and modified for the physical and
integrated laboratories. The interest in polymers and surface analysis was
further stimulated by observing spectral properties of materials using the FT-IR
reflectance accessory. Greater student-faculty interaction in the area of
research (polymer films, molybdenum complexes, products resulting from
mechanistic studies) were fostered by the acquisition of the FT-IR
spectrophotometer. Construction and use of the spectral libraries gave the
students opportunities to gain skills in chemical analysis used in the
environmental analysis sector. The institution contributed to this project in an
amount equal to the NSF funds.
