This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop and
implement a completely novel chatter control scheme. In many machine tools,
fluid bearings (also known as hydrostatic and hydrodynamic bearings) are gaining
popularity. The project will apply low-power piezo actuators to modulate the
input flow rate of the fluid into the spindle housing. By carefully computing
the actuator voltages, we can generate the correct amount of input flow rate so
that the chatter effects will be minimized. There are several advantages
associated with this new approach. First, since the fluid pressure is directly
acting on the spindle unit, the response will be fast, direct, and effective.
Second, since piezo is used to control the flow rate, not the whole-spindle
housing, only very low power amplifiers are needed to regulate the flow. Third,
the overall chatter control cost will be significantly reduced as commercial
off-the-shelf, rather than custom designed, piezo actuators can be used. Fourth,
no significant modification of the machine is needed because four small piezo
actuators will be inserted near the inlets. Only a modest change in mechanical
design needs to be done.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial application will
provide a practical approach to chatter control. Chatter is the primary limiting
factor in metal removal rate in machine tools. To a first order approximation, a
machine tool with twice the metal removal rate is worth twice as much. This
technology will be useful for other types of machine tools such as milling,
lathe, and boring.
