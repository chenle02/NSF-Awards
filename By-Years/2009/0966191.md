This project is increasing the number of local high school students pursuing
bachelors degrees in STEM fields. Seven new students in each of the first two
years of the project are receiving scholarships for four years, subject to
sufficient progress towards an undergraduate STEM degree. S-STEM Scholars enroll
in a special First Year Seminar. Seminar instructors utilize relevant Hope
College support programs to provide academic and professional development events
over the entire four year experience to inform students of opportunities that
enable them to successfully prepare for and enter a STEM career. Additionally,
S-STEM Scholars serve as role models for other students in the Holland area who
may lack the confidence to pursue undergraduate STEM degrees.
