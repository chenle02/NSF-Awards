Technical Narrative: This U.S.-Turkey collaborative research project involving
a cultural anthropologist from University of California at Davis and an
agricultural economist from Ege University in Boronova, Turkey will provide a
comprehensive study of the biological diversity of wheat in Turkey. Project
funding will enable Dr. Emin Isikli of Ege University to participate in a survey
of wheat farmers in Turkey and then spend six months in the laboratory of Dr.
Stephen Brush at UC Davis analyzing and interpreting the survey data. This
collaborative research project will study how farmers use different types of
wheat, relate the variation in use to socioeconomic and environmental variation,
and establish conservation procedures to maintain the diversity that exists.
This project is important because understanding why farmers maintain diverse
crop types will aid in designing policies to encourage diversity, thereby,
conserving the genetic substance of diverse plants for the future. This project
in biological diversity fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific
knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States and Turkey to combine
complementary talents and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual
interest and competence.
