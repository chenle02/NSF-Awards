The cloud supports many important services. This includes the applications that
have driven the growth of the web like search and mail as well as new emerging
applications that require machine learning. As the demand for these services
continues to grow, there is also a need to scale the computation behind them. In
the cloud, this is done by distributing the computation across many processors
communicating across a high-speed network. Unfortunately, there is an increasing
performance gap that is limiting our ability to scale these cloud applications.
Processor performance has stagnated, yet network performance continues to
increase exponentially to 100Gbps and beyond. As a result, in scaling these
applications, existing networking stacks are struggling to fully utilize network
resources because the computational costs of network communication are too
high.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal aims to fundamentally rethink the
design of server-side networking and develop new networking abstractions to
address these problems. To accomplish this goal, the plan is to develop Network
Interface Card (NIC) Accelerated Active Messaging (NAAM), a new networking
framework. In NAAM, functions are written in a high-level language and then are
compiled to a bytecode and verified before they are executed on a NIC.
Importantly, this new paradigm exposes the full capabilities of NICs to
accelerate message processing and offload computation from the main processors
while still providing a simple and expressive interface to application
programmers. The goal is to create a system that is easy to use for developers
and operators while simultaneously ensuring security, performance, and
scalability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
