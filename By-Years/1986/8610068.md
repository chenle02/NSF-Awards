Current geophysical models of the Earth's mantle and core are based mostly on
estimated properties of mantle and core minerals. This study is to obtain
properties of several mantle and core minerals by experiment simultaneously at
high pressures and temperatures. An important physical property of the deep
Earth, the pressure-volume-temperature equation of state, can be determined for
candidate mantle minerals by the experiments. The results will be used to
address problems of the composition of the Transition Zone, the lower mantle,
and the core-mantle boundary. The PIs will measure with high accuracy the
thermal expansion and bulk modulus of mantle minerals at high pressures and
temperatures in the System Fe-Mg-CA-A1-Si-O.2. They are among the leading
practitioners of this important area of research. Funding at the revised level
is recommended.
