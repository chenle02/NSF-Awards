8904014 McKenzie This project is a continuation of work supported by NSF grant
No. DMS-8600300. The research lies within the general area of foundations of
mathematics, more specifically universal algebra and to some extent, model
theory. The research plans of the principal investigator, Ralph McKenzie,
include the search for an algebraic characterization of locally finite varieties
that possess a decidable theory of finite models, and work on two conjectures
concerning, first,the spectrum of cardinalities of subdirectly irreducible
algebras in finitely generated varieties, and second, the finite
axiomatizability of finitely generated quasivarieties whose algebras possess
modular relative congruence lattices.
