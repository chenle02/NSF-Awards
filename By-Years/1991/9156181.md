The members of the Mathematics, Statistics, and Computation Department at Mount
Holyoke College are initiating a four-year project aimed at creating an entry
level mathematics curriculum which will serve all students. At the end of the
four year project, a curriculum with a variety of attractive entry level courses
and a number of parallel tracks leading to a mathematics minor will be
developed. These minors are being designed to supply a coherent set of
intellectual tools which will form a basis for further study, both in
mathematics and in other disciplines. This new curriculum will have much more
flexibility in allowing students with weak backgrounds to pursue scientific
careers and will, ultimately, lead to a larger number of students electing to
major in mathematics. It will also better serve students who go on to
nontechnical careers.
