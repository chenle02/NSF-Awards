ABSTRACT This investigation utilizes a new approach for evaluating the
confluent hypergeometric function for a wide range of arguments both real and
complex. The approach consist of the direct summation of Kummer's series and
extension of the computing machine precision to control overflow. This direct
approach 8seems promising for the accurate evaluation of the entire subset of
special case functions: Bessel functions, Coulomb functions, Laguerre
polynomials, etc. The goals of the research are to: determine the absolute
accuracy of the method; make the function evaluator as robust as possible;
ensure the portability of the evaluator; and vectorize the function evaluator
algorithm to achieve computation times competitive with existing evaluators.
Because a wide range of complex arguments are now possible, this function
evaluator will be an accurate, versatile, and portable package applicable to a
wide spectrum of problems in science and engineering. In addition, the approach
used to control overflow in the complex arithematic may be applicable to a
broader class of problems requiring the summation of a power series.
