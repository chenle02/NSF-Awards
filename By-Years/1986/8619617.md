This project addresses the problems of design and analysis of structural systems
under multiple hazards. Probabilistic methods for system reliability and their
applications to real, complex systems are developed. Methods of optimization
under reliability constraints and computationally efficient methods and
algorithms are investigated. The study will firmly established the basis for
safety evaluation of important structures in special environments and for
modernization of design codes taking into account cost/loss consideration.
