NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: The application of an electrical bias during ceramic
processing for manufacturing applications has the potential to dramatically
improve processing times, lower required temperatures, and decrease required
mechanical pressures. The mechanisms for these process improvements of these
ceramics is unclear; this research is revealing the underlying reasons. The
experimental work in this study is complemented by theoretical modeling. The
anticipated results of this study are informing how electric fields can be
utilized for enhancing processing conditions for existing materials, and
tailoring of new functional ceramic materials. Graduate and undergraduate
students are being trained in areas of materials science and engineering for
subsequent careers in academia or fields of high-tech manufacturing.
Participating university students are mentoring high school students from
traditionally underrepresented communities to improve science literacy and
college-going rates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS: Electric field
assisted sintering has demonstrated the feasibility to accelerate densification
of powder compacts, lower processing temperatures, and suppress grain growth.
The role of electric fields in the absence of current flow remains, however,
mostly unknown. A major challenge is the systematic investigation of emerging
defect structures in nanocrystalline ceramics due to the overwhelming number of
randomly oriented general grain boundaries. Diffusion bonding of bicrystals in a
custom-built setup is used to systematically investigate atomic and electronic
grain boundary structures as a function of applied field strength, direction,
and grain boundary geometry. This experimental approach allows the comparison of
specifically selected grain boundary geometries as a function of the applied
electric field, and elucidates whether externally applied electric fields impact
on the thermodynamic stability of grain boundaries. Experiments are complemented
by novel modelling routines that are based on variations of atomic density
within the grain boundary cores. The combination of diffusion bonding, atomic
resolution characterization, and theoretical modelling of the interfacial
thermodynamic state is used to gain a quantitative mechanistic understanding of
electric field effects on grain boundary formation. Field-assisted modifications
of grain boundary networks are expected to become a disruptive technology for
tailoring of new microstructures with unprecedented macroscopic physical
properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
