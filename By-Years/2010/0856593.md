&lt;br/&gt;Armstrong Atlantic State University (AASU) is developing STEM
learning communities that focus on both undergraduate research and on targeted
freshman experiences that include significant faculty and peer mentoring. Twenty
students will be selected each year to participate in a pre-freshman summer
undergraduate research experience and participate in an intense one-week skill
enhancement program in applied mathematics. With university support, additional
math tutoring will be continued through the students' freshman year. These
students, who will be joined by 52 additional AASU students, will participate in
an academic year learning community experience that will include research
supportive courses (inquiry-based format), experiential activities (field trips,
community service projects, etc.), a monthly colloquium, and faculty and peer
mentor tutoring and counseling.
