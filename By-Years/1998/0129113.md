&lt;br/&gt;DNA sequence information from subfossil wood specimens, hundreds to
thousands of years old, would promote our understanding of temporal as well as
spatial genetic variation in long-lived forest tree species. Huon pine and
Siberian pine have been used extensively in dendrochronological analyses to
infer climate variability in the late and post-Pleistocene periods in both the
Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Subfossil wood samples range in age from
present day to 15,000 years before present and encompass periods of increased
amplitude of climate change and human mediated disturbance. Using state of the
art DNA sequence based technology, we will evaluate the feasibility of obtaining
genetic information from nuclear, chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes from
exactly dated wood samples of these species. Rigorous criteria to authenticate
DNA extraction and PCR - amplification from subfossil wood will be incorporated
in all phases of this study. &lt;br/&gt;Genetic data from historical specimens
could open broad new areas of investigation related to plant evolution,
biodiversity, forensics and archaeology. Knowledge of the scale of genetic
change in forest tree populations related to variability in climate and habitat
alteration represent fundamental problems in plant biology, important for gene
conservation strategies and global energy policies. &lt;br/&gt;
