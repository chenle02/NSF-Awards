The goal of this project is to develop novel interprocedural techniques for
compiling scientific and engineering applications on distributed address space
parallel machines. With recent advances in parallel and supercomputing
architectures, the application programmers have unprecedented computational
power available. However, it has also become increasingly difficult to harness
this power. The parallelizing and optimizing compilers usually turn out to be
inadequate, since they restrict the analysis to a single procedure level.
However, by developing a set of novel effective and efficient interprocedural
techniques, the efficacy of the parallel compilers can be enhanced
significantly, without significallty slowing the compilation process. In message
passing machines and distributed shares memory machines, the compilation process
involves several complex tasks, including data distribution, locality
management, placement of communication and/or synchronization, and aggregating
remote memory accesses. This project will develop new interprocedural techniques
for performing these phases of analysis interprocedurally.
