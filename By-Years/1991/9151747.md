In order to create an environment conducive to inquiry and exploration, a
microcomputer assisted laboratory-classroom setting is being established.
Learning physical concepts, principles, and methods of scientific inquiry is
enhanced through integration of laboratory activities, discussions, and lectures
in an atmosphere of guided, interactive inquiry. This innovative approach is
greatly facilitated with the assistance of microcomputer interfaced
instrumentation, which allows rapid collection, display, and analysis of data.
Spreadsheet and graphics applications are learned and used frequently. As
methods and tools of investigation become more familiar, student initiated
inquiry and student designed experiments should arise naturally. Computer
simulations and tutorials are used where appropriate. This microcomputer-based,
workshop- style course will impact introductory physics courses at three levels,
affecting students ranging in backgrounds from science and engineering to arts
and humanities. Increased understanding and appreciation of the process of
scientific investigation, improved attitudes towards learning physics, and
greater interest in pursuing careers in science, engineering, and science
education should result from this project.
