A laboratory containing a flexible configuration of parallel processors for use
in an upper level seminar in parallel processing is being established. The
laboratory explores parallel algorithms and their relation to various connection
topologies. Transputer systems are used because they lend themselves to
empirical studies of the speedup of parallel algorithms under varying conditions
and are easily configured into a variety of different topologies. The equipment
initially is used in an upper level seminar. The algorithms to be explored in
the seminar are chosen with care, so that experience gained in the seminar can
translate into useful units of study in parallel algorithms in most of the
computer science courses in subsequent years.
