This REU site award provides support for ten undergraduate researchers working
under the supervision of several faculty advisors. The program runs for eight
weeks as a combination of individualized research projects, usually one student
with one researcher and short courses on material not normally found in the
undergraduate curriculum. A faculty seminar with talks on research interests is
scheduled to broaden student perspectives. A strong cooperative effort with the
Mathematical Sciences Section of Oak Ridge National Laboratory includes some
teaching of the short courses and the direction of student projects by
mathematical researchers at the laboratory. Research projects will cover areas
such as applying optimal control to population models with particular
applications to competitive systems, predator-prey models and bioremediation
strategies. Other work will focus on the application of statistical decision
theory to analyze alternative partitioning patterns of limited nutrients to root
and shoot tissue, on the size of minimal generating sets for finitely generated
ideals of commutative rings and development of numerical algorithms which
operate with some type of parallelism.
