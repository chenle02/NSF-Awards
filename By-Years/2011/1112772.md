The International Symposium on Performance Analysis of Systems and Software
(ISPASS) is a premier forum for sharing advanced academic and industrial
research focused on performance analysis of computer systems and software, and
brings together researchers from the computer architecture, systems and
applications software, and performance analysis fields. ISPASS seeks to increase
student participation in symposium and the field. The proposed funding would
support the travel of eligible US students to the symposium.
