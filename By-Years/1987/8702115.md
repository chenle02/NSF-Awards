The principal investigators propose to use a quaÃ•itative approach to analyzing
stability problems in local area networks/ These problems include ergodicity and
nonergodicity, partial ergodycity, practical stability, shape of steady-state
distributions (bistability property) and robustness. In order to make meaningful
performance predictions, given the variability inherent in most local area
networks, they plan to take a stochastic approach throughout the research. They
will define stability of a system in terms of a number of properties, provide
computable conditions for various kinds of stabinity and apply their analysis to
different types of networks such as ALOHI-type, ETHERNET with exponential back-
off algor>thms, token-passing computer networks, multiaccess system with
conflict resolution algorithms, and exponential back-off protocols. The outcome
is intended to be a set of constructiwe algorithms for assessing the stability
of computer systems and their networks, methods for improving stability, and
algorithms for approximating`impoztant performance measures of some classes of
complex systems.
