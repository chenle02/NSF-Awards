9727098 Rodriguez This proposed investigation will examine how video can be used
as a medium to enhance both analytic research and teachers' professional
development. In particular, this project will examine the potential of video-
based instructional materials to influence students' willingness to adopt
unfamiliar ideas related to constructivism and multiculturalism. The context for
this study is a preservice teacher education program at the University of
Wisconsin-Madison. To aid his students' preparation as educators, the
investigator plans to use constructivist pedagogy in the multiculturalism course
he offers as part of this academic program. In addition, the investigator will
assess the potential capability of video case studies to serve as an analytic
medium for understanding students' conceptual evolution on these topics. These
two objectives will be accomplished through (1) studying how leading scholars in
education use video as a means of professional development and of research, and
(2) preparing a publication synthesizing and disseminating these results. ***
