This symposium will encourage the participation of researchers from a broad
range of disciplines, while maintaining a core representation from the areas of
Dynamics and Controls. Many of the presentations will focus on new emerging
research areas of key significance. These new areas share in common the fact the
dynamics and control theory and methods provide the appropriate framework for
the understanding of the corresponding phenomena, while at the same time
providing many of the tools necessary for their application to relevant
technologies. Examples of these opportunities include the areas of systems
biology, quantum feedback and control, fluid dynamics, and control applications
in nanotechnology. The importance of these emerging areas in the current
research agenda in science and technology means that a unique opportunity exists
to drastically extend the scope and impact of dynamics and control methods far
beyond their traditional areas of application in engineering.
