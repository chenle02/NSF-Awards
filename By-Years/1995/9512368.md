9512369 McDowell This Academic Research Infrastructure (Acquisition) Award is
made to partially fund the acquisition of an integrated simulation and test
control capability that will be used to study deformation, fatigue and fracture
of high temperature structural materials. The Mechanical Properties Research
Laboratory has a long history of modeling materials propepties that are used
both for performance predictions and processing/forming techniques. The new
equipment will allow better studies of the changing microstructure which in turn
contributes to a better understanding of material behavior. ***
