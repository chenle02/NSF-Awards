The objectives of this research are to develop experimental and theoretical
procedures for online measurement and analysis of combustion, ammonium sulphate
and nitrate particles formed in dry scrubbing processes, and silicon particles
from the pyrolysis of silane. In silicon production, conditions are chosen to
prevent cluster formation by operating at temperatures below where homogeneous
nucleation occurs and with low concentration of nuclei. In the electron beam
scrubbing processes, operating and installation costs are so expensive that
short irradiation times at high doses are mandated. These conditions yield
comparatively high water vapor concentrations will at least partially
compensate, and a compact particle can be expected. The soot structures are
extended chain-like structures. The specific research areas are: (1) the
experimental measurement of the aerodynamic diameter of clusters and their
correlation with primary particle size and fractal dimension; (2) the
development of a coagulation model based on the Kaplan lattice approach; and (3)
the diffusional charging of clusters and especially their role as a sink for
ions.
