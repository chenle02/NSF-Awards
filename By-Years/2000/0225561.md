ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Proposal: 0073259&lt;br/&gt;PI: Gyungho Lee&lt;br/&gt;Title:
High-Bandwidth Memory Pipeline for Wide-Issue Processors &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Technological and architectural innovations have enabled development
of powerful microprocessors that can issue several instructions concurrently at
a very high clock rate. In future processors with aggressive speculation
techniques, an even larger number of instruction issues per cycle are expected.
Efficient handling of memory references for data access is one of the keys to
achieving high performance in future processors. This research addresses methods
to provide sufficient bandwidth at fast latency for data access in wide-issue
processors issuing tens of instructions per cycle. The methods are based on the
concept of "data decoupling". Data decoupling divides the memory reference
instructions into multiple independent streams before the actual addresses of
the data they access are known. Partitioned memory reference instructions are
then fed into a separate memory pipeline. This research investigates the issues
in effective and efficient hardware and software support for multiple memory
pipelines based on data decoupling. The data decoupling approach of providing
multiple memory pipelines can provide two crucial advantages over a conventional
design. First, the cost and the complexity of building a large cache with many
ports are reduced. Second, partitioning memory references can facilitate more
specialized handling of each partitioned stream. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
