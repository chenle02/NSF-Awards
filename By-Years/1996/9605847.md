This project involves the ethnographic field research of two senior and one
junior cultural anthropologists from the University of Georgia. The project
proposed to document the complete inventory of edible resources of the Highland
Maya of Chiapas, Mexico, and to analyze the contribution of these resources to
the Maya diet. It is well known that rural peoples exploit food sources that are
not well recognized by non-locals, yet which can be important supplements in a
dietary sense. Using standard methods of ethnographic interviews, formal data
elicitation techniques, dietary recall and garden surveys, the use of local
experts to collect food resources and document them, as well as formal
interviews of a sample of 50 men and 50 women in each of two Mayan townships,
the available food resources will be described and analyzed for their impact on
the diet. This research is important because population pressure and
deteriorating economic conditions have impacted negatively on rural diets in
many areas of the world. This project will attempt to describe the complete
range of local resources available in diets, and will stimulate new research
into viable alternative diets which can help improve the long-term well being of
this and comparable rural populations. In addition, the demonstration that
little known edible resources are important food sources can advance our
understanding of their place in the ecosystem and encourage their conservation
and sustainable use.
