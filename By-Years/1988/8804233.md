A REU site will be established involving ten (10) undergraduate students (5 from
UNC, Charlotte and 5 from surrounding schools) and 5 faculty members from the
Civil Engineering Department at UNC, Charlotte. Each student, under direction of
a professor, will conduct research on a civil engineering related area using
laboratory and computational facilities. Research projects include timber design
and construction, concrete beam evaluation, seapage through soils, landslide
potential, water quality mapping, high accident location analysis, and
comparative disinfectant chemicals. These projects are designed to enhance the
students capability to develop and understand research methodology.
