The CyberCorps: Scholarship for Service (SFS) program at the University of South
Alabama (USA) prepares at least 20 highly qualified Information Assurance (IA)
and cybersecurity professionals for service in federal, state, local, and tribal
governmental agencies. The project develops a Cyber Scholars Program that
expands the national IA academic reach to students throughout the Gulf Coast
region, increasing diversity and capacity of the national cybersecurity
workforce. The USA School of Computing (SoC) has three ABET-accredited computing
programs, including a health informatics degree program that offers substantial
interaction in IA and a unique opportunity to attract women into the computing
field. The project collaborates with local minority institutions such as Bishop
State Community College, a designated underrepresented institution, and other
community colleges in the region, raising awareness of cybersecurity issues in a
wide variety of rural communities. USA has a strong K-12 outreach program in
partnership with industry and government agencies, including an annual GEMS
(Girls Exploring Math &amp; Science) conference for middle school girls and
Summer Security Seminars for high school students.
