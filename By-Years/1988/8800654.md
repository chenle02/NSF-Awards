The Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting this project
which deals with the development of novel sulfur- and phosphorus-containing
reagents to be used to prepare a variety of naturally occurring compounds of
biological importance. These reagents are designed to carry out a wide variety
of important organic reactions, many of them with an unusually high degree of
stereospecificity. The enantioselective formation of carbon-carbon bond is
extremely important in the synthesis of chiral organic molecules. Recently, this
research group has developed a general and facile process for annulation which
allows the preparation of these ring compounds in high to excellent optical
purities, i.e. 1,4 gamma-addition of chiral sulfinylallyl anions to cyclic
enones provided 70-97% ee, and chiral allylphosphonyl anions provided 88-98% ee.
Studies of the general scope, mechanism and versatility of these stereospecific
1,4-addition reactions of chiral sulfinyl- and phosphonylallyl anions will
provide better understanding of the structures of the anions and further
information on their utility in organic synthesis. Enantioselective total
syntheses of antitumor agents, trichothecenes, indolizidine alkaloids, and many
other diterpenoids will be realized by utilizing these methods.
