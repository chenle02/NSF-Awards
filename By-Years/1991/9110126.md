The subject of this program, supported as a Research Planning Grant for Women
Scientists and Engineers (NSF90-121) is the preparation of a plan for
experimental investigations of self-pumped phase conjugation in photorefractive
materials, through two types of measurements: 1) the photon counting
distribution and 2) the second-order correlation function. Research planning
activities include extended visits in the laboratories of experts in photon-
counting and laser intensity stabilization, and in optical scattering in solids.
