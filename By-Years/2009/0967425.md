The research will provide a fundamental understanding of the factors controlling
the adsorption of organic compounds by carbon nanotubes. Quantitative structure-
activity relationship (QSAR) models will be developed. There are thousands of
organic compounds produced and used worldwide. This research will predict the
adsorption of organic compounds by carbon nanotubes in water without the need
for performing costly experiments. The approach is to systematically investigate
the adsorption and aggregation of carefully selected carbon nanotubes with a
wide spectrum of diameter, length, number of walls, and surface functional
groups. These will be used with a suite of organic probe molecules with
different physicochemical properties in controlled background solution matrices.
Carbon nanotubes with a wide range of structural characterists will be
extensively characterized and isotherm experiments will be performed to
systematically examine the roles of nanotube structural parameters and organic
compound physicochemical properties in the adsorption process. Carbon nanotube
manufacturers will be able to use these models to develop environmentally
sustainable approaches in their production of carbon nanotubes toward different
applications.
