This project at the University of California at Berkeley is entitled, "Science
and Societal Issues: Industry and Education Partnership Program at the Lawrence
Hall of Science." This three-year project uses practicing scientists in the
development of activities that will introduce students and teachers to topics in
the scientist's area of expertise. The emphasis is on science topics that relate
to current societal issues, such as global warming, acid rain, AIDS, recombinant
DNA technology, and the effects of drugs on the brain. A one-day program will be
held each year to introduce participating scientists to hands-on activities that
relate to societal issues of relevance. A Science and Societal Issues Symposium
will motivate 500 high school students each year to confront the ethical and
societal issues raised by recent scientific and technological advances. Fall
meetings will model activities and pair teachers and scientists. Each scientist
will spend at least four days per year visiting classrooms. Spring follow-up
meetings will enable teachers, scientists, and staff to assess the progress of
the project and generate new ideas.
