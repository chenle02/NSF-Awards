9528546 Key This is a collaborative study of deep and bottom water formation in
the southern sector of the Indian Ocean, as part of the World Ocean Circulation
Experiment (WOCE) Indian Ocean Expedition (IOE). Six PIs from six institutions
will complete the final segment of the WOCE Hydrographic Program Line, S-4,
along 60 degrees South from about 20 degrees East to about 120 degrees East. The
program is designed to detect subtle differences across the Kerguelen Plateau,
an important hydrographic boundary for bottom waters. In addition to
hydrography, the section will include standard tracer measurements, as well as
CFCs, Helium, Tritium, and Carbon-14, all to WOCE standards. In addition to the
zonal line, two excursions to the shelf at about 54 degrees East and 96 degrees
East will be made to investigate the Antarctic Slope Front and its associated
westward current. Expendable current moorings will also be deployed at several
locations to measure, for one year, the current along the slope and on the
flanks of the Kerguelen Plateau.
