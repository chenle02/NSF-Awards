9361123 Lyon This project focuses on development of a liquid absorbent for the
separation of isobutylene by thermal- and pressure-swing absorption processes.
The absorbent will contain transition metal complexes which are expected to have
a high selectivity for isobutylene over other C4 components. Isobutylene is an
important precursor for gasoline additives and tires. Low-energy methods for the
separation of isobutylene from natural gas liquids and from petroleum
derivatives can reduce production costs to make the processes more profitable
and competitive. ***
