The project will duplicate the highly successful Multiple Mirror Telescope
chopping/adaptive optics membrane deformable secondary mirror for the Magellan I
telescope, where it will provide a new and versatile f/15 Cassegrain focal
station. Its first use will be as the basis for a thermal infrared chopping/tip-
tilt imaging system producing diffraction-limited, high-Strehl (&gt;70%) mid-
infrared (5-25 micron) astronomy. The system will uniquely allow deep nulling
interferometry, nearly full-sky tip-tilt guiding, and nodding/chopping in the
southern hemisphere. After the successful deployment of this secondary we will
quickly upgrade its wavefront sensor to allow high speed high-resolution 0.8-5
micron adaptive optics science.
