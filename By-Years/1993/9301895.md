This award will establish a visiting scientist program at the Millstone Hill
incoherent scatter radar facility for atmospheric scientists from the Former
Soviet Union (FSU). The purpose of this program is to further the aims of US
researchers involved with the Coupling, Energetics and Dynamics of Atmospheric
Regions (CEDAR) program, an element of Global Change. The visiting scientist
program will facilitate the interaction of CEDAR researchers with the resources
and talents that exist in related research areas in the FSU. Over the course of
three years a total of nine FSU scientists will visit the Millstone Hill
facility with each visit lasting about three months. Research topics to be
addressed include radiowave probing of the coupled ionosphere/thermosphere
systems which is the primary focus of CEDAR related activities at Millstone
Hill.
