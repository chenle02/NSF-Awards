The primary objective of this proposed research is to induce a significant
increase in the viscosity of liquid carbon dioxide by dissolving small amounts
of chemical compounds which may aggregate in the fluid phase and form long
macromolecule-like structures. Three types of compounds will be evaluated using
a novel, high pressure, visual falling cylinder viscometer and a high pressure
PVT apparatus. Various oil soluble nonionic and semi-fluorinated surfactants
will be dissolved in carbon dioxide along with small amounts of water, in an
attempt to form long, cylindrical reverse micelles and microemulsions. Semi-
fluorinated alkanes constitute the second category of candidate compounds.
Finally, tri-n-butyltin fluoride and a cosolvent will be introduced into the
liquid carbon dioxide. Increasing the viscosity of carbon dioxide may be of
value in developing displacement media in oil reservoirs where current low
viscosity carbon dioxide solutions lead to by-passing or channeling and low
recovery efficiencies. An understanding of surfactant behavior in supercritical
fluids may also lead to new separation and purification processes combining
surfactant technology and supercritical fluid technology.
