This project capitalizes on recent developments in computer technology,
authoring programs, optical disc technology, and multimedia to create a unique
instructional environment within an anatomy and physiology laboratory for health
science majors (nurses, therapists, laboratory technicians). Video exercises for
the wet lab dissections and experiments and interactive multimedia stations (a
combination of text, pictures, diagrams, animation, sounds, and linear video)
develop and reinforce students' intuition and understanding of anatomic and
physiologic principles. Equipment includes 30 TV/VCR/Headphone stations for the
video-guided dissections and six multimedia workstations, each consisting of a
Macintosh IIci and a Pioneer LD4200 Laserdisc player. The multimedia stations
are networked to and managed by a faculty development/file server workstation
consisting of a Macintosh IIci, Pioneer LD 4200 Laserdisc player, and an
appropriate authoring program. Simulations and animations enhance the wet lab
format with an emphasis on interaction.
