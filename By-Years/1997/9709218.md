9709218 Egbelu Eleven United States delegation members will participate in a
series of two USA-South Africa Workshops for Collaboration in Manufacturing
Research and Education. The first workshop will be held in March 1997 in
Johannesburg, South Africa, and the second workshop will be held in May 1997 in
Arlington, VA. The purpose of the workshops is for the participating researchers
and educators to discuss the current manufacturing research and education
activities in the United States and South Africa, so as to identify priority
areas and effective ways in which the universities in the two countries can
collaborate effectively in manufacturing research and education. The discussions
in the workshops will address unit manufacturing processes of various kinds of
materials, as well as quality control and system integration issues. Topics of
discussion will include industrial robotics, high-speed machining, automated
welding, reconfigurable assembly, semiconductor manufacturing, printed circuit
board processing, quality control, logistic management, and manufacturing
education. The workshop activities are an advancement of similar activities
which have led to a significant increase in both quality and quantity of
manufacturing research and education activities in South Africa. It is expected
that the activities of the workshops will result in a follow-up of real
collaborative activities between the United States and South Africa,
particularly among university researchers, thereby leading to advanced
technology development, better manufacturing education, and improved cultural
understanding for both countries. ***
