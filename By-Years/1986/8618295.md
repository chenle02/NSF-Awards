Theoretical and experimental investigation of the kinetics of rare gas halogens
in high pressure electrical discharges are an important data base for the design
of future compact excimer lasers. Progress has been made in developing effective
computer codes and in investigating the key physical processes which govern
plasma behavior and energy release: spectral gain, XeCl emission, preionization
kinetics, and laser performance. The role of an increase in current density will
be investigated.
