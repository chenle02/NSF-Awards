A new reconstitutable emulsion system was identified in laboratory, which is
formed by addition of an aqueous vehicle to a finely divided solid. The emulsion
does not contain emulsifiers or other surfactant materials. It is formed by
dissolving saccharides or a hydrophilic polymer in a volatile solvent and the
mixture is flash evaporated under vacuum until a dry solid is formed. The
addition of water to the dry solid forms a dispersed system having unique
properties. The new systems may be formed with strong acidic, alkaline or
alcoholic solutions, is thixotropic, and the particle size decreases with time
for about two weeks. The objective of this research is to establish the
thermodynamic properties of the new emulsion obtained in laboratory. The
research may lead to a new group of emulsion systems with application in
pharmaceuticals, food and chemical industries.
