This award provides one-half the funds required to purchase an isotope ratio
mass spectrometer and a laser ablation source for the microanalysis of mineral
samples. The new spectrometer system will replace two stable isotope
spectrometers, one almost 40 years old, and the other installed in 1972 but
inadequate for modern work. The equipment will be installed and operated in the
Department of Geosciences at the Pennsylvania State University. Penn State
University will provide the remaining funds necessary for the acquisition. The
new facility will be used to carry out research projects on: (1) the origin of
sulfur in igneous rocks and its effect on the formation of hydrothermal ore
deposits; (2) kinetics of reaction between organic matter and aqueous sulfate
under ore forming conditions; (3) origin of shale/carbonate- hosted deposits of
base metals; (4) mechanism of formation of iron sulfides and the role of CaSO.4
in mineralization under submarine environments.
