This award funds a three year project to test economic theories about financial
markets for the poor in developing countires. The tests will use randomized
field experiments combined with collection of supplementary data. The research
will improve our understanding of both how individuals make decisions over time
and of how micro-lending policies can aid economic
development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research will be conducted at field sites in
the Phillipines and South Africa. Reearch questions include (1) Is adverse
selection present in South African lending markets? Is such adverse selection an
important explanation for why poor South Africans default on loans? (2) Does the
refinancing incentive of repeat loans inspire repayment? (3) Are individuals
credit-constrained in South Africa and if so what is the impact from providing
access to credit to such individuals? (4) Do commitment features to a savings
product help individuals save more? What kinds of individuals are more likely to
use such a product?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this research will give
policy makers important information about whether and how micro-credit loans can
help to encourage entrepreneurship and reduce poverty in developing countries.
