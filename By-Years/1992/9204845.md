The research activity under this proposal will consist of a combination of
theoretical modeling and data analysis. Its primary objective is to gain an
increased understanding of the energetics and dynamics of the atmospheric region
situated between heights of 50 and 100 km. It will consist of an indepth study
of Polar Mesospheric Clouds (PMC), a phenomenon which is a prominent
manifestation of the energetics and dynamics in the summertime polar mesopause
region near 84 km height. New modeling techniques which we have previously
developed for simulating PMC evolution and optical properties will be combined
with existing dynamical-photochemical models for the thermal and compositional
structure of this atmospheric region. Newly- available satellite measurements of
atmospheric properties will be used to develop a diagnostic model of the
region's thermal, dynamical and transport processes. A second objective will be
to determine the extent to which long-term anthropogenic changes in chemical
composition of the lower atmosphere has impacted the thermal and dynamical
structure of this region. In particular, we will develop both empirical and
first-principles modeling methods to support our recent hypothesis that PMC is a
relatively recent phenomenon, an indirect result of rising levels of
tropospheric methane.
