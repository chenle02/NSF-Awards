The Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemisty Program supports
research on intramolecular light-induced electron transfer in chemical systems.
The research may give insight into the ability of the photosynthetic reaction
center to continue to function at low temperatures. Investigations of
photoinduced electron and energy transfer in complex intramolecular systems will
be continued. The studies will be based on the metal-to-ligand charge transfer
(MLCT) excited states of polypyridyl complexes of Ru(II), Os(II) or Re(I),
incorporated into chromophore-quencher or ligand-bridged, dimeric metal complex
assemblies. In properly designed cases, it will be possible to explore
intramolecular electron and energy transfer and competition between these
processes in complex molecules, the appearance and decay of long-lived charge
separated states and the role of solvent and, in some cases, pH, in dictating
transition rates and lifetimes.
