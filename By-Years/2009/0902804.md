The National Science Foundation is constantly striving to more fully document
the impact that I/UCRCs have on the development of technological breakthroughs,
technology transfer and commercialization. Previous compendia have been used by
the I/UCRC program to demonstrate the scope of high quality, industrially
relevant research outcomes produced by the program. The proposed project will
gather, organize, catalogue and illustrate noteworthy program-related
technological breakthroughs that have resulted from I/UCRC research and
subsequent technology transfer activities.

The deliverables from the proposed project would make it easier for policy
makers and researchers to access breakthrough descriptions from all I/UCRC
scientific areas. Deliverables will also be useful as marketing tools for
informing industry and the scientific community of the benefits of such
programs, and could pave the way for studies of economic impacts of cooperative
research.
