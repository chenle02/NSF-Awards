Intellectual Merit: A Workshop on Frontiers in Electronics (WOFE-11) is to be
held in San Juan, Puerto Rico during 18-21 December 2011. The Workshop has high
intellectual merit and embodies technological exchange and discussion of new
ideas and emerging trends in the current rapid evolution of electronic
technology. The Workshop focuses on a merger of the major technical areas
including low-power digital electronics, microwave power circuits, and
optoelectronics, which collectively have become the foundation of today's
electronic technology. It aims at fostering an active cross-fertilization of
these different areas by gathering experts from academia, industry, and
government agencies to review the recent developments.

Broader Impact: This workshop will promote exchange of scientific ideas and will
make an impact on future science and technology in electronics. It will provide
a special forum for leading researchers to review the most recent and exciting
breakthroughs in various areas of electronics. Emphasis will be placed on
inviting women and members of the under representative minorities. These
activities will help to establish future programs for training graduate/
undergraduate students to become the next generation of electronics scientists
and engineers.
