This proposal covers a spectrum of topics, ranging from astrophysics, to QCD
collider physics, to physics beyond the Standard Model. The PI's propose to
study neutrino interactions with external magnetic fields, ultrahigh energy
neutrino-nucleon interactions and non-standard models of dark energy. These
processes are important for supernova and for high-energy neutrino astronomy
experiments. Experimental consequences of noncommutative geometry for
positronium decay will be investigated. Several processes important to collider
physics such as the production of the Higgs boson and di-photons as well as the
production of heavy quarks will be studied using next to next to leading order
perturbation theory in QCD as well as resummation schemes. A scheme for
calculating rates for multi jet events expected at LHC will also be
investigated.
