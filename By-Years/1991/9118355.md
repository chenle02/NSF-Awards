This is a five year Young Investigator Award. The mechanisms that enable
eukaryotic cells to control the synthesis of membrane lipids in coordination
with ongoing membrane biogenesis are complex and, to a great extent, unknown.
What is clear is that the phospholipid precursor inositol plays a critical role.
Inositol containing phospholipids have been implicated in metabolic signalling
process that act to control cell growth and proliferation in higher eukaryotes.
An extensive analysis of inositol transport, and the role of transport in the
coordinated regulation of phospholipid biosynthesis will be conducted in the
unicellular eukaryotic organism, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The studies will
involve the genetic and biochemical characterization of inositol transport and
regulation of transport in mutant and wild type strains of yeast. Strains
harboring well-characterized regulatory mutations, in addition to the new
mutants, will be used to identify the role of inositol transport in the
coordinated regulation of phospholipid biosynthesis. The mutants will also be
used to facilitate the cloning of structural genes encoding the inositol
transport. The cloned genes will be employed in molecular studies, including DNA
sequence analysis and analysis of transcriptional regulation in response to
exogenous precursors, such as inositol and choline. It is expected that the
proposed analysis will define a complex regulatory circuitry which coordinates
the uptake of inositol with the continuous proportional synthesis of the
phospholipids in the growing cell.
