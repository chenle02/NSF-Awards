A serious problem related to evaluation of soil strength is the lack of
knowledge related to seasonal variation of soil properties. Geotechnical
engineers have recognized this problem and have established various corrections.
However, these methods are generally empirical and cannot truly represent the
conditions at a specific site. What is needed is a better technique to determine
the time dependent change of soil properties. One technique that is available,
but largely untried, is based on spectral-analysis-of-surface waves (SASW) to
determine shear wave velocities and depths of frozen layers. Shear wave
velocities can then be related to soil moduli that can be used in conventional
engineering analysis. This work applies SASW techniques to a series of tests at
different times during a year. The results will show that this technique can be
used to assess seasonal effects on soil parameters and should demonstrate the
technique as a reliable method of evaluating a large number of test sections in
a short time. As part of the test program, a refraction survey of the test sites
and a series of Clegg Impact tests will be conducted at the same time and place
as the spectral analysis. This should provide independent tests that can be
related to the results from the spectral analysis.
