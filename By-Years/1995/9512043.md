This ARI award provides funds for the acquisition of high-capacity, on-line
data storage and computer visualization systems for improved access to deep
submergence data collected by the National Deep Submergence Facility at WHOI and
for multibeam sonar and marine seismic data obtained by other groups within the
Institution. The goal for this project is to modernize their data retrieval and
archiving capabilities and to markedly improve the ability of investigators and
educators both within the Institution, and in the US academic community to
access these datasets for processing, analysis and interpretation, and
educational use by students and teachers. To achieve this goal, the PIs request
funds to acquire a Metrum Super VHS mass storage system, and associated
peripherals, to provide (1 terabyte of on-line data storage for deep
submergence, Sea Beam and marine seismic data collected by several different
groups within WHOI. They also are requesting a number of I/O devices will
significantly improve access to deep submergence and geophysical data both
locally and via the Internet.
