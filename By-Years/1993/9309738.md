This research will investigate the relationship between two different data
structures for representing surfaces, parametric and algebraic, which have been
used to solve the same set of geometric problems. The targeted geometric
problems include the problem of scattered data interpolation and the problem of
the construction of blending surfaces. Practical and constructive algorithms
will be developed for converting a mesh of tangent-continuous parametric surface
patches to an analogous mesh of tangent-continuous algebraic surface patches and
vice-versa. Relationships between useful parameters influencing the shape of
surfaces in the parametric representation to those in the algebraic
representation will be explored through theoretical and experimental means. The
methods to be employed include a combination of exact symbolic computation and
numerical approximation. The results will be applied to construct new solutions
and improve existing solutions to the problem of construction of blending
surfaces and the visualization of fluid flow.
