&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act
of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Opportunistic communication
leverages communication opportunities arising by chance to provide significant
performance benefit or even enable communication where it would be impossible
otherwise. This project develops algorithms, techniques, and protocols that
optimize opportunistic communication to achieve good, predictable performance in
wireless mesh networks and vehicular networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A key
challenge involved is how to systematically optimize opportunistic communication
to achieve good predictable wireless performance. The research addresses the
challenge by making three major contributions. First, the PIs develop novel
robust optimization techniques that systematically optimize opportunistic
communication even in the presence of high uncertainty. Second, they design
efficient models, measurement and inference techniques, and prediction
algorithms to obtain the required inputs to the optimization algorithms. Third,
they exploit inter-flow coding opportunities arising from multi-flow diversity
to further enhance the efficiency of opportunistic communication. To demonstrate
the effectiveness of the approaches, the PIs design, implement, and experiment
in a wireless mesh network and a vehicular network testbed deployed at UT
Austin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project produces publications in leading
network conferences and journals, and software that is publicly available
online. The resulting techniques and software significantly advance wireless
mesh network and vehicular network technology, and benefit other wireless
network environments. The research results are also integrated into
undergraduate and graduate curricula as well as outreach activities.&lt;br/&gt;
