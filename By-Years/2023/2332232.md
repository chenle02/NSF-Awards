Over the past several decades, formal mathematical models have contributed
increasingly to advances in political science, and over these years
mathematicians and economists have joined forces with political scientists to
study timely and important issues, including fair representation in legislatures
and multimember districts - in which multiple candidates rather than only one
are elected to represent a jurisdiction - to produce legislative bodies more
reflective of voting populations. The Principal Investigator will make
significant contributions to public and civic discourse and advance
understanding of the nature of U.S. representative democracy, including
responses to the gerrymandering of districts for partisan gain and loss in state
and local jurisdictions. Beyond this scholarly inquiry, the project will
increase engagement of Black men in coursework and collaborative mathematical
research, specifically in the mathematics of fairness and equity, an area
closely connected to the social justice aims of Morehouse College, a
historically Black college.

This project will advance research in the mathematics of voting and
representation. The PI examines the potential of multimember electoral
districts, in conjunction with supporting election methods, to yield fair
representation. One facet of this work is to consider fairness to individuals in
a population through spatial models, in which the ideals of voters are
represented by points in m-dimensional space where each coordinate of an
m-dimensional point in a "policy space" represents the position of the citizen
on a particular issue or interest. Spatial models in politics are well studied,
but less so for multimember districts with multiple candidates elected
simultaneously. The PI will develop and extend theoretical and experimental work
on spatial models of multimember district elections. Beyond this thrust, other
research results will arise more broadly from research collaborations
established with other mathematical scientists during the Algorithms, Fairness,
and Equity scientific program at the Simons Laufer Mathematical Sciences
Institute.

The project is funded jointly by the Infrastructure program of the Division of
Mathematical Sciences and the Historically Black Colleges and Universitites-
Excellence in Research (HBCU-EiR) Program.
