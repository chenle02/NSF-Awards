Professor Beckmann will work on the arithmetic of branched coverings of curves.
She hopes to describe arithmetic coverings of the projective line defined over
number fields in terms of branch cycle descriptions of the coverings. In
particular, she hopes to describe the ramification properties of field
extensions derived from these coverings. This project falls into the general
area of arithmetic geometry -a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of
mathematics: number theory and geometry. This combination has proved
extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems that withstood
generations. Among its many consequences are new error correcting codes. Such
codes are essential for both modern computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
