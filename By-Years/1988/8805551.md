Walter Neumann will continue his study of the topology of complex curves and
surfaces and their singularities, particularly the influence of the existence of
complex structures on the topology and topological invariants of the associated
3- and 4- manifolds. He will also study geometric structures on real and complex
manifolds in low dimensions, including singular structures, deformation of
structures, their invariants, and arithmetic questions related to the
invariants. Remarkable connections between geometry and algebra are uncovered at
every turn.
