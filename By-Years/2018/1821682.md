Public cloud computing is rapidly becoming the foundation of our information-
based economy. Users are adopting cloud platforms in lieu of maintaining
dedicated computing infrastructure primarily due to the resulting savings in
costs. Since cloud platforms earn revenue from utilizing their infrastructure by
renting it out to customers, and earn no revenue if their infrastructure is
idle, their goal is to maximize utilization. The increasing complexity of cloud
markets raises new research challenges for both users and providers that are
inherently economic. This award will support the organization of a workshop to
bring together researchers from computer systems and networks and from the
fields of economics, finance, and operations research to define important
research challenges at the intersection of economics and cloud computing over
the next 5-10 years.

The research agenda of the workshop has the potential for broad and
transformative impact on the US and beyond by fostering a new interdisciplinary
community in this nascent area, identifying its key research challenges, and
laying the foundation for future innovations that increase the efficiency of
using cloud computing resources. Furthermore, the workshop will engage early
career scholars and those from diverse backgrounds and underrepresented groups
to connect them with a broad community of academic and industrial researchers
interested in the intersection of economics and computer systems and networking.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
