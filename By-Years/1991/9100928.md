This project will support 8 students during the summer of 1991 and 8 more
students during the academic year 1991-92 to do research in the Intelligent
Structures Group within the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at
the University of New Hampshire. The research projects revolve around the
development of new hardware structures for embedding intelligence in dedicated
electronic systems. Basic research is performed in the areas of distributed
fault-tolerance, neural networks, synthetic vision, and learning systems in
control and signal processing.
