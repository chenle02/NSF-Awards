The goals of the project are to identify and develop engineering examples and
activities that can be integrated into standards-based 7-12 mathematics and
science curricula; to help teachers to develop an understanding and appreciation
of how mathematics and science concepts taught in their courses are used by
practicing scientists and engineers; to prepare teachers to guide their students
through the engineering examples and to explore the applications of mathematics
and science concepts they have learned; to provide workshops for engineering
professors to improve their pedagogical techniques; and to prepare a recruitment
and retention plan to increase the diversity of the engineering population.
Specifically targeted course materials are prepared for workshops and courses
provided for pre-service teachers, in-service teachers, and university faculty
members in engineering and education. Follow-up support is provided to
participants to assist them in implementing the approaches learned in the
workshops. The general perspective of the project utilizes contemporary
constructivist theory that integrates aspects of Vygotskian socio-cultural
theory, interactionist theories, and social cognitive theories under an umbrella
of critical theory.
