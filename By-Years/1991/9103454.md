The principal investigator will conduct research in several areas of stochastic
differential equations. This area of stochastic calculus is a field within
probability theory which has impact on several disciplines: electrical
engineering, mathematical physics, finance and economics. In particular, the
investigator will study weak convergence of stochastic integrals and stochastic
differential equations, with investigations into numerical schemes for
approximating solutions of stochastic differential equations driven by general
semi-martingales. In addition he will study a new type of forward-backward
equation which arose in finance theory. Finally, he has proposed a new type of
Stratonovich stochastic differential equation for general semimartingales which
allows approximation of the jumping differentials by continuous processes in a
Wong-Zakai manner. The principal investigator will conduct research in several
