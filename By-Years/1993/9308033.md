9308033 Smith This applicant will apply multidisciplinary to examine a long-
standing hypothesis relating an animal's size to its environment (Bergmann's
Rule). The study will focus on woodrat middens over a 35,000 year span, and will
incorporate DNA studies of fossil hair, the relationship between fecal pellet
size and body mass, deposition data, and climatic changes. Using technique
available from other disciplines, materials from dated middens will be used to
estimate species and their body size, and relate that information to geographic
location and climatic conditions at the time of deposition. This work will be
conducted under the direction of Drs. James H. Brown, Donald Natvig, and
Margaret Werner-Washburne, all of the University of New Mexico, and Dr. Julio
Betancourt of the U.S. Geological Survey. ***
