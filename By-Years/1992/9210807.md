This award supports the development of a computer software system enabling
large scale research computing projects dealing with systems of polynomial
equations in many variables. The result of the project will be a usable and
efficient computer program, which executes the Groebner basis algorithm for
computing standard bases and syzygies of ideals and modules over polynomial
rings. Improvements over the existing program, Macaulay, will include the
addition of a good programming language for the user, the ability to work over
more general coefficient rings, and increased speed of execution. This project
is in the general area of commutative algebra and the computer-aided
computational aspects of this field. There is a growing interest in using
computers to answer theoretical questions in algebra and conversely, algebra is
quite useful for the development of algorithms. This project makes serious use
of both the theory and practice of symbolic calculations to solve real problems
in commutative algebra.
