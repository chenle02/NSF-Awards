9619406 Garg The Department of Physics at the College of Wooster will establish
a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site. Eight students will be
recruited from Wooster and from other primarily undergraduate institutions.
Students will participate in research which includes experimental studies of
liquid crystals, binary fluid mixtures and polymer networks, and theoretical
studies in nonlinear dynamics. %%% The REU project at the College of Wooster
will involve students from primarily undergraduate institutions in frontier
research and will develop in the undergraduates a motivation to pursue careers
in science and engineering. ***
