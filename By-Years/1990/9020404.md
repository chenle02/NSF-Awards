This program will focus on a petrological and geochemical characterization of
the intra-transform spreading centers in the Siqueiros transform fault, on
determining the structural histroy along the transform domain through ALVIN
field mapping, structural studies of deformed rocks recovered from the walls of
each fault scarp, and on understanding the tectonci processess that have
influenced the development of the Siqueiros tranform for the past 4 Ma. There
will be eighteen ALVIN dives in the transfrom and a night-time program of rock
coring and dredging that will provide additional samples from along the
spreading axis and at various sites along the strike- slip faults. SeaBeam will
be used at night to produce detailed 10 m contour maps of each spreading axis.
Questions to be addressed include: What processes are responsible for initiating
intra-transform spreading? What is the evolutionary sequence of lava types
erupted when a new spreading center start? What is the nature of major
transform-affiliated compositional discontinuities in the mantle? What is the
scale of chemical heterogeneity in the mantle? Are unique magma types generated
along transform faults?
