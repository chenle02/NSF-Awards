9316406 Condie This project will examine a diverse crustal xenolith suite from
the Navajo volcanic field in the Four Corners area of the southwestern United
States. The research will include field, petrographic, major and trace element,
U/Pb zircon dating, and thermobarometric studies. Major objectives are to
determine the spatial, depth, and age relationships among these xenoliths, and
from these results, to better understand the origin and evolution of the crust
in this region.
