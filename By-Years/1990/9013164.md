The Marine Science Center of Northeastern University is the only marine station
with year-round research and teaching facilities, as well as resident faculty
and staff, located on the coast of New England north of Cape Cod. It is also the
only such marine laboratory within an hour's drive of most universities in the
greater Boston area. The location, well north of Boston Harbor, provides high
quality seawater and excellent intertidal and subtidal habitats for field study
and organism collection. Funded research at the Marine Science Center
encompasses a variety of projects in marine ecology, behavior, neurobiology,
structural biology, biochemistry and molecular biology. At present, development
of new projects and addition of new resident and visiting investigators are
severely limited by available research space. This award will increase research
space by providing partial funding for a 6000 square foot addition to the
present laboratory building and two pieces of badly needed equipment. The
expansion will provide space critically needed for funded projects by resident
faculty, other investigators from Northeastern University, and visiting
researchers from other academic institutions in the Boston area, other parts of
the U.S. and overseas.
