Abstract 9415073 Wichman The triple flame is usually found near the tip of
diffusion flames where on one side there is a lean premixed flame and on the
other side of the diffusion flame there is a rich premixed flame. The PI feels
that the triple flame is extremely important in practical combustion systems in
that it allows the diffusion flame to be propagated into or against an opposing
flow. The PI has proposed to study the intrinsic triple-flame structure of
diffusion flames in contact with conductive surfaces so that the system becomes
non-isenthalpic. The PI feels that the triple flame plays a central role in
flame spread processes especially on solid surfaces. The PI plans to examine the
dependence of quenching distance on the thermochemical parameters, the shape and
variation of the triple flame structure with stoichiometry, and the heat flux
signatures produced by such flames. He also intends to examine the influences of
the triple flame structure on real, measurable, physical quantities such as heat
flux and excess enthalpy profiles. The PI proposes to use an analytical approach
based on asymptotic techniques and one step chemistry between fuel and oxidizer.
