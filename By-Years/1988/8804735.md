The PI's propose measuring U and Th decay series radionuclides in geothermal
brines and their associated solid phases obtained from commercial geothermal
wells in the Coso Geothermal Field. Past work in the Salton Sea geothermal field
demonstrate that radioactive disequilibria between brines and solid phases can
be used to determine (1) behavior of actinides and their daughters in high
temperature waters; (2) rates of brine-rock interaction, and (3) hydrogeologic
parameters. A crystalline plutonic/metamorphic basement below Coso provides a
different environment (from Salton Sea; sedimentary basement) to contrast the
effects of different host rocks on fluid evolution.
