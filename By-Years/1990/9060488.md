In expressing transformations associated with dynamic 3- dimensional perspective
imagery, log-polar coordinates have recently been shown to possess significant
computational advantages over traditional Cartesian coordinates. Reduced pixel
count and reduction in calculations per pixel suggest the feasibility of
compact, high-performance systems not possible with Cartesian systems. This
award will provide Phase I SBIR funding and will support design of a robot
vision testbed capable of performing useful visual functions such as dynamic
depth mapping and camera/vehicle motion control. This system will incorporate
new algorithms for visual tracking and depth mapping that have recently been
developed in this field, and will reformulate those algorithms form Cartesian to
log-polar coordinates.***
