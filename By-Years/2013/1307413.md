The goals of this project are to advance the theoretical understanding of
hadrons and light nuclei using effective theories that are rigorously consistent
with the fundamental theory of the strong interactions, Quantum Chromodynamics
(QCD). In single hadrons, the project will continue the development of improved
chiral effective theoretical methods in baryons by applying in the low-energy
regime a framework known as the 1/N expansion of QCD. By studying excited
baryons in this framework, this research relevant for the analysis of current
experimental results on baryon resonances from various facilities, including the
Jefferson Laboratory, and it can also be applied to connect with recent results
of Lattice QCD calculations of the excited baryon spectrum. In few-body physics,
the research is focused on applying the combined chiral effective theory and 1/N
expansion to study the nucleon-nucleon potential, with possible extensions to
few-body currents. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will focus on the
fundamental properties of QCD as manifested in the context of hadronic and
nuclear systems. An important mission of this research concerns the education
and training of undergraduate and graduate students at Hampton University, one
of the historically black institutions. The PI's long-standing involvement with
the theoretical and experimental programs at the Jefferson Laboratory provides
students with unique learning and research opportunities at one of the premier
experimental facilities in the world.
