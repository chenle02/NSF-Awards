Transcriptional regulation is an important control step in the developmental and
organ-specific expression of the rbcS gene family in plants. Among plant genes,
the rbcS promoter is one of the best characterized for cis-acting DNA sequence
elements and transacting factors. In contrast, much less is known about the
integration of the regulatory components into the developmental program. Using
tomato as a model system, we have shown that the temporal and organ-specific
activity of each rbcS promoter is correlated with changes in the complex
interaction of DNA-binding proteins with specific DNA sequences that are shared
or unique among the promoter regions. In tomato fruit, all but one of the rbcS
promoter DNA-protein complexes disappear during the transition from young to
ripening fruit. This proposal will investigate the mechanisms that control the
developmental and organ-specific differences in DNA-protein interactions. The
project will focus on five different DNA-binding proteins with unique binding
characteristics. Experiments are presented to establish the function of the
proteins in rbcS transcriptional control and to determine how the expression of
the proteins is regulated in different organs and during fruit development. %%%
This approach will provide novel and important insights into the mechanisms that
control regulatory DNA-binding proteins during plant development.
