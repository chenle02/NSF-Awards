0000096&lt;br/&gt;Gawley&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This two-year award for U.S.-U.K.
collaboration in organic synthetic chemistry involves Robert E. Gawley and a
postdoctoral researcher from the University of Miami and Iain Coldham of the
University of Exeter. The objective of the collaboration is to develop new
methods for the synthesis of complex heterocyclic compounds. The investigators
will extend their work on the configurational stability of aminoorganolithiums.
Both groups have studied reactivity patterns in these generally unstable
compounds and propose to identify structural characteristics using complementary
sets of related, yet different compounds. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The U.S.
investigator brings to this collaboration a unique approach to the study and
development of unstabilized alpha-lithio amines. This is complemented by the
U.K. investigator's expertise on the structure and preparation of the compounds.
His laboratory prepared a compound that demonstrated configurational stability
even at room temperature. The project will advance understanding of new methods
for synthesizing complex nitrogen heterocycles and of the science of organic
synthesis. Heterocyclic compounds are important to pharmacology because the vast
majority of pharmaceutical drugs contain the cyclical arrangement of molecules
that are typically found in this system.&lt;br/&gt;
