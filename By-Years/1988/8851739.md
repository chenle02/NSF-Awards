This award to Montana State University's Department of Earth Sciences is made
in response to a proposal submitted to the National Science Foundation's
Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement Program. The award will provide one-
half of the funds needed to acquire a computer-based geographic information
system for use in the Department's undergraduate training program. The
University is committed to matching the NSF support for this acquisition. The
equipment will be used to upgrade the institution's capability to teach digital
methods of mapping and map interpretation in two new junior-level geography
courses. It will also be used for independent student research projects in
existing junior and senior level courses in earth sciences, agriculture, civil
engineering, and plant and soil sciences.
