Jackson State University will initiate a three-week, residential Young Scholars
(EAI) project in mathematics for 36 students entering grades 7-9. The three-week
summer workshop and subsequent one-day-per-month academic year follow-up
workshops consist of learning activities which include experiments, math-fair-
type projects, field trips and interaction with working mathematicians and
mathematics majors.
