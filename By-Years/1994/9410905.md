9410905 Lo When communication and computing systems merge in the coming
information age, schemes of interfacing photonics and electronics become
increasingly important. One ideal scenario will be integrating photonics and
electronics together to form optoelectronic integrated circuits (OEIC's). Such
OEIC's will not only provide efficient O/E and E/O interfaces but also have
applications in massively parallel interconnect and signal processing. Since
transistors and optical devices (laser and detectors), the workhorses for
electronics and photonics, are mostly made of silicon and III-V compound semi-
conductors respectively, the most sensible OEIC's should combine III-V
optoelectronics with Si electronics. If the technology for such III-V/Si OEIC's
becomes available, exciting new areas such as the integration of optoelectronics
with nanoelectronics and micromachining can be explored. The future impact of
these new areas might be very significant. One fundamental problem for Si-based
OEIC's is that high quality III-V compound epitaxy can not be formed reliably on
Si substrates. Besides, the integration process of forming III-V/Si OEIC's has
not been developed, hindered by the process incompatibilities between III-V and
Si materials. To solve these technical bottlenecks, this research will focus on
three subjects: (1) to develop viable technology to integrate III-V epitaxial
layers on silicon substrates, (2) to develop processes to integrate III-V
optical components with silicon electronic circuits, and (3) to demonstrate
functional III-V/Si OEIC's. ***
