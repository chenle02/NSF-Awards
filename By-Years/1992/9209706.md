The principal investigator's previous theoretical work concentrated on the
nonlinear optical and electro-optical properties of the asymmetric quantum wells
and superlattices. He has shown that in such structures large optical
nonlinearities can occur. He has also shown that these nonlinearities can be
enhanced by Coulomb effects. Some of the theoretical results were confirmed
experimentally by other scientists. He proposes to continue the theoretical
research of novel quantum size heterostructures. The proposal involves the study
of three new phenomena: a) carrier transport in the p-i-p-n and n-i-n-p
modulation-doped superlattices; b)electroabsorption based on the Quantum
Confined Stark effect in type II wide-bandgap superlattices; and, c)
intersubband transitions in the asymmetric quantum wells in the magnetic field.
This research will ascertain the potential for the new heterostructure-based
transistors, photodetectors, and electro-optic modulators and switches. //
