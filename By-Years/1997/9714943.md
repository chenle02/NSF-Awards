This research examines the extent to which group identity and solidarity can
deter shirking and free riding behavior in a group production setting. The
research draws on social identity theory from the social psychological
literature to predict that identification with a group will induce cooperative
behavior. A series of experiments will be conducted to test the impact of group
identity on cooperative behavior.
