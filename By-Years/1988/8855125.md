Science Enrichment for Nebraska Talented Rural Youth, 1989 (SENTRY '89) is a
two-week summer residential program at Nebraska Wesleyan University for Nebraska
high school students from small rural high schools. The forty participants will
include approximately ten Native Americans from the three Nebraska reservations
and twenty women. The academic portion of the project is made up of laboratory-
based experiences in biology, chemistry, physics, and computer science. Evenings
will be devoted to presentations and discussions of career possibilities in
science related occupations. At the end of the project, the participants will
present the results of their academic and other work to their high school
science teachers and principals/superintendents of schools at a banquet- reports
session. During the succeeding academic year, faculty members from Nebraska
Wesleyan University will visit the high schools to consult with the high school
teachers and the participants and to make a presentation (or conduct some other
activity) in the participants' science classes.
