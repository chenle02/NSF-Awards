materials continue to emerge, there is an increasing need for new approaches to
manufacture these materials efficiently, at high yield, and with minimal damage
to the environment. In this project, two green chemistry technologies?ionic
liquid solvents and microfluidic reactors?are combined to engineer new
approaches to nanocrystal synthesis. Ionic liquids are ideal for nanofabrication
reactions because they can act both as solvents and as surface passivation
ligands. Microfluidic systems are ideal because nanocrystal nucleation and
growth processes are exquisitely sensitive to local conditions that can be
engineered and controlled in microfluidic flows.&lt;br/&gt;Beyond the immediate
advantages of green manufacture of nanomaterials, this work promises to provide
novel insights to the role that mixing plays in controlling nanofabrication
reactions. This system will allow for precise control of the timing of the
nucleation and growth phases of nanocrystal formation, allowing for improved
crystal homogeneity and better control over final morphology. Metal oxide
nanocrystals are used as photocatalysts, piezoelectric and photovoltaic
materials, and pigments. The green principles developed in this proposal are
broadly applicable to manufacturing these materials, and will have
correspondingly broad impacts. The proposed work includes an education and
outreach program. At the high school level, the PI will work with the USC Center
for Engineering Diversity to provide laboratory experiences for high school
teachers from local schools. The co-PI will undertake an experimental outreach
program to local community colleges.&lt;br/&gt;
