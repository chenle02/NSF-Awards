The Foundation for Glacier and Environmental Research will initiate an eight-
week, residential, Young Scholars project with a Mathematics and Science
Teaching Perspectives component in environmental and earth sciences for 15
students entering the 12th grade and 3 high school teachers. This summer program
will emphasize field research in Alaska's Juneau Icefield. Students are in the
field the entire period in a seven-day-a-week immersion in on-going and new
research projects. They will be involved in discussions of career possibilities
and the philosophy and ethics of environmental earth science. Involvement will
continue throughout the academic year via preparation of research papers,
presentations at homes schools, and through Newsletters and scheduled reunions
with participants and staff.
