While attempting to solve a problem raised by Talagrand in the context of
deviations from a median, the PI and his collaborators introduced the notion of
the subgaussian constant in the context of concentration inequalities on product
graphs. Estimating the subgaussian constant amounts to estimating a certain log-
moment generating function, and is useful in establishing tight concentration
phenomenon on graphs. Some known (classical) results of Maurey, McDiarmid, and
others are derived using this notion, leaving open still some fundamental
problems, a few of which are addressed in this proposal. Besides the subgaussian
constant, in recent work the PI (with his collaborators) has introduced new
Poincare- and Log Sobolev-type functional constants in the discrete setting of
Markov chains and graphs. Algorithmic problems such as computing and
approximating these and related isoperimetric constants are considered here.
Mathematical problems such as estimating the vertex isoperimetric constant and
its functional analog on product graphs are also
proposed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The combination of combinatorial and functional-
analytic techniques has proved quite fruitful, especially in the last few years,
in investigating discrete isoperimetry, and in establishing tight inequalities
between isoperimetric and Poincare-type constants. These inequalities in turn
were invaluable to problems in extremal and probabilistic combinatorics, and to
the design and analysis of randomized and approximation algorithms. Not as well
understood, in the discrete setting, are the finer so-called Log-Sobolev
inequalities, and their connection to isoperimetric and concentration
inequalities. Some fundamental problems are addressed here with a view towards a
better understanding. In summary, this proposal addresses some important and
current problems in discrete probability and combinatorics. The motivation for
some of these problems stems from questions which arose in the fields of
probability theory and computer science.&lt;br/&gt;
