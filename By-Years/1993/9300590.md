The National Nanofabrication Facility (NNF) at Cornell University is an
interdisciplinary center, the primary role of which is to provide resources and
technical expertise to researchers in microstructures science, particularly in
the areas of advanced lithographies, nanostructure physics, scanning tunneling
microscopy for fabrication and analysis, optoelectronic and electronic
applications, microfabrication applications to biology, and related areas. NNF
provides equipment, training, and expertise to leading edge research in a
"hands-on" environment where the user is responsible for the conduct of that
research. This orientation is unique. In keeping with this role, NNF is
conducting a Research Experiences for Undergraduates program over a ten week
period. In some cases, NNF facilities are used for only a small, but crucial,
part of the fabrication or experimentation. Most of the projects would not be
possible without NNF resources. In all cases, the attraction of NNF is the
quality and open access to central advanced laboratory resources, and the
ability to accomplish complex or unusual microfabrication in a routine way.
