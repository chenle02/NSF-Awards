Pfeiffer OCE-9530389 This award provides funding to purchase shipboard
instrumentation in support of NSF-funded research. The instruments will be used
aboard the R/V CAPE HENLOPEN, a 120 foot vessel, which is owned and operated by
the University of Delaware. The R/V CAPE HENLOPEN operates mainly in the
Chesapeake Bay and along the eastern coast of the U.S. Instrumentation requested
includes a towed CTD system and replacements for a salinometer, an incubator,
and a 12 kHz pinger. The instrumentation requested is required for support of
NSF-funded cruises aboard the CAPE HENLOPEN during 1996 and will enhance the
scientific capability of the vessel in the future. The University of Delaware
will provide $25,260 in matching funds for the towed CTD system.
