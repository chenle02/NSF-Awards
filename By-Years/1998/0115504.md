Lay Abstract for "Characterization of a Candidate Sweet Taste Receptor"

The objective of the proposed research is to elucidate the function of a novel
protein, T1R3, which is present on the surface of taste buds in mice and humans.
The discovery of the T1R3 gene at the chromosomal locus associated with
saccharin sensitivity in mice suggests that the T1R3 protein may be (a receptor)
involved in the detection of sugars and sweeteners. To gain insight into the
potential role of T1R3 in taste, the co-localization in taste bud cells of the
T1R3 protein with other proteins believed to be involved in taste will be
examined. In individual taste cells, the co-localization of messenger RNAs
(mRNAs) encoding T1R3 and other candidate taste tranduction proteins will also
be studied. It is anticipated that this knowledge gained from this research will
lead to a better understanding of how taste signal transduction occurs. In
addition, this research may provide important information towards the
development of improved non-caloric sweeteners and effective therapies for taste
disorders.
