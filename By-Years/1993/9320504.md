9320504 Barro This research will focus on the key economic issue of the
determinants of long-run economic growth. The work will include theoretical
models, empirical estimation and testing of theories, and the construction and
distribution of related data sets. One data set contains panel data for 138
countries over the period 1960 to 1990. A major element of this set is
information on educational attainment by level and sex. Other variables cover
national accounts, demographics, political variables, government activities, and
foreign trade. Another data set will include figures on income and migration
across the U.S. states and for regions of the major European countries, Japan,
and Canada. Preliminary results on the growth rate of real per- capita Gross
Domestic Product for about 100 countries from 1960 to 1985 reveal a "conditional
convergence" effect: countries that begin with low per-capita GDP tend to grow
faster if one holds constant measures of initial human capital (in the forms of
education and health). Government policies are shown to influence a country's
long-run position. The results indicate that growth is enhanced by better human
capital, reduced market distortions, a greater degree of political stability,
and smaller government spending in nonproductive areas. The propensity to invest
is also positively related to growth, but it appears that much of this
relationship reflects the reverse impact of growth on investment, rather than
vice versa. This empirical work will be continued and additional research will
be carried out on regional data and on the long-period information that is
available for about 30 countries.
