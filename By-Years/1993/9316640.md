The goal of this work is to understand the unimolecular reaction dynamics of the
ground electronic states of small molecules and hence of their thermal
unimolecular reactions. Three kinds of experiments will be conducted: 1)
infrared spectroscopy of molecules activated with sufficient vibrational energy
to dissociate, 2) direct measurement of dissociation rates in the range from 1
million to 100 billion per second, and 3) measurement of product energy state
and angular momentum distributions and their scalar and vector correlations as a
function of the initial quantum state of the activated molecule. Special
emphasis will be given to two qualitatively different, prototype molecules-
formyl fluoride and ketene. The dynamics of chemical reactions stands at the
forefront of investigations in contemporary physical chemistry. The primary
purpose of these investigations is to obtain a detailed, molecular level
understanding of the energetics and dynamics of reaction processes. This
involves the preparation of a molecule in defined electronic, vibrational, and
rotational quantum states and observing not only the products of a reaction, but
also how the total energy and angular momentum redistribute themselves among the
various possible reaction channels followed by the parent molecule as it
dissociates into fragments. In contrast to conventional methods in which
chemical reactions can be only crudely controlled through variations of
temperature and pressure, and in which all possible reaction channels are
followed, a detailed, molecular level understanding of the reaction dynamics
offers the possibility of close control of a reaction and thereby maximizing the
efficiency of producing the desired reaction products. The present research will
provide critical data which will allow the testing and further development of
state-of-the-art theoretical models for various aspects of chemical reaction
kinetics and dynamics.
