Abstract Furman

The research component of the project concerns with various aspects of rigidity
in Ergodic theory, Lie groups and Hyperbolic Geometry. The common theme of the
proposed research projects is the analysis of group actions on spaces endowed
with a measurable, topological or geometrical structure. More specifically, in
the context of Ergodic Theory the proposed problems address the structure and
invariants of ergodic equivalence relations on probability spaces generated by
measurable actions of lattices in Lie groups. In the context of Hyperbolic
geometry the goal is to study negatively curved Riemannian structures on compact
manifolds through coarse-geometric point of view on the fundamental group.

Generally, the research component of the project is focused on dynamics and
geometry of various systems which have a rich group of symmetries in the search
of special phenomena occurring due to these symmetries. The educational
component of the project is aimed to contribute to the graduate studies program
via special designed Workshop in Mathematics Seminar and advanced Topic courses.
The goal is to engage students in small scale "self discovery" projects via sets
of challenging problems, to encourage independent thinking and to expose
students to a wide spectrum of current research.
