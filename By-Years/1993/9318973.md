Abstract ATM-9318973 Kutzbach, John E. University of Wisconsin - Madison Title:
An Interdisciplinary Research Program in Climatology Numerical climate models
are used to study how changes in the earth's orbital parameters, the height of
mountains and plateaus, and the location of continents may have influenced the
evolution of earth's climate. The results of climate model experiments are then
compared with the appropriate geological records to test the accuracy of the
models and to understand the processes involved in large climatic changes. These
processes include changes in atmospheric circulation, sea-ice, ocean currents,
land vegetation, carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere, ice sheets, and sea-
level and, therefore, an interdisciplinary approach is required. These studies
will contribute to a better understanding of earth's climatic history and to an
assessment of the accuracy of climate models for estimating possible future
global change.
