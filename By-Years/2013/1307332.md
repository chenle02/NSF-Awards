The electroweak standard model describes two of the four fundamental forces
present in the universe. By conducting experiments that probe with increasing
sensitivity phenomena that can be described with this model, it is hoped
discrepancies will appear that will lead to a more complete understanding of the
weak interaction which is responsible for the decay, or transformation, of the
neutron into a proton, electron and antineutrino. Among the measurements that
can be made involving neutron decay are correlations between the properties of
the neutron and its decay products. One of these correlations, known as little
"a", involves the direction of emission of the electron and antineutrino from
the decay region. Other neutron decay correlations are known to within 1%, but
little "a" is only known to 4%. After several years of planning and
construction, the aCORN ("a" CORrelation in Neutron decay) collaboration is in
the process of collecting data on the fundamental physics beamline at the NIST
(National Institute of Standards and Technology) Center for Neutron Research
(NCNR). This grant will provide support that will allow DePauw University
undergraduate students and the Principal Investigator to continue participating
in the experiment.
