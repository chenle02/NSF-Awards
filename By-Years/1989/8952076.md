During the past 25 years, instrumentation use in chemical analysis has changed
dramatically. The rapid development of mass spectroscopic analysis for example,
has been made possible by advances in computer interfacing, gas chromatography,
and quadrupole mass detection systems. Since mass spectroscopy analysis has
become a routine indispensable tool for identifying organic substances, it is
essential that students majoring in laboratory sciences gain experiences with
this technique. This project enables IUP to implement these goals. The
experiments done by the students allow them to become more proficient in using
the mass spectrometer and in interpreting data produced by this instrument. This
instrument is also used in other laboratory disciplines including Biology,
Medical Technology, Criminology, and Safety Science. The institution is matching
the NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.
