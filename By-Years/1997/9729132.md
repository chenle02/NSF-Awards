ECS-9729132&lt;br/&gt;Papavassilopoulos&lt;br/&gt;The Bilinear Matrix Inequality
(BMI) provides a powerful formulation of a large class of problems appearing in
robust control, such as: fixed order H-infinity, mu / km synthesis,
decentralization, simultaneous stabilization, etc. The BMI can be reformulated
as a nonconvex programming problem and has also very deep interconnections with
the Linear Complementarity Problem and the Semidefinite Programming Problem. In
recent publications several aspects of the BMI pertaining to these problems have
been studied. The basic aim of the proposed research is to examine further the
theoretical structures of the BMI as well as to develop efficient algorithms for
solving it. The development of efficient algorithms for solving BMI's will
constitute a major part of the present effort. The theoretical insights that
will also be pursued will be primarily utilized for gaining insights to be used
in the development of such algorithms. The method to be employed will rely on
the areas of Linear Complementarity, Semidefinite Programming and Parallel
Algorithms for nonconvex programming. Several practical applications of Control
Theory pertaining to robust control stand to benefit from such a study. Besides
robust control, there are also other areas of applications such as signal and
image processing, economics, graphs and combinatorial theory, etc., where such
study will be of use. &lt;br/&gt;*** &lt;br/&gt;
