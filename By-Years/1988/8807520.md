This research will develop a semantic framework for program optimization and
parallelization. Initially, concentration will be on developing a denotational
and an operational semantics for program dependence graphs, since they are the
most important graph-oriented program representation for parallelizing
compilers. It is intended to incorporate the semantics into an interactive
(Lisp-like) interpreter (possibly integrated with an editor) that allows a
compiler writer to test ideas about graph transformation and code generation
techniques. Later plans are to extend the operational semantics into a calculus
for the formal verification of graph transformations.
