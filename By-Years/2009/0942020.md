The project, Assessing the Impact of a Disciplinary Teaching and Learning Center
on Current and Future Faculty Professional Development, addresses a pressing
national need to identify, assess, and promote successful models for increasing
faculty and graduate student involvement in meaningful efforts to revitalize the
undergraduate science curriculum. The project investigates the impact of a
disciplinary-based teaching and learning center and a set of promising
professional development activities directed at establishing faculty-driven
innovations in curriculum reform teaching in science. These types of efforts
have the potential to enhance the educational experience of large numbers of
undergraduate students. Promising practices include teaching and learning
workshops, teaching seminars by visiting scholars, disciplinary and
interdisciplinary teaching communities, individualized mentoring, and travel
grants for faculty and graduate students to attend teaching conferences.
Intellectual merit: The project has the potential to provide evidence on how
faculty and institutions can build capacity for excellence in undergraduate
science education through participation in well-designed professional
development efforts. Broader impacts: The project has the potential to
contribute to the growing literature on the impact of faculty professional
development on teaching and learning in STEM through the identification,
investigation, and promotion of models of faculty professional development. In
addition, the project begins to examine the association between faculty outcomes
from participation in professional development activities with student outcomes
from faculty-driven innovation in science education.
