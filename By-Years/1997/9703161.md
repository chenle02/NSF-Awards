We propose to develop a statistical framework for nonlinear signal processing
for communications by using a recent extension of maximum likelihood estimation,
the maximum partial likelihood (MPL) theory. MPL allows for dependent and
missing observations and sequential processing of data using only the
information that is available at the time of processing. The inclusion of the
dependent data in the framework allows development of techniques for joint
detection and estimation in the presence of sources and channels with memory,
for example to combine maximum likelihood sequence detection with adaptive
equalization. The proposed research includes development of a new class of real-
time adaptive signal processing algorithms based on MPL estimation by using both
gradient optimization and information-theoretic alternating projections, study
of their statistical and dynamic properties, incorporation of order/complexity
determination into the scheme, and implementations in equalization, joint
equalization and sequence estimation, and variable rate speech coding. The
educatimn goals of the PI are shaped by the commitment to equip the students
with the necessary theoretical and practical facilities to solve real-world
problems; to help them mature into resourceful and creative engineers who could
meet the challenges of a discipline rapidly growing in complexity. Information
