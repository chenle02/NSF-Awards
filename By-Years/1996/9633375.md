9633375 Schrag This award will support a study of the relationship between
radiocarbon variability and circulation in the upper waters of the tropical
Pacific Ocean. Specific topics include: 1. the physical processes which
determine the distribution and variability of tropical sea surface Carbon-14; 2.
the physics determining the observed thermocline inventory of bomb Carbon-14;
and, 3. the pathways and timescales for the exchange of thermocline waters
between the subtropical and tropical gyres. This is a collaborative study, in
which scientists at Princeton will focus on analysis of historical records of
C14 found in coral reefs, while scientists at Columbia University will apply
numerical modeling techniques to the problem.
