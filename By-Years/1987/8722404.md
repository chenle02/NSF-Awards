The extent of finite soil deformation caused by liquefaction, flow and
solidification, is addressed in this project. The study of the two- dimensional
interactions between viscous two-component boundary layers and solidification
waves, is undertaken for establishing criteria (based on soil properties and
ground geometry) for predicting the extent of lateral spreading and flow
failures. The study is based on a one-dimensional solidification process and a
model constructed on the basis of two superimposed and interacting continua, the
liquid and the solids. The investigation thus, is an extension and
generalization of those findings to two dimensions, where the analysis focuses
on the development of the two-dimensional constitutive relations between stress
and strain rate in this bi-continuum framework. The results of this study will
provide a more reliable way of predicting the extent of lateral spreading and
flow failures in the event of a ground related hazard, and of estimating the
damage potential to structures.
