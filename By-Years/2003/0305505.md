&lt;br/&gt;Proposal DMS-0305505&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: "Geometry and
Physics"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three
individual researchers supported on this grant. Professor&lt;br/&gt;Freed and
various coauthors study first twisted K-theory and loop
groups,&lt;br/&gt;secondly differential K-theory and geometric invariants of
Dirac operators,&lt;br/&gt;and finally anomalies in M-theory and string theory.
Professor Hausel&lt;br/&gt;researches new mathematics in quaternionic geometry
which corresponds to&lt;br/&gt;known mathematics in complex geometry, such as
the moduli space of Higgs&lt;br/&gt;bundles, square integrable harmonic forms,
integration on circle compact&lt;br/&gt;manifolds and face vectors of hyperplane
arrangements. Professor Uhlenbeck&lt;br/&gt;has two projects on hyperbolic
equations, one of finding fundamental&lt;br/&gt;solutions of covariant-
derivative wave operators and one studying wave map&lt;br/&gt;blow-up in two
space dimensions. She also studies Virasoro actions in
TCFT.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The three supported researchers are part of a large
geometry group whose&lt;br/&gt;research projects span many topics in geometry
which originate in high energy&lt;br/&gt;theoretical physics or engineering
physics. In mathematics proper the work&lt;br/&gt;of the group is not limited to
geometric analysis, but also involves&lt;br/&gt;algebraic geometry, geometric
topology, algebraic topology, representation&lt;br/&gt;theory, harmonic
analysis, and mathematical physics. Essential to the group&lt;br/&gt;research
are collaborations among mathematicians with diverse backgrounds
in&lt;br/&gt;mathematics, physics and biology.&lt;br/&gt;
