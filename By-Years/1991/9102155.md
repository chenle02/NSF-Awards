Many useful thin-walled structures such as aircraft and automatic parts, rocket
casings, helicopter blades, and a variety of containment vessels, are
constructed of layers of anisotropic, filament or fiber-reinforced materials.
While many of these structures are subject to severe mechanical, inertial, or
thermal loads, they must often be designed to remain elastic. This means that it
is particularly important to be able to compute accurately global
characteristics, such as buckling loads and natural frequencies, as well as
local information such as stresses near holes or edges. It is proposed to study
two important, complementary regions of such structures, namely, the interior
where there are no steep stress gradients, and the edge zone(s) where stress
gradients are high. For both regions, simplified, cost-effective asymptotic
methods will be developed. The scope of the investigation will include both
linear and nonlinear problems. It is known that considerations of nonlinear
effects in composites often lead to striking differences from predictions of
linearized theories. In view of the rapid utilization of advanced composite
materials in current technology, studies on large deformations of such materials
promise to have widespread impact on the knowledge and technology base.
