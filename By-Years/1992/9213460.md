This grant will provide support for the ongoing research program of Professor
Xavier Creary at the University of Notre Dame. Kinetics, isotope effects, and
product studies will be used to elucidate the mechanisms of organic reactions
and to characterize reactive intermediates. Dihalodiazirines will be studied in
order to provide evidence for the formation of a diaziryl anion intermediate.
The possibility of a concerted cyclic elimination to give olefinic products
under solvolysis conditions will be explored. Silyl substituted carbenes will
also be synthesized and the migratory aptitude of silicon determined. %%% The
intimate details of several important reactions that transform carbon containing
molecules into new and interesting molecules will be determined. Independent
synthesis of the suggested reaction intermediates in these important
transformations will allow unambiguous evidence for their involvement. The
possibility that the transfer of an electron will trigger some of these
transformations will be examined by careful analysis of the reaction mixtures.
It is anticipated that the results of this study will provide the basis for
predicting the outcome of many reactions.
