The investigator considers a physical system representing a porous medium, such
as a groundwater aquifer or a petroleum reservoir. The movement of, e.g., a
contaminant or oil over several kilometers is strongly influenced by the
properties of the intervening rock. What appears to us to be bulk fluid flow is
actually a complex process of fluid flowing through high and low permeability
regions. To simulate the flow, one generally uses a coarse computational grid.
In subgrid upscaling, one incorporates fine-scale processes within the coarse
grid cells through a local and easily computed subgrid technique. The projects
objective is to obtain provably improved accuracy and computational efficiency.
Moreover, since this technique provides a good and easily computed approximation
to the fine-scale movement of the fluids, the technique will be adapted so that
the full fine-scale problem itself can be solved in significantly less time. One
post-doc, two graduate students, and one undergraduate student will be involved
in the research, and educated in the interdisciplinary environment. The work
will be disseminated at interdisciplinary meetings and in the mathematics,
groundwater, and reservoir simulation literature to maximize its impact.

The contamination of groundwater is one of the most serious environmental
problems facing the nation. Improvements to the predictive capabilities of
groundwater simulations in heterogeneous formations would have a wide-ranging
impact. The engineering of petroleum and natural gas production uses heavily
subsurface simulation technologies as well. The subgrid upscaling method has
shown great promise, and this proposal will further its development while
promoting important educational and societal objectives.
