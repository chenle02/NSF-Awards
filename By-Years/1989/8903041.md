Professor Kupiainen's research project in statistical mechanics has two parts,
one in the physics of disordered systems and the other in the application of
conformal field theory to two-dimensional critical phenomena. In connection with
disordered systems, he will endeavor to develop exact renormalization group
methods for the study of random walks in random environments, of interface
fluctuations in the presence of random fields or random exchange couplings, and
of spin glass models. On the conformal field theory side, he will continue
investigations in which the Wess-Zumino-Witten model is used to solve various
conformal theories. Statistical mechanics studies the behavior of systems
consisting of very large numbers of particles interacting with one another.
Typically, the particles would be arrayed in a lattice and interactions would
take place between nearest neighbors. The basic problem is predict the overall,
long-run behavior (equilibria, phase transitions, and the like) of the system
given information about the interactions. Mathematically, this is a very
difficult undertaking even in the simplest models. A further complication occurs
when elements of randomness are present, as in the research to be undertaken by
Professor Kupiainen.
