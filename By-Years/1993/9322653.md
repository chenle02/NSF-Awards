9322653 Baldwin An educational series on Integrated Product and Process Design
from the National Technological University is now available on video tape. It
can be used by engineering faculty to help students understand the views of a
number of academic, industry and government leaders on the subject. Selected
videos could replace and/or supplement the visits by such people to classrooms.
This project assists in funding the intellectual content of the series, thereby
reducing the required selling price to academe. It is a marketing experiment
which will make an assessment of faculty willingness to use such resources if
they are readily available.
