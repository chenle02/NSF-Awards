Chromatin plays a central role in gene expression during eukaryotic development
and mediates epigenetic phenomena. Our goal is to determine the mechanisms that
contribute to chromatin-based control of gene expression using maize, a premier
model for these studies. It is becoming increasingly clear that understanding
chromatin-level control of gene expression in plants cannot be extrapolated from
other eukaryotes. Rather, direct experimentation in plants is needed.
Understanding how chromatin controls gene expression in maize will provide new
knowledge and molecular tools for precisely and effectively manipulating gene
expression and phenotypes in this and other important crop plants.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;We will identify additional maize chromatin genes, including RNA-
based silencing genes; complete a new set of chromatin mutants for maize (both
RNA interference lines and recessive mutations); test function by assaying lines
for 1) paramutation and epigenetic variegation; 2) transgene silencing; 3) loss
of imprinting; 4) DNA methylation; 5) histone modification of repetitive
elements; 6) changes in gene and transposon expression profiles; and 6)
chromosome cytology. New vectors will enable high-throughput screens of cellular
localization and protein-protein interactions. The combination of different
types of functional data will provide an integrated picture of chromatin-level
regulation of gene expression. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will
contribute to the education and training of students and postdoctoral students
who will work in the participating research groups. In addition, plant genomics
will be the focus of programs for science teachers and for undergraduate student
interns. At the University of Arizona, high school teachers will join plant
genomics labs for an 8-week summer program featuring individual lab work and
development of genomics modules to use in their high school science classes. At
the University of Missouri, science teachers will take part in a one-day
workshop called "Chromatin: All Wrapped Up" as part of a year-long workshop
series focusing on different aspects of plant genetics and genomics. The
University of Missouri will also host undergraduate students from around the
country to participate in 8-week summer internships as part of the Plant
Genomics Internships @ MU program. All of these educational programs actively
seek participants from underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Access to
project outcomes&lt;br/&gt;All resources will be available through the Maize
Genetics Stock Cooperation (http://w3.aces.uiuc.edu/maize-coop/) and data will
be available through The Plant Chromatin Database (ChromDB:
http://www.chromdb.org/). &lt;br/&gt;
