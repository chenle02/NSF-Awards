Under the auspices of the Association of Research Libraries this project is
modifying and repurposing the existing LibQUAL+ protocol for assessing the
services provided for the user community of the National Science, Math,
Engineering and Technology Education Digital Library (NSDL) program. Project
goals include: (a) defining the dimensions of digital library service quality
from the perspective of the users; (b) creating a tool for measuring user
perceptions and expectations of digital library service quality across NSDL
digital library contexts; (c) identifying digital library "best practices" that
permit generalizations across operations and development platforms; (d)
enhancing student learning by managing effectively user perceptions and
expectations of digital library services; (e) establishing a digital library
service quality assessment program as an integral part of the library service
quality assessment program at the Association of Research Libraries; and (f)
institutionalizing continuous product and process evaluation efforts directed
toward positive and timely management of outcomes.
