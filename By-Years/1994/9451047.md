9451047 Moore The objective of this proposal is to equip a teaching laboratory
for a state-of-the-art molecular genetics techniques course. Molecular genetics
is becoming an increasingly important tool in most areas of biological research.
It is critical that students have access to knowledge of molecular genetics and
practical experience in molecular genetic techniques. This course is designed to
introduce the students to the theory and basic biological principles underlying
molecular genetic techniques. Students will also be exposed to a variety of
research programs and job opportunities in areas utilizing molecular genetic
techniques. In addition, students will gain practical experience in a variety of
up-to-date molecular genetic techniques. The laboratory component of the course
will focus on a single organism, Dictyostelium discoideum, in order to give the
students the opportunity to gain some in-depth knowledge about the biological
system on which the experiments are being carried out and to analyze the data
they collect in a meaningful way. In addition to the laboratory experiments, the
students will learn how to access and use computer molecular genetics data
bases. Exposure to computers in the laboratory is essential as computers become
an integral part of biological research. In addition to the material and
techniques learned during the course, increased exposure to molecular genetics
and other laboratory techniques, along with the availability of modern
laboratory equipment, will encourage students to participate in independent
research either with the faculty at Transylvania University or at other research
institutions. Major instruments requested include equipment necessary for
submarine agarose gel electrophoresis, polyacrylimide gel electrophoresis, 2 DNA
sequencing gel electrophoresis systems, a thermocycler, and 4 microcomputers
with appropriate software and accessories.
