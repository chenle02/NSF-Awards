This workshop enhances the knowledge and instructional capability of 80
undergraduate faculty members in the area of Computer Integrated Manufacturing
(CIM). Through experiential teaching methods, faculty participants drawn from
institutions throughout the USA are provided with an intensive overview of the
CAM field. Particular emphasis is placed on illustrating how these concepts can
be successfully introduced into undergraduate engineering curricula. Projects
and demonstrations on CAM-related areas such as CAD/CAM, Computer Aided
Management, Simulation Modeling, and Expert Systems are included. A conference
in which participants in previous summer projects interact with new faculty
participants and report on efforts to introduce CAM undergraduate curriculum at
their home institutions is part of the project as well. //
