The project aims at providing a more streamlined 2+2+2 education in the field of
sustainable agriculture (SA) by improving articulation between Santa Rosa Junior
College (SRJC), local high schools and state-supported universities in
California (CA). High school students are introduced to sustainable agriculture
through outreach and a summer academy program where they receive dual credit and
also credit by examination (CBE) for selected high school courses. For students
enrolled in SA programs at SRJC, improving retention and completion rates are
accomplished through enhanced advising, modifications to curriculum, increased
course offerings and the development of internship opportunities. The project
establishes improved articulation of SA courses with CA's state-supported four-
year institutions such as UC-Davis, UC-Santa Cruz, Chico State and Fresno State
to allow more students to pursue and complete four-year degrees in SA. Students
benefit from experiential "farm to table" learning at SRJC's 365 acre Shone
Farm. Students also learn business and marketing aspects that are critical to a
successful SA operation through internships and student enterprise projects.
Potential benefits of the project include improved stewardship of the land and
natural resources, decreased use of chemicals, healthier food supplies, and new
ways to support small and medium farms.
