The goal of this project is to make end user literature searching an integral
part of student/faculty interaction in research courses in Biology, Chemistry,
and Psychology. To that end, the project will implement the Life Sciences
Collection database on the Bates College campuswide network using Digital
Equipment server technology. Students' proficiency in finding and evaluating
scientific literature will be enhanced by working directly with their faculty
advisors.
