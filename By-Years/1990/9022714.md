A hybrid (combining passive with active) control system will be developed that
incorporates a refined stochastic finite element method for the optimal control
of buildings, bridges and other complex shell structures such as domes, towers,
tanks and chimneys, with uncertain structural parameters and which can be
exposed to random dynamic wind loads. The structural uncertainties are assumed
as random in space. The wind loads are assumed as random in both time space.
This development may also be applied to earthquake loads. The goal is to develop
a hybrid control system that significantly improves the reliability and safety
of complex structures subjected to extreme random loads produced by certain
natural hazards.
