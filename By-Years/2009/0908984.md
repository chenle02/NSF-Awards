(Public Law 111-5).

Dr Charlton and her collaborators will conduct a multi-wavelength survey of
twelve nearby Hickson compact groups of galaxies. Space-based infrared, optical
and ultraviolet images are in hand, and X-ray observations are in progress. The
team will obtain ground-based optical broadband imaging and spectroscopy, to
determine group membership and to measure the star formation and metal content
in the galaxies. With collaborators at the University of Virginia, Dr Charlton
will use the Very Large Array radio telescope to map the distribution of neutral
hydrogen gas in and around the groups. This distribution will be compared to
that of young star clusters, old globular star clusters, and tidal dwarf
galaxies, all of which may reflect interactions between the galaxies.

A graduate student will be trained by participating in the research. Dr Charlton
has an exceptionally strong record in mentoring undergraduate researchers, and
in training graduate students and postdocs. She will also continue to direct
AstroFest, an annual summer public outreach event at her institution.
