The purpose of this fundamental bioengineering research is to provide three-
dimensional images from multiple two-dimensional angiograms. This novel research
involves integrating information from anatomical knowledge, human experience of
interpreting angiograms, and computer vision techniques into a knowledge base.
The knowledge base will be used in construction of the 3-D images.
