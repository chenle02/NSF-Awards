9526344 Halliday This project will develop the new technique of ICP magnetic
sector multiple collector mass spectrometry (MC-ICPMS) for application in two
areas of relevance to petrology and geochemistry - higher resolution
geochronology and precise in situ isotopic measurements. MC-ICPMS combines the
advantages of very efficient plasma ionization with the precision of multiple
collector magnetic sector mass spectrometry. The addition of a laser facilitates
studies for which spatial resolution is needed. The P.I.s will focus their
development work in new techniques that provide a capability not well duplicated
by other methods. In particular, high sensitivity U-Th measurements on low
230Th/232Th samples, Hf isotopic studies of small samples and high precision in
situ laser Sr, Pb, and Hf isotopic measurements will be made with MC-ICPMS. In
the first instance the P.I.s propose using these methods for Sr and Pb isotopic
studies of fluid inclusions, elucidating magmatic histories using high precision
in situ isotopic measurements, U-Th disequilibrium studies of igneous systems,
Hf isotopic studies of zircons and the determination of P-T-time paths using
microscopic mineral inclusions.
