This research is aimed at developing an understanding of the physical properties
of dispersed systems such as emulsions, micelles, colloidal suspensions, and
polymer solutions. One thrust of this research is a quantitative study of block
copolymer adsorption. Systems under study include polar-nonpolar block
copolymers currently in use as pigment stabilizers. Another aspect of this
project is a statistical mechanical model of the structure in electrorheological
(ER) fluids. These fluids exhibit dramatic changes of their rheological
properties upon the application of an electric field.
