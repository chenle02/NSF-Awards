This award will support a "U.S.-Japan Workshop on Technical Japanese" in May
1989 at the University of Washington in Seattle. The workshop is being jointly
sponsored by NSF and the Japanese Ministry of Education, Science and Culture
under the U.S.-Japan Cooperative Science Program. Approximately 18 U.S.
participants will meet with a similar number of Japanese participants for in-
depth discussion on : 1) The present state of Japanese language instruction and
its relation to needs for technological and scientific activities; 2) Existing
philosophies of Japanese language instruction; 3) Instruc- tional materials and
technologies; 4) Instructor training and utilization; and 5) An agenda for
improving technical Japanese instruction. This workshop will provide a much-
needed assessment of the available programs for technically oriented Japanese
language instruction. Likewise, it will initiate U.S.-Japan cooperation in
efforts to improve and expand such programs. These efforts will address one of
the significant barriers to more productive scientific exchange between our two
countries.
