The project increases the number of women and minorities who graduate with
baccalaureate degrees from Columbia College in the fields of mathematics and
computer information systems by awarding scholarships for six students the first
year and 15 for each of the next three years. The project objectives are 1)
attract and recruit academically talented but financially needy women and
minority students to major in mathematics and computer information systems
(CIS); 2) increase retention rates to 80% by providing academic support,
mentoring, and peer leadership opportunities for project participants; and 3)
prepare participants for successful entrance into the workplace or graduate
school upon completion of their degrees. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project
features special support programs including a lunchtime seminar series that
focuses on topics to gear Scholar-Leaders for success in future careers in math
or CIS; mentoring relationships with faculty and industry representatives; and
technological communication about the project. Participants have program
enhancement opportunities offered through the campus Leadership Institute,
department programs (including the Math Lab, The Mathematics and Computing
Society, Math Day, and the Mathematics and Technology Camp), additional
internships, professional meetings, and campus academic support centers.
