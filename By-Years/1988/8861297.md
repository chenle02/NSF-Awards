Non-intrusive, on-line sensors of molten metal atomization have the potential to
improve powder yields through improved process control. The prediction and
control of powdered metal production processes are largely based on operator
experience. The complex relations between the operating variables controlling
powder yield, powder quality and finished product quality are not yet well
understood. Powder quality refers to powder size, powder size distribution, and
the powder microstructure. Rapid solidification will be increased by the
controlled production of smaller powder sizes; improved powder microstructure
and chemical homogeneity are directly related to solidification rates. Current
powdered metal production monitoring practices are limited to visual observation
of sprays by an operator during the production process and a quantitative sieve
analysis after production is completed. Presently there is no on-line sensor to
quantitatively assess powder quality during the course of the batch production
process. Insitec has extensive experience in the design and development of non-
intrusive, in situ instrumentation for particle size, concentration, and
velocity measurements in fossil energy combustors.
