This project focuses on synthesis of El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
related climate information from the written historical record in northwestern
tropical South America. The objective is to construct, if possible, a continuous
chronology of ENSO occurrences and relative intensities back to about 1500 A.D.
The derived chronology would be useful in studies of significant climatically
anomalous periods such as the little ice-age and also be of immense value in
calibrating the ENSO record contained in cores obtained from equatorial mountain
glaciers as well as oceanic regions.
