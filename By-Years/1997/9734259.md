Abstract - Wooldridge This is an investigation of particle formation and growth
in gas-phase combustion synthesis as used for the production of various
materials. The evolution of particle composition in combustion synthesis flames
is characterized using laser spark spectroscopy. Parametric experimental studies
detail the burner conditions that affect particle composition and morphology.
The aerosol dynamic equation is used as the basis modeling particle growth and
in refined as necessary to model single component and multicomponent particle
synthesis. Laser scattering experiments provide data on particle size and number
density for comparison with the models. Evaluation and control of particle
composition in gas-phase combustion synthesis is important, particularly when
several condensed-phase species are present in the flame. The nanocomposite
particles created by these systems can exhibit a variety of morphologies and
chemical compositions.
