Tag1 is an autonomous transposable element in Arabidopsis thaliana. Tag1
excision and expression are restricted to the reproductive cell lineages in
developing flowers. The long-term goal of this research is to elaborate the
mechanisms and identify the host genes that control Tag1 excision and expression
during plant development. The specific objectives of this project are as
follows: (I) Elucidate the developmental control of Tag1 transposase expression
by pinpointing the cells and stages of flower development in which Tag1
expression is active, localizing the cis-acting regulatory elements within Tag1
that are responsible for the developmental control of expression and identifying
host regulatory genes. (II) Elucidate the developmental control of Tag1 excision
by searching for host genes that regulate Tag1 excision, characterizing
mutants/variants that have altered excision patterns, determining the effect of
known mutations on Tag1 excision and cloning the gene encoding the host factor
that binds to the 3' end of Tag1.&lt;br/&gt;Transposable elements provide
powerful tools for studying development and gene function. They have been
exploited for mutagenesis, gene shuttling, gene isolation and cell lineage
studies. The research on the Tag1 transposon of the plant Arabidopsis will
advance the study of (I) developmental and genetic regulation of transposition
in plants, (II) control of plant development and (III) genome
evolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
