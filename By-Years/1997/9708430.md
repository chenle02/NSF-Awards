This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program and the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program and the Office of
Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) will assist the Department of Chemistry at
Cornell University to acquire a two-color, portable laser excitation source.
This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including the
following: (1) dynamics and energetics of H-H, C-H, and C-C bond activation and
(2) photodissociation dynamics of radicals and molecules. A laser can provide
important information about chemical reactivity. Its use may enable
breakthroughs in our understanding of the properties of reactivity and non-
reactivity of molecules..
