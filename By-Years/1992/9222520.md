Changes in hormone levels and metabolism in pregnant females in a number of
species, including humans, can influence the development of the fetus. These
changes in fetal development can result from adaptive responses to normal
fluctuations in the environment as well as from the teratogenic effects of
chemicals injected by the mother. Indeed the toxic effects of nicotine, cocaine
and alcohol result from their interference with the normal biochemical pathways
that regulate fetal development, pathways similar to those used in an organism's
normal adaptive response. Dr. Horton will examine the mechanisms by which the
maternal system transmits information about changes in day length, a naturally
occurring environmental cue, to the fetus during gestation. It is known that
prenatal photoperiodic information influences postnatal rate of growth, body
weight and reproductive development. She proposes that melatonin, a hormone
produced and secreted by the pineal gland, is a likely candidate for this
transfer of information since it crosses the placenta from the maternal to the
fetal circulation and is involved in regulation of circadian rhythmicity. Using
an innovative technical procedure to administer melatonin in a physiologically
meaningful manner, Dr. Horton will identify those factors in the maternal system
which communicate day length information to the fetus. The results of these
fundamental studies will lead to a better understanding of the mechanism by
which the maternal system can alter the unfolding intrinsic genetic program
regulating the development of the fetus.
