Current dredging technologies cause extensive environmental damage, resulting in
high project costs for the Army Corps of Engineers, State Departments of Natural
Resources, and dredging contractors. As such, this team has designed the
"Microdredger" and has been continually conducting customer discovery research,
to ensure that its innovations align with the real pains in the marketplace. The
"Microdredger" is like the Roomba for waterways. It's an intelligent, robotic
system that can continuously and autonomously remove sediment with less
environmental disturbance and human involvement. Instead of a root canal once
every 10 years, the Microdredger? offers its customers a more regular solution,
like brushing your teeth every day. The core values the proposed team offers its
customers are reduced environmental impact, including a 90% reduction in fossil
fuel consumption and a 50-80% reduction of overall project costs by reducing
equipment mobilization and operation costs. As a result, the "Microdredger" has
the potential to expand the existing $2.7 billion maintenance dredging market to
include waterways that cannot be serviced with traditional dredging technologies
obviously helping both the contractors servicing the waterways and the
commercial or recreational activity in the waterbody.

This I-Corps team has developed proof-of-concept prototypes to validate various
aspects of its technological operations; the team is currently finishing up the
development of its beta prototype. At the end of the project, the team expects
to be able to present a sound, validated business model from which it can move
forward with, in its path to commercialization. The proposed activities,
centered around customer discovery and feasibility research, will allow the team
the valuable opportunity to explore and test different distribution channels and
revenue models, among other aspects, while also connecting to key resources and
partners. These activities, guided by expert mentors, give the team the
confidence that they will be able to demonstrate a feasible business model and
commercialization plan at the close of the project.
