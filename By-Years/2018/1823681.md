This project addresses questions confronting modern society due to the rise of
platform capitalism. Platform capitalism, a business model in which people work
for themselves as coordinated algorithmically by a company, spans a wide range
of service, transportation, and manufacturing industries and is changing the
organization and experiences of work, consumption, and everyday life. For
platform enterprises, this study investigates the meaning of work, workplace,
and worker; how social, gender, and family relations are different; and power
relations, such as labor politics and state regulatory power. Findings will
advance scientific knowledge in the field of sociology of work and
organizations. Findings also will increase public and policymakers' knowledge
concerning the nature and effects of platform capitalism, thereby informing
decision-making and contributing to the national
welfare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study focuses on the world's largest platform
economy in terms of revenues and number of participants. Using ethnographic
observations and interviews with management, workers, and government officials,
this research compares work and management relations among three platform
corporations in three sectors: transportation, with majority male drivers;
domestic labor, with majority female domestic workers; and e-commerce, with
majority young shopkeepers respectively. Comparison across the three cases will
help differentiate and theorize the variety of work regimes and labor politics
mediated by gender, generation, and the uneven economic and political interest
of the state. Empirical data on this platform economy will be useful for
sociological analysis, and will provide comparative perspectives for the public,
policy makers, unions and businesses in other expanding platform
economies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
