This research will investigate the design of a peer-to-peer network built around
secure coprocessors. The network, named Marianas, will be designed to have a
level of resiliency in the event of cyberattack on the Internet infrastructure.
The combination of secure coprocessing and peer-to-peer technologies will create
a distributed survivable trustworthy backbone which enables functionality for
critical infrastructure that hitherto did not exist. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A
Marianas node must be highly trustworthy for many applications. The secure
coprocessor's kernel must ensure that applications do not interfere with each
other. Marianas must remain connected during a network cyberattack on the
routing infrastructure. Authentication infrastructure for diverse user,
application, and trust requirements will be developed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
solutions to these problems will draw on technologies for secure execution, PKI,
secure systems, and networking systems evaluation. To prove these concepts,
middle-ware will be developed that encodes the candidate solutions and will be
installed on a small scale Marianas system. Much larger Marianas systems, which
could support critical infrastructure systems, will be simulated to evaluate
their performance, and resiliency in the face of network attack.
