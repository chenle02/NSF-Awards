Gill&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0106206&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Radioactive disequilibria in the
238U and 235U decay chains will be measured and interpreted for young volcanic
rocks from several western Pacific island arcs (Marianas, Sangihe [Indonesia],
and Japan). Specifically, disequilibria between 238U-230Th, 230Th-226Ra, and
235U-231Pa will be measured. Results will be integrated with other geochemical
data to be obtained for the same rocks, especially trace element concentrations
measured by ICPMS and Sr-Nd-Pb isotope ratios measured by TIMS. These
supplemental can fingerprint components which may be in the source region of the
magmas. Special attention will be placed on determining whether results
constrain the physical processes of melting (such as the porosity, upwelling
rate, and melt productivity of mantle in the wedge between the arc and
underlying subducting lithosphere), as is the case in other major sites of
planetary magmatism. Such processes are expected to differ in subduction zones
where melting occurs by fluxing from subducted waters and may be much faster.
The alternative is that the radioactive disequilibria are dominated by the
source components too. By comparing results from three quite different arcs, we
will explore the role of different tectonic environments and source components.
Results for Japan will be integrated with seismic tomographic images of melting
there, which are the best in the world, but it will also be necessary to work
closely with Japanese colleagues familiar with the volcanoes being studied in
order to take the local geological context fully into account. Results will be
disseminated through a University of California K12 partnership
program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
