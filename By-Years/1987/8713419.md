The proposal describes a planned two-day workshop on "Hardware Implementation of
Analog Neuron Nets". The computational methods employed by neuron nets have
received recently considerable attention. Whereas most of the research effort in
this area has been directed toward theoretical work, actual construction of
analog neural machines is still very much in its infancy and is being pursued in
only a few laboratories. This workshop is specifically intended to bring
together key investigators in this field with the aim to discuss critically the
feasibility of different approaches, to evaluate new technologies and to foster
collaboration between workers in the field. The agenda will be restricted to
analog designs and not include neural net simulation on digital architectures.
The workshop shall focus on device implementation as well as system design. The
format of the meeting would emphasize informal discussion.
