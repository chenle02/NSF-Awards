This proposal is to fund student travel to the Security and Human Behavior (SHB)
workshop to be held in May 2018 at Carnegie Mellon University. The goals of SHB
are to discuss, in an informal and interdisciplinary setting, issues where
security, psychology, and behavior interact. The scope is broad: topics that
have been covered in the past include the misperception of risk, security
usability, deception, security and privacy decision making, and so forth. As the
Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) research program has expanded to
include social sciences in addition to its core in computer science, gatherings
such as SHB provide a key venue for interaction between the different
communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students from U.S. universities, or U.S.
students from other universities, will greatly benefit from participating in the
workshop, where they will interact with research leaders from a variety of
disciplines and will be exposed to the most recent developments in information
security and privacy research. In particular, the first rule of the SHB Workshop
is that everyone who attends actually participates in the discussion. This will
ensure that students get more value from attending SHB than many conferences and
workshops where they can simply listen. Further, the organizers will ask invited
senior scholars for suggestions of student participants who are from
underrepresented groups to invite, increasing the chance that the workshop will
broaden participation in the SaTC community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
