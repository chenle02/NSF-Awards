This Special Minority Award provides a third year of support for Gloria
Carrillo, a graduate student in physics at the University of Minnesota. With the
completion of formal academic requirements (expected in Fall, 1990), Ms Carrillo
will be ready to devote full time to research in pursuit of her Ph.D. This award
is an integral part of the strategy of the National Science Foundation to
strengthen and increase minority participation in the field of physics.
