&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research and education program in superstring
phenomenology will focus on physics at the intersection of string theory,
particle theory and cosmology. The PI together with students will focus on (1)
constructing realistic particle physics models and early universe cosmology
arising from string theory, (2) explore the low energy and cosmological
consequences of string theory; and (3) conversely use low energy particle
physics and cosmological measurements to test and constrain string theory. The
PI will work with teachers in local rural high schools as a mentor of the
Undergraduate Research Scholar program, and will also organize workshops to
train high school teachers in frontier topics of physics&lt;br/&gt;
