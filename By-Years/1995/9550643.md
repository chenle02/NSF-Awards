9550643 Hill Planning activities related to the investigation of Bartonella
bacilliformis receptors and signaling mechanisms are proposed. Specific aims of
the planning activities include (1) performance of preliminary investigations on
Bartonella bacilliformis (2) collaborations with Dr. Hoover (at Vanderbilt) and
Dr. Minnick (at the University of Montana) and (3) attend several scientific
meetings. The specific aims of the research are (1) identify and characterize
the Bartonella receptor on host cell surfaces (2) determine whether protein
phosphorylation has a role in the uptake of Bartonella into host cells (3)
determine whether outer membrane proteins of Bartonella can stimulate host
target cells to proliferate. ***
