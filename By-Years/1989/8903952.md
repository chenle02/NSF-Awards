The principal theme of this research is the application of group- theoretic
techniques to a wide variety of search problems. The ultimate objective is to
combine algebraic techniques with standard search methods to solve problems
which are currently solvable by neither method alone. The research has three
major aspects; the development of an experimental system for testing algorithmic
ideas; and the exploration of methods for representing search problems in an
algebraic setting, and of tools for solving them. The algorithms to be studied
play a central role in most applications of group theory to real world problems.
Group membership is used to construct a solution, minimum word algorithms
correspond to the simplification of a solution, and a change of basis represents
a transformation of the group data structure into a domain which is more
suitable for improving time and space utilization. Applications are numerous.
Examples range from the transporation problem in operations research to
minimization of pin count in VLSI. Both algorithms and applications are being
implemented in the context of a unified environment which is engineered to
support experimentation with a variety of data structures and approaches.
