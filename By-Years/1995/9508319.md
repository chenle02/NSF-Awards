9508319 Wolff We propose to study the effects of immigration of unrelated
individuals on the breeding success of established residents in a habitat patch.
Males or females that enter unfamiliar groups often disrupt reproduction by
committing infanticide on young individuals or by disturbing normal breeding
patterns. This study will document breeding success, survival, and population
growth of the gray-tailed vole in habitat patches differing in degree of
isolation. Animal movement, survival, and numbers will be determined by live-
trapping, marking, and releasing animals within experimental enclosures. This
study will allow us to test the role of kinship versus unfamiliarity in the
breeding success of animals in fragmented landscapes. Construction of corridors
to permit movement of animals between fragments has been suggested as a
mechanism for maintaining viable populations increasingly fragmented by human
activity. This study will contribute to our ability to manage habitat patches by
increasing our understanding of the effect of behavior on breeding success.
