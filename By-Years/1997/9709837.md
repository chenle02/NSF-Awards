Atomic level studies of structure and reactivity of bimetallic surfaces are
carried out in this research project supported by the Analytical and Surface
Chemistry Program and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities. Professor Koel
and his coworkers at the University of Southern California have developed ultra
high vacuum scanning tunneling microscope instrumentation which allows the
identification of adsorption sites and molecular adsorbates on metallic
surfaces. Correlations between reactivity of model bimetallic surfaces and the
atomic level structure and occupation of step and defect sites on these surfaces
will be made. Pt-Sn alloy surfaces, and Pd thin films on refractory metal
substrates are being examined, and various hydrocarbon reactions on these
surfaces, including acetylene trimerization to form benzene, are being probed.
Insights gained from these studies will be valuable in developing our
understanding of important catalytic processes. Correlations between atomic
level structure of bimetallic surfaces and the reaction chemistry of these
surfaces are being made in this research project. Hydrocarbon reactions relevant
to heterogeneous catalysis are examined on well characterized Pt-Sn and Pd-Mo
substrates, in order to probe the effect of metal atom ensembles and defect
sites on these surfaces. Atomic level characterization using scanning probe
microscopy forms the basis of these studies which will provide insight into the
operation of important catalytic systems.
