Phosphorus, an essential element for plant life, gets into water through urban,
suburban and agricultural sources, including lawn fertilizers, septic systems
and livestock manure. As a pollutant, this nutrient has impacted streams,
rivers, lakes, coastal waters and bays - including the Chesapeake Bay - for the
past several decades. In particular, phosphorus loading may cause eutrophication
--excessive algal growth as well as dead zone--a reduction in the amount oxygen
dissolved in water. Negative economic impacts and serious environmental and
human health issues result. This research will develop the methodological
framework to study different sources of inositol phosphate compounds and their
subsequent degradation products in soils and waters. Data and information on
phosphorus pathways and processesing from this project will be provided to the
Chesapeake Bay Program, U.S. Geological Survey and Environmental Protective
Agency, who collectively develop Chesapeake Bay restoration plans. This research
will also inform the development of an Environmental Forensics and Society
course at UD and enhance curricula at the local community college and an
environment forensics summer camp. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Inositol phosphates
(IPx where x = 1 to 6), an important type of organic phosphorus derived from
leaf litter and animal feed and manure, are increasingly recognized for their
multifunctional role from cellular signaling to environmental significance. This
research project will address fundamental gaps in the knowledge regarding
identity, lability, bioavailability, transformation, and degradation pathways of
inositol phosphates by stable isotope tracking aided by 1D and 2D Nuclear
Magnetic Resonance (NMR), High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and
HPLC-Mass Spectrometry (HPLC-MS) techniques both in controlled laboratory
experiments and in field experiments in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Synthesis,
isotope labeling, and functional group derivatization of IPx compounds and
application of a multi-isotope tool will be used to differentiate degradation
products. Connecting sources and products of various IPx compounds through
isotope signatures and particular isotope effects during degradation will
identify accurate residence times in soils and waters and address longstanding
question on accumulation versus degradation and their environmental impacts.
