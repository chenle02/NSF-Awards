9522206 Kassner The ductile fracture Mechanisms of constrained metals will be
studied using an integrated mechanics-materials science approach. Common
engineering situations involving constrained metals are thin interlayers such as
welds and brazes, metal interconnects in integrated circuits and some
composites. Current theories for ductile fracture are generally based on cavity
growth which in turn require unrealistically large plastic strains. two new
cavity expansion models that do not require macroplasticity or cavity nuclei
coalescence based mechanisms appear to be more reasonable. High triaxial stress
states will be studies using silver interlayer specimens that are free of bulk
defects. Changes in the void microstructure of the interlayer will be examined
at small plastic strains via the scanning electron microscope and high voltage
transmission electron microscopy. ***
