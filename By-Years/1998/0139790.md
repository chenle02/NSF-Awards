0139790&lt;br/&gt;Savrda&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With funds from this grant, the
Department of Geology and Geography at Auburn University will acquire a
carbon/sulfur determinator system for the analysis of organic carbon and sulfur
components in sediments and sedimentary rocks. Acquisition of this equipment,
which will replace a now-inoperative and obsolete carbon analyzer, will help
maintain and enhance existing research and teaching programs that involve
detailed characterization of fine-grained sedimentary materials and evaluation
of their depositional environments and their hydrocarbon-source potential. The
principal investigator and his students are and will be involved in research
programs that will benefit significantly from accurate measurement of
sedimentary organic carbon and/or sulfur contents. These programs involve (1)
reconstruction of marine basin paleo-oxygenation histories; (2) evaluation of
causal mechanisms for depositional cyclicity in rhythmically bedded pelagic
carbonate sequences; (3) sequence stratigraphy of passive-margin successions and
interpretation of sea-level dynamics; and (4) analysis of ancient nearshore and
marginal marine environments and processes. &lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
