&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this research involves the development of metal
catalyzed bisdiene and enediene carbocyclization reactions for use in total
synthesis. The target molecules for the methodology include two dolabellane
diterpenes, two indolizidines and the lycopodium alkaloid
phegmarine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular
Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. James M. Takacs in the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Professor Takacs
will focus his research efforts on developing transition metal catalyzed
carbocyclization methodology for the synthesis of biologically active molecules.
There is potential for broader impact of the work for the pharmaceutical
industry and the project presents an excellent arena for the training of
undergraduate and graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;
