9409295 Zukow-Goldring ABSTRACT A conference on "Changing Ecological Approaches
to Development: Organism-Environment Mutualities" will be held at the University
of Connecticut, September 29-October 2, 1994. Participants represent an
interesting mix of perspectives and will include researchers who normally do not
participate in the same conferences nor publish in the same journals: those who
work in ecological psychology and those who work in epigenetic and dynamic
systems. Leading researchers will each discuss the same set of questions in
light of their particular work to provide coherence among the presentations.
Discussants will represent different theoretical approaches in order to
challenge the presenting participants. A book based on the conference
presentations will be published by the American Psychological Association. ***
