Dr. Michael Greenberg is the Scientific Director of the University of Florida's
Whitney Marine Laboratory, located in Marineland, Florida. The Lab is well known
for its use of marine animals in neurological and cell biology research, and it
supports a variety of research projects that require lab facilities for
microscopy and molecular techniques. In particular, recent growth in the Lab's
activities in histology and microscopy have strained the resources available to
resident and visiting researchers. To serve these increasing demands, Dr.
Greenberg proposes to renovate one microscopy. These additions will increase the
Lab's ability to host visiting research projects. A variety of biological
disciplines will benefit from the enhanced capabilities of this research
facility.
