This REU in Mathematics will be held at the University of Notre Dame, from June
27 to August 5. It is anticipated that eight mathematics majors who have
finished the sophomore or junior year will be involved. Students will work on
research projects tailored to their background, and will take two minicourses:
one in Algebra, the other in Topology. Students will be recruited from around
the country, but will include some Notre Dame students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
