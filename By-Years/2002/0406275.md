AST 0406275&lt;br/&gt;De Pater&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Io, with its tidal-heating
driven volcanoes and complex interaction with Jupiter's magnetosphere, is one of
the most remarkable bodies in the solar system. Although the satellite has been
studied extensively by spacecraft, many questions remain unanswered. In
particular the heating and heat loss processes are not understood in any detail.
It also is still a mystery why certain volcanoes are associated with gas plumes
and others are not at all. These questions might be answered ultimately if the
frequency, spatial distribution, and eruption style of volcanoes are known.
These parameters can only be derived by monitoring Io from the ground using
Adaptive Optics (AO) techniques on large ground-based telescopes. Dr. De Pater
and her collaborators will continue a program of high resolution observations
with the Keck telescopes, on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, and an extension to the Gemini
telescopes, in Hawaii and Chile, the Very Large Telescope, in Chile, the 3-meter
telescope at Lick Observatory, and the Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF), on
Mauna Kea, Hawaii. This may be the only way to map ongoing volcanic activity and
chart changes on Io. Only through excellent temporal coverage can one set limits
on the amount of, and variations in, the total heat flow and the latitudinal and
longitudinal distribution of this activity. These limits will be compared with
those derived from eruption rates via volcano thermal models and with tidal
heating models. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students and the public love Io with its
giant volcanoes. It is an ideal subject for public presentations and for
classroom teaching, where chemistry, physics, geophysics, and astronomy can be
combined. Graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in the data
processing and analysis techniques on this project. Hawaiian students will be
involved in Io observations at the IRTF. &lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
