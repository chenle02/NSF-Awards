This award supports Dr. John Levine and a post doctoral student from the
University of Arizona in a collaboration with Hans Joachim PflÂ¼ger of the
Department of Neurobiology at the Free University of Berlin. The collaboration
will determine the neuronal pathways through which identified octopaminergic
modulatory neurons are recruited during well- characterized behaviors including
crawling, walking, flight, kicking, and ekdysis. In addition the U.S. and German
groups will determine how the patterns of modulatory neuron recruitment are
modified to accommodate behavioral changes at metamorphosis. Modulatory neurons
release substances, including biogenic amines or neuropeptides that influence
the function of the central and peripheral nervous systems profoundly. Although
there is much information regarding the effects of modulatory substances on
target neurons or muscles, relatively little is understood about the neuronal
circuits that activate the modulatory neurons. This collaboration will use two
complementary and well- characterized insect model systems to investigate the
mechanisms involved in recruitment of those neurons.
