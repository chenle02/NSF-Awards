9504176 Wolpert The investigator proposes to continue his investigations of the
large eigenvalue asymptotics of hyperbolic Riemann surfaces. He proposes to
consider the question of unique quantum ergodicity for the classical modular
group, connections between spectral asymptotics and questions in number theory,
and the geometry of the moduli space of real projective structures for a compact
surface. Riemann surfaces can be thought of as multi-sheeted covers of the
plane; have interesting topological properties. In addition, Riemann surfaces
play a crucial role in the study of complex-valued functions (the graph of a
complex-valued function is a surface in a 4-dimensional space). Indeed they were
originally constructed as natural domains for complex-valued functions.
