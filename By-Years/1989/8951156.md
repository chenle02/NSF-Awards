New instruments will be used in two courses in a Recombinant Gene Technology
Program. In a course in Recombinant Gene Technology, an integrated series of
laboratory exercises will involve: 1. usage of an oligonucleotide synthesizer to
prepare mutagenic oligonucleotides for subsequent use in site-directed
mutagenesis of functionally important nucleotide sequences in cloned genes, 2.
DNA sequencing analysis involving the sequencing gel electrophoresis apparatus
to ascertain incorporation of mutagenic nucleotides in the cloned DNA, 3.
Northern electroblot and slot blot analysis of RNAs transcribed from the
mutagenized DNA templates for the ability to undergo splicing. In the Cell and
Subcellular Biology course, laboratory exercises will expose students to
separation of megabase-sized DNAs utilizing pulse-field electrophoresis
apparatus. Further application of this technique to the localization of genes on
chromosomes will be employed by subsequent Southern blotting and gene probing of
pulsed-field gels. The college will provide 50% matching funds.
