Funding is requested for costs of registration and travel for young
investigators to the first North American Regional Meeting of the International
Environmetric Society, taking place in Seattle, WA, June 19-21, 2007. The theme
of the meeting is "Climate change and its environmental effects: monitoring,
measuring, and predicting." Invited session include Paleo-climate assessment,
Agro-risk assessment, The role of statistics in public policy, and Assessing
trends in extreme climate events. Keynote speakers will be Paul Switzer of
Stanford University, and David Brillinger of the University of California at
Berkeley.

The International Environmetric Society has traditionally held international
meetings every year. A few years ago the European region of the society starting
holding regional meetings. The request for this type of regional meeting has
been particularly strong from government employees, who have found international
travel difficult under limited travel budgets. The meeting will focus on
quantitative aspects of environmental science, and is expected to draw some
100-150 participants. The focus and size of the meeting will enable strong
interactions between environmental scientists and statisticians/mathematicians.
