Two-phase disordered media are most frequently encountered in modern
technological applications of the physical and chemical sciences. A common
example of such media is heterogeneous mixtures consisting of a fluid phase
dispersed in a solid porous medium. The mission of the proposed research is to
study thermal instability phenomena associated with buoyancy- driven convection
in two classes of fully-saturated systems: (i) porous media saturated with pure
fluids, and (ii) porous media saturated with binary fluids. We propose a
rigorous analytical and experimental program to investigate pattern formation
during natural convection in large aspect ratio enclosures filled with porous
media. Our primary objectives are: (1) the delineation of the various stability
domains for the convective flows and an exploration of the convective states
after the onset of secondary instabilities, (2) the development of novel
experimental techniques, including non- invasive magnetic resonance imaging, for
high precision measurements and determining the flow patterns in porous media,
and (3) the validation of macroscopic governing equations for natural convection
in porous media.
