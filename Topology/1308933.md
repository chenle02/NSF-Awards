This project combines two principal areas of current research in homotopy
theory: Goodwillie's calculus of homotopy functors and operad theory. The
overall goal is to understand the universal structure possessed by the
Goodwillie derivatives of a functor, from which the Taylor tower of the functor
can be reconstructed. The PI and Greg Arone have proved the existence of such a
structure in the form of a coalgebra over a certain comonad. In the case of
spectrum-valued functors, there is a close relationship between this comonad and
those associated to right modules over various operads, including the little
disc operads. We now study the corresponding comonads for space-valued functors,
as well as for derivatives at arbitrary base objects. We also apply our previous
theory to calculations such as the Taylor tower of algebraic K-theory. The
Koszul duality of operads of spectra plays a key role in this theory, and we
study this duality in its own right, building on previous work of the PI and
John E. Harper. The main goal here is to get an equivalence between the
categories of algebras over one operad and of divided power coalgebras over the
Koszul dual operad.

Topology is the study of properties of shapes and spaces in any number of
dimensions. One particular goal is to develop ways to measure aspects of these
spaces that are usually considered qualitative. For example, a basic problem is
to give a precise description of the difference between the shapes formed by the
surface of the Earth (a sphere), and the surface of a bagel (a torus). The
difference is intuitively clear - the bagel has a hole - but giving a precise
definition of what we mean by a 'hole' in a shape allows us to make calculations
in higher dimensions, where intuition is less reliable. Some of these
calculations (the so-called 'homotopy groups of spheres') turn out to be
extremely complicated and have been studied extensively. This project is
concerned with systematic approximations to these calculations that are
analogous to the Taylor series of undergraduate calculus. Our central goal is to
understand how more complex calculations can be built, in a natural way, from
simpler pieces. A good understanding of the pieces should then provide us with
better tools for making the hard computations. The foundational nature of our
approach lends itself to applications in a range of areas of mathematics,
including homological algebra and representation theory, in addition to
topology.
