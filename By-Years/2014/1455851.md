A new Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site will be located at
Texas A&M University's campus in College Station, TX. The Geochemical and
Environmental Research Group (GERG) and the Department of Oceanography will host
10 REU students for 10 weeks each summer, and the program will focus on
innovative ocean observing technologies. Students will have access to a suite of
ocean data acquisition technologies incorporated in TAMU's offshore buoy system,
glider technology, remote real-time measurements from moored instrumentation,
shipboard field surveys with CTD profiling and water sampling. A group project
to develop and deploy a glider mission in the Gulf of Mexico onboard a research
vessel will promote team building. Training modules on sensors, data analysis,
graphical representation of oceanographic data, data management, and science
writing will be provided. Students will participate in weekly REU seminars, and
at the program end, they will demonstrate their communication skills with a
final written report and a seminar presentation at the GERG REU Student Research
Symposium. Although the program is open to students who are US citizens or
permanent residents attending any university, local recruitment efforts will be
coordinated with faculty in the NSF-funded Alliance for Graduate Education and
the Professoriate (AGEP) program which supports mentoring of STEM majors across
TAMU branch campuses (Kingsville, Corpus Christi, Prairie View and West Texas).
