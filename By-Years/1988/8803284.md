The principal investigator, along with Dr. Donnelley from England, will
continue the research in mathematical models in molecular evolution and
population biology. The particular problems are quite diverse and build on the
results previously obtained by their collaboration. A more powerful statistical
test for neutrality will be designed assuming that the age- ordering of the
alleles in the sample is known. Asymptotic theory will show that the weak limit
for the age-ordered allele frequencies of a range of exchangeable models lead to
the GEM distribution. The canonical representation of the genealogical urn model
will be used to provide more detailed description of the evolution of the
population. Distribution of the segregating sites in a sample from a stationary
population of an infinitely- many sites model will be found. New statistical
methods will be developed for the analyses of substitution rates and divergence
times in pairs of homologous sequences.
