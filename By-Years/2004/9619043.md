9619043 Frascella The Indiana Mathematics Initiative (IMI) is a five-year
teacher enhancement and curricular implementation effort involving a partnership
among Indiana University, the Middle Grades Network, and twelve urban school
districts in Indiana. The project provides extensive professional development
experiences of 132 - 180 hours for each of 445 mathematics teachers and
administrators in 62 middle and secondary schools that are fully committed to
mathematics education reform at all grade levels. The experiences are designed
to enable each teacher to use effectively one of four sets of NSF-supported
middle school instructional materials (Connected Mathematics, Mathematics in
Context, Seeing and Thinking Mathematically, or Six through Eight Mathematics)
or one of four sets of NSF-supported secondary school materials (Core Plus,
ARISE, Interactive Mathematics Program, or SIMMS). Submitted under the
guidelines for Local Systemic Change through Teacher Enhancement in Mathematics,
Grades 7-12, the project seeks to create significant changes in how the teachers
perceive mathematics and how it is learned, as well as in their views of their
roles in middle/secondary mathematics classrooms. These changes will be effected
in a variety of ways: (1) intensive and extensive meetings, seminars, and
workshops involving the teachers, IMI staff, and representatives of the
curriculum projects; (2) continuous support and technical assistance by IMI
staff following seminars and workshops; (3) leadership development of lead
teachers, district curriculum coordinators, and other school administrators to
insure sustained, systemic change; and (4) coordination with current state
reform efforts, especially Indiana's upcoming mathematics textbook adoption
process. Non-federal cost-sharing in the project is over $ 2,000,000, of which
more than $ 1,740,000 is to be derived from the twelve participating school
districts, approximately $ 227,000 from Indiana University, and approximately $
35,00 0 from the Middle Grades Network.
