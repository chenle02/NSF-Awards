It is now well established that there is a critical need for researchers who can
think creatively to solve problems in data science in various interdisciplinary
fields. Further, there is a scarcity of workforce and opportunities to train the
next generation of researchers to tackle the problems in data science. To
address the scarcity, this Data Science Across Disciplines Research Experiences
for Undergraduates (DSAD-REU) Site will immerse undergraduate students in an
interdisciplinary research-intensive training and mentoring program. The impacts
of this site will extend beyond the project duration in a number of ways. First,
students will be exposed to a variety of data science research projects that are
bound to stimulate passion for data science research and help them seek either
industry careers and/or graduate degrees in this area. Second, the site students
will serve as peer mentors and brand ambassadors for data science research at
their home institution to bring more awareness to the field. Finally, it will
open students to vast opportunities in academia, industry and
government.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of the DSAD-REU are that
students will participate in data science research in different domains such as
healthcare, social science, and exercise science. The studentsâ€™ participation in
data science research will lead to outcomes such as: (1) increased confidence in
their ability to carry out a data science research project; (2) improved ability
to apply abstract concepts learned in the classroom to actual applications; and
(3) increased competence in verbal and written communication of research
findings and experience to a diverse audience. It is important to provide the
requisite background to undergraduate students who may have little or no
background research experience in data science related areas. Hence, a 3-day
mini boot camp on introduction to data science will be offered during the first
week of the program. The program is composed of interesting projects in the
broad field of data science across different disciplines, whose purpose is to
arouse the intellectual curiosity, challenge the students to develop novel
solutions that will advance the state-of-art, and improve oral and written
communication skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
