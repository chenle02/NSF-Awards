The physics of disordered, correlated Bose sytems constitutes a major challenge.
Recently a density controlled superfluid transition was observed in helium-four
absorbed in porous materials with a superfluid density exponent contrdicting
earlier theories; new types of scaling behavior of the resistivity have been
seen in disordered superconducting films and wires; and the observation of a
possible universal conductance in granular superconducting films has attracted
considerable excitement. A related problem of primary importance is the vortex
state of the high temperature superconductors, where an unconventional, vortex-
glass phase has been observed in some materials. At the same time, the discovery
of heavy fermion and oxide superconductors has driven a substantial improvement
in numerical techniques and also led to genuinely new analytical approaches to
strongly correlated fermions. These advanceshave yet to be applied to the
interacting boson problem. The research will apply Quantum Monte Carlo, the
Schwinger boson approach and the perturbative scaling methids of localization
theory to explore the quantum phase transitions taking place in helium-four
absorbed in porous media and granular superconductors, as modeled by a
disordered, interacting boson Hamiltonian. The disorder will be handled by
methods which were successful in the spin-glass problem, among others finite
size scaling of appropriately chosen dimensionless quantities, and a suitable
version of the maximum entropy method. %%% Theoretical research will be
conducted using numerical and analytical techniques to study the behavior of
disordered, interacting many particle systems which obey Bose statistics. New
methods will be applied to describe such diverse physical systems as properties
of helium absorbed in porous materials and the behavior of high temperature
superconductors.
