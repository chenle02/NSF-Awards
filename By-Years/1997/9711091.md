This is a one year project to generate software and a pilot infrastructure for
measuring Internet performance. The project could lead to positioning probe
machines throughout the Internet to collect data to assist in identifying
current and long-term performance characteristics of portions of the Internet
and the overall system. The project is patterned after Network Probe Daemon
(NPD), a prototype by one of the co-PIs which instrumented 37 Internet sites to
perform the first large-scale measurements of end-to-end Internet behavior
regarding routing and connection dynamics. This project also will establish the
framework for producing a national Internet profile to record the network's
performance over time.
