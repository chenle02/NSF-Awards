The goal of the investigation is to study the interdiffusion and interface
reactions in semiconductor materials, particularly metal-semiconductor
interfaces. The emphasis in ongoing new insight into the atomic behavior
associated with such reactions to include crystallization, grain growth, and
dislocation behavior. The primary analytical technique is dynamic, in-situ high
resolution electron microscopy, and x-ray diffraction, Auger electron
spectroscopy, Rutherford backscattering will provide complementary information.
The research concentrates upon both the thorough understanding of the reactions
of metals with semiconductors as well as the reactions within the semiconductors
as the reaction progresses from the very beginning of the formation of the
interface.
