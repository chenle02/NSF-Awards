0237750 Schnoor This proposal is for a joint workshop on mathematical models for
the management of water quality problems in the United States and Europe. The
workshop will be held in Venice and the US delegation will be led by Professor
Gerald Schnoor. The Italian coordinator is Professor Marcello Benedini. This
workshop collaboration will advance the state-of-the-art as well as provide some
practical solutions for modeling water quality problems such as eutrophication,
ecosystem habitat suitability, and hypoxia.
