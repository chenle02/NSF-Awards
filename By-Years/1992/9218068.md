The study of variable stars is basic to much of astronomy. The properties of the
variability provide more information than can be obtained from static stars and
they contribute greatly to our understanding of stellar structure and evolution,
galactic evolution and cosmology. This project concerns modelling of stellar
instability and understanding its systematics. A new nonlinear adaptive
hydrodynamic code which produces better agreement between the models and the
observations has been developed. This new method resolves and tracks the
important physical features during the pulsation cycle. In this study, the
results from the new code will be combined with the PI's previously developed
semi-analytical theory of pulsation to gain insights into the mechanisms. The
stars which will be considered range from the regularly varying Cepheids and RR
Lyrae stars to the erratic RV Tauri stars and Semi-regular variables. The
effects of stochastic noise on pulsations and methods of analysis of time-
dependent signals will also be studied in the context of comparing the
theoretical results with observation.
