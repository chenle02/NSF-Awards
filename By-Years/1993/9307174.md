The Workshop on Technology and Sustainable Development will take place on
February 16 and 17, 1993, at the National Science Foundation Headquarters. The
purpose of the meeting is to gain a better understanding of the engineering-
related critical issues in achieving sustainable development in the United
States, and to develop a research agenda, set priorities, and determine resource
needs for promising cost effective technologic advances in this context.
Remedial and preventive environmental technologies will be discussed together
with emerging research opportunities in the area of clean extraction of natural
resources; manufacturing, use and disposal of products; and management of
wastes. The findings and recommendations from the workshop will be published and
will help in developing ENG programmatic lines in this important research area.
