The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project is to provide a novel hardware and software architecture for finance,
resource planning, insurance, and cybersecurity applications. The proposed
technology will reduce costs and improve decision-making quality. This project
will provide on-demand resources via the cloud, on premises for privacy, and in-
situ for immediate reaction. Providing capability for on-demand access via cloud
providers will expand access to more communities, as well as to educational
institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research
(SBIR) Phase I project expands the frontier of streaming graph analysis. Current
analysis methods assume a static environment with full visibility. This project
proposes a system for streaming graph analysis without strict instantaneous
assumptions unless required and with the capability to evolve queries as data
are updated. The proposed system will respond sufficiently fast to address the
needs of fast-paced applications, such as financial and news
updates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
