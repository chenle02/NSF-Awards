This project will support U.S. scientists to participate in a SCOPE sponsored
workshop that will address integration of terrestrial and aquatic phosphorus
cycles in the Amazon Basin of South America. The goal of the workshop is to
assemble and integrate data on the phosphorus cycle for the Amazon Basin. The
workshop will address sources, sinks and fluxes of P, mechanisms of supply of
biologically active P, and evaluate the environmental effects of current and
projected use of phosphorus in relation to biogeochemical cycles of carbon,
nitrogen, and sulphur. This information will be integrated in a regional
analysis. The workshop will bring together recognized experts from several
disciplines to evaluate current understanding of phosphorus cycling in the
Amazon Basin. The products of the workshop will be 1) a publication of the
position and data papers presented, 2) identification of areas where careful
management of phosphorus resources will be required to optimize food and fiber
production and minimize hazard in various environments, and 3) development of a
conceptual model and extension of a simulation model to integrate existing
knowledge and develop a better understanding of P cycling in relation to carbon,
nitrogen and sulphur in the Amazon Basin.
