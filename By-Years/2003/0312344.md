The evolution of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence resulting from magnetic
reconnection will be investigated, and subsequently employed to evaluate the
transport and acceleration of energetic particles in solar flares. The cascade
of turbulent energy from large to small scales and its dissipative damping
through the heating and acceleration of particles determine the evolution of the
plasma fluctuations. The transport coefficients for the electrons and protons
follow from the coupling to the fluctuations, and enter into a Fokker-Planck
equation describing the energy spectrum and pitch-angle distribution of the
superthermal particles. Incorporation of these results into a coupled and self-
consistent solar flare model will provide specific predictions that can be
tested against ground, and space-based observations.
