This project will support 25 students to attend the IEEE International Parallel
&amp; Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS'14) conference in Phoenix. This is
a premier international conference in parallel and distributed computing. This
will help students develop their technical strength and engage more closely in
the parallel and distributed computing community. The workshop will increase the
likelihood of these students staying in the research community, and will thus
lead to a more talented and more productive research
workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The IPDPS 2014 student program will provide a
comprehensive venue to better prepare students for research and career paths in
parallel and distributed computing. Participating students will have the
opportunity to both present their research and interact with senior academic and
industry people in an informal setting. In addition, mentoring sessions will be
organized to help students improve communication skills, obtain valuable
information for career planning, get familiar current research topics, and make
valuable contacts, as well as participating in the IPDPS main conference and
associated workshops.&lt;br/&gt;
