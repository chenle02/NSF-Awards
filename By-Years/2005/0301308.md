This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial Biology for
FY2003. The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of
protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are
not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides
opportunities for recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in
microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of
established scientists, and to broaden their scientific horizons beyond the
research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These
fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their
research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves
of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign
locations.

The research and training plan is entitled "Exploring new marine microbes
involved in anaerobic ammonium oxidation." The discovery of anaerobic ammonium
oxidation (anammox) has provided new insights into the physiological diversity
of microbes. The environmental significance and consequences of anammox are yet
to be elucidated. The research is identifying and characterizing the microbes
involved in anammox in marine systems. The population dynamics and activities of
these microbes are being examined using advanced molecular and stable isotope
techniques.
