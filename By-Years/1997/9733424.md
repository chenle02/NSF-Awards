Our Sun's corona, a tenuous, hot atmosphere above the visible surface of the
sun, is the most dramatic, variable component of solar activity. The PI develops
a global model of a complex, evolving corona, based on the hypothesis that
coronal activity results from surface motions stressing its magnetic field.
Numerical implementation of the model, applied to observations of coronal
evolution, tests this hypothesis. Statistical studies of the model provide
quantitative estimates for flaring frequency/amplitude, distribution of coronal
loop lengths, and total heat supplied by magnetic stressing. The PI is also
developing a computational physics curriculum for undergraduates, allowing
students to participate more fully in departmental research.
