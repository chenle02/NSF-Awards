This grant supports participation of approximately 10-12 graduate students from
US institutions in the second instance of the Conference on Online Social
Networks (COSN) of the Association for Computing Machinery, to be held in
Dublin, Ireland, on October 1-2, 2014. Participation in conferences such as COSN
is an extremely important part of the graduate school experience. Attendance at
the conference will enhance the scientific workforce in this emerging research
area by developing a group of promising young researchers interested in online
social networks. The award will enable these young researchers to interact with
other researchers and conference events; to learn of potential career paths
within academia and industry; to access an international network of researchers
who can support their professional development; and to observe the
interdisciplinary nature, diversity and interrelationships of research in online
social networks.

This project integrates research and education of students through exposure to a
premier technical meeting in online social networks. Students will have the
opportunity to observe high-quality presentations and interact with senior
researchers in the field. The proposed student participation is expected to have
a positive impact on the students' research interests. The project will promote
diversity by encouraging and enabling women and other under-represented
minorities to participate. Furthermore, the truly international flavor of COSN
as an annual conference is reflected in the composition of the Technical Program
Committee as well as the expected set of authors of papers.
