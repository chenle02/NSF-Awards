This project addresses experimental validation of current analytical work in
robotics as well as the initiation of new work in robotics. The principal
Investigator has a strong background in the mechanical aspects of robotics,
including manipulator force control, redundant manipulator kinematics, the
analysis of dynamically stable legged locomotion, multi fingered dexterous hand
manipulation, and modular self organizing robotic systems. All of these topics
are aimed at developing sophisticated multi degree of freedom machines to
enhance automation. The applications are quite broad, and encompass space
exploration, medicine, and hazardous waste removal. This project will implement
both a prototype hyper redundant manipulation and locomotion system as well as a
dynamically stable legged robotic system. They will be used to demonstrate and
validate previously developed analytical models and algorithms, and to identify
future research needs in manipulator kinematics and dynamics.
