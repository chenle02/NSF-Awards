The Principal Investigators will organize the conference "Frontiers in Applied
and Computational Mathematics 2016", to be held at New Jersey Institute of
Technology (NJIT), Newark, New Jersey, June 3-4, 2016. Contributions from all
areas of applied mathematics and statistics are welcome. The main conference
themes will be on mathematical and computational aspects of materials science,
mathematical biology, wave propagation, biological and microscale fluid
dynamics, statistics, and biostatistics. Each of these topics is at the
forefront of current developments of mathematical and computational techniques.
Together they have practical applications that include the understanding and
development of new materials, the central nervous system, acoustic and
electromagnetic wave phenomena, the behavior of cellular and other soft matter,
and improved analysis of data from clinical studies and spatial and societal
statistics. The conference participants will include mathematicians,
statisticians, scientists and engineers from academia, industry, and government
laboratories. The conference will bring together students, junior researchers,
and leaders in their field from the US and other countries to interact and
exchange ideas in an informal and approachable setting. A goal of the organizers
is to introduce future leaders of applied mathematics and statistics to
established investigators and emerging research areas. Participation among
graduate students and postdocs is greatly encouraged through selected
contributed talks being given in minisymposia alongside leading scientists. For
students and postdocs, this will be a learning and networking experience that
will help them with their research and career paths. Special efforts will be
made to continue the participation of underrepresented groups.

The two-day conference will include four plenary talks, one in each of this
year's focus topics: materials science, the interface between statistics and
neuroscience, wave propagation, and biologically motivated fluid dynamics.
Morning and afternoon minisymposia will be given in three parallel sessions: one
in an area of statistics or biostatistics, and two in this year's focus areas of
applied mathematics. Poster presentations will be actively encouraged from all
areas of applied mathematics and statistics. The conference is expected to
attract 140-160 participants. Substantial funds will be devoted to support the
participation of students, postdoctoral fellows, junior researchers, and
underrepresented groups. The Department of Mathematical Sciences at NJIT has
hosted a conference of this type on different focus areas each year since 2004.
