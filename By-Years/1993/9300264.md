All species of sea turtle are either endangered or threatened. Those concerned
with the conservation of sea turtles are strongly interested in the behavior of
these animals. Drs. Mellgren and Mann will conduct exploratory research on the
behavioral capacities of hatchling green and hawksbill sea turtles that are
being "head-started" in a conservation project in Quintana Roo, Mexico.
Experiments on diet selection, learning, and species and kin recognition will be
carried out at the turtles' natal beach. The research will be done in
cooperation with Mexican biologists involved in the conservation project.
Information gained in this research will be important for understanding
reptilian function in general and marine turtles in particular. Efforts to
conserve sea turtles will benefit from a better understanding of the basic
processes governing their behavior.
