Multimedia presentation refers to the concurrent presentation of multimedia data
using monitors for text, video or still images, and speakers for audio. Each
presentation contains multimedia segments retrieved from a database and is
constructed and played out by a presentation manager software. For novice users
of multimedia databases, general-purpose techniques and methodologies are
developed for automated assembly of semantically coherent presentations from
multimedia databases. These techniques are extended into automated assembly of
presentations from electronic books and electronic classroom lectures and notes.
For intermediate users, a graphical interface is developed for constructing
concurrent presentations. Such an interface (i) provides control on the number
and contents of concurrent presentation streams, (ii) has the ability to specify
dynamic (i.e., playout-time) changes in a presentation order, and (iii) allows
playout-time communication and synchronization among multiple concurrent
presentation streams. For advanced users, graph-based query and update languages
for advanced users, tailored specifically for retrieving and manipulating
presentation objects, are developed. A multimedia database system is developed,
populated, and experimentally evaluated. The system has an Automated-
Presentation-Assembler, a graphical interface for presentation manipulation, and
a presentation query and manipulation language. The system will contribute to
our understanding of software tools for using digital libraries.
