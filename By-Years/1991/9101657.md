The overall objective of the research is to understand the mechanisms of creep
and be able to predict the magnitudes and rates of displacements of submarine
slopes. The previous 3-year program provides the geological basis, extensive
experimental data base, and foundation of a finite element code for studying
creep processes of slopes. The laboratory testing will focus on further
development of analytical creep constitutive relationships for sediments found
on the continental slope and rise. The finite element code will be expanded and
improved to incorporate a wider range of material behavior and applied to more
complex slope configurations. In the laboratory physical model portion of the
program, in which actual experiments are just beginning, the apparatus will be
improved to provide additional monitoring capabilities and more precise
measurements. The research is scientifically relevant in terms of understanding
a broad range of slope processes and has important implications to the sitting
of offshore installations on slopes.
