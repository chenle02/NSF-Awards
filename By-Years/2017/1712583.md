This project supports hosting the final Japanese-US Network Opportunity (JUNO)
PI meeting to be held at the George Washington University on Dec. 8, 2016, in
Washington DC. This meeting continues a research collaboration between US and
Japanese networking researchers jointly funded by the NSF/NeTS program and the
Japanese National Institute of Information and Communications Technology
(NICT).&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;In 2013, NSF issued a solicitation for proposals
titled Networking Technology and Systems (NeTS: JUNO), Japan-US Network
Opportunity: R&amp;D for "Beyond Trillions of Objects." This "Beyond Trillions
of Objects" Japan-US joint research and development program has addressed a
critical subset of the issues that arise when environments with trillions of
device and information objects are network-connected, as is expected to be the
case by the year 2020. Seven collaborative research projects have addressed
novel approaches for network design and modeling, new technologies for network
management and control in support of object mobility, and flexible optical
networks with the speed, capacity and environmental characteristics needed to
accommodate communications among objects in the emerging world. The first
program PI meeting was held at the University of California, Davis, in June
2014, and the second PI meeting was held in Tokyo in October 2015. This final PI
meeting will bring together the PIs from the US and Japan, as well a selection
of US student participants in the JUNO projects. The meeting will provide the
opportunity for all project participants to learn about the progress to date on
all of the JUNO projects.
