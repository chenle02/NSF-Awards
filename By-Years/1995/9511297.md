9511297 Kucera Neurotrophins are small protein molecules that are important for
the well-being of cells in the brain and spinal cord. One of these neurotrophins
is neurotrophin-3 (NT-3). This research will examine how NT-3 affects the
development of a special type of proprioceptive sensory neuron that provides
information to the brain about the position of the body and limbs in space. The
research will be done on genetically altered animals that lack the gene
necessary for the assembly of NT-3. These animals have a very severe movement
disorder suggestive of dysfunction of the entire proprioceptive (body position)
system. These animals will be analyzed using a variety of techniques to find out
why and how the neurons become dysfunctional in the absence of NT-3. The study
will generate data concerning how neurotrophins aid neurons in the growth
process during development. Knowledge derived from this work will provide
fundamental information about the effects of neurotrophins during the
development of the nervous system.
