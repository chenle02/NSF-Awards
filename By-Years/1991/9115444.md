In this project sponsored by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program,
Professor George Ewing of Indiana University will use infrared and fluorescence
spectroscopy to map patterns of energy flow for small molecules weakly adsorbed
on single crystal insulator surfaces. This includes developing techniques for
growing well-ordered monolayers on well-defined surfaces, and studies of two
dimensional phase transitions as well as obtaining rates of vibrational
dephasing, radiation, phonon excitation, and photodetachment. The work is
important because it illustrates differences between insulator surfaces which
bind intact molecules weakly, and more commonly studied conducting (metallic)
surfaces which involve much stronger atom-surface interactions. %%% Molecules
bound to metal surfaces are often destroyed by the strong bonding forces. By
focussing attention on molecules bound to insulators, Professor Ewing (Indiana
University) is able to learn how energy flows between a surface and intact,
weakly bound molecules. This provides a unique glimpse into the chemistry of
fundamental processes involved in friction and lubrication.
