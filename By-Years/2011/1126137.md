This award supports a planning visit to the Chengdu Institute of Geology and
Marine Resources in Chendu, China, by Professors Rodney Feldman and Carrie
Schweitzer of Kent State. The purpose of the trip is to develop a collaborative
research project on the early evolution and radiation of decapods, specifically
Crustacea, and the implications for the early history of the Mesozoic Marine
Revolution. An extensive assemblage of well preserved fossils has recently been
discovered in Luoping, Yunnan Province, and access to the specimens presents an
opportunity to expand greatly the understanding of anthropod recovery following
the end-Permian extinction. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This planning visit aims to
establish an international collaboration in both research and education based on
the large repository of well preserved fossils in Chengdu. Few specimens of
decapods in China have been described so the proposed study can add considerably
to the knowledge base of marine evolution in the early Mesozoic period. In
promoting the research collaboration among the participants, this planning visit
will establish the basis for a full-scale proposal for research in China. That
subsequent research project promises to engage undergraduate and graduate
students in the field work.
