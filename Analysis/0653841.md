Harmonic Analysis, Mathematical Physics and Nonlinear PDE

Abstract of Proposed Research Wilhelm Schlag

This project is explore the long time behavior, or prove that singularities
will form in finite time, of solutions of equations that arise in mathematical
physics. The equations under consideration typically admit nonlinear bound
states (solitons or instantons) and much research has recently been devoted to
the perturbative analysis of such solutions. It is well known that solutions of
nonlinear Schroedinger and wave equations of the focusing type may blow up in
finite time (if the energy of the data is negative, for example). It turns out,
however, that global solutions exist if the data belong to a submanifold of
finite co-dimension (a "center-stable" manifold in the language of dynamical
systems). We shall investigate whether there is a manifold that divides a region
of blow-up from one of scattering. Our goal is to obtain a deeper understanding
of blow-up phenomena. Recently, progress was made for the critical wave-map
equation into the two-dimensional sphere with regard to blow-up. It can be shown
in a very precise and quantitative way that blow-up for this equation occurs
through the bubbling off of energy via a non-constant harmonic map. Moreover, it
turns out that the blow-up rate can be prescribed a priori. Similar phenomena
occur for the semi-linear energy critical focusing equation in three plus one
dimensions. Currently we do not understand which classes of equations admit this
kind of phenomenon.

Much of the success of science and engineering lies with its effective use of
mathematical tools, both in terms of modeling and for computational simulation.
The nonlinear Schroedinger equation arises in various applications in optics
where a bound state (soliton) for represents a particle, or beam, that travels
for a long time without disintegrating. An important issue is to understand the
stability or instability of these solitons. That is, whether they persist under
small perturbations or not? The theoretical understanding of these issues is
very difficult, and is requiring new insights into mathematical problems. This
project will investigate these problems and develop methods that may be used by
practicing scientists and engineers.
