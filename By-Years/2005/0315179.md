Little information is currently available on the hormones of ticks and their
role in development and reproduction, especially in comparison to insects, other
arthropods and animals in general. The lack of basic knowledge of tick hormones
is a critical impediment to the to the advancement of the general science of
tick, mite, spider and related animal biology as well as to the development of
new control methods for this important arthropod group responsible for the
transmission of human diseases. The hypothesis over the last two decades has
been that ticks regulate their development with juvenile hormone (JH). Data
collected in the laboratories of the investigators indicate that JH is not found
in two species of ticks. The goal of this study is to identify the hormones that
regulate egg development and reproduction in the American dog tick, Dermacentor
variabilis. This will be achieved by sequencing the gene(s) coding for the tick
egg yolk protein and then examining the role of possible hormones on the
regulation of this gene. Preliminary data are available of the role of a steroid
and synganglion hormone from the female tick involved in the regulation of egg
development. The studies proposed are to further validate the role of these
hormones and to develop a model on how they are used to regulate reproduction.
The proposal is a collaborative research effort between laboratories at North
Carolina State University and Old Dominion University. The research will provide
training opportunities for postdoctoral and graduate students in the field of
tick biochemistry and molecular biology. The work proposed will provide new
opportunities to develop novel chemical and molecular approaches to the control
of medically-important ticks.
