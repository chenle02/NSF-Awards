Heterogeneous catalysis is used in the chemical and petroleum industries for
the manufacture of a variety of valuable products. Inorganic membrane reactors
combine the catalytic reaction and separation functions into one unit. The
attractiveness of these reactors arises from their substantially improved
performance for reversible reaction systems; as the products are continuously
removed the reactions can shift to higher conversions, not limited by
equilibrium considerations. For a fixed total amount of catalyst, the question
arises as to how it should be distributed within the membrane so that the
membrane reactor performance (for example reaction rate, product purity, etc.)
is optimized. This is the motivation for this research project. The PI plans to
conduct a combined theoretical-experimental study, to investigate the
performance of catalytic membrane reactors with controlled catalyst
distribution. Theoretical work will identify the optimal catalyst distribution
required to maximize specific performance indices (for example, reactant
conversion, product purity, etc.). This will include analysis of membrane
reactors where the catalyst is distributed in a controlled manner along the
membrane thickness as well as along the reactor length. Experimental work will
be directed towards preparing and testing such membranes, and will permit a
quantitative comparison with theoretical predictions.***//
