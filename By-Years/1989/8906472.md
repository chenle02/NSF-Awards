A tunable diode laser (TDL) adsorption apparatus will be used for studying the
chemistry of diffusion flames. TDL absorption offers the capability for the
analysis of a great many species in particle-laden combustion flows.
Specifically, carbon monoxide, methyl radical, and acetylene will be measured in
the sooty and soot-free regions of a laminar methane/air diffusion flame. Methyl
radical profiles will be compared to those established by scavenger probe/mass
spectrometry and multi-photon ionization techniques. The TDL instrumentation
will allow quantification of important intermediate species formed in diffusion
flames, giving insight into soot formation and control mechanisms.
