0305104 Coale This award to San Jose State University in California provides
support for the acquisition of oceanographic instrumentation to be used on R/V
Point Sur operated by the Moss Landing Marine Laboratories. Specifically,
support is recommended to acquire twelve Niskin bottles, an acoustic locator
system, two transmissometers, two oxygen sensors, two fluorometers and a
shipboard computer server with email software. These acquisitions should provide
a substantial advantage to marine scientists using R/V Point Sur in their
research during 2003 and future years. ***
