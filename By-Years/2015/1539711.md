Each year approximately 30,000 people are killed in the U.S. in motor vehicle
crashes. Often crashes occur because the driver cannot see the hazard in time,
especially when the hazard is obscured (a braking vehicle in front of the lead
vehicle, a crossing vehicle running a red light, etc.). Currently such
technology is quite expensive, which has led to lower levels of adoption.
Indeed, the field of augmented reality for cars is looking for an 'application'
that will have broad basis of appeal and deep impact. Crash avoidance could be
such an application that gets more users interested in adopting this hardware,
which then provides the basis for other applications to be developed and
adopted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research is being conducted to determine how
Augmented Reality (AR), implemented as a large field of view head-up display,
can be used to present warnings. Concepts include arrows showing where drivers
should look and graphics to highlight at what drivers should look.
Implementation requires a full-windshield Head-Up-Display (HUD) to show the
graphics, communications technology to connect vehicles, and validated user
interface concepts. These elements are to be combined in a product, one that
could substantially reduce motor vehicle crashes. The team has developed and
tested a proof-of-concept prototype of the augmented reality interface in a
driving simulator. That interface consists of some means to highlight a hazard,
such as an underline or a surrounding box. However, when the hazard in not in
front of the driver or not visible, an arrow appears in front of them directing
them where to look, either to the left or right.
