Calculations which explore the consequences of ionizing collisions of particles
and radiation with atoms are performed using the simplest methodology which
gives agreement with experiment. Approaches used include Hartree- Fock, multi-
configuration Hartree-Fock, Born approximation and close-coupled techniques.
