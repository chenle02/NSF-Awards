This Growing Convergence Research project aims at revolutionizing how
circulating epidemic and pandemic influenza virus strains are surveilled and
characterized. The project brings together virologists who perform controlled
mutations of the virus, nanoscience engineers who create platforms for virus
enrichment, materials scientists and optical spectroscopists who develop
effective 2D material Raman signal enhancement platforms, and data scientists
who analyze data with machine learning methods to achieve virus identification
and prediction of potential emergence of new antigenic variants. The goal of the
research team is to develop a convergent device platform that can rapidly
capture, sense, and identify viruses and predict new antigenic strains against
which the human population has limited or no immunity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project pursues a solution to a grand challenge in the surveillance and
characterization of circulating epidemic and pandemic influenza virus strains by
addressing deep scientific questions in enhanced Raman spectroscopy for virus
detection and evolution prediction. The proposed platform is based on controlled
virology experiments that propagate by culture and mutate viruses for specific
research tasks, a novel virus enrichment platform for effectively capturing
viruses without labels, biosensing of virus surface proteins with enhanced
signal through a novel 2D/metal enhanced Raman spectroscopy technique, and rapid
and sensitive virus identification and evolution prediction through machine
learning analysis of enhanced Raman data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
