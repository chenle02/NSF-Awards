Achieve, Inc. plans to work with a group of Mathematics Achievement Partnership
(MAP) states to plan a set of challenging mathematics activities that includes a
new mathematics assessment, professional development, and curriculum selection.
The strategic plans that are created will allow each state to assess the degree
of alignment between existing states standards and tests, and MAP standards and
assessment.

Achieve, Inc. has been actively working with states over the past several years
to help states transition to more challenging mathematics curricula and
assessment. Through other funding sources, Achieve, Inc. is creating a extbook
guide, professional development models and a website library of mathematics
lessons. It is anticipated that an assessment will be produced as well.

There are fourteen states that have been associated with the MAP effort. This
planning effort will provide a small number of MAP states with an opportunity to
actively plan for a transition from current standards and assessment to a more
ambitious and internationally benchmarker endeavor.
