The objective of this research is to develop computer models for integrated
design of steel structures using several emerging computer technologies. They
include object-oriented programming (OOP), genetic algorithms, neural network
computing, and concurrent processing. The research includes development of a) a
blackboard architecture for integrated design of steel structures using the OOP
paradigm, b) an object-oriented database management system using an enhanced
entity relationship model for managing a multitude of input, intermediate, and
output data encountered in integrated design of steel structures, c) an object-
oriented version management model based on the parallel version graph, d) an
augmented Lagrangian genetic algorithm for detailed design of steel structures,
e) an adaptive conjugate gradient integrated design machine learning algorithm
for training of multilayer feedforward neural networks, f) a hybrid learning
algorithm by integrating genetic algorithm with error backpropagation multilayer
neural networks, g) concurrent algorithms for integrated/optimum design of large
steel structures such as highrise buildings using the multiprocessing
capabilities of shared memory machines (Cray YMP 8/864) and distributed
multicomputers (transputers), and h) concurrent algorithms for the hybrid neural
networks/genetic algorithm.
