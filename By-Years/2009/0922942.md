0922942&lt;br/&gt;Carmichael&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law
111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds from this grant will support the acquisition
of a cathodoluminescence (CL) microscope for petrologic research and research
training at Appalachian State University. The CL microscope will support the
beginning research careers of two female geoscientists with research interests
igneous and sedimentary petrology. The instrument will aid in student research
training in methods of optical petrography. Appalachian State &lt;br/&gt;serves
an area of the country where many enrollees are first generation college
students. This equipment will also serve faculty and students from nearby East
Tennessee State
University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
