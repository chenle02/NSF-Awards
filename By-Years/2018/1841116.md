This award provides partial support to U.S. based participants of the conference
"Classical and quantum 3-manifold topology" to be held at Monash University in
Clayton, a suburb of Melbourne, Australia, from 17 to 21 December 2018, preceded
by a workshop for students and early career researchers on 14-15 December 2018.
The conference and workshop will promote progress in mathematics by bringing
together international researchers in two related areas of topology, encouraging
the dissemination of new ideas and results, increasing collaboration, and
introducing new researchers to important problems in these fields. This will
contribute to the training and development of mathematical talent.

The last four decades have witnessed the discovery of many deep connections
between topological quantum field theory (TQFT), low-dimensional topology, and
geometric structures on manifolds. This conference is devoted to exploring and
strengthening these connections. The specific goals are: first, to provide a
venue for sharing new results in these closely related areas. Second, to
increase collaboration and communication among research experts globally in
these fields. Third, to introduce researchers, especially students and early
career researchers, to important open problems and areas of current research,
particularly problems lying at the interface of quantum and classical topology
in three dimensions. To meet these goals, the conference and workshop will bring
together a distinguished international group of mathematicians. The strong
scientific program of the conference is expected to encourage researchers
working in these subjects to find common ground and lead to new developments. In
addition, the introductory talks during the workshop will enable junior
mathematicians to learn major research themes and eventually to contribute to
these areas. The conference website, which includes further details, is located
