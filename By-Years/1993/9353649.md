93-53649 Shehata Maine Experimental Systemic Initiative The Research Excellence
Partnership has developed a one-year pilot program to stimulate collaborative
research among Maine's public and private research institutions. This
initiative, which is a component of Maine's Science and Technology Strategic
Plan, would take advantage of the state's Centers for Innovation in aquaculture,
biomedical technology, and metals and electronics. The program would encourage
Maine firms to work with academic-based researchers to address industry
challenges. The collaborations would not only produce short-term benefits for
businesses at the heart of Maine's economy, but they would position the
participants, as individuals and as cohesive research groups, to expand their
research capacities. Maine EPSCoR is requesting $75,000 to pilot test this
program. The Maine Science and Technology Commission, as fiscal agent, will
provide additional funding totaling $77,158.
