This proposal describes the creation of a Texas Alliance where the Texas
A&amp;M University will lead an alliance of nine Texas Universities (Texas
A&amp;I, Corpus Christi State, Laredo State, Prairie View A&amp;M, Texas A&amp;M
at Galveston, Texas Women's University, Texas A&amp;M University, Tarleton
State, and West Texas University), 31 Texas community colleges, 67 initial
industry partners, and 12 national laboratories joined in a comprehensive
coalition dedicated to improving the quality of the undergraduate and graduate
education of minorities in engineering, mathematics and the sciences through a
program of enhanced preparation, recruitment, transfer and retention. Eleven
fundamental goals were presented which support six major components: 1. Texas
Summer Research Internships Program - This program is the backbone of the Texas
Alliance. It is designed to provide a comprehensive financial support mechanism
to participating students while they interact with scientists and engineering.
2. Pre-College Program - This program will support TexPREP which is designed to
strengthen problem solving skills and promote awareness, interest, and
dedication to achieving the goal of entering college level engineering and
science degree programs. 3. Transfer Stipends - This program will award Transfer
Stipends to students in their final year of a science or pre- engineering degree
track at the participating community colleges. 4. Texas Alliance Stipends - This
program supplements the Texas Summer Research Internship Program by guaranteeing
students that complete a summer intern academic year stipends support. 5. Non-
Traditional Student Stipends Program - This program awards stipends to minority
women with young children to assist these women to continue or start their
science or engineering education. This is a supplemental award. 6. Internships
at Monterrey Tech - Five summer research internships for study at Monterrey
Institute of Technology in Mexico for minority students. Students will be
allowed to work in a major center of research were Anglo culture is not the
dominant experience.
