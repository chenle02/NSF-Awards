The investigator outlines a research plan directed towards development of high
precision, solid state tracking devices which can be used to reconstruct
vertices corresponding to the origin of tracks from D or B meson decays. The
kind of detector presently envisaged uses a newly emerging technology with two
sided strip etchings on a silicon substrate. More esoteric detectors are also to
be developed using heterojunction techniques. The devices so formed would have
an intrinsic gain reducing the need for massive external electronics.
