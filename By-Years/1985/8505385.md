Research is conducted on microbiological aspects of anaerobic processes used for
treatment of wastewater. Conditions under which complex organic compounds in
wastewater are transformed into low-molecular weight fatty acids and then into
methane are investigated. Results of this work may be applied in improvement of
engineering design of wastewater treatment processes and systems that depend
upon anaerotic biotechnological phenomena.
