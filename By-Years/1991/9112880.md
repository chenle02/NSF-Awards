Implicit invocation mechanisms are a fundamental technique for organizing
software systems. Typically, each of these mechanisms has been produced - at
significant cost - as an innovative design and implementation. One reason for
this diversity is that each mechanism has been designed for different domains.
Another reason, however, is that the common properties of implicit invocation
mechanisms are poorly understood. Consequently, it is hard to take advantage of
previous experiences when designing a new mechanism. Now, however, the
collection of mechanisms and practical experience is rich enough to permit the
characterization of the design space so that choices can be made in a principled
and routine way. To achieve this ability to engineer implicit invocation
mechanisms requires three steps. First, based on an analysis of the common and
distinct aspects of existing mechanisms, the underlying architecture of such
mechanisms will be formalized. Second, how to create new mechanisms with
specific desirable properties by specializing this architecture according to
well-defined principles will be determined. Third, this architecture and these
principles will be applied to two domains: an environment for manipulating
formal specifications and an environment for interactive manipulation of
encyclopedia articles.
