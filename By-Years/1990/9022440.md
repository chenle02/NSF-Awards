This is a Phase II SBIR research activity. Its goal is to define the processing
requirements for combining shape-memory film technology with silicon micro-
fabrication. This will be done by focusing on development of a microvalve.
Questions raised in Phase I will be addressed, structures will be fabricated on
silicon and film actuators tested, a valve design test bed will be constructed
and a variety of valve configurations examined, and silicon based microvalves
will be fabricated over a range of sizes.
