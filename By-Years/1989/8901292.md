The transport of stress and scalar quantities in turbulent premixed flames is
difficult to predict because of the interaction between spatial and temporal
fluctuations of the controlling parameters. Modeling the dynamics requires
elimination of troublesome terms in the equation of motion. One set of elusive
parameter involves pressure- velocity fluctuations. The research will focus on a
technique to measure these fluctuations in isothermal flows by substituting
nonintrusive laser methods (multiple-beam, laser-doppler anemometry and Rayleigh
scattering) for intrusive mechanical microphone probes. The pressure
fluctuations will not be measured directly but will be calculated from the
volume integration of the density-velocity gradients. The proposed research
deals with pressure fluctuation measurements in an isothermal jet. Quantitative
results which are repeatable and of high accuracy will lead to similar
measurements in reacting jets, will further our understanding of turbulence, and
will increase the scientific basis for combustion modeling.
