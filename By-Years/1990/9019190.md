The principal investigator will develop a new stable isotope mass spectrometer
capable of measuring oxygen isotope ratios of very small samples. An on-line
capability for analyzing tiny silicate and oxide mineral samples, using a new
laser fluorination technique, also will be developed. The latter will lead to a
study of detailed exchange behavior of aqueous fluids with minerals and volcanic
glasses. Additionally, studies will be conducted on isotopic variations in
several specific rift-zone environments where enhanced fracture permeability
allows deep circulation of surface waters. Investigations also will take place
to better understand the isotope geochemistry of the continental crust and upper
mantle.
