The variability of rainfall rate will be examined over a range of time and
space scales. The principal topics of the proposed research are the probability
transformations of rainfall rate from the plot scale, at which physical process
representations can be applied for land surface processes, to the observation
scale of climatological remote sensing systems, and from the observation scale
to the climate model scale. A statistical model of raindrop processes (Smith
ı1991!) will be used to examine these transformations. The model of raindrop
processes yields a stochastic/dynamic representation of rainfall rate and
provides a unified framework for studying land surface processes related to
rainfall rate and atmospheric processes related to remote sensing measurements
of rainfall. In this study, empirical and theoretical analyses will be carried
out for rainfall rate and raindrop processes. The lognormal cascade theory of
Gupta and Waymire ı1990! will play an important role in both empirical and
theoretical scaling analyses. Two principal problems will be examined: *How do
distributional properties of rainfall rate and raindrop processes vary with
scale? *How does rainfall rate depend on raindrop processes and how does this
relationship vary with scale? An important element of this project is
development of statistical procedures for assessing scale properties of rainfall
and raindrop processes. The project will be an interdisciplinary effort
involving hydrologists and statisticians. The proposed research will provide
analytical tools for testing and refining the "probability distributed method"
for representing land surface processes in climate models (Entekhabi and
Eagleson ı1989!). Empirical studies will center on the southern plains regions
of the U.S. and utilize radar data, rain gage data and surface drop-size data
(including data from a network of disdrometers that will be deployed for the
1992 STORM field experiment). Surface drop-size data from a number of climatic
regions in the U.S. will also be used for empirical studies.
