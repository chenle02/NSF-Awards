This REU site award will support six undergraduate researchers working under
the supervision of faculty advisors from the University of Texas at San Antonio
and Hendrix College. The project is scheduled to run for a period of ten weeks
with emphasis on research in the newly developing field of wavelets and their
applications. The plans are ambitious in that the mathematics of wavelets is
still in its developmental stage. However, opportunities for undergraduates to
make substantive contributions and carry the work further along in their
mathematical development is great. Some training in harmonic analysis will be
necessary and students with computational backgrounds will be able to visualize
the results quickly. Applications to image processing, computer vision,
stochastic processes, numerical methods and speech synthesis make this
attractive program an excellent example of how mathematics can provide insight
into the research world without the necessity of long periods of passive lecture
and study.
