The Department of Mathematics and Computer Science proposes to establish a
Computer Architecture Laboratory around single- board computers. This project
has, as its dual objectives, an improvement in the quality of the undergraduate
Computer Science program and an increase in the success rate of students in that
program. The project will develop a laboratory in which students can acquire
some hands-on experience with single-board computers, minimizing the layers of
hardware and system software between the user and the microprocessor. The
laboratory will enable the students to grasp the concepts of computer hardware
and computer systems organization more effectively than learning the concepts in
the abstract. Educational materials to be developed by the project will
integrate the laboratory with the current Computer Science curriculum.
