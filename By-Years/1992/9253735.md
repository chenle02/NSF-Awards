Law This multidisciplinary research focuses on the development of silicon models
for point defect behavior, which are vital to understanding dopant diffusion.
Models are being developed and parameterized for the effect of silicidation and
stress on point defect kinetics. These models are then implemented in SUPREM-IV,
a standard integrated circuit process modeling tool that utilizes advanced
finite element techniques. This is a Presidential Faculty Fellow (PFF) Award
initially awarded in Fiscal Year 1992.
