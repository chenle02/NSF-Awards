Drexel University has been at the forefront of geosynthetic and fibrous
materials engineering since establishing separate centers of excellence in these
fields in 1986. The Drexel-affiliated Geosynthetic Research Institute (GRI) is
today the leading research and development institute dedicated entirely to
geosynthetics. Drexel's geosynthetics and fibrous materials laboratory
facilities have not kept pace with the University's achievements in these areas.
Currently, many of the University's laboratory devices&lt;br/&gt;are outdated.
Moreover, researchers are now recognizing that many of the existing devices used
by the profession do not realistically simulate the in-service conditions of
most geotextiles and industrial textiles. To remain a leader in these fields,
and to significantly improve its laboratory infrastructure it is critical that
the University develop and acquire state-of-the-art test
equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attempting to address this need, the University
established a laboratory maintenance and&lt;br/&gt;equipment upgrade program.
Accordingly, this award focuses on development and fabrication of a major test
device that will greatly enhance the experimental capabilities of geosynthetic
and fibrous materials researchers. This highly versatile devise will be capable
of assessing geosynthetic and fibrous material behavior under confined or
unconfined conditions in uniaxial, biaxial, or axisymetric tension. The device
will be able to perform both monotonic and cyclic tests over a range of strain
rates and frequencies (creep to seismic rates) and under loading conditions that
closely replicate those experienced over a range of in-service conditions.
