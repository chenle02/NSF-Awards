9521745 Claffy General Atomics proposes in collaboration with Digital Equipment
Corporation as a partner on this project, to develop and deploy a scalable
caching and replication system across strategic network locations within the
United States. Digital Equipment Corporation has committed to significant cost
sharing and collaboration, as an integral part of this proposal. Our goal is to
facilitate the evolution of U.S. information provisioning with an efficient
national architecture for handling highly popular information. Our proposed
effort is unique in tying together research and infrastructure. The research and
deployment experience of the principal investigators and their proximity to NSF
backbone sites will leverage existing NSF-sponsored activities, at the
supercomputer centers as well as activities related to resource discovery at the
University of Colorado in Boulder.
