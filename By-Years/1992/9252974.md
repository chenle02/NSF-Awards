Human biology is the basis for a tenth grade, activity-based biology course.
The major goals of the course are to understand those characteristics which are
unique to the human species and which are shared with other living systems, to
understand the place of humans in the biosphere and the consequences of our
interactions with the environment, and to understand the place of humans in
evolution and the consequences of our interactions with other species and the
environment on the evolutionary process. The course is informed by science
reform movements and stresses understanding concepts and processes over
vocabulary. The content will emphasize major biological themes as identified in
curriculum frameworks: evolution, genetic continuity, patterns of organizations,
bioenergetics, regulation, behavior, development, forms and function,
biodiversity, and ecology. The course, designed for all students and schools, is
organized about topics which concern students: the human species, the human
organism, human physical performance, human life cycle, human population, and
human adaption. It incorporates laboratory activities, and instructional
technologies and employs modified learning cycle and modern assessment
strategies. Materials include a student textbook, a student resource book,
teacher's guide, an assessment package and an implementation guide.
