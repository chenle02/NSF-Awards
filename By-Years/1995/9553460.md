GER-9553460 Stith The Ohio State University Physics Department is submitting a
proposal to the National Science Foundation under the NSF Graduate Research
Traineeship Program. Our proposal is that five Graduate Research Trainees be
funded each year for five years. These students will work to earn PhD's in
physics with specialties in physics education research. Their training will
focus on the theory and methods of teaching and learning in physics and on the
use of technology to enhance that learning. These efforts will involve
collaborations with several private companies. The five specific objectives of
our proposal are as follows. A) To produce PhD physics graduates who develop the
research and teaching skills and the knowledge about cognition and learning that
will prepare them to lead future efforts to improve science education in the
United States. B) To produce PhD physics graduates who gain the knowledge and
develop the skills to produce and implement effective systems of learning based
in part on the use of technology. C) To increase the number of talented PhD
physics graduates from traditionally underrepresented groups who have this
knowledge and these skills. D) To increase the number of PhD physics graduates
trained in all areas of physics who also have the knowledge of physics education
research to implement new forms of instruction in the education systems in which
they may work in the future. E) To help produce a positive systemic change in
the learning system of a state university with over 50,000 students --a change
that better prepares these undergraduate students for the twenty-first century
information- age workplace. We propose that the five Graduate Research
Traineeships be funded in physics at OSU each year for five years. The cost to
the NSF for these Traineeships will be $112,500 per year. Ohio State
University's matching contribution of $27,000 per year will be realized by
paying the tuition of the NSF support ed trainees in excess of $8400 per year
and in $100 per year of miscellaneous support and travel for the trainees.
