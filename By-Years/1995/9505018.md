Under this award, Dr. Betts will pursue a wide range of problems involving
primarily the thermodynamics of atmospheric energy and water interactions from
the surface through the troposphere, in support of programs such as the Global
Energy and Water Cycle Experiment Continental-Scale International Project (GCIP)
and the Boreal Forest Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS). The overarching
objective is to improve the surface boundary condition over land in large-scale
models. At present, forecast and climate models have serious deficiencies in
their physical parameterizations, particularly in the modeling of energy and
water transports at the earth's surface (more so over land than over the ocean),
and in the coupling of convective processes to the large-scale dynamic and
radiation fields. The principal investigator will tackle these issues by first
analyzing observations from several field programs and then using them to test
and develop physical parameterizations in large-scale models. Operational
forecast models will be used primarily so that the research directly benefits
the forecasting of weather on timescales of a few days, as well as the global
model data bases, which are used for climate studies. This research is supported
under NSF's Water and Energy: Atmospheric, Vegetative, and Earth Interactions
(WEAVE) Program.***
