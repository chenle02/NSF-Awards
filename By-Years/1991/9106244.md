This award provides matching funds for the acquisition of a thermal ionization
mass spectrometer to be installed and operated in the Department of Earth,
Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
MIT is committed to providing the remaining funds needed for this acquisition.
The spectrometer system will allow the earth crustal structure and tectonics
research group at MIT to pursue geochronological and other isotope geochemical
research projects aimed at understanding the evolution of the continental crust
and lithosphere.
