This study will analyze the impact of government-initiated social change on
individuals and families in the People's Republic of China. It draws on data
from a survey conducted in Shanghai in the spring of 1988. At that time a random
sample of 1200 residents, ages 25-65, were interviewed. The study has three
principal goals. The first is to examine the effects of specific social changes,
such as school closings and urban to rural migration, and to determine how these
affected five different birth cohorts of men and women born between 1924 and
1963. The second goal is to examine family processes and structures and to
determine how social changes have affected family life. The third goal is to
examine the effects of social change on the degree of interdependency among
individuals, both within the family and across generations. This study is
important because it will document how dramatic social changes in this
historical period have had profound consequences for individuals and families.
Nowhere have these changes been more striking than in the People's Republic of
China.
