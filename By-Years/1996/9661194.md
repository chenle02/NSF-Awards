*** 9661194 Maren This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
prototype and demonstrate key technology components for an Intelligent Agent
using Situation Assessment. This system will automatically provide pilots with
high-fidelity, near real-time information that will help in their decision-
making under stress. Phase I will lay the foundation and will identify
demonstration scenarios based on real accidents, construct emulations of these
scenarios, and identify the "schemes" that pilots consistently use when doing
selected piloting tasks. Key components of a pilot cognitive model will be
identified, and an IA architecture will be developed. The key necessary learning
methods for constructing user models also will be identified and the first steps
for their development will be taken. Commercialization is expected for
commercial, military, and general aviation systems. In addition, the IA
technologies can be extended to assist operation of power plants, chemical
refineries, and television station operation. ***
