A computer database of planned research ship cruises and ship information and
contacts will be maintained for a multi-nation consortium of research ship
operators. In addition to NSF support, funding will be supplied the Office of
Naval Research (U.S.) and marine science agencies in Canada, Japan, the
Netherlands, and the U.K. The database will include information for research
ships that are over 40m in length and will cover cruises for the current year
and for as far into the future as information is provided. The database will be
widely available by on-line electronic access. It will allow research cruises to
be identified by ship name, country, places and dates of port calls, working
area, science discipline, and chief scientist. It will also provide a list of
operational contacts and physical and scientific characteristics for each ship.
The system should help optimize the use of research ship time.
