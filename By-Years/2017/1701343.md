Combustion processes are the foundation of the electric power, transportation,
and manufacturing infrastructures in the world. Transitions to new fuel feed
stocks and transitions to new engines technologies pose challenges and
opportunities to use the fuel properties to improve the combustion applications.
This project focuses on experimental studies to identify and quantify fuel
reaction chemistry important to successfully integrating new fuels and new
engine designs. Pioneering new methods will be developed to isolate fuel
chemistry that has not been previously studied. This fuel chemistry remains
undiscovered country not due to lack of impact or significance, but due to the
lack of experimental protocols and facilities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A technical
approach has been designed based on the unique chemical reactor facility (a
rapid compression facility, RCF) to isolate fuel reaction chemistry at the
particularly challenging conditions required by modern and next-generation
combustion systems. The RCF will be used to heat fuel mixtures to temperatures
from 600 to 1200 K and pressures from 3 to 30 atm. Fast sampling will be used to
acquire small amounts of the gases created while the fuel reacts at these high
temperatures and pressures. The gas samples will be analyzed to identify the
compounds present and the amounts of each compound as a function of time. From
these data, the reaction pathways important to fuel combustion will be
determined at relevant conditions. By strategically choosing the cases to
demonstrate the approach, the experiments are designed to be extrapolated to
similar fuels with high confidence. The project will also set precedence for
other research teams to extend the experimental methods to broader classes of
fuel compounds, thus benefiting conventional and unconventional fossil fuels as
well as first and later generation biofuels.
