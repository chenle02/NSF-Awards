0201783 Best Under this Investigator Initiated Award, studies will be performed
that will improve understanding of the fundamental biomechanics of skeletal
muscle and its mechanical response to stretch injury and healing. In particular,
the stretch rate and stimulation effects on normal muscle behavior, and that of
muscle recovering from eccentric stretch injury will be addressed. Skeletal
muscle is a complex material that exhibits nonlinear viscoelastic behavior.
Mechanical response to uniaxial stretch begins with nonlinear strain-stiffening,
or toe-in behavior, followed by a linear response, and ultimately material
softening prior to failure. Sensitivity to stretch rate and stimulation state
variations, in both healthy and stretch-injured skeletal muscles, will be
examined in vivo in rabbit Tibialis Anterior muscles. The PIs new
phenomenological muscle model consisting of a nonlinear Maxwell fluid element
combined in parallel with a contractile element and a stimulation induced linear
spring, already demonstrated to explain the mechanical response outlined above,
in conjunction with a carefully planned statistical design, will be used to
interpret the experimental load-displacement data. Results of the studies have
the potential of influencing treatment plans for skeletal muscle injuries.
