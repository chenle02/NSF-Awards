The project suggests investigations in the area of Harmonic &lt;br/&gt;Analysis
and Nonlinear Hamiltonian Equations. One direction &lt;br/&gt;of the research in
the analysis of singular integral operators.&lt;br/&gt;Current interests include
Lebesgue space estimates on Fourier &lt;br/&gt;integral operators associated to
singular and nonsingular &lt;br/&gt;canonical relations. Such estimates provide
important tools &lt;br/&gt;for the analysis of properties of solutions to
nonlinear &lt;br/&gt;Hamiltonian systems: global existence, smoothness, and
stability. &lt;br/&gt;The other direction of the research concerns specific
properties &lt;br/&gt;of solitary wave solutions to nonlinear Hamiltonian
systems.&lt;br/&gt;Such soliton-like solutions were proved to exist in
many&lt;br/&gt;different contexts. If the equation is invariant under
the&lt;br/&gt;action of some Lie group, then the solitary waves may
possess&lt;br/&gt;stability properties. The program of research focuses on
the&lt;br/&gt;stability of solitary waves with minimal energy, which
are&lt;br/&gt;expected to be of particular importance for
applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the amplitude of the waves increases,
their interaction with &lt;br/&gt;the medium becomes important. This interaction
may seriously&lt;br/&gt;change the behavior of the waves and lead to the
appearance of&lt;br/&gt;nonlinear solitary waves, or solitons. Such nonlinear
waves&lt;br/&gt;describe central phenomena in fiber optics, plasma
physics,&lt;br/&gt;theory of superconductivity, theory of elementary
particles,&lt;br/&gt;meteorology, and oceanology. Detailed knowledge of
properties&lt;br/&gt;of such waves, and in particular their stability or
instability,&lt;br/&gt;will allow to predict the chances of sudden weather
changes,&lt;br/&gt;develop optical waveguides, and describe quantum effects
on&lt;br/&gt;the scales being inexorably approached by today's
electronics&lt;br/&gt;and chip manufacturers, let alone the Experimental
Physics.&lt;br/&gt;Natural phenomena pose new challenges to the intricately
related &lt;br/&gt;fields, Harmonic Analysis and the Theory of Nonlinear
Equations, &lt;br/&gt;and stimulate further refinement of the tools of
modern&lt;br/&gt;Mathematics.
