This project deals with the production of ceramic composites such as Al2O3-SiC
by hot forging. Al2O3-SiC composites are available commercially but expensive
due to hot pressing. Near net shape forging could reduce cost of these
commercial components and open up opportunities in adiabatic and gas turbine
engine components, armor, pump parts and high thermal conductivity electronic
substrates for AlN.
