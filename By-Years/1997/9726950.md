Abstract 9726950 Grodzicker The Cold Spring Harbor meeting on the Cell Cycle has
been held bi-annually since 1992, and has become one of the most important
international forums for discussion and criticism of progress in the cell cycle
field. One of the highlights of the 1998 meting will be the progress in
understanding the cell cycle controls on DNA replication. The meeting will also
emphasize the impact that cell cycle research is beginning to have in
understanding mechanisms that control cellular differentiation, programmed cell
death, senescence and transcription. Platform presentations will be selected
entirely from submitted abstracts, and strong emphasis will be place upon
participation by graduate students and post-doctoral fellows. ***
