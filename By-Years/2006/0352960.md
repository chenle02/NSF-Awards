Image-Slicing Multislit Option (GISMO) for the Magellan I telescope's Inamori
Magellan Areal Camera and Spectrograph (IMACS) will be developed to allow high-
efficiency spectroscopy of regions in which the targets are closely packed or
where the targets are compact. The goal will be achieved through the use of an
image-reformatter to feed the wide-field reimaging spectrograph. The reformatter
will unpack slices 24 arc seconds high and a few arc minutes long from the
center of the field and redirect them to take advantage of the entire 16 x 16
arc minute field of the spectrograph. The development of this instrument will
allow even more ambitious versions at other telescopes.
