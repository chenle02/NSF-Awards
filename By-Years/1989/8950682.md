Loma Linda University will strengthen its general physics laboratories by adding
experiments on the detection and measurement of nuclear radiation. Undergraduate
students from biology, chemistry, engineering, mathematics, health science, as
well as physics take this course. General Physics is the only course where many
of them will be introduced to the principles of nuclear radiation and
measurement. Beta and gamma ray detectors and power supplies will be purchased;
associated electronics will be constructed. Software will be written to
integrate these experiments into the existing computer-based laboratory
curriculum. The university will match the award with an equal amount of funds.
