This proposal requests funding to continue a summer REU site in the various
disciplines of ocean and earth sciences at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory
of Columbia University. Approximately 10 undergraduates are to be recruited
nationally to conduct research at LDEO. Each student is paired with a senior
researcher, chosen to reflect the student's interests and background. The
program consists of a variety of scientific lectures and discussion groups, a
written report, a final oral presentation, and a program of social and
scientific interactions.
