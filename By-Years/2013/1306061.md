The IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy will be held in San Francisco, CA on
May 19-22, 2013. Since 1980, the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy has been
the premier forum for the presentation of developments in computer security and
electronic privacy, and for bringing together researchers and practitioners in
the field. This proposal requests funding to assist 15-20 US-based graduate
students in attending this meeting. Participation in symposia like this is an
extremely important part of the graduate school experience, providing the
opportunity to interact with more senior researchers and to be exposed to
leading edge work in the field. This grant enables the participation of students
who would otherwise be unable to attend the IEEE Symposium on Security and
Privacy.
