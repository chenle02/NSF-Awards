This award will provide one-half of the funds required to purchase an electron
microprobe for installation and operation in the Department of Geology and
Geography at the University of Massachusetts. The University is committed to
providing the remaining one-half of the funds necessary. The analytical
capabilities of the electron microprobe (chemical analysis of a wide range of
elements at concentrations down to a few hundred parts per million with a
spatial resolution of a few micrometers) are central to research in petrology,
mineralogy and structural geology. The research projects at the University of
Massachusetts that will benefit from the new equipment include studies of the
New England Appalachians, the sedimentary basins of Mesozoic eastern North
America and the lower crust and upper mantle underneath Africa.
