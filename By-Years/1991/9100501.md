The detailed petrologic and geochemical study of a suite of metrmorphic rocks
recovered from the Hess Deep will be conducted. The goal is to develop a model
for the spatial and temporal evolution of metamorphism in the ocean crustal
sections considering the effects of axial hydrothermal alteration, crustal
aging, and uplift and exposure of the scarps. This study provides the
opportunity to characterize the root.zones of hydrothermal systems as well as
the processes that control the distribution of metamorphism in oceanic crust.
