The proposed research expands current work at the grain scale on eolian sediment
transport into the multiple grainsize realm and into the Martian and snow
systems. The PI will explore mountain scale evolution due to growth by
characteristic earthquakes, and decay by a suite of realistic geomorphic
processes acting at smaller scales.
