Cabrillo College's Watsonville Digital Bridge Academy is providing information
technology training and ancillary services to students aged 17 to 25 who do not
view themselves as candidates for college or who are under-prepared for
community college level study: minority, reentry and other at-risk students. In
a partnership between community agencies, national corporations with nearby
major facilities and the college, the Academy offers a carefully sequenced
bridge program that incorporates academic, work experience and wrap-around
support services. The intent is to seamlessly transit students into Cabrillo
College's 18-24 month IT technician career programs, support their completion of
training, and track their progress into IT jobs or further higher education. The
program aids young adults in developing a strengthened sense of self, an
awareness of their intellectual abilities, and a strong sense of responsibility
for their futures. It does this with an immersion style foundation course using
proven training models from corporate settings. In addition to accelerated basic
skills remediation, academic challenges and work experience, services such as
childcare, financial aid, legal advice, housing, transportation, and counseling
are available. This project is model for community colleges to create a well-
trained workforce in any technical area by engaging existing local resources.
