Abstract

Principal Investigator: Etingof, Pavel I. Proposal Number: DMS - 0750598
Institution: Massachusetts Institute of Technology Title: Conference Proposal:
Symmetries in Mathematics and Physics

The one-week conference "Symmetries in Mathematics and Physics", which is being
organized to honor the 65th birthday of Prof. Victor G. Kac (MIT), intends to
present some of the most important and recent developments in Mathematics and
Physics through the concept of "symmetry", which encompasses the major algebraic
ideas involved in the description of physical problems.

For instance, conservation (of energy, momentum, charge) laws are often obtained
as consequences of the invariance of some physical system under suitable
continuous symmetries; the representation theory of Lie superalgebras describes
the concept of supersymmetry and supersymmetric objects, such as fundamental
particles and interactions. The quantization of physical systems can be
interpreted in terms of quantization of the corresponding algebraic structures
and representations.

Scientists who studied and developed the central ideas of the above theories are
among the invited speakers.
