9420283 Barneby The species-rich American tropics remain poorly documented, and
this obtains even for woody plants important in agroforestry. Dr. Rupert Barneby
of the New York Botanical Garden is conducting fundamental taxonomic studies of
the leguminous trees of several genera in the tribe Ingeae, including the mimosa
relatives Calliandra and Pithecellobium. From study of extensive collections of
herbarium material and past field work in selected sites in South America, he is
describing and classifying ca. 200 species native to the Neotropics, placed in
four genera. Older classifications have confused the generic limits of American,
African, and Asiatic representatives of these groups, and thus prevented
biogeographical analysis of migrational history. Barneby's monographic research
will provide precise descriptions for all the species, reliable identification
keys, accurate mapping of the geographical distributions of the taxa, and
synthesis of the taxonomic relationships among the groups. Taxonomic monography,
also characterized as alpha-level taxonomy, provides comprehensive documentation
of the species resources for a major lineage of organisms. For the woody legumes
of the Calliandra and Pithecellobium complex, Barneby's research will complete
the study of a major portion of the American tropical Leguminosae. ??
