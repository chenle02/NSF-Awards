Reproduction requires continuous growth and ovulation of eggs from the ovary.
Eggs grow in structures called follicles. In birds, the careful parceling of
follicles into the active pool throughout the animal's reproductive life ensures
a steady supply of oocytes for egg-laying. The mechanisms or pathways involved
in this careful balance between activation and continued quiescence are unknown.
However, dramatic changes in gene activity occur in follicular cells and this is
associated with follicular activation and growth. These changes are part of a
process called differentiation. The end result of follicular differentiation is
the production of a fertile egg and important systemic hormones such as estrogen
and progesterone. The long-term objective of the proposed research is to
understand the intra-ovarian pathways involved in follicle activation and
growth. The inhibitors of growth (ING) proteins are a newly discovered class of
nuclear proteins that "read" the state of the nuclear DNA (chromatin). ING
proteins recruit modifying enzymes that repress chromatin and therefore inhibit
differentiation. ING2 mRNA is high in quiescent avian follicles and decrease as
follicles grow larger. The proposed research will test the hypothesis that ING2
inhibits follicular development by maintaining the nuclear DNA of follicular
cells in a repressed state. Experiments will be conducted to test this
hypothesis using a newly developed small follicle culture system in conjunction
with molecular inhibition of ING2 mRNA (RNAi). These studies will yield valuable
insight into a basic biological mechanism of cellular differentiation and
ovarian development in birds. The PI is committed to the training and career
advancement of qualified graduate and undergraduate students and in particular
seeks to increase the pool of trainees from underrepresented groups in biology.
