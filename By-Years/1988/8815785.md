This research is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of computer-aided chemistry. The focus of this research is in five
interrelated areas: 1) the development of new molecular structure descriptors,
2) new developments in pattern recognition and multivariate analysis methods as
applied to chemical problems, 3) development of quantitative structure-retention
relationships (QSRR) in chromatography, 4) carbon thirteen nuclear magnetic
resonance spectral simulation, and 5) interpretation of complex analytical data
from capillary column chromatographic experiments of biological samples. This
research is designed to develop new computer algorithms for chemical analysis.
These algorithms will be used to predict properties of molecules, particularly
in the areas of chromatography and nuclear magnetic resonance.
