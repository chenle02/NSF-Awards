9404384 Zumbrun This project concerns the study of nonlinear systems of partial
differential equations. It consists of two main programs, in parabolic and
hyperbolic conservation laws, respectively. The first project involves the study
of stability of waves in viscous conservation laws. This project is intimately
connected with the central problems of hyperbolic admissibility and the inviscid
limit. Current theory, based on energy methods, remains ad hoc and incomplete. A
new, pointwise stability analysis is proposed for the treatment of several open
problems, including: Lebesgue integrability behavior, rarefactions, multiple
wave patterns, undercompressive and "fake Lax" shocks, weak deflagration waves,
multi-dimensional fronts in MHD, and nonuniform convergence of shock capturing
schemes. The second project involves refined wave tracing methods for hyperbolic
conservation laws. Wave tracing gives a great deal of information about
approximate solutions obtained by the Glimm random choice scheme. It is proposed
that, by refined accounting techniques, more of this information can be
extracted in the limiting process. Previously, decay and convergence to N-waves
have been established for nonconvex systems. More recently, existence and decay
have been shown for periodic solutions of nxn, nonresonant systems, generalizing
the work of Glimm and Lax for 2x2 systems. It is planned to study periodic
solutions of nonconvex and of resonant systems, and, ultimately, continuous
dependence on initial data. This project deals with equations of applied
mathematics. In particular, the equations of continuum mechanics will be study.
Emphasis will be placed on the study of stability and convergence of viscous
shock and rarefaction waves. The analysis can be applied to real world problems
encountered, for example, in gas dynamics. ***
