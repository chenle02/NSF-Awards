This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I (SBIR) project will develop a
novel antimicrobial&lt;br/&gt;surface modification for polymeric biomaterials.
This surface modification could be used to develop antimicrobial catheters,
hubs, fabrics, and surfaces for medical instruments, as well as biofilm
resistant dental and water lines. The need for antimicrobial catheters is great.
Every year in the U.S., twenty million hospital patients are catheterized. Use
of these devices places large numbers of patients at risk for a variety of
catheter-related infectious complications. In U.S. ICUs approximately 500 to
4000 patients die&lt;br/&gt;annually of central venous catheter-related
bloodstream infections. The annual cost of caring for patients with central
line-associated blood stream infections is $60 to $460 million. This Phase I
project proposes a novel antimicrobial surface modification (1) that will
covalently attach active groups to the surface of a variety of plastics,
including polymers commonly used in medicine; (2) that can be formed on both the
inner and outer surfaces of complex geometries; (3) that will inhibit bacterial
adhesion by nonspecific oxidative destruction and by electrostatic repulsion of
negatively charged bacteria; (4) that will be effective against bacteria, fungi,
and spores; and (5) that will not promote increased antibiotic
resistance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary commercial application of this
project will be in the medical instrumentation market.&lt;br/&gt;
