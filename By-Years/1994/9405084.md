Carey 9405084 This research deals with the analysis and numerical solution of
nonlinear systems of hyperbolic transport equations. The equations are to be
solved using a generalized Galerkin finite element method, with additional
numerical dissipation for enhancing stability and capturing solution
discontinuities.
