This project is awarding 76 scholarships to 29 students enrolled in Electronic
and Computer Engineering Technology at the technical college, and Computer
Science at the university. The project objectives include creation of an
intercollegiate student cohort, increased enrollment and retention of students
in associate degree technology and baccalaureate programs, increased enrollment
of women and first-generation college students, improved persistence, and
greater involvement of business representatives.

The project supports students who enroll in and complete an associates degree,
and continues support until scholars have earned their bachelors degree. Cohort
activities have been thoughtfully designed to encourage development of
interpersonal relationships and sharing. Support services include orientation,
advising, intercollegiate relationships, study groups, mentoring, supplemental
lectures, attendance at regional technology meetings, and assistance with
admission fees and child care.
