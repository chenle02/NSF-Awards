This project will introduce Macintosh IIsi and IIci computers with relevant
software, interfaces, and probes, into all chemistry laboratory courses at
Siena. First-year students will use the computers for data acquisition through
interfaced temperature and pH probes and for data analysis through graphing and
spreadsheet programs. Second-year students will use the computers for
information retrieval (spectra, safety, physical properties). Third and fourth
year students will use the computers for molecular modeling, quantum mechanical
calculations, fourier transform analyses, interfacing projects, and independent
research projects.
