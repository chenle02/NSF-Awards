While much has been accomplished in the QLTC programs, several critical start-up
issues remain. In this proposal we address the need for computer resources
necessary for full program execution, specifically graphics-capable computers
for module and presentation-material development in computerized classroom
facilities. These facilities will allow us to enhance quantitative reasoning
skills in students by giving them computer-delivered materials 1) as class
presentations, 2) as in-class active-learning opportunities, and 3) as out-of-
class laboratory opportunities in the QLTC itself.
