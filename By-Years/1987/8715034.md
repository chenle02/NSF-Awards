This award will support collaborative geological field research in Mauritania
between Dr. Gary Kocurek, University of Texas in Austin and Dr. Max Deynoux of
the Laboratoire de Petrologie, University of Poitiers, France. The investigators
plan to study a Saharan sand sea (the Archar Erg in northwestern Mauritania)
that, from all evidence, is actively migrating with the formation of a super
bounding surface in its wake. It has been recently recognized that regional
unconformities (termed super bounding surfaces) occur within ancient eolian
(wind) sequences of the western U.S. These surfaces potentially allow local and
regional correlation and the recognition of distinct genetic sand-sea migration.
Super surfaces formed by sand-sea migration are the least understood, largely
because the modern small dune fields in the temperate climate of North America
are not viable analogues for large-scale, trade-wind-belt sand seas that are
migrating. In this joint project Dr. Kocurek will benefit from French expertise,
logistical support and access to an unusual geological site. The study will
address processes of surface development with sand-sea migration, including
controls on sand deflation, preservation potential of sand-sea deposits, and
formation of features characteristic of this type of terrestrial unconformity.
