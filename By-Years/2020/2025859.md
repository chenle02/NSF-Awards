The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable superior digital displays with
better cost, power, and performance. Today's typical solutions include liquid
crystal displays (LCDs) and organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). LCDs require
many layers of materials, each of which adds cost, reduces efficiency, and
increases fragility; OLEDs are typically even more expensive to make and degrade
faster than LCDs. This project proposes a manufacturing process for an improved
display assembled from arrays of very small light sources. These displays will
enable advances in many applications of low-cost, lightweight displays, such as
artificial and virtual reality headsets, automotive consoles, wearables, medical
devices, and mobile devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project develops a manufacturing process to place
millions of microelectronic components, such as micro-scale light emitting
diodes (microLEDs) onto substrates with the required accuracy to build
functional displays. Conventional approaches use basic mechanical tooling to
pick up each microLED from a source wafer and place it on the target circuit
board. The objective of this project is to develop a manufacturing process
consistent with yield, cost, and performance requirements. The project is based
on properties of polymers related to those used in photolithography. When
illuminated by light, the polymers vaporize and cause components adhered to them
to be transferred to a substrate, moving millions of microLEDs in a single,
cost-effective step. This research will advance this technology toward
translation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
