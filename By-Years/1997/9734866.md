Proposal: DMS-9734866 Principal Investigator: Christopher D. Sogge Abstract:
Sogge will work on various problems in Fourier analysis and nonlinear wave
equations. He would like to concentrate mainly on two types of problems. First,
he is interested in proving local and global existence theorems for nonlinear
wave equations in various settings, including wave equations outside of convex
obstacles. For this, the main analysis involves proving a suitable "Strichartz
estimate." Such estimates in the situation where there is a boundary are much
more delicate than in the case without boundary; however, some preliminary
results have already been obtained in joint work with Hart Smith. Sogge is also
very interested in studying maximal averages over curves and especially
interested in trying to establish such estimates in the curved space setting.
Sogge has been intrigued for some time by certain questions in nonlinear partial
differential equations and Fourier analysis. Such issues arise naturally in many
contexts. For instance, the equations of general relativity are just nonlinear
wave equations. One of the main things Sogge would like to do is to show that
such equations have solutions in the region outside of an obstacle. This might
be thought of as a model for equations describing black holes, where the
obstacle plays the role of the black hole. Sogge is also interested in basic
problems in Fourier analysis. Since its introduction in the pioneering work of
Fourier himself on problems of heat conduction, Fourier analysis has been the
main tool to study differential equations, which constitute the formal language
of physics.
