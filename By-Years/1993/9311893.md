ABSTRACT -- CTS-9311893 Williams The application of a transverse magnetic field
to Czochralski crystal growth of semiconductors has been found to improve the
distribution of dopants and the crystal quality itself. However, optimal results
are impossible to obtain without an understanding of the melt flow, which has
proved elusive. The PI proposes to formulate the initial development of a three-
dimensional spectral method numerical model to examine the melt growth for
moderate to high magnetic field strengths. The planning activities will consist
of an in-depth literature review, and a close examination of the governing
equations, boundary conditions, and simplifications. Care will be taken to fully
explore the aims and motivations of the larger numerical study, and to initiate
and maintain contact with experimentalist in the field. Initial numerical
studies will be performed to promote familiarity with the computational and
graphical techniques.
