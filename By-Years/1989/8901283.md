This project addresses issues in the design and development of tools for
automating the development of effective flow analysis systems for logic
programs. The focus of this work is on investigating families of related
analysis systems, with an emphasis on pragmatic aspects of implementations, such
as precision and efficiency. The project will investigate the identification of
families of related flow analysis applications, and develop algorithms for
implementing them automatically in ways that are efficient in practice. This
involves the investigation of automatic selection of data structures and machine
representations of abstract domains; incorporation of efficient techniques for
recursive query evaluation over finite domains; and using program transformation
techniques for the generation of efficient flow analysis programs dynamically.
It is hoped that this work will aid implementors of logic programming languages
in the rapid development of efficient and effective flow analysis systems for
such languages.
