9314455 Wilkins This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research
in condensed matter physics between John W. Wilkins, Mebarek Alouani of Ohio
State University and Christian Brouder of the University of Nancy and LURE (the
French Laboratory for the Application of Electromagnetic Rays). The objective of
their research is to study the long-range interaction that causes magnetic
ordering in transition-metals and rare-earth compounds by using circular
magnetic x-ray dichroism (CMXD). CMXD is a new spectroscopy with potential of
providing information of the magnetic properties of a broad range of magnetic
systems. The proposed research on a theoretical approach and calculations will
advance CMXD technique and development. The U.S. investigators bring to this
collaboration theoretical expertise and their new numerical codes. This is
complemented by French group's adaptation of multiple-scattering theory to these
problems and the excellent experimental facilities at LURE.
