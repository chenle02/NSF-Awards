Low-intensity elective logging of tropical forests is a promising means of
according tropical forests economic value, thus providing a financial incentive
for their retention. Currently lacking, but vital, are good data on the
demography of timber species in order to make selective harvesting of tropical
timber species sustainable. This study will examine in detail the ecology and
demography of mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla), a valuable hardwood species in
the Neotropics. Dr. Hubbell will study the demography of mahogany in (1)
pristine forest, (ii) in recently logges forests, and (iii) forest logged 20
years ago. Demographic data from pristine forest will identify the factors
responsible for controlling the abundance of mahogany in natural populations.
Demographic data from the recently logged forest will provide data on immediate
mortality of individuals during logging, and estimates of residual stocking
after logging. The demography of mahogany in forest logging twenty year ago will
provide data on the long-term response of natural populations to selective
logging. Information from this study will aid in assessing the sustainability of
current logging operations, and through simulation models, developing better
forest management practises. Dr. Hubbell will also assist in forming a long-term
research program by (i) training Bolivian nationals in data collection and
analysis techniques, and (ii) establishing permanent forest inventory plots,
which will provide the basis for future research on other potentially commercial
species.
