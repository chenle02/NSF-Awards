This project explores complex interactions between cruciferous plants, one of
their most important herbivores, the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella, and
its major parasitoid, Diadegma insulare. The diamondback moth is a major, world-
wide pest of crucifer crops. The work examines the role of variable sex ratios
in parasitoids and their herbivorous hosts in population regulation and dynamics
of 3-trophic level systems. It concentrates on direct and indirect effects of
plants on interactions between herbivbores and parasitoids and tests the
hypothesis that interactions between sex-ratio variation and plant preferences
of the moths and wasps provide a mechanism for density-dependent regulation of
herbivore populations over several generations. The project will provide
detailed estimated of the effects of plants on both herbivore and comprehensive
dynamic models. The work is relevant to questions of stability of parasitoid-
host dynamics and to biological control in an economically important system.
