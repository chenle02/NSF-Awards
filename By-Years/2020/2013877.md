The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to address an unmet need in incomplete
colonoscopy procedures, as they can result in missed colorectal cancer and
ultimately increase healthcare expenditures related to follow-up procedures,
with an estimated $1 B in the colonoscopy market. The proposed device will
transition over 15% of colonoscopies today that are incomplete to fully screened
procedures at a fraction of the cost of a colonoscopy. This proposed approach
offers an entirely new manner for completing incomplete procedures to minimize
costs, while improving patient outcomes and overall clinical experience.

The proposed SBIR Phase I project will demonstrate feasibility of an integrated
balloon overtube that can be used intraoperatively as a mid-procedure, time-
efficient addition on the endoscope. Current balloon overtubes are used only in
challenging conditions, due to their troublesome slippage and inefficient
application, but their use during colonoscopy can significantly improve cecal
intubation rates and overall outcomes. The proposed advanced balloon overtube
directly addresses the need to maximize complete colonoscopies. This project
will advance the development of an intraoperative tool for endoscopists.
