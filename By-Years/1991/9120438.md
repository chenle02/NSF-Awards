ABSTRACT The project involves the continuation of work already in progress on
producing a basic description of the Kutenai language, an American Indian
language of the Pacific Northwest which is not closely related to any other
language. The basic goal is to produce two volumes, one a coleection of texts in
the language, the other an analytic dictionary. Lawrence Morgan recently
completed a dissertation that provides a grammatical description of the
language. The two volumes proposed, together with Morgan's dissertation, will
provide a well-rounded description of the language. The dissertation is
primarily descriptive and makes the facts of Kutenai grammar available to
linguists of all theoretical persuasions. The project will involve transcribing
a number of the texts that already exist on tape, entering them onto computer,
and analyzing them. There are also some existing texts that have only been
transcribed, and others that have been transcribed and entered onto computer but
which need to be analyzed. The dictionary will serve as a glossary for the
volume of texts and for the dissertation. Field work will be undertaken and the
project will interface with local community-based language projects.
