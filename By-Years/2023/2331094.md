This project supports six WINS volunteers to participate in SCinet activities in
support of the 2023 Supercomputing Conference (SC23) scheduled November 12 - 17,
2023 in Denver, CO. Volunteers will gain hands on experience in the ground-up
construction of the conference network. WINS strives to have a diverse
representation of organizations and applicant backgrounds in the group selected
each year, with the 2023 group expected to be the most diverse since the start
of the program, including many participants from underrepresented groups.

WINS volunteers will participate in SCinet, one of the fastest and most advanced
computer networks in the world which supports the annual Supercomputing
Conference (SC). Expected outcomes include WINS SC23 volunteers developing new
technical skills, gaining exposure to technologies or equipment outside their
standard work environment, adding to their professional network, improving
collaboration and communication skills, applying the skills developed during
SCinet at their home institution, and access to future professional development
opportunities. The travel funded by the proposal will continue the broadening
and expansion of knowledge and training for network engineers and information
technology professionals who desire to build expertise and continue their
education and careers in network and computer systems. Through this program, the
National Science Foundationâ€™s mission is strengthened by opening more training
and career opportunities for a diverse workforce.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
