In an effort to keep pace with theoretical and technical developments in the
life sciences, as well as with new ideas in education, the college is revising
laboratory experiences for undergraduates in order to emphasize structure-
function relationships and the interdisciplinary nature of science. This program
adds new laboratories that make use of microscope-based methods that allow
examination of dynamic phenomena in cells, for instance immunocytochemical,
autoradiographic, and in situ hybridization methods. The implementation of such
new techniques, as well as the addition of a microscopy component to several
existing labs, requires new and expanded microscopy facilities. In addition to
scientific goals, these enhanced laboratories satisfy several pedagogical goals:
to demystify science, to provide an opportunity for real discovery, and to learn
to communicate ideas and think critically.
