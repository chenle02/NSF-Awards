This action will provide funds for an investigator from the University of
Arizona to continue his work on two experiments at Fermilab, E705 and E771.
These experiments are designed to study the production mechanisms and the decay
properties of particle states composed of heavy quarks, c- quarks (E705) and
b-quarks (E771). Data for E705 is already taken and E771 is in preparation. E705
will be a precision experiment designed to understand better the spectroscopy of
c- quarks while E771 will be a pilot experiment to guide future research at
Fermilab. Institutions collaborating in these experiments are: Arizona, Athens,
U.C.,Berkeley, Duke, Fermilab, Prairie View A&amp;M, McGill and Northwestern.
The principal investigator has been a prime mover in the conceptual design of
these experiments.
