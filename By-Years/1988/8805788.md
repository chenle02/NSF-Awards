The perfluorinated oxyanion ligands oxopentafluorotellurate(VI) and
perfluorotertiarybutoxide will be used to prepare new classes of very reactive
compounds of transition metal and lanthanide ions. These compounds are expected
to have the highest reactivity (Lewis acidity) possible in a given solvent, due
to solvent molecules in the coordination sphere of the metal ion. Efforts will
focus on solvents which are extremely weak donors, such as arene hydrocarbons
and chlorocarbons, so that compounds containing coordinated solvent molecules as
extremely easily replaced ligands will be formed. Extremely bulky anions which
have the potential for being the least coordinating anion, such as
tetrakis(oxopentafluorotellurate(VI))borate, will be synthesized, and their
reactions with solvated metal ions will be studied in the weakly coordinating
solvents mentioned above. The enhanced chemical reactivity of metal ion
complexes of these weakly coordinating solvents and ligands will be applied to
selective oxidation of organic substrates, the generation of unusual high
oxidation states of metal ions, such as Cu(III) and Fe(IV), and the study of
naked metal and non-metal cations in solution. The results of this project may
provide a new method of controlling the reactivity of metal ions in solutions.
