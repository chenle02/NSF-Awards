This dissertation research will investigate changes between 1960 and 2000 in
issue agendas of environmental social movements. Annual data will be coded for
the almost 500 environmental organizations listed in the Encyclopedia of
Associations. Issues have been grouped into seventeen categories based on
activities described in the Encyclopedia. Issue agendas are expected to vary as
a result of variations in organizational structure (e.g., local, participatory
movements versus international organizations), tactics (ten overlapping
categories such as electoral, legal, and direct action), other organizational
characteristics such as size and location, influences from the international
environmental movement, legislative successes and debates, media attention, and
foundation support.
