The functonalization of C60 and C70 by means of a (2+2) photocyclization of
cyclic enones onto the fullerene skeleton will be examined. The generality and
chemoselectivity of the methodology will be developed through a selective use of
different enones, and comparisons of the product distributions obtained with C60
and C70 fullerenes. Mechanistic details will be elucidated with particular
attention paid to understanding why the high energy enone triplets prefer to
undergo the chemical reaction with the fullerene skeleton, rather than energy
transfer to a lower energy fullerene triplet state. Metalloporphyrins tethered
to the fullerenes will be achieved by means of this photosynthetic methodology,
and the photoinduced electron transfer between the tethered fragments examined.
Graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in all aspects of the
research including its presentation at scientific meetings. With this award, the
Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports the research and
educational activities of Professors Schuster and Wilson of the Department of
Chemistry at New York University. Professors Schuster and Wilson will focus
their research efforts on generalizing a photochemical methodology for
functionalizing C60 and C70 fullerenes. Photophysical experiments will be
undertaken to elucidate the mechanism of addition and the factors affecting the
rate of chemical reaction with the fullerene skeleton relative to the rate of
energy transfer. Professors Schuster and Wilson involve both graduate and
undergraduate in all aspects of the work making the research and its
presentation educational vehicles.
