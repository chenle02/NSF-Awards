This research project has three parts; the first is to develop a general class
of models and inferential techniques for shape analysis. The second aspect is
the development of a theory for the case when the least-squares estimate of mean
shape can be written as the principal eigenvector of a certain matrix. Then
highly interactive software can be written for visualization of shape spaces and
shape differences. The shape of a physical object is defined as whatever remains
after the position of the object, its size and its orientation are accounted
for. In many fields including medicine, biology, imaging, computer vision,
industrial engineering, psychology, much of the data is spatial and is often in
the form of images. This research will develop statistical and high-performance
graphical methods for analyzing and visualizing shapes when these are of
principal interest.
