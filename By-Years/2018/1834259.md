The Division of Materials Research, together with the Division of Physics and
the Division of Astronomical Sciences contribute funds to this award that
provides support for the International Conference on Computational Physics,
which will be held at the University of California at Davis from July 29th to
August 2nd 2018. This is a highly interdisciplinary meeting that brings together
a diverse group of leading researchers from academia, national laboratories, and
industry, aiming to broadly share advances in computational physics, to
facilitate networking among attendees, and to discuss and further general plans
for the community. The topics covered span the topical areas of the Divisions
involved. NSF support will enable the participation of 12 early-career
scientists, who might not otherwise be able to attend.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
