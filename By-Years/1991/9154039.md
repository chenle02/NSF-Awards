The purpose of the California State University -Fresno Project MOST program is
to provide opportunity for college- eligible underrepresented students to
explore, in nurturing environment, the possibility of becoming middle school
science teachers. The program consists of a series of newly designed science and
education courses, and support by a counseling/tutorial service provided by the
CSU office of Science Careers Opportunity Program (SCOP). Participating
undergraduate students will strengthen their knowledge in science and
mathematics. A specially designed science education program underrepresented
teacher candidates will be designed to lead to credentials in life and/or
physical science. The program will begin in the Fall, 1992 and run for five
years. The program has been designed as a long range program to ensure
continuity beyond the duration of this project. New minority candidates will be
brought into the 5 year program each year.
