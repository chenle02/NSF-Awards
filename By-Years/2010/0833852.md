The objective of this exploratory research is to develop novel anti-theft
Internet-assisted Global Positioning System (GPS) technology for personal
computers. The approach is based on a software GPS radio installation and its
enhanced assisted-mode operation. When a notebook computer is connected to the
Internet after a theft occurs, the computer will request assistance data from a
server to compute and silently report its location. Assistance enables indoor
operation and includes information from Internet Protocol (IP) address locators
and data from reference GPS receivers.

The intellectual merit of the proposed research is in the new concept,
algorithms and assistance formats. The proposed solution uses very coarse IP-
address location as a reference and employs appropriate novel algorithms for
enhanced software operation in diverse environments. Other current methods are
not comparable for global operation in various wireless and wired networks.
Conventional assisted GPS positioning has been standardized for all cellular
networks and recognized as the best known technology to meet the wireless safety
mandate for emergency calls. Reference assistant data in computer networks are
obtained differently and they are coarse compared with cellular networks
requiring customized algorithmic solutions.

With respect to broader impacts, notebook theft is a prevalent computer crime.
Computer positioning has the potential to minimize multi-billion dollar losses
of data and computers. It also has the potential to enable other applications,
such as asset tracking and positioning for computer-originated emergency calls.
The project aims to enhance the pool of engineering talent in South Texas,
including students from underrepresented groups, through cooperation with
ongoing educational programs and dissemination.
