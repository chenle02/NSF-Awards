Engineering training in biotechnology requires an understanding of the
biological process involved and the constraints and requirements of large-scale
manufacturing. Although many colleges and universities have developed successful
postbaccalaureate training programs in biotechnology and biochemical
engineering, similar programs are not available at the introductory
undergraduate level. By introducing students to the engineering aspects of
biotechnology at a very early stage (freshmen or sophomore level) the project
motivates them into acquiring the necessary biology, chemistry, and engineering
knowledge required for a successful career in biotechnology. A Biotechnology
Engineering Laboratory is being established with the goal of developing a group
of experiments that can be used to exemplify the contribution of engineering to
biotechnology. Each experimental unit can be used as modules for an introductory
(freshmen or sophomore) level biotechnology engineering course, or the combined
group of experiments can be used to teach an upper undergraduate or graduate
level laboratory course in biotechnology engineering. The Biotechnology
Laboratory is being used for a variety of purposes: teaching both at the
introductory (freshmen and sophomore) and advanced (senior and graduate) levels,
and research for both undergraduates interested in conducting an independent
study or a senior research project, and high school students, in particular
women and minority students, as part of summer internships. The project is
developing a group of experiments that can be used at all levels, from
introductory to advanced level courses; to integrate engineering in the
interdisciplinary teaching of biotechnology that already includes biology and
chemistry; and to attract students interested in satisfying math/science
requirements to experience a state-of-the-art engineering laboratory with the
ultimate purpose of permanently attracting them to a science and engineering
education.
