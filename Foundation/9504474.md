9504474 Lempp Lempp will investigate aspects of the central notions od
computability, decidability, and definability in various parts of mathematics.
Computability in arithmetic gives rise to degree structures, given by
collections of sets of natural numbers of equal information content. Two related
issues involved in this research are (i) the existence of automorphisms for such
structures (yielding nondefinability results) and (ii) the decidability of
fragments of their first-order theories. Computability in group theory involves
the existence of algorithms for deciding certain properties of finitely
presented groups. Lempp plans to determine the complexity of some of these
problems in the Kleene-Mostowski hierarchy, and to show the undecidability of
related problems for finite groups. Computability, decidability, and
definability are central notions of mathematical logic, relevant to all of
mathematics. Lempp's project deals with these notions, both inside his field of
expertise, computability theory, and in the connections to other areas. As
mentioned above, computability in arithmetic classifies sets of natural numbers
according to their information content. Lempp will investigate the existence of
transformations which preserve this content, and the related question of
deciding certain elementary properties of these sets. In group theory the goal
is to investigate the transfer of undecidable problems from the infinite to the
finite. Lempp will also seek logical criteria for "feasible" computability,
which is to say the sort of computations which could conceivably be done by
machine. ***
