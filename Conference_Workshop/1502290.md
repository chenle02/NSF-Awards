This award provides partial support for U.S.-based participants in two summer
schools in Geometry and Physics (GAP): GAP XIII (2015) to be held at the IBS
Center for Geometry and Physics at POSTECH, Republic of Korea, July 6--10, 2015,
and GAP XIV (2016) to be held at Penn State University in summer 2016. The main
purposes of the proposed activities are: (1) gathering leading experts and young
researchers working in rapidly developing subjects and (2) fostering interaction
between groups of mathematicians and physicists working on different aspects of
related problems to facilitate cross-fertilization between different fields and
dissemination of the most recent results of current research. There are many
talented young people working in this area. GAP XIII and GAP XIV will provide
them with excellent opportunities to disseminate their ideas and to broaden
their perspective. The organizers anticipate inviting many mathematicians at the
postdoctoral and graduate student level (from Asia, Europe, and the United
States) to these summer schools. Both summer schools will include a poster
session so as to give young researchers a chance to present their recent work.
Each summer school will also constitute an excellent opportunity for young
American scientists to exchange ideas with their foreign peers and launch
collaborations. The website for GAP XIII is

The theme of the schools is "Higher Structures: Derived Geometry and
Quantization." GAP XIII (2015) will be devoted to derived geometry and GAP XIV
(2016) to quantization. Higher structures has emerged as a new field in
mathematics, as well as in mathematical and theoretical physics. The subject has
undergone tremendous exploration recently due to its close connection to a
number of areas of mathematics and mathematical physics, including algebraic
topology, Lie theory, homotopy algebras, mirror symmetry, string theory, quantum
field theory and noncommutative geometry. The project will be devoted to
bringing together different aspects of higher structures, in particular derived
geometry and quantization, as well as identifying new emerging directions of
investigation, which is becoming more and more urgent as the field progresses.
Derived geometry develops a powerful machinery for studying the residual
geometry of badly behaved intersections and quotient spaces of high current
interest in different areas of mathematics and mathematical physics while
quantization establishes bridges between classical and quantum physics. Roughly
speaking, quantization is the study and prediction of quantum phenomena, which
are normally described by noncommutative associative algebras, based on the
geometry of the underlying classical objects.
