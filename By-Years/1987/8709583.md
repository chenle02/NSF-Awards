This research is concerned with examining several questions in mathematics
computationally. The specific areas being examined are: image segmentation and
other optimization involving neural networks using computer simulation; computer
vision and related problems in computational geometry; extending and testing an
extension of Prolog that includes the priority method of classical recursion;
finding an explicit Kahler- Einstein metric for a K3 surface with the help of a
computer; investigating finite dimensional, multi-particle variational problems
for configurations of small numbers of particles with the aid of a computer.
