This project will improve an advanced undergraduate teaching and research
laboratory in Acoustics at Smith College. The Physics Department will acquire
the capability to use holographic interferometry to identify, demonstrate, and
analyze the vibrational modes of various objects, starting with musical
instruments. For this project Smith will purchase a vibration isolated optical
table and base, vibration exciter, accelerometer, digital shutter, variable
attenuator/beam splitter, and spatial filter. The Acoustics course requires a
semester-long experimental project from physics majors taking the course, and
shorter projects may be elected by non-majors. In addition, the Acoustics
laboratory is used by seniors doing Honors and Special Studies projects. Having
the capability to use holographic interferometry in the identification of
vibrational modes will provide several additional laboratory experiments for the
Acoustics course as well as giving majors another technique for use in their
experimental projects.
