The focus of this project is on the application of model theory (a branch of
mathematical logic) within mathematics. Model theory comes into the picture in
two ways: (a) it provides a new set of tools; (b) it provides a new language
within which to formulate results and problems. Recent successes demonstrate
that these can provide powerful new methods for many areas of mathematics and
can be the basis for breakthroughs on critical problems. This project focuses,
therefore, on a well defined and coherent research direction, made timely by
recent advances, not on a single mathematical problem.

Model-theoretic methods typically involve identifying and axiomatizing the first
order theories of classes of structures, studying their nonstandard models,
identifying the class of definable sets in a structure (quantifier-elimination),
and making use of the compactness theorem to work within rich nonstandard
models. There is a sophisticated machinery available (via Shelah and others) for
understanding definable sets in certain general classes of structures. For
example, once a concrete structure is identified as being stable, this machinery
comes into play.

The research problems to be emphasized in this project involve potential
application of model theoretic ideas and tools within symbolic dynamics and
algebraic geometry, the algebraic theory of differential equations, analysis,
and geometry.

One of the goals of this project to find new and effective ways to help
mathematicians learn how to use model theory. In particular, the researchers
selected for support by this project will often be mathematicians who work
outside model theory, and who are interested in finding ways to use it in their
own work.
