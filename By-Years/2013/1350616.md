In recent years, we have witnessed an explosion in the amounts of data being
acquired and analyzed in a wide variety of contexts. Data-driven techniques are
increasingly applied, not only in the traditional quantitative sciences, but
also throughout the social sciences and in a variety of other non-traditional
scenarios that challenge many of our common assumptions. For example, in
contexts such as collaborative filtering, personalized and predictive medicine,
and personalized learning systems, we face a variety of challenges due largely
to the fact that an important -- often the only -- source of data is people. In
these and many other modern applications, we want to learn about people using
the data that people supply.

This presents several difficulties, including the fact that such data is often
very "coarse" or heavily "quantized". It might even be binary or entirely
nonmetric data consisting of categories or comparisons. Moreover, in many of
these cases it is impossible to fully sample the data, and the underlying data
of interest may be constantly changing, necessitating approaches that can handle
incomplete observations and dynamic data models. This research confronts these
difficulties by building on recent progress in the design of efficient
algorithms for exploiting low-dimensional structure to perform inference, often
using highly incomplete and coarse observations. This research addresses a
number of fundamental theoretical and algorithmic questions in the context of
low-rank matrix recovery, nonmetric multidimensional scaling, unfolding, and
low-dimensional dynamic models. It has applications in contexts such as
collaborative filtering, personalized and predictive medicine, and personalized
learning systems.
