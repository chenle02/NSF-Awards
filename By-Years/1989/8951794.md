This award to Clemson University is made in response to a proposal submitted to
the NSF Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement Program, a program whose goal
is to extend support for undergraduate instructional equipment. The award will
provide one-half of the funds needed to acquire an atomic absorption
spectrophotometer for the chemical analysis of groundwater samples. The
University is committed to matching the NSF contribution for this equipment. The
instrumentation will be used to enhance the undergraduate curriculum in
environmental groundwater and to provide direct experience for undergraduate
laboratory students in groundwater analytical techniques.
