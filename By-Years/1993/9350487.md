9350487 Ibrahim The proposed research will develop computer models for
predicting the characteristics of the spray produced by the atomization of
liquid-fuel sheets such as in gas burners nozzles. An innovative mathematical
formulation that takes into account the effect of liquid viscosity and sheet
thickness attenuation is advanced. A computer code would accept normally known
parameters, such as sheet properties, initial velocity and thickness as input
and compute the outcome of the atomization process, such as the resultant fuel-
drop size and velocity. Predictions of the mean drop size and velocity would
eliminate the need of experimental distributions using the maximum entropy
principle. The results of the proposed effort are expected to enhance the
ability to perform a controlled design of the combustion processes that take
place in gas-turbine combustors. ***
