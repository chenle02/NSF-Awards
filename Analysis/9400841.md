940841 Felder The main goal of the proposed activity is to give an explicit
description of conformal blocks on Riemann surfaces, as a space of solutions of
a system of differential equations, generalizing the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov
equations. Properties of the equations and their solutions will be investigated.
In particular, integral representations of the solutions will be calculated,
with applications to the topology of configuration spaces on surfaces,
invariants of three-dimensional manifolds, and the theory of quantum groups and
integrable systems. Conformal Field Theory finds its origin in the physics of
surface at critical temperature, and string theory, a unified model of particle
interactions. The object of this research is the mathematical structure of
Conformal Field Theory. This theory explicitly associates a mathematical object
called a complex vector space of "conformal blocks" with equations that model
physical systems. ***
