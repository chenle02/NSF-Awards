In this project supported by the Chemistry Division and the Division of Chemical
and Transport Systems under the NSF/DOE Partnership in Basic Plasma Science and
Engineering, Cosby will measure electron-impact dissociation cross sections of
molecules and radicals important for plasmas at electron energies between the
dissociation threshold and 200 eV. Absolute cross sections, product
translational energy distributions, and product identifications will be
determined for a number of small molecules and radicals, including CFx, NFx,
SiFx, BFx (where x = 1-3), BCl2, BCl3, NO, N2O, SO, and SO2. The measurements
will be made in a crossed electron beam-fast neutral beam apparatus. Plasmas are
used to process critical materials in the electronics, aerospace, automotive,
steel, biomedical, and toxic waste management industries. Therefore, it is
important to be able to describe a plasma and its complex interactions with
materials. The data gathered in this project will provide input into models of
plasma which will allow the processing steps used in semiconductor fabrication
and other areas to be improved and optimized.
