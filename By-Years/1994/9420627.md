This project will conduct fundamental theoretical research on selected topics in
the collective behavior of dusty plasmas with applications to phenomena in dusty
space. The physical effects studied include (1) grain charging, (2) grain
dynamics and transport, and (3) waves, instabilities, and anomalous transport.
This research will investigate how realistic attributes of grains in space such
as finite grain size affects grain charging processes such as secondary electron
emission and photoemission. The research will specifically address the motion of
dust grains or aerosols in noctilucent clouds and polar mesospheric clouds in
the Earth's ionosphere. The proposed research will substantially advance
knowledge in the collective behavior of dusty plasmas. ***
