Sperm maturation and glycosidic enzymes. The capacity of sperm to effectively
fertilize an overm is acquired during passage through the epididymis. Dr. Hall
has developed a hypothesis that sperm are "activated" by modification of surface
membrane, specifically, modification of carbohydrate molecules on the cell
surface. He proposes that the epididymis secretes enzymes that alter surface
carbohydrates. He plans to study these enzymes and their secretion in detail. It
is conceivable that this basic research could lead to development of effective
male contraceptives.//
