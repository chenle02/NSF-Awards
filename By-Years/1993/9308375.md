93083375 Sarnelle This research focuses on the strong interactions between
Daphnia and algae in eutrophic lakes. The general objectives to quantify the
relationship between the death rate of Daphnia and total algal biomass to
examine the role of initial conditions as a determinant of planktonic community
structure and to quantify adaptive tradeoffs faced by algal species to
constraints imposed by herbivory. This research examines whether multiple
equilibria exist in the community structure of eutrophic lakes, due to a
reciprocal negative interaction between Daphnia and filamentous bluegreens. In
addition the work will identify some of the mechanisms underlying the above
interactions, by examing adaptive tradeoffs faced by algal species. %%% The
presence of multiple equilibria has been predicated by ecological theory but
rarely demostrated experimentally. This is crucial to development of ecology as
a predictive science since the need to specify initial conditions may severely
contrain the ability to predict ecolgical phenomena. The role of food webs in
ameliorating negative effects of extroplication on water quality is also
important to indentifying management targets for reducing excessive algal growth
in nutrient enriched lakes via changes in the fish community.
