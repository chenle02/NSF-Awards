This project will address issues concerning fundamental statistical inference
for diagnostic classification models. It aims at both theoretical development
and applications to educational study, psychiatry, and other disciplines using
classification models. The project will concentrate on several aspects that are
challenging in the analysis of multivariate latent variable models. In
particular, the research will focus on the statistical inference of the item-
attribute relationship, which in the current context is formulated as the so-
called Q-matrix. Topics for research will include point estimation of the
Q-matrix, hypothesis testing, dimension reduction, model diagnosis, and
classifying Q-matrices, including tasks such as constructing appropriate
equivalence classes that are estimable based on the
data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is motivated mainly by
applications in educational assessment and psychiatric evaluations and has the
potential to positively impact these two areas of study. In educational
applications, this research will help to obtain a data-driven estimate of the
skill requirements for each exam problem and also validate the subjective belief
of such skill requirements based on the data. In psychiatric assessments, this
study will help to improve diagnosis accuracy by learning the symptom-disorder
relationship objectively via the data.
