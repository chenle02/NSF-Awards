This project aims at improving our ability to understand, predict and control
macroeconomic developments at the national and international level. Long term
trend movements in the economy, at time scales exceeding the span of data we
have available, raise special problems for inference that are just beginning to
be addressed by econometricians. This project will develop ideas for approaching
these problems in a Bayesian framework -- making explicit the separate
contributions of the data and of information from other sources (prior beliefs)
to knowledge of long term dynamic behavior. A special emphasis will be on
extending the recent results in this area for univariate models to more
practically relevant multivariate models. There is disagreement among
macroeconomists on the importance of monetary policy and other forms of
aggregate nominal demand management in generating or offsetting business cycles.
Increasing our understanding in this area is important not only for improving
demand management policy, but also in guiding the restructuring our banking
system is undergoing. The international facts about relations among the main
macroeconomics aggregates are only beginning to be documented and understood.
Patterns of responses to innovations (surprise changes) in monetary variables
appear in preliminary work surprisingly robust across countries, time periods,
and lists of variables included in the system. This research will document these
regularities. These regularities present difficulties for simple standard
theories. For example, Keynesian or monetarist theories view monetary policy as
a major independent influence on the business cycle. Real business cycle
theories treat it as passive and unimportant because of the smooth dynamic
functioning of product and asset markets. This research will explore possible
interpretations of the regularities, using several kinds of new and recently
developed modeling strategies.
