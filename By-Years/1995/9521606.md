This research project, in the area of on-line algorithms, focuses on
deterministic and randomized algorithms for the k-server problem and some
natural generalizations of it. Many important questions related to these
problems are examined. Their resolution will impact the area of on-line
algorithms, and will help to bridge the gap between the theory of competitive
analysis and its numerous applications in robotics, data and memory management
and programming languages. Additional areas of investigation include complexity
theory, the theory of circuits, approximation algorithms, and novel search
strategies.
