The focus of this proposal is one of the central problems in number theory:
relate special values of L-functions to the orders of associated algebraic
quantities, especially Selmer groups. This is a problem whose origins lie in the
celebrated class number formula from algebraic number theory and which includes
the conjecture of Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer about the L-function of an elliptic
curve. The research described in this proposal aims to prove such relations for
various L-functions arising from automorphic forms. The theory of automorphic
forms provides a rich source of L-functions (conjecturally all) and - through
its connections with algebraic varieties attached to quotients of symmetric
spaces - it is also closely connected to the objects of interest to algebraic
number theorists (esp. Galois representations). The investigator aims to further
develop and exploit the p-adic properties of these connections to relate
L-values and Selmer groups.

The research described in this proposal aims to establish relations between
certain analytic and algebraic objects. The analytic objects are L-functions- a
special class of analytic functions built from number-theoretic data (this class
includes the celebrated Riemann zeta function which is built from the prime
numbers). For at least a century and a half L-functions have been central to
efforts to tackle the most central problems in number theory (e.g.,
understanding the distribution of prime numbers). An important feature of
L-functions is that their values at certain special points - these values are
often called `special values' - are expected to be the orders of algebraic
quantities associated to the data defining the L-function. The investigator aims
to prove the existence of such relations for various classes of L-functions,
drawing especially on the theory of automorphic forms. Automorphic forms are
closely connected to both analysis (they are a rich source of L-functions,
conjecturally all) and algebra. The investigator aims to prove such relations by
systematically understanding the divisibility properties of the objects of
interest (special values, automorphic forms, and Selmer groups) by powers of
primes numbers.
