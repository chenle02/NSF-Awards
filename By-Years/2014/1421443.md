This research brings about a new methodology for developing compilers, where the
data structure and algorithm implementations of software applications are
independently normalized and categorized into commonly occurring patterns,
compiler optimizations are made customizable components that can be flexibly
composed, and all optimizations are closely coordinated and collectively
specialized to attain a highest level of performance. The pattern-based
specialization specifically targets a number of domains, e.g., dense/sparse
matrix codes, stencil computations, and graph/machine learning algorithms, which
are critical to scientific computing. A uniform annotation interface is provided
for developers to concisely document the higher-level semantics of abstractions
provided by varying domain-specific and parallel programming libraries, thereby
allowing the development of specially customized library-aware compilers that
can automatically coordinate the uses of library abstractions to maximize the
overall performance of large scale multiprocessor applications. Automated
optimization tuning support is provided to support the performance portability
of applications on modern heterogeneous computing
platforms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deliverables of this research include a
collection of specialized compiler optimizers, distributed open source online,
with associated auto-tuning toolkits to target them for varying modern multi-
core and GPU platforms, and with a graphical user interface for users to
interactively invoke these optimizers. These optimizers, together with their
interactive configuration interfaces, are expected to fundamentally change how
high performance computing applications are developed, while providing
computational specialists a toolset to automatically generate optimized library
kernels without manually composing assembly codes.
