The proposed research consists of accelerator based experimental programs at
three laboratories -Brookhaven National Laboratory, Thomas Jefferson National
Accelerator Facility, and the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility. The
experiments at all three facilities use photonuclear reactions to investigate
the production of mesons and nucleon resonances, as well as fundamental
properties of the neutron and proton. A dominant component of each program is
the scattering of polarized photons from polarized nucleons. The experiments
address fundamental questions in nuclear and particle physics.
