The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project will allow highly cost effective, 2-way
communications to be delivered to machinery and ?Things? over extremely long
distances using underutilized frequencies and new hardware and software
techniques. The resulting technologies will provide 2-way connectivity where
cellular does not exist and where other techniques (satellite) are too
expensive. This will result in near universal availability of the Internet-of-
Things at costs superior to legacy approaches and which are appropriate for
applications typically seen in Internet-of-Things.

The proposed project will create a new system of hardware, software, frequency
and operating techniques which will allow underutilized spectrum to be used to
deliver 2-way communications to very remote machines and things. The work will
involve the creation of a small hardware platform, the creation of embedded
software and the modification of existing software and the creation of
techniques for detecting and avoiding current users of spectrum, Devices will be
created and field deployed to assess efficacy. A number of test routines and
procedures will be run during the work to assess how well the technology will
work, what performance can be expected, how well operations will fit into
existing Regulatory frameworks, what sort of capacity can be expected and what
the overall economics of the system will be. We expect to build a significant
patent position as we pursue the project.
