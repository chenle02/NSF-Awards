The International Research Network Connections Network Operations Center (IRNC
NOC) serves as a cooperative point of contact and communications for IRNC
network management, providing consolidated network monitoring, reporting, and
operational visibility for the IRNC program. The IRNC NOC facilitates a single
set of operational expectations for all IRNC funded infrastructure programs;
this enables greater availability of IRNC infrastructure and improves results in
troubleshooting multi-domain network issues. A central data repository created
by the IRNC NOC provides critical operational information; monitoring data and
performance metrics in support of NSF funded science and
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The IRNC NOC end-to-end Performance Engagement
Team (E2E PET) provides centrally guided and well-coordinated end-to-end
performance incident management. The E2E PET coordinates activities with the
IRNC Exchange Point and Backbone programs as well as international partners,
enabling efficient and timely troubleshooting of end to end performance issues
spanning the continents. The IRNC NOC works together with these programs to
create a common framework for handling end-to-end performance problems. An IRNC
NOC Advisory Council with representation from each of the awarded backbone,
exchange point, and measurement projects guides interaction to ensure consistent
operational practices across the IRNC programs.
