There has been much interest in the development of parallel inference computing
machines for higher performance computation. The implementation of parallel
Prolog is an important and timely research topic. This investigation proposes to
simulate parallel Prolog on networks of processors such as CM and ZAPP. In
addition, the system will be implemented on an MIMD (Multiple Instruction Stream
and Multiple Data Stream) multiprocessor. A working implementation of parallel
Prolog could provide useful experience in developing parallel Prolog programming
techniques, determining appropriate application areas, and finding deficiencies
in the current execution model.
