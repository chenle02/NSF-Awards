A small astronomical observatory built around a commercially available telescope
and photometer is being used by undergraduate students. The observatory is
located on campus to provide maximum access for students. It is intended for use
in elementary courses and to support senior and honors thesis projects. Projects
deal largely with photometry, particularly of variable stars. The University of
Puget Sound currently offers three courses in astronomy, and sends some students
to graduate programs in astronomy and astrophysics.
