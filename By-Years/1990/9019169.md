This award provides 40% funding for the acquisition of a computer system to be
installed in the Institute of Tectonics at the University of California, Santa
Cruz. The University is committed to providing the remaining funds needed. The
computer system will be used primarily by the reflection seismology group at the
Institute of Tectonics. Examples of applications in the research projects of the
group include the development and implementation of enhanced seismic imaging
algorithms, the processing and interpretation of regional and continental scale
data produced by portable seismograph array field experiments, and the mapping
of lithosphere structures.
