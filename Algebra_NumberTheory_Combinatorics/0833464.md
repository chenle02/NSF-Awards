This research program consists of three lines of investigation, each connected
to multivariate analogues of generalized hypergeometric functions. The first
concerns a family of biorthogonal abelian functions associated to elliptic
curves that generalize multivariate orthogonal polynomials due to Macdonald and
Koornwinder. The second aspect involves certain multivariate analogues of
quadratic transformations of hypergeometric functions, which generalize
identities from the theory of symmetric spaces; related to this is the study of
natural deformations of permutation actions of Coxeter groups to representations
of the associated Hecke algebras, some of which have led to proofs of
multivariate quadratic transformations. Finally, the investigator will be
studying multivariate elliptic hypergeometric (contour) integrals, with a view
to understanding the functional equations satisfied by such integrals.

Historically, the study of "special functions" originated in the fact that quite
a few functions of interest in applications turned out to be members of a single
family, the hypergeometric functions. The new family of functions the
investigator is studying is a significant generalization of this family,
combining several existing generalizations (each with their own applications and
connections to other areas of mathematics) under one roof. In addition to the
potential that new applications may arise, this investigation should also lead
to a greater understanding of the existing families.
