HRD 03-26177 Dr. Chellu Chetty, a professor of biology, has a strong record of
service in working with students at the undergraduate and graduate level,
particularly the "high ability minority" students (generally African-American).
He has developed strategies that involve and challenge students in their
academic and career development pursuits. He has been an active mentor for a
number of years and has invested much time and energy to working with
underrepresented communities. Among his many approaches to mentoring and
advising students is his direct involvement of undergraduate students in co-
authoring more than 15 professional papers. He has worked with HBCU's and has
been very effective in obtaining grants from both government and non-government
funding sources. Dr. Chetty plans to utilize the PAESMEM grant, if awarded, to
support the establishment of a mentoring and advising office for the College of
Sciences and Technology.
