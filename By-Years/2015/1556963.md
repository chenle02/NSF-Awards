Evolutionary biologists seek to understand why there is such tremendous
diversity in life forms and how these diverse forms developed over time. One
approach to addressing these questions is to study and compare the genetic
makeup of closely related species. Some of life's most striking examples of
diversity have evolved in a process known as adaptive radiation, when a wide
variety of closely related species arise from a common ancestor during a
relatively brief period of time. Adaptive radiations of cichlid fishes in
certain African lakes provide captivating examples of this process, where these
fishes exhibit incredible diversity in color, shape, and reproductive and
feeding behaviors. Recently developed technologies make it easier to obtain
large amounts of genetic data from wild organisms, so that it is now possible to
document thousands of times more of the genetic makeup of these species than
ever before. This project will use such genomic data to study the history of
species that have formed in two African cichlid fish adaptive radiations, thus
improving our understanding of how and why species have evolved, and yielding
greater insight into the origins of biodiversity. In addition to its scientific
goals, this work will strengthen relationships with international partners in
Tanzania and the Democratic Republic of Congo through a collaborative workshop
on the use of genetic data in understanding and monitoring biodiversity. It will
also involve the development of educational materials for teaching about
evolution and biodiversity in middle school classrooms.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adaptive radiations are exemplary systems for studying
evolutionary processes due to the diversity of forms that evolve on rapid
timescales. However, the rapid nature of these diversification events means that
reconstructing the history of species divergence can be intensely challenging.
The recent attainability of genome-wide sequence data for non-model organisms
has precipitated a fundamental shift in the data that can be used to address
questions related to the history of rapidly diversifying species. Such genomic
datasets present new opportunities for uniting population genetics approaches
with phylogenetic approaches to understand the history of species and speciation
in adaptive radiation. This research will expand knowledge of how genomic data
can aid in reconstructing the history of rapid adaptive radiations by studying
two model cichlid adaptive radiations, Lake Kivu's haplochromine cichlids and
Lake Tanganyika's tropheine cichlids. It will use newly available genomic
resources to investigate the evolutionary history of these groups and the
evolutionary processes influencing patterns of genetic diversity.
