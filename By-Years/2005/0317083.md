&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this research involves the development of in situ
enzymatic screening for the rapid evaluation of organic catalysts. The project
will strive to better establish the breadth of the technique with respect to
both byproduct and product, it will determine the possibility for much higher
throughput assays, and it will investigate the possibility of obtaining real
time information about catalyst enantioselectivity, as well as relative rate.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry
Program is supporting the research of Dr. David B. Berkowitz in the Department
of Chemistry at the University Nebraska-Lincoln. Professor Berkowitz will focus
on developing a new application of enzymes in the synthetic laboratory; namely
as sensitive, real time, chiral sensors. There is potential for broader impact
of the work in both academia and industry where information rich, rapid catalyst
screens are in demand. Also, the project presents an excellent arena for the
interdisciplinary training of graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;
