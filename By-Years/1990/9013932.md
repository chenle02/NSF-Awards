This Research Opportunity Award (ROW) supports a collaborative effort between
Dr. Marilyn Livingston, Professor of Computer Science at Southern Illinois
University at Edwardsville and Dr. Nora Sabelli, Senior Research Scientist, at
the National Center fort Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at Urbana. The
collaboration is aimed at increasing the participation of women in science and
expanding the computer and computational science components in women's science
programs. One particular goal is the participation of women undergraduate
students in a software research development and evaluation project. These
undergraduate students will also act as mentors to pre-college women students.
