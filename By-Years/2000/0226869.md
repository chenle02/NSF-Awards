The investigator and his collaborators will investigate certain "arithmetic
fundamental groups," that is to say the Galois group of a global field (finite
extension of the rational numbers or the function field of a curve over a finite
field) with a specified (finite) set of branch points. They will study, in
particular, extensions in which the filtration of the Galois group by higher
ramification groups has fixed bounded length, especially in connection with a
conjecture of Fontaine and Mazur. The proposed activity includes a computational
component which seeks to construct infinite fundamental groups with extremal
properties. Such explicit constructions give a good qualitative understanding of
the asymptotic behavior of discriminant with respect to the degree (number
fields) and genus with respect to the number of points (curves over finite
fields). The latter has applications to the efficiency of certain codes made
from number fields and function fields.

This is a proposal in number theory, the oldest branch of mathematics where the
fundamental question is that of solving polynomial equations. Knowledge
regarding solutions of polynomial equations is of fundamental importance in
cryptology and coding theory, the science of secure and efficient transmission
of data. Solutions of polynomial equations in one unkown are equipped with a
kind of algebraic symmetry and the study of these symmetries is called "Galois
theory." These symmetries are encoded in a mathematical object called the
Absolute Galois Group, which contains such a wealth of information about
equations in not just one but any number of variables that it is sometimes known
as the "Holy Grail of Number Theory." This proposal is a theoretical and
computational investigation of certain aspects of the Absolute Galois Group.
