Abstract - Alabama Cryogenic Engineering, Inc., 9362074 Partial oxidation
reactions are very important routes to chemical synthesis. A large fraction of
all catalytic processes are oxidation reactions, and there is a need to reduce
waste byproducts and to improve yield in the synthesis of a wide variety of
specialty chemicals. Oxidation reactions are very difficult and dangerous to
manage. Their exothermicity, speed, flammability and explosive potentials
mandate extreme care in the design of reactors. Consequently, current reactors
for oxidation are designed very conservatively and far from yield optima. Recent
research has led to the development of new ceramic monoliths (solid metal plates
perforated with small, uniform holes) for use in partial oxidation processes to
catalyze very fast, high selectivity synthesis reactions such as the direct
production of syngas from methane, olefins from higher alkanes, and formaldehyde
from methanol. This SBIR Phase I research project will test such metal monoliths
as a new catalyst for carrying out these reactions. Metal monoliths have high
thermal conductivity, so that the heat of reaction can be removed and the
reaction temperature regulated. This will allow higher selectivities and greater
yields than are possible with currently available ceramic monolith catalysts. A
new fabrication technique will be used that allows thin layers of noble metals
to be incorporated into the holes of the monolith so that the reaction rate can
be further enhanced. Monoliths can be fabricated with hole diameters less than
one micron and porosity's as high as 65%. The monoliths can be mounted in large
arrays and thus be scaled up for commercial chemical production.
