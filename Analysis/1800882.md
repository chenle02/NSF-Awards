The study of operator algebras was begun by John von Neumann in the late 1920s
with the aim of understanding quantum mechanics. Currently, there are two active
areas of investigation of operator algebras---von Neumann algebras and
C*-algebras. The project involves investigations into the classification of
C*-algebras. Here a classification of a collection of complicated objects
provides a simpler way to identify and distinguish between objects in the more
complicated class. The classification theory for von Neumann algebras is
relatively well developed. The classification was obtained by Connes (and
others) in the 1970s. While on the C*-algebra side, it was only in the 1990s
that one began to see rapid developments in classification theory. Since then,
the classification of C*-algebras has blossomed into one of the central areas in
the study of C*-algebras, and tremendous progress has been made in the last few
years. The research in this project is to push the classification theory even
further, and to seek more applications or interactions of the classification
theory with other areas of mathematics, in particular with the study of
dynamical systems.

Compared to the classification of unital C*-algebras, the classification of non-
unital C*-algebras is far from complete. The principal investigator plans to use
the strategy and techniques from the classification of unital simple C*-algebras
to push forward the classification program for non-unital simple C*-algebras. In
particular, this involves showing that an abstract non-unital C*-algebra can be
tracially approximated by certain concrete type I C*-algebras (the reduction
theorem), developing a classification theory for this semi-concrete class of
C*-algebras, and then studying how these might be put to work together to obtain
a full classification for abstract non-unital C*-algebras. The other purpose of
the proposed research program is to continue the investigation on the interplay
between the classification program and study of dynamical systems. In
particular, the principal investigator would like to continue the study on
whether the zero mean topological dimension of the dynamical system (for an
action of the group of integers, or of a more general amenable group) would be
equivalent to the regularity property of the crossed product C*-algebras. The
principal investigator also would like to investigate possible impacts of the
recent classification results on the study of the underlying dynamical systems.
