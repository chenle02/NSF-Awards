Keener 9626334 The investigator develops and uses mathematical models and tools
to study the electrical activation of cardiac tissue. The two main
interconnected emphases for this project are to develop useful numerical
algorithms to solve model equations on physiologically realistic domains, and to
use analytical and numerical tools to study the dynamics of normal and reentrant
waves, their initiation, subsequent dynamics, and termination. Particular
emphasis is placed on the development of fast, accurate, implicit numerical
methods for integrating nonlinear partial differential equations on irregular
three-dimensional domains. The overall purpose of this research is to increase
the fundamental understanding of life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias, their
mechanisms and possible control. To do so, however, requires a substantial
effort to develop and improve the numerical algorithms for the efficient use of
high performance computing.
