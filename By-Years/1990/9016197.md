Funds are requested for the purchase of a SLM Aminco DW-2000 dual wavelength
dual beam scanning spectrophotometer. This instrument will be housed in the
Biochemistry Department as part of the Biopolymer Service Center where it would
be accessible to all researchers on campus. Major users of this equipment will
be: 1) Steven W. Meinhardt, Department of Biochemistry: Characterization of the
NADH dehydrogenase complexes of Rhodobacter capsulatus and the electron
transport chain of the archaebacterium Thermoplasma acidophilum. 2) Thomas
Class, Department of Microbiology and Animal Science: Function of steroid
metabolism in anaerobic gut bacteria. 3) Marek W. Urban, Department of Polymers
and Coatings: Surface reactions of silicon phthalocyanines with conjugated
polymers. 4) Greg Gillispie, Department of Chemistry: Spectroscopy of aromatice
in low temperature Shpol'shkii matrices, II Adsorption of aromatice molecules
and pesticides on soil particles. 5) Marvin W. Fawley, Department of Botany:
Isolation and Characterization of photosynthetic pigment-protein complexes from
algae. Studies of the organization of the photosynthetic apparatuses of algae.
6) Murry E. Duysen, Department of Botany: Regulation of the biogenesis of light-
harvesting chlorophy11-protein complexes. 7) D.K. Srivastava, Department of
Biochemistry: Characterization of the control of enzyme function by
enzyme:enzyme interactions.
