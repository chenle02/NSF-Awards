Many species of marine organisms are characterized by high variation in the
size of individuals, especially during the early life history. The objectives of
the proposed research are to: 1) quantify this variability in natural
populations, 2) determine whether variability is transmitted through time, 3)
assess if there are demographic consequences of size and growth variation, and
4) quantify the effects of size and growth variation on population models. The
approach to the problem will be pluralistic, including observations of
individuals in the field, experimental manipulation of tractable populations,
and population modeling where individual traits are included. Observational and
experimental data will be gathered from several species that differ in their
taxonomy and life history, including an alga, a limpet and a nearshore fish.
Experiments will determine if variation alone can affect future population
trajectories by manipulating the quantity and type of variability in a
population. Throughout the study, information will be gathered at the level of
the individual by following the fate of marked individuals. In both observations
and experiments, the key biological features that will be quantified include
individual growth, whether growth rates are correlated through time,
survivorship, and the propensity for all these traits to vary among individuals.
The analyses will contrast the outcome of models which include variability among
individuals (individual based models) versus those that use a mean value for
organism attributes (matrix population models). The importance of this work
draws from a recognition that understanding why recruitment varies in marine
organisms may require the inclusion of individual attributes.
