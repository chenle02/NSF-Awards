This grant provides travel support for selected students attending the annual
Symposium on Combinatorial Search (SoCS). Student participation in SoCS
encourages young investigators in their research in combinatorial search. This
symposium carries on a tradition of bringing together researchers and students
around issues of pattern-database heuristics, inconsistent heuristics, real-time
search, path-finding for physical robots and computer-game agents, parallel
search, and search using external memory. These search techniques have a
significant place in broader AI application in areas such as robotics, computer
games, planning, and bioinformatics. In addition, SoCS 13 includes a special
focus on graph search engineering.
