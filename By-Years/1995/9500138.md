9500138 KING This proposal addresses a longstanding problem in industry-
university research collaborations, namely, establishing the value to industry
of the partnerships. The proposer seeks to use asset valuation methodology, a
financial management technique, to derive the value of intangible results of
industry-university research collaboration, e.g., intellectual property and
hiring of new degree recipients whose university training included involvement
in the collaboration. The proposed work entails conducting preliminary work on
the untested and novel idea of using financial valuation techniques to establish
the value to individual firms of outputs from industry-university research
collaboration. The PI proposes to try the technique with one Engineering
Research Center. ***
