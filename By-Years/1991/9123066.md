Although many researchers propose that the balance between costs of plant
defenses and the cost of herbivory have influenced both the types of defenses a
plant employs and the distribution of those defenses among plant structure, no
study to date has fully evaluated these costs in a quantitative fashion nor has
anyone determined how these costs are affected by the plant's access to light
and other resources. To address this question, the relationship between costs of
extrafloral nectar production in two closely related Passiflora species that
differ in the range of light conditions in which they grow will be studied. The
proposed project provides several advantages over previous approaches to the
study of costs and benefits of defense. Extrafloral nectar, unlike many toxic
chemical defenses, has a simple chemical composition and can be measured in a
non-destructive fashion. Further, protection associated with extrafloral nectar
production can be evaluated by comparing untreated plants to plants from which
ants have been excluded. Finally, by using population projection matrices to
model plant growth, the costs of defense and herbivory can be expressed in terms
of a fitness component. Thus, extrafloral nectar-based ant defense may represent
an ideal system for the study of costs and benefits of leaf defense.
