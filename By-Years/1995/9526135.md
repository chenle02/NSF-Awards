9526135 ATCHLEY The first Gordon Research Conference (GRC) in Molecular
Evolution will be held in Ventura, California on January 28 - February 2, 1996.
Gordon Conferences have occurred for over 60 years and are important vehicles
for fostering education and science among researchers with common interests in
the fields of biological, chemical and physical sciences. The specific aim of
the conference on Molecular Evolution is to stimulate discussion and
interactions among a broad spectrum of scientists interested in evolution at the
molecular level. The study of molecular evolution is fundamental to the life
sciences and integrates research from molecular biology, genetics, developmental
biology, cell biology, ecology, biochemistry, virology, biophysics,
paleontology, biogeography, statistics, mathematics, computer science and
medicine. Twenty-nine invited speakers from North America, Europe and Japan will
speak on topics as diverse as the origin and evolution of the AIDS virus, the
mammalian Y chromosome, the evolution of gene networks, and mathematical models
of change at the molecular level. Gordon Conferences are noted for their
capability to determine the direction of research in a given discipline for the
next 5 to 10 years.
