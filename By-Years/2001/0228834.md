"Spreading Kinetics of Constrained Thin Films"

The rate at which a liquid spreads over a solid surface is called the wetting
kinetics, which deals with the rates at which a liquid moves over a solid
surface and displaces a second fluid. Since the liquid film thickness gradually
decreases to zero as the contact line, the line common to the solid-liquid-vapor
phases, is approached, the special properties of thin liquid films play an
important role. Of importance here is the disjoining pressure, which is related
to the excess potential in thin films (less than 100 nanometers), and can be
used as a body force to describe the hydrodynamics and equilibrium. This
analytical research is for a liquid that has both attraction and repulsion for
the solid substrate in its disjoining pressure, which is common but has not been
analyzed. Although the thin film phenomenon determines that the liquid is non-
wetting, the dynamics of spreading itself seems unaffected in the experiments by
the disjoining pressure until the time when the moving liquid suddenly
equilibrates. A quantitative description of how such a behavior arises will be
made clear from the results of this research. The fluid mechanical equations for
the profile of the moving liquid film will be solved numerically. The numerical
method is made very difficult by the need to look at two very different length
scales, the scale of the basic liquid mass and the thin film dimensions, and
over very long times. Additionally, the effect of liquid evaporation and surface
roughness will be considered, since they bring in great deal of reality to the
analysis.
