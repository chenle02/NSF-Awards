This project continues work on the relationship between academic research and
its payoff in industrial innovation utilizing a unique data base from previous
research. Having estimated the high public return rates in seven industries from
the total investment in academic research, this project will gather data and
information on: (1) the sources of financial support for academic research that
has contributed significantly to industrial innovation; (2) the role of
geographic proximity of the academic researchers and industrial users; (3) the
relationship of high payoff academic research to departmental quality ratings;
(4) the time frame of social benefits and costs from industrial innovation based
on academic research; and (5) begin preliminary work on the economic effects of
the industry cooperative research centers.
