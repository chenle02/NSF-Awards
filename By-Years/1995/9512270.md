9512270 Nicol The proposed project is to acquire a parallel graphics computer, a
Silicon Graphics Onyx symmetric multiprocessor, that will support a wide variety
of computational science research activities. This computer will provide a focal
point for the initiation of new inter-disciplinary research in computational
fluid dynamics, flow visualization, materials science, geophysics, and parallel
algorithms for the simulation and analysis of complex discrete systems in
addition to supporting existing research. This computational science environment
will have the following joint attributes: (1) a parallel architecture of basic
research interest to computer scientists, and (2) memory, computational power
and sophisticated high-speed graphics capabilities sufficient to support the
contemporary computational and data visualization requirements of physical
scientists. ***
