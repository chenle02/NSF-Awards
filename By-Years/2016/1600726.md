This research project is in the field of harmonic analysis, a mathematical area
that grew from the fact that many functions defined over an interval can be
decomposed as sums of the simple sine and cosine functions. The principal
investigator plans to study cases where such a decomposition is not possible, or
is not efficient enough, for example because the functions in question are no
longer defined over intervals. The question is whether similar decompositions
are possible in such cases, with the sines and cosines replaced by other
functions of a simple structure. The goal is to use functions that mimic the
structure of the sines and cosines, in one way or another, as good replacements
for the trigonometric functions, which provide an excellent tool for studying
properties of functions and the interrelationships between them. In particular,
this project includes the development of efficient ways to sample, interpolate,
and approximate signals.

The principal investigator and collaborators have recently shown that any finite
union of intervals admits a Riesz basis of exponentials. While a big advance in
the area, there remain many aspects of the question that the principal
investigator will study, such as clarifying whether this is a generic property
of all sets of finite measure and understanding whether the result holds for
Riesz bases with "good bounds." Further, she plans to study the benefits of
using even weaker notions (e.g., frames, Riesz sequences) for the same purposes.
Of particular interest is the relation between the study of such systems and the
development of techniques to analyze sampling and interpolating sequences.
Finally, the project will explore applications to Gabor systems in time-
frequency analysis, for instance, possible extensions of the Balian-Low theorem
and linear independence of Gabor elements.
