Abstract: Random curves constructed on a lattice will be considered from the
perspective of the (continuum) scaling limit where the lattice spacing is taken
to zero. The first problem is to characterize scaling limits of rather general
systems of random curves. One aspect of the problem is to determine the
regularity and dimension of a given (not necessarily random) curve without
actually parametrizing it. Moreover, a sequence of scaling exponents which are
relevant for regularity and tightness will be studied. The second problem is
concerned specifically with random spanning trees in two dimensions. Precise
conjectures exist regarding the values of the exponents in a number of examples.
The object is to confirm or contradict those predictions, especially for the
first three non-trivial exponents. A related question is whether the scaling
limits of two standard examples, called the Minimal (Random) Spanning Tree, and
the Uniformly Random Spanning Tree, differ or coincide in the limit. Moreover,
existing methods should be extended to cover a class of tree processes on random
graphs which has natural conformal invariance properties. Work on these
questions will be part of a continuing collaboration. The third problem is to
try to establish any non-trivial bound on the dimension of self-avoiding random
walks, adapting techniques that were successful for random spanning trees and
loop-erased walks. Finally, the investigator will participate in a collaborative
effort aimed at understanding the connecting curves in high-dimensional critical
percolation.

Random curves provide some of the most natural examples of fractal sets. They
appear in random spanning trees (where every pair of points is connected by a
unique curve), in critical percolation clusters (where two points are in the
same cluster, if they are joined by a path along occupied bonds), as random
walks, and as interfaces between random subsets of the plane (such as the
Frontier of Brownian Motion, or level sets of random functions). These systems
of random curves are typically constructed on a fine lattice within some box of
finite size. Simulations suggest that in many models of interest, a meaningful
continuum limit emerges as the lattice spacing is taken to zero. It is widely
believed that these limits have remarkable symmetry properties, and that they
should admit simple descriptions. However, there are only partial results
guaranteeing that such limits even exist, and many questions about their
properties remain open.
