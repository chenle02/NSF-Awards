9354730 Zheng A recent survey conducted by the author indicated the need for a
data communications and networks text covering fundamental theory and new
technologies along with software project topics in a multiplatform distributed
environment for computer science and software engineering students in
undergraduate level. Traditional textbooks do not take advantage of recent
development in multimedia and hypertext technologies. Through the use of these
technologies students are able to interact with computers in the pursuit of
knowledge at their own rate, following their own particular interests within the
field. Various media, digitized still and motion images, and sounds, provide a
more complete and lasting access to the subject matter. The techniques of
hypertext and multimedia are just beginning to be realized in education. This
project develops a text in this format as a prototype for texts. This project
also develops a cost-effective network laboratory prototype, to provide software
and supplementary teaching materials including a question set and project topics
with sample solutions in a multiplatform environment. The goal of the curriculum
is to engage students actively in the learning process and, through the projects
developed, to promote critical thinking, problem solving skills, and creativity.
