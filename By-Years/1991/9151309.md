Quantitative analysis of economic data has become a central component of both
public and private sector decision making. This project establishes a Computer
Laboratory for Quantitative Economic Analysis in order to provide students with
hands-on data analysis opportunities in six undergraduate quantitative economics
courses. Housed within the Department's Economics Resource Center (a faculty
supervised learning center staffed by students) the Laboratory will promote
creative explorations in applied economic analysis, eschewing the traditional
drills and rote exercises. By encouraging original student research projects,
the Laboratory will enrich student understanding of economic modeling and
estimation techniques. Exploiting the capabilities of personal computers and
powerful statistical and mathematical software, students will gain proficiency
in applying analytical tools to a wide range of complex micro and macro-economic
issues. The overlapping use of hardware, software and data bases across the
introductory and advanced quantitative economics classes will offer students a
progressive learning environment in which to gain ever more sophisticated
analytical skills. Data collection and management skills will likewise be
nurtured in the learning process.The award will be matched by an equal sum from
the grantee.
