The principal investigator intends to try to solve the following problems:
Problem 1: Prove (or disprove) that the Diophantine theory of the rational
numbers is undecidable. Problem 2: Prove (or disprove) that the Diophantine
theory of the field of rational functions, in a letter t with coefficients in
the field of complex numbers, is undecidable in the language of rings with
constant symbols 0, 1 and t. Problem 3: Consider a machine M which can add or
multiply integers. Let f(x) be a polynomial with integer coefficients,
X=(X1,...,Xk). Let n(f) be the least number of multiplications required for the
evaluation of f at an arbitrary integer input X by M. Prove (or disprove) that
the function which associates n(f) to an arbitrary polynomial f is recursive; in
other words determine whether one can effectively find the necessary number of
multiplications for the evaluation of a given polynomial. These problems,
particularly the last, are of interest to computer scientists as well as
mathematical logicians. In some sense the existence of this project is a
demonstration that recursion theory has returned to its roots and is capable of
addressing practical problems.
