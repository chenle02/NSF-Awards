This is a doctoral dissertation proposal to study the abolition of slavery in
Suriname, a former Dutch colony in South America and a Caribbean society. The
research will focus on changes in the composition and structure of the elite
during the 19th century. Archival data will be analyzed and the measurement of
structure at several points in time will introduce a dynamic perspective in the
study of the interplay of state formation, ethnicity, and the emergence of elite
in post-emancipation Suriname. The study will make contributions to the
understanding of state formation, and the formation of elites, and it will
increase knowledge about Caribbean societies.
