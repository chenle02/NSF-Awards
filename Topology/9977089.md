9977089 Goerss Throughout different fields of mathematics, it is important to
understand how various objects acquire some sort of multiplication. For example,
in homotopy theory, which is the study of mathematical phenomena that remain
invariant under continuous deformation, one wants to decide if an object has a
multiplication that is commutative up to all ``higher homotopies'' -- this is
the type of multiplication that is invariant under deformation. One way to
discuss this issue is with the device of opera, which make rigorous the phrase
``higher homotopies.'' Goerss intends to develop and explore these ideas in the
context of homotopy theory; for example, he would like to discuss when a
spectrum has an operad multiplication, and to discuss the implications of the
fact that the cochains on a topological space have such multiplications. The
broad goal of this project is to further understanding of homotopy theory, the
branch of topology concerned with properties of higher-dimensional surfaces and
other geometric objects that remain invariant under continuous deformation.
There are some surprising and rather mysterious connections between homotopy
theory and seemingly unrelated fields of mathematics such as number theory and
algebraic geometry, and one hopes the project will ultimately illuminate these.
