The research objective of this grant is to lay the foundations of a geometric
theory of discrete elasticity using techniques from differential geometry,
algebraic topology, and discrete exterior calculus. This mathematical framework
will be critical in building new numerical methods that are free of spurious
numerical artifacts, e.g. numerical dissipation and volume locking, while
mirroring the corresponding continuum models, e.g. they conserve energy and
linear and angular momenta. The results of this project have the potential to
transformatively change the way discretization is understood and implemented in
computational mechanics. In particular, we formulate incompressible elasticity
without using Lagrange multipliers; we extremize the elasticity action over the
manifold of volume-preserving motions. We introduce a nonlinear elasticity
complex that can be used in a rigorous convergence analysis of discrete
incompressible nonlinear elasticity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the
proposed research activities will lead to a geometric discrete elasticity theory
that will unify all the existing numerical methods, and will make it possible to
build new and more robust numerical schemes that mirror the corresponding
continuum models in the form of their governing equations, conservation laws,
and internal constraints. This interdisciplinary project will fundamentally
impact computational mechanics by demonstrating the importance of geometric
techniques and the new insights gained in choosing the correct discrete spaces
for different discrete fields.
