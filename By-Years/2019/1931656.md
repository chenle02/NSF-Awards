The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to enable
airborne chemical sensors that are smaller, lighter, and lower cost than
existing technology. The devices developed here enable low-power chemical
sensing on ultralight drones, in wearable technology, and in small spaces where
current technology would not fit or would be prohibitively expensive. The global
chemical sensors market, including defense (chemical weapons, explosives),
domestic security/first responders (opioids, bomb detection, breath sensors) and
industrial hygiene (toxic industrial chemicals) sectors, produces more than $5B
in annual revenue, with toxic gas sensors representing $1.5B. This project looks
serve markets in the defense, domestic security, and first response sectors due
to the size and weight advantages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project
further develops an alternating current impedance technology to detect
dielectric changes in custom designed sensor materials. Tuning the probe
frequency to target specific chemical interactions allows our sensor to be more
selective: For instance, probe frequencies can be chosen to avoid environmental
interference, such as water vapor which typically manifests only low-frequency
(&lt;100Hz) impedance changes. The method allows greater selectivity with fewer
probe elements, allowing simpler devices that can be made smaller, and at lower
cost, compared to devices of similar performance. The project incorporates
frequency selection into a device that uses an interdigitated capacitor with
overlaid thin film of colorimetric material. A microcontroller controls input,
feedback, and an impedance analyzer for continuous measurements at targeted
frequencies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
