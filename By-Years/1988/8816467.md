High power radar (radio waves) interaction with the ionosphere produces a
number of observable heating processes. These may be characterized as
instabilities and spread F, plasma line overshoot and generation of extrathermal
electrons. This work will combine a theoretical model with specific experimental
tests to explain the physical mechanisms involved in these types of ionospheric
perturbations.
