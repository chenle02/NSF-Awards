9321478 Mosley-Thompson This award is for support for a study to conduct anion
and cation analyses of samples from polar ice cores to establish an annually
resolved 800-year volcanic history for Greenland and a 4000-year history from
Antarctica. The proposed 800-year Greenland record will complement the existing
1000-year record from South Pole Station and make detailed interhemispheric
comparisons possible. The proposed 4000-year Antarctic record will extend from
the South Pole volcanic record and ultimately complement the longer histories
expected from central Greenland cores. Interhemispheric comparison of these high
resolution (annual to decadal) time series will allow identification of those
near-tropical eruptions which perturb the sulfuric acid content of the global
atmosphere. ***
