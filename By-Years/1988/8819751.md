A Laboratory investigation is proposed to explore the hypothesis that some
collisions between supercooled precipitation drop result in freezing and that a
collision-ice nucleation mechanism may account for the kind and number of first
ice particles in warm-based midwestern convective clouds. An apparatus will be
constructed that will produce isolated collisions between supercooled drops
initially falling freely at terminal velocity. Experiments will be conducted
over a range of collector drop sizes and size ratios. Collisions will be
recorded photographically to measure the possible dependency of freezing on
impact angle and occurrence of coalescence, bounce or temporary coalescence.
Data will first be collected for minimally charged drops created from distilled
deionized water. By exploring a relatively overlooked but prevalent
microphysical process, the goal of this research is to provide a better
understanding of the role of supercooled drop collisions in the production of
ice in clouds and the consequent influence these may have on the production of
rain in the warm-based convective clouds of the midwestern United States. //
