This project will contribute to the national economy, security and prosperity by
advancing the state-of-the-art in facility location decision-support tools.
Analytical tools for facility location problems are used for policy and decision
making in a wide range of applications, including locating public facilities
such as emergency medical centers and fire stations. The increasing
dependability on these tools makes it critical to develop more accurate
approaches that eliminate potential errors due to aggregation of data and data
uncertainty, which in turn could lead to millions of dollars in wasteful
expenditure. The goal of this project is to create pathways toward the design of
next-generation facility location analytical tools which are error-free and have
the capability to account for uncertainties. The collaboration with Roanoke
River Cleaning project will inform and validate the developed methodology, as
well as demonstrate a meaningful broader impact in the local community. This
project will also contribute toward training of undergraduate and graduate
students and engaging underrepresented K-12 students in research via established
programs at Virginia Tech.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research objective of this
project is to bring a paradigm shift in modeling the classical facility location
problems by eliminating critical errors arising from traditional practice of
demand aggregation into demand points and binary coverage assumptions. As part
of the work, computationally efficient data-driven algorithms will be developed
to solve the planar Maximum/Set Covering Location Problems. The developed
modeling frameworks allows spatial (non-aggregated) representations of demand
and service zones, partial coverage in its true sense, and an adjustable level
of risk-aversion to address uncertainty. Exact and approximation algorithms will
build on the theoretical properties of the models and result in efficient
solution methods. Extensions to explicitly address uncertainty will also be
considered. The PI will evaluate the effectiveness of the models and algorithms
by executing a pilot project with the Roanoke River Cleaning
Project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
