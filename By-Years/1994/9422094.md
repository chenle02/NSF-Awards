9422094 Farag Researchers at the University of Louisville will purchase
equipment for research in the area of Computer Vision and Image Processing
(CVIP). The equipment will be used for several projects including the following:
1) 3-D Model Building in Computer Vision: New Approaches and Applications; 2)
Integrated Image Segmentation; 3) Large Image Manipulation in Support of Optical
Pattern Recognition; and 4) Fractional Brownian Motion for Representing Natural
Image Texture. The main components of the laboratory are: 1) Hardware for 3-D
data acquisition and analysis (Silicon Graphics Iris Indigo 200/100MHz; 2) 3-D
scanner for object scanning (Cyberware 3030-RGB/PS 3D Scanner&amp;Table Bundle);
3) still-image capturing &amp; display (Pullnix digital Camera, HP-C2732A
X-terminals &amp; Tektronix 3D display); and 4) image printing equipment
(Codonics NP600 color dye sublimation printer, and slide write Polaroid
CI-5000). ***
