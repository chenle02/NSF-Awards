The aim of the project is the development of capillary electrophoresis (CE)
experiments in Honors General Chemistry, Instrumental Analysis, and Biochemistry
courses. The instrumentation needed includes CE with a fluorescence detector and
a continuous wavelength detection system, software, and a printer. This
equipment is as an integral part of the laboratory component of these courses.
The laboratory experiments enable the student to experience firsthand the
separation principles that are taught in the course lectures. Examples include
protein analysis, peptide sequencing, DNA fragment analysis, and small molecules
in biological and environmental samples. In addition, students use this modern
instrument to do research during the academic year and summer. The significance
of the project is that students will be trained in a state-of-the-art
bioanalytical technique. The addition of a capillary electrophoresis instrument
enhances the teaching efforts in Honors General Chemistry, Instrumental
Analysis, and Biochemistry.
