Continued planning of the U.S. Global Ocean Flux Program (U.S. GOFS) will be
the focus of this effort. This program results from a workshop held in 1984
under the auspices of the National Academy of Sciences. The principal theme is
to identify and quantify the physical, chemical and biological processes
controlling biogeochemical cycling in the ocean, and their interaction with the
global atmosphere. The goal is to understand the processes governing the
production and fate of biogenic materials in the sea well enough to predict
their influences on, and responses to, global scale perturbations. In order to
achieve these complex goals, a Planning Office has been established which serves
the needs to coordination, communication, publication, planning and
representation of the scientific issues involved. The coordination and
implementation of this program nationally and internationally is provided for.
During the grant period a pilot program involving 5 nations and 2 aircraft will
be undertaken, data from time-series stations will commence, and plans for a
global survey will be brought to final form.
