This workshop, led by an organizing committee of law and social science scholars
affiliated with the Consortium for Undergraduate Law and Justice Programs
(CULJP) and the Law and Society Association (LSA), will help identify and
advance the next wave of research questions among four key subfields of
sociolegal studies and expand the involvement of undergraduates in this
research. Those subfields include legal consciousness, legal mobilization, cause
lawyering, and judicial decision making.

The workshop is targeted to 30 sociolegal scholars from primarily undergraduate
programs and will be held over one and a-half days. Half of the participants
will be selected by invitation with the other half open to application.

The workshop will help chart and stimulate new waves of sociolegal scholarship
while increasing the involvement of undergraduates in this research. One of the
goals of the workshop is to create a network of research-active sociolegal
scholars who are interested in expanding research projects at undergraduate
sociolegal programs or involving undergraduates. The organizers will enable this
process by creating a listserv of participants and facilitating conversations as
planning begins for potential research experiences involving undergraduates
(REUs). The organizers also will prepare an analytical article that synthesizes
the discussions and conclusions of the workshop and how sociolegal scholarship
might expand in four key subareas. In order to stimulate and broaden the
participation of undergraduates in sociolegal scholarship, the resulting
publication also will report on strategies derived from the workshop to recruit
and involve undergraduates in research.
