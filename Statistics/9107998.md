Bootstrap is a technique which provides answers to many complex statistical
questions with a minimum number of assumptions. The investigator will to study
the performance of the bootstrap in cases where the observations are not
independent of one another. The corrections needed to make the bootstrap
procedure more efficient for dependent processes will be studied by Edgeworth
expansions.
