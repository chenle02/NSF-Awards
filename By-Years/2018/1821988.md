Substances that make up the Earth's atmosphere, oceans, and some interior areas
are all seen to rotate. Scientists also see the same actions in the Sun, the
other smaller and larger planets in our Solar System, as well as in other stars
and planets found orbiting other stars. Rotation clearly affects the spread of
heat, chemical compositions, and physical processes. It can drive circulation on
the large scales we see from planets to stars. The "Rotating Convection: from
the Lab to the Stars" meeting will bring together an international group of
people who study different aspects of rotating convection to review the current
state of this field, and plan future studies. The conference will last five days
and have talks and posters mixed with group discussions. This conference will
serve the national interest by promoting the progress of science when plans are
made to coordinate future scientific studies of rotating convection to be most
productive. Funding will support the travel of early-career participants from
the United States.

Rotation directly influences convection by affecting the transport rates of
heat, chemical species, and angular momentum. It can therefore drive large-scale
circulations, and large-scale inhomogeneities. The interaction of rotation and
convection is complex and takes different forms depending on the parameter
regime considered (e.g. high momentum/heat transfer oceanic convection compared
to intermediate atmospheric and planetary convection, to low stellar
convection). Understanding the complexity of fluid motions that derive from this
interaction is a longstanding problem that can only be studied through a
combination of experimental, numerical, mathematical and observational research.
The principal goal of this workshop is to identify fundamental questions to be
addressed in rotating convection research, and develop a research agenda for the
future.
