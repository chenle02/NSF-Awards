In December 1988, the Marine Systems Engineering Laboratory (MSEL) began a
program, funded by the National Science Foundation (Grant No. EID-8818406), to
investigate the key issues in the design of knowledge-based systems for use in
Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) systems. It was directed at understanding
some of the problems associated with utilizing these knowledge-based systems in
real time domains. The efforts focused on establishing a symbolic processing
environment which would exist on top of a real time operating system. This
effort which builds on the results of the initial work, reflects the insights
which were developed during the initial phase of this program. The
investigations will be accomplished over a two year period and will result in
the implementation of a intelligent real-time scheduler for expert systems
running in Autonomous Undersea Vehicle (AUV) systems. It defines an effort to
develop a scheduling algorithm in accordance with the criteria specified as a
result of our previous work in designing real-time expert systems. The product
of this effort will be a domain-independent scheduling algorithm suitable for
use in any environment where multiple knowledge sources interact in a time-
constrained fashion.
