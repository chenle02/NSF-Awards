Sensitivity analysis of discrete event systems is an area that has recently
attracted the attention of a number of researchers. Two general approaches have
been proposed, perturbation analysis and the likelihood ratio method, that
provide efficient estimates of parameter sensitivities for analytically
intractable systems. Infinitesimal perturbation analysis estimates in particular
are very attractive because they are easy to obtain, have small computational
requirements and low variance. However, their usefulness is limited by the fact
that they are biased in many cases. The proposed research is to investigate the
possibility of using compensator identities in combination with perturbation
methods in order to derive unbiased, low variance sensitivity estimates. Initial
success in deriving estimates for the second derivative of the mean response
time and of occupancy probabilities for the GI/G/1 queue justify confidence in
this approach. The results of this study will be directly applicable in all the
cases where discrete event simulation is used for sensitivity analysis and
optimization of real systems and more specifically in manufacturing systems and
data communication networks.
