The goal of Biology 2000 is to develop a new syllabus, complete with course
materials, for teaching introductory biology to non-science majors and future
teachers. Biology 2000 addresses a problem of national importance. Undergraduate
science education in America needs revision. Too many students studying science
in college are "turned off" by the experience and intimidated by their classes.
This has led to an unfortunate paradox: Living in a highly technical society,
Americans lack an understanding of science. The Biology 2000 approach helps
students understand science and the nature of discovery by organizing the
concepts of biology around major experiments and discoveries in the field. In
Biology 2000, biology is taught as a logical progression of ideas starting with
Darwinian evolution, progressing through the major discoveries in the field, and
ending with today's exciting challenges. Three components of Biology 2000 are
being co-developed as an integrated package: A relatively brief textbook tells
the story of biology in a highly readable style that introduces concepts and
builds motivation. Accompanying CDs walk students through difficult concepts
using interactive animations, video clips and "virtual experiments." An
extensive World Wide Web site is a source of further detail, self-tests, a
glossary and links to other relevant Internet sites. By Fall of 1997, five of
the 12 anticipated chapters will be in first draft stage, ready for preliminary
beta testing and revision. We are seeking support from NSF to complete the
project. Wiley and Sons, Publishers has agreed to publish and disseminate the
Biology 2000 materials. A professional software development company has been
contracted to develop the CDs.
