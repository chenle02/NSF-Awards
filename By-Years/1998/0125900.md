0125900&lt;br/&gt;Sowers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a project to
improve the understanding of the biogeochemical processes that control CH4
emissions. Records of the concentration of methane in trapped gases in ice tell
us about changes in atmospheric loading through time. Such records do not,
however, provide information on the individual sources or sinks. One way to
refine our understanding of the cycling of bioactive trace gases like methane is
to use stable isotope records of trapped gases in ice cores. This project will
measure the Deuterium/Hydrogen (D/H) ratio of methane trapped in shallow/recent
ice (covering the last ~ 200 years) at Siple Dome, Antarctica. The proposed work
will complement current efforts to measure the carbon-13 isotope ratio of
methane in ice cores and will provide fundamental information on the various
sources and sinks of atmospheric methane over the last 200 years.
