Under this award, numerical tools will be developed for the study of
astrophysical systems involving relativistic gravity, strong electromagnetic
fields, and rotation. These tools will include computer codes for evolving
fluids and electromagnetic fields in a fixed gravitational field, codes for
evolving the relativistic gravitational field itself, and a combined code that
will evolve gravitational fields with both material and electromagnetic sources.
Tools for verifying the accuracy of the integrations will also be developed. The
codes will be optimized for use on the latest generation of supercomputers,
publicly released, and made available within the scientific community. In the
course of developing these codes, computational scientists will be trained at
the undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral levels. The codes will also be
applied by the developers to problems at the forefront of astrophysics and
gravitation physics research.

This work is motivated by a number of astrophysical systems, including:
accreting black holes and neutron stars; coalescing binary neutron stars and
black holes; rapidly rotating neutron stars formed in core-collapse supernovae;
and collapsing supermassive stars. Taken together, these objects are the focus
of a large fraction of current astrophysical research. They are the likely
source of detectable gravitational waves, powerful X-ray emission, and gamma-ray
bursts. So far, however, they have resisted understanding because the underlying
physics of the fluid, the electromagnetic field, and the gravitational field is
complicated, nonlinear, and time dependent. Only numerical integrations can
unlock the fundamental physics of black hole accretion, test scenarios for the
generation of gamma-ray bursts, and generate more accurate predictions for
gravitational waveforms from coalescing compact binaries. The required numerical
methods do not yet exist; they will be developed under this award.
