This research is focused on using a newly developed balloon borne sensor for
evaluating the long term global atmospheric effects of the recent Mt. Pinatubo
volcanic eruption, especially in regard to its influence on global and polar
ozone depletion, global optical depth changes, atmospheric temperature
variations, and the possible influence on global tropospheric aerosols. The
research will also help characterize the global volcanic cloud so that it can be
put in proper perspective for comparison with past volcanic eruptions.
Systematic balloon sounding of aerosol and ozone will be made at a mid-latitude
station in both the northern and southern hemisphere where other supporting
measurements are also being made. As an additional opportunity, variations of
tropospheric aerosols and ozone will also be systematically investigated. It is
believed that such variations can be traced to biomass burning episodes and are
highly significant in regard to tropospheric chemistry on a world scale.
