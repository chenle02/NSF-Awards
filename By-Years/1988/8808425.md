An analytical method to predict the response of wood-frame, non- engineered
structures in high winds will be developed based on the assumption that this
response depends on the flexibility of certain joints and on the diaphragming
action of certain walls and floors, including ceilings and roofs. Experiments on
dissected wood joints (nailed joints and special connectors) will be performed
also to obtain the flexibility curves needed for the structural analysis. The
expanded knowledge in wind effects on wood-frame buildings will help to diminish
the damages and losses that occur in the United States every year. The results
of the project also will provide better analytical tools to the construction and
the insurance industries for assessing damages and developing improved building
techniques.
