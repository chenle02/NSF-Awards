Even the best computer vision system falls far short of human vision. A person
has no problem recognizing metal as metal or wood as wood. These are examples of
material perception in which vision relies on combinations of color, texture,
transparency, and glossiness to recognize the material surface of objects. With
NSF Support Dr. Edward Adelson studies how perception puts information together,
thereby allowing material perception. His working hypothesis is that human
vision relies on certain statistical relationships between colors and patterns
within an image, and uses these to infer the material. However, the exact nature
of these relationships remains to be understood. Broader impacts of the research
are important in everyday life. People care greatly about the appearance of
their skin and hair, the clothing they wear, and the food they eat. If we can
understand the principles that determine material perception, it will help
industrial researchers who seek to make new products with improved surface
appearance, such as new kinds of cosmetics or paint. An understanding of
material perception may also pay off in better machine vision systems. For
instance, an automated vehicle should be able to distinguish pavement, dirt,
mud, or ice and adjust its driving accordingly, but today's machine vision
systems find such problems quite difficult. By emulating the mechanisms of human
vision, we can develop more powerful machine vision systems.
