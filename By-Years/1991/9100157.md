High density information storage is an emerging technology crucial to
international economic competitiveness. Magnetic and magneto-optic high density
storage will continue to grow in economic importance for at least the next
fifteen years, and perhaps beyond that. We propose to carry out a research
program in magnetic microstructures as applied to information storage. The
research will study several fundamental issues that should be addressed to bring
the technology closer to thermal and quantum limits: Experimental investigations
and modeling of the relation of physical and magnetic microstructure to
fluctuations and noise is expected to lead the way to storage media with
controlled and programmed microstructures. We plan to introduce novel computing
methods using massively parallel processors into the micromagnetic modeling.
Studies of medium and transducer micromagnetics will be aimed toward
multielement sensors. Such sensors will be needed for servo systems capable of
high density recording track following. We will also explore their possible
application to adaptive sensing as an innovative method of eliminating
microstructure related medium noise. This will involve research on signal
processing algorithms appropriate to these sensors. A breakthrough in even one
of these directions will have a far ranging technological and economic impact.
Apart from the direct technological benefits expected from this research, it
will have a lasting impact through its mission of teaching gifted professionals
principles of information storage technology and magnetics, engineering
disciplines that are underrepresented in United States universities to the
serious detriment of our international competitiveness.
