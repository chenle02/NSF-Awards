Metalanguages that are suitable for implementing derivation systems such as
proof systems and program transformation systems will be investigated. A crucial
feature of such languages appears to be the ability to represent higher.order
objects and to manipulate them in logically meaningful ways. A higher.order
logic programming language that provides such a capability will be studied. This
language provides simply typed \-terms as data structures for representing
objects such as programs and proofs and incorporates higher-order unification
and search primitives for reasoning about such objects. Experiments have shown
that such a language has considerable potential as a metalanguage, thus pointing
to the importance of a robust and efficient implementation for it. This research
will examine techniques for efficiently implementing the novel operations in
this language, i.e. higher-order unification and the new search primitives,
resulting in the design of an abstract machine. An implementation will be
provided based on these results and will be used to explore applications of this
language within actual derivation systems. Feedback from these studies will be
used to improve the behavior of the implementation on commonly occurring
problems. Extensions to the language based on using a richer class of \-terms
will also be addressed.
