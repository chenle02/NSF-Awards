9318662 Eyler This proposal is for "High-Resolution Laser Spectroscopy of
Excited Atomic and Molecular States." It involves several studies on the
structure and dynamics of excited states in small atoms and molecules. The
experiments share a common experimental approach, multiphoton spectroscopy with
narrow band lasers. They include precision measurements in fundamental atomic
and molecular systems, the study of near threshold dissociation of diatomic
molecules, the systematic investigation of excited-state dynamics in small
molecules and the development of new spectroscopic techniques.
