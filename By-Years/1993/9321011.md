This research project seeks to develop a new class of manufacturing decision-
making methods based on machine learning, which refers to computational systems
for deriving knowledge, strategies, or decision structures from such information
as performance data, observations, or past experiences. The proposed methodology
will provide a framework for intelligent, adaptive manufacturing decision making
with learning capabilities. It will also incorporate a general model for
automating manufacturing decision support that is capable of progressive
performance improvements. Besides the development and analysis of the learning-
based manufacturing decision methodology, the research plan also includes the
validation of the methodology by simulation experiments and by testing it in
real-world manufacturing environments. !K !K F : : ( Times New Roman Symbol &
