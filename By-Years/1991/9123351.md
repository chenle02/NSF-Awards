A direct electromagnetic generation of ultrasound techniques is used to study
precursor effects in the velocity and attenuation in Nickel-Aluminum alloys near
the martensitic phase transformation temperature. This technique probes not only
the bulk but also the surface of the materials and will yield valuable
information about both the interaction of phonons and the strain fields
associated with the defects which cause the transformation. The variation of the
elastic constants with hydrostatic and uniaxial pressure will e measured in
order to determine the conditions for lattice stability in these alloys.
Additional studies with collaborators will employ neutron diffraction work to
further characterize the structure of single crystals used in the research
project.
