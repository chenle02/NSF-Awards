This project will investigate the structural, thermal and geobarometric
histories of the high-grade Central Gneiss Complex of the Coastal orogen of
western British Columbia through a multi- disciplinary structural, petrologic,
and geochronologic study. The study addresses a critical problem in our
understanding of tectonic processes occurring during collisional orogenesis,
including how supracrustal rocks are transported to lower crustal levels and
subsequently uplifted. These uplifted rocks are now represented by Phanerozoic,
