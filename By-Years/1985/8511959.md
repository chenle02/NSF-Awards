Research will be conducted on the design of a distributed control system for a
robot. The goal is to produce a high-level control network which will allow a
dextrous hand (the Salisbury hand) to be used in a task-oriented manner, i.e.,
where actions of the hand are specified in terms of their effects on objects.
Research on the dextrous hand already conducted in this laboratory provides the
context in which distributed robot control will be explored. Research issues
will be investigated involving both design of a logical distributed model of
computation specifically for the robotic domain, and design of a dynamic mapping
function to realize this model using a network of processors.
