Assessing Weathering as a Function of Climate in Proximal Alluvial
Sediments&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;by&lt;br/&gt;Gerilyn Sorghan, Megan Elwood-
Madden, EAR-1225162, University of
Oklahoma&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Inferring a glacial influence
from sedimentary facies is elusive, especially in the absence of ice-contact
indicators (e.g., striated clasts). Illustrating this, inferences of glaciation
on the basis of sedimentary facies have ignited controversies for sediments and
sedimentary rocks from the murky depths of the Archean through the comparable
light of the Pleistocene. Traditional chemical weathering indices are also
ambiguous, particularly in discerning glacial/proglacial alluvial deposits from
those formed in hot-arid systems. However, integrating chemical, mineralogical,
and textural observations of alluvial sediments formed in temperature-
precipitation extremes could provide valuable indicators of climate for
sedimentary studies, particularly in distinguishing glacial from non-glacial
systems. PIs propose to test the hypothesis that bulk chemistry, texture, and
mineralogy, and solute fluxes of granitoid-sourced alluvial sediments show
systematic and robust variations between glacial and non-glacial systems owing
to differences in reactive surface area, temperature, and aqueous conditions.
Accordingly, the objective of the proposed research is to quantify natural
variation of chemical and physical weathering in granitoid-sourced proximal
alluvial sediments in end-member glacial and non-glacial systems when other,
"non-climatic" factors (e.g., provenance, drainage basin area and relief, sample
grain size, sediment facies) are controlled. The ultimate goal is to establish a
quantitative matrix of chemical and textural metrics to differentiate sediments
formed in contrasting climates.
