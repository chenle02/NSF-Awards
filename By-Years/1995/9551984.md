This project establishes a state-of-the-art Molecular Biology Laboratory. The
laboratory is not only providing Biology and Chemistry majors in-depth exposure
to the rapidly expanding field of molecular biology, but also providing an
introduction to nonmajors enrolled in the General Education class, Biological
Concepts. The laboratory consists of six workstations; each includes the
equipment necessary to perform the following contemporary experiments:
structure, function, and isolation of DNA; electrophoretic separation of
proteins and DNA; molecular weight determination; restriction nuclease mapping
of DNA; analysis of a genome segment; and recombinant DNA experiments. The data
resulting from these experiments are correlated and analyzed utilizing the
latest software programs. Limited instruction on the use of internet, modems,
and GCG programs for gene sequence analysis is also provided, with an indication
of the role they play in molecular biology. The laboratory is linked to the
university-wide Novelle network. This gives access to the internet and data
banks around the world. This laboratory enables the university to enhance the
education provided for its students in molecular biology. Additionally, the
project provides students with a positive experience, perhaps motivating them
toward a career in the sciences. For the nonscience student, this laboratory
makes the often bewildering world of biotechnology more understandable, a must
for everyone in the world of tomorrmw.
