This project is related to the digitization of the Television News Archive at
Vanderbilt University. The issues to be addressed during the project
include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Evaluation of alternate delivery technologies
(streaming video methods and different kinds of video
servers).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Technology for identifying program segments,
and labeling the results of the segmentation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3.
Acquisition methods for future content acquisition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. Time
stamp technology and uses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5. Algorithms and processes for
signal conditioning for increasing quality of the data
archive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Vanderbilt archive is crucial for historians:
it contains the only records of TV news for some years starting in 1968.
However, it is currently stored on obsolete analog technology. This proposal
takes advantage of the need to digitize the material to explore techniques that
could be applied to many other kinds of video digitization projects.
