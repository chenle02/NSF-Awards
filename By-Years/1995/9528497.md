ABSTRACT 9528497 ROUNDS This Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) has been established
between the NSF/OPP and NASA Ames Research Center, NASA Science Internet, as a
collaboration vehicle intended to capture data and related telecommunications
supported previously under a separate MOA with NASA Headquarters, Washington,
D.C. The predecessor MOA was established in support of collaboration between
NASA and NSF for developing jointly managed projects to explore the analog
between space exploration and research and Antarctic science and research. A
continual growth in telecommunications and data networking projects has occurred
under the original MOA to the degree that both agencies agreed to develop a new
framework of interaction tailored specifically for this function. The
accompanying Task Completion Summary represents the first funding for specific
tasks originated under the old MOA framework: (a) Continuation of INTELSAT
satellite telecommunications services, Internet services, and on- demand
compressed video services for McMurdo Station $516,000 (b) Provision of
electronic news gathering microwave transmission system and fiber optic
video/audio transmission cable system in support of the NSF-NASA distance
learning project, "Live From Antarctica" $48,000 These products and services
have been provided by NASA on a cost reimbursable basis by NSF. The full
requested amount of $562,000 is recommended for award to NASA in reimbursement
of FY95 funds expended in support of NSF activities of the United States
Antarctic Program. ***
