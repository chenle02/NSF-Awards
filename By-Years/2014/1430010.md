This proposal provides for travel of participants of the 2014 CPS Workshop on
Medical Frontiers in Research. The workshop is bringing together multi-
disciplinary experts from industry, academia, and government to discuss future
CPS research challenges in this space. The participants are expert in the
foundational science, engineering, and technology underlying next-generation
cyber-physical systems, particularly in the context of the application domain of
medicine, including medical devices. Through sessions on CPS research in
sensing, diagnosis, and prosthetics, the attendees are defining a compelling
research agenda in an area of scientific, technical, and engineering exploration
that has tremendous societal impact.
