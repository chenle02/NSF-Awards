The general objective of the proposed research is to use lead and zinc trace
metals derived form point sources of known historical ages to quantify and model
erosional and depositional effects of floods and the long-term downstream
transport of sediment and trace metals. The research addresses the long-standing
problem that little previous quantitative data has been available to document
the sensitivity of sediment storage at various time scales and geographic
locations in drainage systems. The proposed research will quantify response
rates and processes that describe the movement and storage of sediment under
varying time scales and flood events. Results from the modeling and
quantification of the long-term fate of lead and zinc metals in floodplain
sediment of the study area should serve as a general model to further understand
the long-term behavior of many toxic substances that are associated with water
transported sediment.
