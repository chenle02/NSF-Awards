The 2016 Redbud Geometry/Topology Conference will be held April 1-3, 2016 at the
University of Oklahoma. The conference will focus on topics in geometric group
theory and related areas in low-dimensional topology. This conference is part of
an ongoing series of conferences held at universities in Arkansas and Oklahoma,
intended to increase interaction and collaboration among young and senior
mathematicians in the area. It will feature prominent speakers from across North
America, as well as a graduate student workshop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2016
Redbud Geometry/Topology Conference will be centered on topics in geometric
group theory, diffeomorphism groups, and the geometry and combinatorics of
curves on surfaces. The invited speakers are Tarik Aougab (Brown University),
David Cohen (University of Chicago), Thomas Koberda (University of Virginia),
Kathryn Mann (University of California at Berkeley), Denis Osin (Vanderbilt
University), Piotr Przytycki (McGill University), Jenya Sapir (University of
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign), and Robert Young (Courant Institute, NYU). The
conference begins with a workshop designed to enhance the experience of graduate
students and junior researchers. The workshop will feature expository talks by
Mann, Osin, and Przytycki.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference website:
