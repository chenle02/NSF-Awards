Influenced by air-sea heat exchange, rainfall, and evaporation, the buoyancy of
the oceanâ€™s uppermost layer can impact the overturning oceanic circulation.
Winds above the ocean surface can generate currents and promote mixing. The
combined effects of wind and buoyancy on the ocean are ultimately felt
throughout the entire ocean. In response to the changing ocean conditions
(especially, the sea surface temperature or SST), atmospheric circulations can
arise to govern patterns of clouds and rain, which in turn impact the wind and
buoyancy forcings on the ocean. To this end, mechanisms involving buoyancy and
winds at the air-sea interface are critical in establishing the timescales,
patterns, and amplitudes of many climate variations we observe and simulate in
climate models. Yet, complete understanding of these mechanisms remains elusive
due to sparse ocean observations and complicated dynamics. The research will
decompose the relative effects of winds versus buoyancy forcing using climate
model experiments, with emphasis on two features expected to substantially
change in a future climate, namely the surface temperature and the Atlantic
Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In particular,
many open questions remain about the importance of winds versus buoyancy forcing
as pathways through which the atmosphere communicates intrinsic and externally
forced variations to the ocean. Addressing these questions is made more
difficult by a wide gap in the model hierarchy, between fully coupled models
with a complete dynamical representation of both the ocean and atmosphere and
models that represent the ocean as a motionless slab that is only thermally
coupled to the atmosphere. This work will be implemented by closing said gap in
the model hierarchy via leveraging a mechanically decoupled (MD) version of a
climate model, which isolates variations in the ocean circulation that are
driven solely by buoyancy from the wind-driven variability captured by fully
coupled models. With the MD as an intermediate step between fully coupled and
slab ocean models, a clearer mechanistic understanding of the drivers of climate
variations is possible. These three model versions will be used together to
identify the relative roles of buoyancy and wind variations in driving intrinsic
SST variability, anthropogenic trends in surface temperature, and intrinsic and
anthropogenically forced AMOC variations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
