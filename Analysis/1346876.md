There are three main topics in the proposal. The first is the study of the
cohomology of abelian higher-rank parabolic actions; in particular we study the
cohomological equation and cocycle rigidity for actions completely absent of
hyperbolicity. The second considers the smooth action rigidity for the Cartan
action on homogeneous space generated by quaternion groups by geometric method;
this complements the project of studying smooth rigidity for higher-rank
algebraic actions. Finally, we study the general smooth action rigidity for
Cartan action and parabolic action; here we apply the famous Kolmogorov-Arnold-
Moser (KAM) method to homogenous function space. Dynamical systems appeared
first because of Newton's discovery that the motions of mechanical objects can
be described by the solutions of ordinary differential equations. More
generally, many other natural and social phenomena,such as radioactive decay,
chemical reaction, population growth, or dynamics of prices on the market, maybe
be modeled with various dynamical systems. So the subject of dynamical systems
hasfound numerous applications not only in other branches of mathematics, such
asnumber theory, geometry and representation theory, but also in physics,
biology, economics and other sciences.The proposed research focuses on smooth
rigidity results of algebraic actions, that is, the stabilityproperties related
to change of parameters. The PI proposes to develop new methods and techniques
from representation theory andharmonic analysis in the study of dynamical
systems. The PI believes that the new tool is powerful in solving problems and
inspiring new directions in dynamical systems. The PI intends to work with some
graduate students and teach graduate-level course during the period of this
award.
