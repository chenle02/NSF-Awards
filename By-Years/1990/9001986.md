The source of ore fluids and their interactions with host rocks are of
considerable concern in the understanding of the Mississippi Valley-type of
Lead-Zinc deposits. In southeast Missouri there is a strong possibility that
multiple basinal fluids were involved and indicate a more complex origin for
sulfide orebodies in the region than previously modeled. This project will
utilize sulfur isotope variations throughout the paragenetic sequence of sulfide
deposition for a number of mines in the Viburnum Trend of the Southeast Missouri
Lead-Zinc district. Results should clarify the role of successive pulses of ore-
forming fluids and their interaction with host rocks.
