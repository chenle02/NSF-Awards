From June 2 through June 6, 2014, Boston University will host an international
conference entitled "p-adic Variation in Number Theory." The conference will
focus on the notion that automorphic forms vary in p-adic families and the
multitude of applications resulting from this variation. Over the last decade,
there has been enormous progress in Iwasawa theory and the study of Galois
representations fueled by advances in the p-adic variation of automorphic forms
(e.g. the proofs of the Main Conjecture of modular forms and the Fontaine-Mazur
conjecture along with recent developments in attaching Galois representations to
automorphic forms).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this conference, experts will
lecture on the most recent developments and applications relating to p-adic
variation to bring the participants of the conference up to date in this quickly
evolving field. Many young researchers will participate. Some of the
conference's lectures will be delivered by recent PhDs. In addition, funding
will be provided to over 50 graduate students and recent PhDs in total, to be
selected through an application process. Special attention will be given to any
applications received from under-represented
groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference website:
