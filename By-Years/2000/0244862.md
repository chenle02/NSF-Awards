The CTEQ summer school on QCD analysis and phenomenology fulfills a unique role
in training young physicists. That role is to help train early career
experimental physicists working on collider detectors, as well as a number of
more phenomenologically oriented theorists, in QCD as applied to collider
physics. The education goes well beyond what can be expected from graduate
course work. At the same time the core courses are very 'nuts and bolts',
covering the essential knowledge needed to begin studying QCD in its own right,
or to understand QCD processes as a source of background to new physics, as they
inevitably are at hadron colliders. The special topics courses whose
transparencies are available on web- are quite clear and practically oriented,
rightly de-emphasizing formalism in favor of concrete experimental lessons or
signatures. The School will be held at the university of Wisconsin in Madison.
