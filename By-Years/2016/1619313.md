Data communication has been studied over a wide range of modalities, including
radio frequency (RF), acoustic and visible light. The possibility of
communicating over the vibratory channel has been relatively unexplored. This
project explores the fundamental limits and new algorithms associated with
digital communication via vibrations in the context of vibration motors and
accelerometers embedded inside all modern smartphones. The corresponding speed
of data transfer may not match established communication modalities such as
Near-Field Communication (NFC) or Bluetooth, but we propose that vibratory
communication offers inherent advantages whenever security is vital: for
instance, any two devices may be able to spontaneously exchange security keys by
tapping each other; a user wearing a smart watch may enter her passwords into
her laptop by merely bringing the watch in contact with her laptop; clandestine
communications that should not leave a trackable trace could perhaps also be an
application of vibratory communication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This project
initiates a first-principles study of reliable and efficient communication via
vibration and proposes to develop a concrete communication/networking stack on
vibratory actuators and sensors. The system's capacity and viability will be
tested across different platforms (smartphone, smartwatch, finger rings), with a
focus on real-world use-cases and applications. The core research in this
project is divided into 4 main threads: (1) modeling the vibratory transmitters
and receivers and understanding the theoretical capacity of such systems; (2)
designing a vibratory radio using a combination of new and existing techniques;
(3) developing a Medium Access Control layer that controls channel access and
fault recovery; (4) understanding the information leakage (and side channels)
due to vibrations and developing techniques to mitigate them.
