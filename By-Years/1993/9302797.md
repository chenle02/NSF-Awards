An SGER award will be used to make preliminary studies of the electrical field
which develops between snow and ice and a sliding dielectric material. The local
character of the field in relation to the microstructure of the ice, the
thickness of its surface liquid-like layer and the nature of the slider-ice
interaction will be determined. The potential influence of this rather strong
field on the friction will be studied by performing friction tests at various
temperatures and sliding velocities. The possibilities of affecting the friction
and adhesion levels by an imposed field will also be explored.
