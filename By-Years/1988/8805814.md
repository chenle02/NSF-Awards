Work to be done during the term of this project will cover several problem
areas of mathematical analysis. They include studies of maximal functions and
their control of the differentiation of integrals, multiple parameter singular
integrals and the theory of elliptic partial differential equations. Much of the
present work continues earlier efforts to extend fundamental one (complex)
variable results to higher dimensions. Basic concepts such as maximal functions
and parametrized families of rectangles for differentiation do not extend
directly. Special classes have been substituted and gradually a full Hardy-space
environment is being developed. The goals are the same: to obtain bounds on the
fundamental operators of analysis such as the Riesz transform and the
multidimensional Hilbert transform. Connecting maximal operators with classical
singular integrals much be accomplished before these bounds and the resulting
applications can be made. The study of Dirichlet problems on half-space relates
directly to the questions of harmonic analysis related above. The boundary
function and its nontangential maximal function are to be in some Lebesque
class. This work is distinguished from earlier investigations in that it treats
equations defined on unbounded domains. A general theory of existence of
solutions has yet to be established. This research will concentrate on
developing criteria in terms of the coefficients of the matrix determining the
equation. Additional work will be done in extending classical restriction
theorems for the Fourier transform to the setting of compact Riemannian
manifolds without boundary and to study smoothness of Radon transforms over
lower dimensional submanifolds.
