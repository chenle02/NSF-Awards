Title: Japan JSPS Program: Effect of Dilute Polymer on Laminar Flow Patterns
This award will provide supplementary support to enable Dr. Elisha Moses of the
James Franck Institute, University of Chicago, to conduct collaborative research
with Dr. Takeji Hashimoto for 12 months at Kyoto University in Japan. They will
apply Moses' theoretical knowledge of physics to study the effect adding
polymers to a solution has on the flow patterns obtained under laminar
conditions. For over 50 years, polymers have been added to solutions to reduce
drag significantly in turbulent flows such as the Alaskan oil pipeline; however,
it has yet to be determined why polymers produce such an effect. Dr. Hashimoto's
expertise on the structure and behavior of crystalline polymers and the
experimental apparatus available at Kyoto University will complement Moses'
theoretical expertise in fluid dynamics and non-linear phenomena. Utilizing the
Saffman-Taylor apparatus, the team plans to conduct research on the structure
and behavior of different crystalline polymers introduced to a theta solvent,
Dioctyl phthalate.
