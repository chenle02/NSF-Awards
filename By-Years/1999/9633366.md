This renewal grant will conduct theoretical studies of the interactions of
energetic particles with the solar wind and solar corona. Broad-based studies
will include interstellar pickup ions, galactic cosmic rays, solar energetic
particles, and shock-accelerated particles. The PI's goal is to understand the
energetic particle structure of the heliosphere and fundamental processes that
govern that structure. Specific research tasks are: (1) developing a transport
theory for interstellar pickup ions based on the pitch-angle diffusion equation
to predict the ion spatial distribution and anisotropy for large scattering mean
free paths; (2) investigating the shock surfing mechanism at laminar and
turbulent quasi-perpendicular shocks as the origin of energetic ions at cometary
and interplanetary shocks and the solar wind termination shock; (3) studying the
evolution of the solar wind helium distribution downstream of Earth's quasi-
perpendicular bow shock; (4) exploring the consequences of an analytical
treatment of cosmic ray transport at high energies; and (5) constructing an
analytical theory of the acceleration of solar energetic electrons and ions in
reconnecting current sheets in coronal loops for a realistic electromagnetic
field configuration.***
