This planning grant will lead to a proposal from a coalition of four school
districts in western Connecticut. The full grant would establish a center
entitled the Center for Direct Involvement with Primary Research and Social
Responsibility (DIPR/SR). This center would focus on inquiry and laboratory
based activities and issues shared by science, technology and society. The
planning grant will establish the planning committee, devise an administrative
plan and a program of activities for the center, develop a proposal for the NSF,
and evaluate the planning process. The grantee provided matching costs of 100%.
