Trends in Internet infrastructure drive a shift toward service-
based&lt;br/&gt;computing. Internet-based service providers are adding new data
center&lt;br/&gt;capacity for a variety of services including Web hosting,
application&lt;br/&gt;services, outsourced storage, electronic markets, and
other network&lt;br/&gt;services. In these large scale and rapidly evolving data
centers, one of&lt;br/&gt;the most important challenges is the energy and
thermal problem. Data&lt;br/&gt;centers typically have very high power
requirement, which significantly&lt;br/&gt;increases the difficulty of deploying
and expanding a data center due to&lt;br/&gt;the need for a large power
generation infrastructure. Moreover, high&lt;br/&gt;power consumption can result
in high electricity bills and negative&lt;br/&gt;environmental implications.
Another consequence of power consumption is&lt;br/&gt;heat dissipation. A recent
report shows that heat density per product&lt;br/&gt;footprint in a data center
increases around 28% per year, increasing the&lt;br/&gt;cooling costs for air
conditioning. If the temperature is not cooled&lt;br/&gt;down effectively,
excessive heat can cause malfunctions of many devices&lt;br/&gt;and even
shutdown of the entire data center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research
addresses the above problem. More specifically, we&lt;br/&gt;investigate
innovative energy and thermal management schemes for data&lt;br/&gt;centers with
an emphasis on back-end storage, which is one of the&lt;br/&gt;biggest energy
consumers in data centers. To conserve energy and reduce&lt;br/&gt;heat
dissipation, we explore energy and thermal aware storage&lt;br/&gt;organizations
and investigate cross-layer and cross-node,&lt;br/&gt;energy-efficient,
thermally safe and performance-effective management&lt;br/&gt;schemes for data
centers. Moreover, we revisit and redesign existing&lt;br/&gt;highly-
performance-optimized control policies to be energy and
thermal&lt;br/&gt;aware.&lt;br/&gt;
