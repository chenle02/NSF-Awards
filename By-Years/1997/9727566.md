This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
Program, addresses the dynamics and temporal evolution of highly charged micron
sized droplets. The goal of the work being carried out by Professor Beauchamp at
CalTech is to determine the mechanism of formation of desolvated ions, which
provides the fundamental basis of ion formation in electrospray ion sources used
in mass spectrometry. Electrospray ionization is very useful for the mass
spectrometric analysis of large biologically significant molecules. The
ionization mechanism is probed by the use of ion mobility spectrometry coupled
with fluorescence probing of dye tagged droplets. %%% In order to determine the
mechanism of solvent loss and ion formation in the electrospray ionization
source mass spectrometer, this research project is investigating single droplet
ion mobility. Mobility measurements coupled with laser induced fluorescence
tagging of droplets will provide time dependent information on the ion
desolvation process. An increased understanding of the ion formation mechanism
will improve the applicability of mass spectrometry to the structural analysis
of large, biologically significant compounds.
