The project is developing an introductory astronomy course whose primary goals
will be (1) to develop quantitative reasoning skills and independence in problem
solving; (2) to expose students to the scientific use of computers; (3) to
inculcate an understanding of the power and limitations of experimental data;
(4) to develop critical thinking through scientific writing; and (5) to build on
the appeal of astronomy to attract and retain more science majors. The approach
emphasizes hands-on problem solving experience gained by working on projects
built around a few themes, rather than the more passive learning inherent in
delivery of a comprehensive body of material by a single professor in a
traditional lecture setting. Students will be active participants in the
classroom both collectively, through critical discussions of project goals,
experimental techniques and analysis, and individually, through use of
interactive software packages. The project makes extensive use of the MOSAIC
hypermedia environment in developing software modules for the course, and
eventually these modules will be available to colleagues at other institutions
via the Internet. The course materials are being developed by a team of senior
faculty and graduate students. The team approach benefits not only the
undergraduates who are enrolled in the class, but also the graduate students who
are provided with a mentored experience in designing courses and curricular
materials, and thus a valuable introduction to teaching. An introductory course
based on these goals and following this format will prove more successful than
traditional classroom techniques in sustaining student interest in science and
providing them with the basic skills they will need to understand, address, and
solve technically complex problems throughout their lifetimes.
