The goal of this activity is to understand the structure of complexity classes. 
Complexity classes provide the best tool currently available for understanding
the computational complexity of real-world computational problems.  Some of
these problems are notoriously difficult, but recent progress justifies some
optimism that additional useful insight about these complexity classes can be
obtained.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Minimum Circuit Size Problem (MCSP) is a
well-known example of an apparently-intractable problem in NP that is not widely
believed to be NP-complete.  Until now, all of the evidence that has been
gathered -- trying to indicate that MCSP is hard to compute -- has followed the
same path, invoking the connections between derandomization techniques and
cryptographically-secure one-way functions.  This proposal will focus on
developing a direct approach to reduce seemingly-hard problems to MCSP, and
thereby set the stage for a more thorough understanding of the complexity of
MCSP. The research results will be broadly disseminated, both through journal
publications as well as through survey articles in various venues. The long-term
goals of research in computational complexity, if finally achieved, will have
profound impact on society (for instance, by providing firm mathematical
underpinnings to public-key cryptography, which currently rests upon many
unproven conjectures).
