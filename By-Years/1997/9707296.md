ABSTRACT PROPOSAL # : DEB-9707296, DEB-9708376 INVESTIGATOR(S) : BURKE JOHNSON
INSTITUTION: COLORADO STATE UNIVERSITY DESERT RESEARCH INSTITUTE, UNIVERSITY OF
NEVADA Although much research has focused on the biotic mechanisms by which
ecosystems retain N, there has been relatively little attention paid to
nonbiological fixation (capture) of N in soils. The available evidence suggests
that soils are capable of fixing N in chemical sinks such as humus and clay
lattices but controls on this fixation are poorly understood and the processes
of chemical fixation are not included in the leading biogeochemical models. It
is important to fill this gap in our understanding if we are to be able to
predict and understand effects on soils of global increases in both atmospheric
N deposition and fertilizer use. The aims of this proposal are to investigate
controls on the long-term accumulation of nitrogen in soils, particularly by
nonbiological chemical fixation, and to determine the ecosystem consequences of
increased nonbiological N retention in grassland soils in Colorado. The research
design combines experimental addition of 15-N containing compounds, followed by
sophisticated chemical analysis of chemical transformations. A second series of
experiments involves addition of humus precursors to the soil.
