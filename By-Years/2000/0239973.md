ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;CTS-0239973&lt;br/&gt;A. Chatterjee, SUNY College
Environmental &amp; Science Forestry&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
proposal aims to enhance understanding of the conditions under which physically
connected networks are formed in multicomponent mixtures of non-spherical
molecules. Nanocomposite systems in which a thermoplastic matrix is reinforced
by the addition of rigid rod-like or plate-like filler nanoparticles will be the
primary focus of this investigation. The dependence of the percolation threshold
upon the stiffness and effective diameters of the matrix polymer, and upon the
nature of matrix-filler interaction, will be studied using methods of integral
equation theory which have proved successful in previous work involving polymer
solutions and blends. This investigation will lead to a more fundamental
understanding of the factors which promote network formation at low filler
volume fractions, a desirable objective for the rational design of lightweight,
high-strength, composite materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is being
co-funded by the divisions of Theoretical and Computational Chemistry (TCC) and
Chemical and Transport Systems (CTS).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
