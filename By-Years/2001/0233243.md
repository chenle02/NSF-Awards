ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Steel corrosion and the resulting deterioration of reinforced
concrete structures is one of the primary causes of increasing damage to
infrastructure. Corrosion of the reinforcing steel is implicated as a cause of
damage to the majority of the 226,000 reinforced concrete bridges described by
the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) as deficient. In 1991, the United
States Department of Transportation estimated rehabilitation costs for these
damaged bridges at $90.9 billion. Concrete normally provides reinforcing steel
with adequate corrosion protection. When steel is encased in concrete, a
protective iron oxide film forms at the steel-concrete interface due to the high
pH of the concrete. However, the presence of a sufficient concentration of
chloride ions can compromise the passive layer. In the presence of moisture, the
steel will corrode. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Development of a reliable test method
for in-situ measurement of the chloride ion penetration depth and concentration
in concrete structures would be invaluable to the concrete and construction
industry. From an economic standpoint, accurate measurements of the
concentration of chlorides and penetration depth in concrete structures, would
allow agencies to more effectively allocate funding for repair of those
structures with the most critical needs. Thus, the overall objective of the
proposed investigation is to gain a more complete understanding of the
fundamental implications of microwave measurements of cement-based materials
exposed to chloride solutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A methodical research plan
is proposed in order to correlate microwave measurements to the salt content and
chloride penetration depth in mortar. Mortar samples will be cyclically ponded
with salt solution. After the samples are oven dried, a very accurate and
sensitive microwave characterization technique will be used to evaluate their
dielectric properties using four independent complex reflection and transmission
coefficients. This information is then used in conjunction with a discrete
layered electromagnetic model and a dielectric mixing formula to render
information about the salt volume content as a function of depth into the
samples. This process is repeated for a number of soaking cycles, giving
information about salt penetration gradient and total content as a function of
depth into the sample, sample make-up and soaking cycle.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The anticipated outcome of this proposed investigation
constitutes a significant and comprehensive leap forward in the path to
evaluating chloride ingress in reinforced concrete
structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
