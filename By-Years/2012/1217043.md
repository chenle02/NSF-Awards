The goal of this project is to develop foundations for message-passing
algorithms, in the realm of probabilistic graphical models. The project will
focus on three classes of problems in graphical models: (a) learning graphical
models from observed data, (b) computing the mode of a graphical model, and (c)
computing marginals of variables in a graphical model. The project will identify
the strengths and limitations of the popular belief propagation algorithm for
all three problems. In addition, the project will develop new class of efficient
message-passing algorithms with provable performance guarantees by means of
exploiting the geometry of the graphical
model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Probabilistic graphical models have become a
standard way to represent uncertainty succinctly in a wide variety of
applications: communication and signal processing, computation, vision and image
processing, bioinformatics, natural language processing, and more. The problems
faced in these applications are largely &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research
outcome of this project will be folded in the course titled "Algorithms for
Inference (6.438)" taught by the PI. The course is a popular entry level
graduate course which also disseminates material online through MIT Open
CourseWare and going forward, it may explore possibility of wider dissemination
through MITx/EdX.
