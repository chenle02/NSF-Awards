This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program and the National
Facilities and Instrumentation Program will help the Department of Chemistry at
Columbia University acquire a SQUID based magnetometer. Among the areas of
chemical research that will be enhanced by the acquisition are the following:
(1) investigations of the transition temperatures and critical current densities
of metal-substituted and oxygen doped high-temperature copper oxide
superconductors; (2) studies of the effects of metal substitution on the charge
density wave and superconducting states in transition metal dichalcogenide
materials; (3) measurements of radical yields and investigations of radical pair
interactions in the photolysis of ketones on porous solids; and (4) studies of
magnetism in novel high-spin and chiral organic solids. A magnetometer measures
the force a material experiences when subjected to a magnetic field gradient. A
paramagnetic substance consists of molecular magnetic dipoles which tend to
orient themselves parallel to the direction of the field. The lining up of the
magnetic dipoles is opposed by the thermal motion of the particles, and in a
paramagnetic substance at room temperature only a small fraction of the
molecules have their magnetic moments aligned with the field. The measurement of
the volume magnetic susceptibility is positive for paramagnetic substances and
negative for diamagnetic substances. The magnetometer is useful in studying high
temperature superconducting materials, radical yields, and research dealing in
solid state chemistry.
