This Distinguished Research Fellowship is funded by the Office of
Multidisciplinary Activities of the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical
Sciences. It will involve research in the laboratories of Professor B. Kasemo of
Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden.

The proposal focuses on a polymer molecule that is designed to change its
solubility in water upon the application of a light stimulus. This switchability
is used to promote reversible adsorption to a hydrophobic surface layer. The
fact that the stimulus is light allows the process to be patterned by
lithographic or holographic techniques. To demonstrate the intellectual merit of
this project, this proposal outlines a biosensor which can be switched on and
off through the use of this molecule. The biosensor will consist of detector
molecules that are anchored by the polymer to a lipid bilayer that is supported
upon a quartz substrate.
