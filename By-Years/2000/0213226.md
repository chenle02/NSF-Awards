The focus of this research is the development of synthetic methodology using the
allenic Pauson-Khand reaction to prepare cross-conjugated trienes via a formal
Alder-ene reaction. The scope of the reaction will be determined and the
resulting information will be used to guide the synthesis of complex molecules
having interesting biological properties. The research will also lead to a
better understanding of transition metal catalyzed carbon-carbon bond forming
reactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular
Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Kay M. Brummond of the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Pittsburgh. Professor Brummond will
focus her efforts on the use of transition metals for the development of new
strategies for the construction of molecularly complex and biologically relevant
compounds. Carbon-carbon bond forming reactions with an emphasis on the allene
functional group will be emphasized. The methodology has potential impact for
the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries and the project is an excellent
vehicle for the training of graduate students.
