9503854 Gonsalves This Americas Program award will support Dr. Kenneth Gonsalves
of the Institute of Materials Science of the University of Connecticut in a
research collaboration with Dr. Ramiro Perez Campos of the Institute of Physics
of the Universidad Autonoma Nacional (UNAM) at Cuernavaca, Mexico. The
researchers intend to characterize and investigate the properties of
nanostructured materials. These novel materials, which include M50 type steels,
are of increasing interest to the aerospace and related industries in North
America. The research will focus on the principles of metal-organic chemistry
and materials processing concepts. Researchers at the University of Connecticut
will emphasize chemical processing and consolidation aspects, while the group at
UNAM will focus on the microstructural characterization of powders and
consolidated samples via X-ray and electron diffraction, as well as lattice
imaging by high resolution transmission electron microscopy. It is expected that
the complementary efforts of the synthesis group at the University of
Connecticut and the microscopy group at UNAM will strengthen and promote long-
term scientific interactions. ***
