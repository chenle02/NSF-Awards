NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION&lt;br/&gt;The focus of the research is to develop an
understanding of more complicated oxide surfaces which are important for a range
of applications such as in ferroelectric devices, catalysts or fuel cells. At
present relatively little is known about this class of oxide surfaces. The
target is to develop predicted tools by combining theoretical calculations with
unique methods of determining how the atoms are arranged at the surfaces. The
intent is that in the future we can avoid trial-and-error methods of determining
the best oxides for these applications, instead being able to predict and
therefore design the best oxides. This has the potential, for instance, to lead
to much more efficient water-splitting photocatalysts which would have a large
impact on future energy needs and reduce carbon-dioxide production. The research
will also help support both local outreach to high-school students in the
Evanston area as well as international outreach efforts via workshops in the
developing nations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION&lt;br/&gt;The
primary focus of the proposed work is to study the surfaces of more complicated
strongly-correlated electron oxides. The target is to determine how to
understand and explain the structure and thermodynamics of the surfaces using a
combined experimental-theoretical approach exploiting unique UHV electron
microscopy facilities and new DFT methods. The proposed research will be a step
towards establishing the scientific underpinnings of the use of strongly
correlated oxide surfaces for applications such as in fuel cells or for
photocatalytic splitting of water. The research will also help support both
local outreach to high-school students in the Evanston area as well as
international outreach efforts via workshops in the developing
nations.&lt;br/&gt;
