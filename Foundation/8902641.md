The project will concern mathematical logic and its connections with other
areas of mathematics, especially algebra and analysis. C. Ward Henson will study
the model theory of the exponental function and will apply nonstandard analysis
and techniques from model theory to the study of Banach spaces and other topics
from analysis. In addition, he will attempt to determine the computational
complexity of various specific first-order theories and to characterize those
theories which are computable in polynomial space. He will also investigate
highly homogeneous structures and their groups of automorphisms. Carl Jockusch
will work in classical recursion theory and in particular will study the degrees
of unsolvability of diagonally nonrecursive functions, relative recursive
enumerability, and recursively enumerable degrees relative to which certain
permitting arguments may be performed. Lou Van den Dries will study algebraic
decision problems such as the word problem for commutative rings and the problem
of finding generators for the group of units of a finitely generated commutative
ring. He also will continue his work on definability in algebraic-analytic
structures. Some of the investigations will refine the techniques of
mathematical logic, and some will apply them to questions often viewed as
theoretical computer science or as algebra. Jockusch's work will be of the
former kind, while a portion of Henson's and of van den Dries' work will be of
the latter. For example, Henson will continue to assess the relative complexity
of different mathematical theories and will seek ways to recognize easily ones
with lower measures of complexity.
