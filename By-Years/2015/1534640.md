Since the early 1970s, life imprisonment without the possibility of parole
(LWOP) -- an extreme prison sentence under which a person convicted of a
criminal offense is ineligible for administrative release during natural life --
has emerged as a routine legal sanction and penal practice in the United States.
Yet while LWOP is a normal and expanding part of American punishment, just how
it came to be so has not been carefully articulated or explained.

This project investigates LWOP's rise and continued expansion along several
lines. First, the project examines historical uses of life sentencing in America
as a means of identifying how LWOP is unique. Second, the project analyzes
LWOP's current use, charting patterns in session laws and sentencing statistics
across the fifty states and the federal system. Third, the project uses
comparative state-level case studies to interrogate existing hypotheses that
attribute LWOP's emergence to death penalty abolition efforts or mass
incarceration policies: drawing from legislative history, judicial precedent,
executive records, media coverage, and archival material, the project explores
the state-level conditions and decisions responsible for differences in the
sanction's timing, target, and intensity.
