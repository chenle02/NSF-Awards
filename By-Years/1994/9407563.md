This research focuses on behavior of the solvent to understand nucleation,
cluster formation, and solute-solvent structure in aqueous supersaturated sugar
solutions and the relationship of these to crystal nucleation and growth.
Fluorescent probes at very low concentrations will be utilized for this purpose.
The "tailor-made" probes are to contain sugar moieties to ensure their
participation in solute aggregation phenomena. Bulk nucleation experiments will
be conducted with the fluorophores as probes of glucose and sucrose
crystallization.
