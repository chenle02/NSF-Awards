Design of today's electronic systems would not be possible without the tools
that automate the process of integrating billions of nano-scale components--e.g.
into the "brain" of an iPhone. As technology advances towards mobile devices
that are smaller yet more powerful, these tools need to evolve as fast as the
systems that they help design--in fact faster, because the nano-scale components
not only grow in numbers but also shrink in size, bringing along with them new
challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To improve existing design-aid tools, a new
window of opportunity has arisen due to the emergence of a more powerful yet
affordable computational platform: a network of multi-core computers working
together as if it were one enormous machine. By leveraging this platform the
proposed research investigates alternative design automation strategies which
traditionally were deemed to be too time-consuming. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
focus of the research is to improve an important step of the design process
known as global routing, the step in which designers plan how the billions of
nano-scale components will be interconnected on the chip. This planning can
significantly impact the severity of many issues in subsequent stages of the
design cycle, yet it has to be done quickly. With the aid of large-scale
parallelism provided by grids, the research aims to demonstrate that the use of
a computational technique called integer programming, which was previously
viewed as too time-consuming for global routing, can help generate significantly
higher quality solutions while meeting practical runtime
requirements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Successful completion of the research
contributes to faster delivery of electronic products to market with lower
design cost, resulting in stronger businesses that can initiate new projects in
the technology sector, and hence in the creation of more jobs.&lt;br/&gt;
