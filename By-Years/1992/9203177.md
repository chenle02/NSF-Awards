An invitational workshop with national and international experts is planned to
review and discuss current practice, research needs, and emerging technologies
in structural connections for buildings. The workshop will focus on the needs
for the construction industry in the three areas of steel, concrete, and mixed
(steel and concrete) construction. The planned workshop would encourage a
crossover of knowledge among disciplines. Connections represent one of the key
challenges in advancing the technology for structural systems. The purpose of
the planned workshop is, therefore, to identify those opportunities and
challenges in the connection area which will make a difference in the 21st
century and which require a carefully planned and nationally coordinated
approach for realization or a solution. The workshop will include a review of
today's connection technology and discuss the emerging and required technologies
for steel, concrete and mixed connections. A combination of plenary sessions and
breakout sessions will be conducted. A few selected keynote presentations will
be made to set the stage for the breakout sessions.
