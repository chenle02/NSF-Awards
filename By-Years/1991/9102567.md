The objective of this research is to develop a new interactive tool for the
kinematic design of single and multi-degree of freedom spatial mechanisms and
robot systems. The goal is to provide a designer the ability to identify the
dimensions of a spatial linkage which guides the movement of a workpiece in
three dimensional space. Spatial mechanisms are now found primarily in the form
of robot manipulators. Mechanical hands, walking machines, and multi- armed
robot systems are examples of more complicated spatial mechanisms that will be
impacted by this research.
