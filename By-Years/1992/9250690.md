The project develops a teaching facility which utilizes commercially available
computer and analytical instrumentation, expands the number of students with
hands-on access to micro- analytical systems, and allows for future expansion of
techniques covered and students served. The undergraduate science and
engineering laboratory facility consists of a computer workstation/analysis
system and twenty student terminals. Analytical instruments are interfaced to
the system, including a scanning electron microscope. This facility allows
hands-on access to both live-time and stored, archived data and increases the
efficiency in learning techniques, contents, and methods of the many diverse
fields requiring or benefitting from microanalysis.
