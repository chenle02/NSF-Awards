The Northeast Big Data Innovation Hub will speed innovation and research by
creating an ecosystem for a diverse group of researchers and practitioners to
learn from each other. The Hub will encourage collaboration through workshops,
visiting research positions, student ambassadors, virtual meetings, research
projects and an online web presence, and facilitate sharing of data, tools,
infrastructure, techniques, and insights to address challenges using big data.
It will also facilitate the development, collection and organization of
educational materials and learning opportunities for teachers in pre-K through
high school. To communicate the importance of big data in everyday life, the Hub
will work with museum educators and curators to develop materials and exhibits
on this topic and share work already being done across the region. Finally, the
Hub will develop programs for government and the general public on how to take
advantage of data analytics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scale of this project
will allow the hub to make substantial intellectual gains. By identifying shared
challenges and facilitating the deployment of human and financial resources,
solutions will be developed that can be applied to a range of research
questions, government and economic problems and that can be useful to society
generally. The Northeast Hub will be organized in a "hub and spoke model" with
common theme activities (connectors) that are centrally organized and spokes
that reflect regional interests aligned with national priorities. Initial areas
of focus, or spokes, will be: Health, Energy, Finance, Cities/Regions, Discovery
Science and Data Science in Education. Cross-cutting connectors will be: Data
Sharing, Privacy &amp; Security, Ethics &amp; Policy and Education. Topics of
importance to the northeast will be added to the Hub during the first three
years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For further information see the project web site:
