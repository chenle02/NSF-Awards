This award provides support to establish a COSEE West in the greater Los Angeles
area with a diverse mix of activities aimed at 1) enhancing regional awareness
of ocean sciences, 2) using ocean science as a vehicle to increase general
science literacy and 3) increasing the number of students who choose science and
ocean science careers. These goals will be addressed by through catalytic,
multi-faceted collaboration between the University of Southern California and
the University of California at Los Angeles with additional links to the Los
Angeles County Museum of Natural History and the greater Los Angeles school
districts. A distance learning partnership will be established with the College
of Exploration in Virginia. Activities will include an extensive professional
development and leadership program for science teachers, a community lecture
series, an ocean science web site, a college mentorship program and curriculum
development activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COSEE West has the potential to
enhance science education in a densely populated and diverse major urban area.
The program conveys a focused vision and a set of interesting plans for
incorporating ocean scientists and their research results into classrooms,
informal education activities and public outreach. Because of its focus on the
LA basin, this COSEE Center has the potential to have a major impact on science
education in school districts within the greater Los Angeles area.&lt;br/&gt;
