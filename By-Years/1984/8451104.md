Research is underway that is designed to provide information on the mechanisms
of the effects of applied and naturally generated electrical fields on the
stimulation, and on the optimal parameters of electrical stimulation for
prosthetic and therapeutic devices. This research area should have direct
application to problems concerning electric field effects on the development of
seizures in epilepsy. Several sophisticated techniques are being used, including
;itin vitro;ro brain slice preparations, current density analysis, and computer
models of nerve cells and neural networks, to accomplish the research tasks.
