Salt water at relatively low pressures and near super critical temperatures
appears to play a prominent role in sub>.>seafloor alternation process at
mid>.>ocean ridges. Experimental data for the solubility of key alternation
minerals, especially sulfides and aluminosilicates, however, are conspicuously
lacking for these conditions. The low pressure supercritical region of seawater
(3.2% NaCl) is characterized by physical parameters (density,dielectric
constant) which changes dramatically with slight change in pressure complicating
aqueous activity>.>concentration relations, mineral>.>fluid equilibria, and
theoretical models of rock>.>fluid interaction. Experiments are designed to
assess the solubility and reactivity of sphalerite and chalcopyrite, and
plagioclase and epidote respectively in pH and redox buffered, NaCl fluids in
the low pressure supercritical region. Results of the experiments will (1) allow
predictions of metal concentrations to be made from more sophisticated models;
(2) define the role of chloride ion controlling fluid pH; and (3) specify phase
relationships of minerals that can measure temperature and/or pressure at
mid>.>ocean ridges.
