This project aims to develop accurate and robust ultrahigh temperature
microsensors for in situ measurement of heat-flux and dynamic pressure inside
turbine engines for power generation and aircraft propulsion. The proposed
sensors are based on a new class of high-temperature multifunctional materials
recently developed in PIs? laboratory at University of Central Florida (UCF).
The materials, named Polymer-Derived Ceramics (PDCs), possess a unique
combination of excellent high-temperature durability, micromachinable
capability, and tunable electronic properties, thus suitable for harsh
environmental applications. In order to develop the necessary knowledge base,
which will lead to the successful development of novel high temperature
microsensors and sensing systems for turbine engine systems, the following
research tasks will be performed within this three-year project: (i) developing
capability for fine tuning the electronic properties of PDCs, (ii) optimally
determining micromachining conditions for PDC sensors; (iii) modeling, designing
and fabricating heat-flux sensor and dynamic pressure sensor; and (iv)
characterizing the performance and high-temperature stability of the fabricated
sensor. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will be conducted by an
interdisciplinary team consisting of expertise in the fields of materials
science, micromachining, and sensor design/characterization. Experts from
related local industries will also be involved in sensor performance
evaluation&lt;br/&gt;
