The field of differential geometry is the study of curved objects, and this
project focuses on the use of geometric evolution equations or `flows' to
understand these objects. More specifically, these equations govern
mathematically-defined processes that smoothly modify objects in a way that is
driven by geometrically meaningful quantities such as length, area, volume or
curvature. The equations that the PI studies have very nice regularity
properties, in the sense that bumpy objects often become smoother as they
evolve; in fact, it is reasonable to expect that the object will gain more
symmetries as the flow proceeds, and this will help us better understand the
class of geometric objects we started with. Unfortunately, these equations also
have the potential to develop singularities in finite time, meaning that the
solution may acquire sharp points and corners, and one cannot expect in general
to have a smooth solution to the equation for a long time. In order for us to
achieve our ultimate goal, and better understand the underlying geometric object
using the flow techniques, we need to understand how to deal with singularities
that may arise. These and similar topics have been the subject of several
workshops in geometric analysis at Rutgers University organized by the PI
(together with colleagues), attracting many graduate students and featuring both
research talks and advanced graduate-course level lectures.

One of the aims of this project is the classification of ancient solutions to
nonlinear geometric flows, such as, the Ricci flow and the mean curvature flow.
The PI proposes to combine the PDE techniques and geometric estimates to study
the ancient solutions of such flows. Their classification is crucial for better
understanding the singularities that occur in finite time. Ancient solutions to
the two-dimensional Ricci flow describe trajectories of the renormalization
group equations of certain asymptotically free local quantum field theories in
the ultraviolet regime. The PI will classify ancient closed non-collapsed
solutions to the three-dimensional Ricci flow, which would settle down a
conjecture stated by Perelman in one of his papers. The PI shall also find
minimal conditions that guarantee smooth existence of a solution to the Ricci
flow and the mean curvature flow. The PI also wants to understand singularity
formation in the following sense: what the stable singularity models in four
dimensional Ricci flow are. This is related to understanding the singularity
formation of a four-dimensional Ricci flow starting at generic initial data.
