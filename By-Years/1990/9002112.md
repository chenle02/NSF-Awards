The primate Family Cheirogaleidae is classified within the suborder
Strepsirhini which includes both lemuriform primates from Madagascar and
lorisiform primates from Africa and Asia. The exact placement of the
Cheirogaleidae, which are found only in Madagascar, has been a problem for some
time. Traditionally they have been placed with the other Madagascar primates,
largely on a biogeographic basis. Most recent classifications, however, place
them with the African/Asian lorisiform primates, largely on the basis of
features in the base of the skull. This proposal addresses the question: are the
cheirogaleid primates more closely related to the lemuriform or to the
lorisiform primates? A number of data sets, including anatomical, embryological,
and genetic information will examined to determine their relationships. The
clarification of cheirogaleid affinities will be significant for at least three
reasons. A classification is necessary that is commensurate with phylogenetic
relationships. An understanding of the sister-group relationships between
cheirogaleids and other strepsirhines is necessary to determine the effects of
homology versus convergence. And, if cheirogaleids and lorisiforms are more
closely related it will confirm that multiple migrations between Madagascar and
Africa must have occurred during the history of the primates.
