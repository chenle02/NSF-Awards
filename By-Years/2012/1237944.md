GHz PHONONIC CRYSTAL
DEVICES&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective:
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal targets the development of a new class of
GHz nanoscale phononic crystal (PC) devices that will be employed to understand
and engineer the fundamental properties of low loss acoustic materials at the
nanoscale, demonstrate acoustic functionalities such as tunneling, waveguiding
and multiplexing and synthesize miniaturized radio frequency (RF) signal
processors that are not attainable with state-of-the-art micro/nano mechanical
(M/NEMS) resonators. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The main merit of
this proposal consists in devising a transformative class of acoustic devices
simultaneously capable of high Q, direct matching to 50 Ã™ and unprecedented
functionalities such as frequency multiplexing in a significantly reduced form
factor than what is currently possible with RF components. Furthermore, the
project will enable some transformative advancement at the fundamental physics
level by developing experimental tools for the understanding of phonon-phonon
interactions at frequencies close to and above the phonon relaxation
time.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The PI will be involved in
organizing educational activities with local high schools in Philadelphia, with
special attention to underrepresented minorities. The collaborative effort
between the PI's laboratory and the West Philadelphia schools will allow high
school students doing research in the PI's laboratory to learn more about
cutting-edge science and technology. Undergraduate students will be involved in
research activities via research positions and summer REU programs. The
fundamental discoveries enabled by this project will be included in the current
graduate course the PI is teaching. Finally, the PI plans to involve the general
public by presenting his research findings at the Penn Nanoday.
