This award supports the Particle Physics Group of Jawahery and Roberts at the
University of Maryland to study the physics of heavy flavor and CP-violation at
the LHCb Experiment at the LHC Collider at CERN, Geneva, Switzerland. The
Maryland group is a new institutional member of the collaboration and will be
making both technical and analytical contributions to the experiment in its
current configuration, and forthcoming upgrades. The technical focus for the
current experiment will emphasize tracking software and flavor tagging,
operations and data analysis and, for the upgraded experiment, tracking and
particle identification. The analytical focus will emphasize the group's
expertise in CP violation studies of charm decays and loop-dominated B meson
decays. Broader impacts of the program include engaging high school students and
undergraduate students from underrepresented groups in science in hands research
in the group's Photo Detector Laboratory on the campus in College Park,
Maryland.
