This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop and
demonstrate a MEMS-scale integrated microfluidic fuel injector for small
internal combustion engines to improve their efficiency. This will allow the use
of these engines in small autonomous aircraft for long endurance science
missions. The development of a high efficiency engine with a microfluidic fuel
injector will allow long range missions to be flown. The long range, long
endurance capability of the unmanned air vehicles (UAV) hinges on the
availability of a suitable high efficiency engine: the MEMS fuel injector
enables complete burning of the micron-sized fuel droplets, thereby boosting
fuel efficiency. The cleaner burning also results in reduced emissions. The same
technology can be applied to larger engines as well for other applications.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Work is ongoing with several university groups and federal
agencies to develop UAVs for scientific and tactical missions. The microfluidic
injector developed in this effort can also be modified and made available for
other manufacturers' engines. It can be used to improve fuel efficiency, and
reduce emissions on other small engines, such as those used in garden tools, and
recreational/sport vehicles. The spin-off applications of the core microfluidic
ejection technologies include: biomedical and chemical sampling and delivery,
direct writing and packaging for electronics/optoelectronics manufacturing,
solid freeform fabrication, optical device fabrication, advanced spraying
techniques, electronic chip and board cooling, etc. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
