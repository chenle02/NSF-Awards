This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project investigates the use of
an innovative mixing technique for chemical processes. The problem is that in
many processes, high viscosity and chemical reactions that cause changes in
phase interfere with mixing the reagents together, resulting in a poor product
and wasted reagent. The opportunity is to develop an innovative mixing technique
in which multiphase phenomena dramatically enhance the mixing of viscous and
chemically reacting fluids. The objective of this research is to investigate and
demonstrate this process and apply it for industrial use. Phase I will show the
feasibility of this approach by performing research to prove theories for the
mixing mechanism. Understanding the physics of the mixing mechanism is the basis
for design methods for mixing equipment demonstrated in Phase II.
