This project aims to serve the national interest by expanding the Tribal College
and University (TCU) Advanced Manufacturing Network Initiative to include four
additional TCUs through the delivery of an online advanced manufacturing course
series. The project is increasing access to advanced manufacturing and other
STEM training for the American Indian and Alaskan Natives (AI/AN) population by
developing a shared low cost model. Through coordination and existing
organizational networks, all 37 of the TCU's will have access to the completed
programming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The American Indian Higher Education
Consortium (AIHEC) is establishing the Advanced Manufacturing Technician
Education Network of nine TCUs that offer advanced manufacturing technician
education through delivery of an online advanced manufacturing course series.
The project provides a model for delivering career and technical education
programs to multiple institutions through a distributed education model. The
distributed program design brings together a team of faculty and support staff
available to participate in Advanced Manufacturing curriculum development,
training and education, activities, and includes implementation of an online
learning platform that provides AI-curated content, access to remote data and
virtual labs, and customizable for a wide range of pedagogical applications. In
addition, the project proposes to employ Indigenous problem-based learning
strategies in a culturally relevant model to engage, retain and aid students in
successful completion of the program. This project is funded by the Advanced
Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for
the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's
economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
