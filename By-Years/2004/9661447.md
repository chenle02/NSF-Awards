This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is directed at
developing a new technique to model the area affected by strong thunderstorm
winds using the newly available NEXt generation weather RADar (NEXRAD) Doppler
data. Other than hurricanes and tornadoes, thunderstorms are the largest
producer of direct wind damage in the United States and dominate the extreme
wind climate over much of the country. These locally intense storms have
complicated structures with significant changes in the surface wind speeds and
directions within the storms. As the storms move across the country they can
cause wide spread damage. The current state of the art in the climatological
modeling of the storms involves the use of the relatively sparse network of
surface anemometer records of wind speeds produced by thunderstorms. This sparse
network of wind speed measurements does not allow modeling of the total area
affected by the damaging winds. The research will seek to model the thunderstorm
gust fronts and regions of intense local winds using separate and distinct
methods. The approach will couple surface level anemometer measurements and
NEXRAD data to develop a technique to estimate surface level wind speeds given
NEXRAD data. The approach described in the proposal is unique, and if successful
will yield the only model able to estimate the total wind induced damage
produced by these storms. The potential areas of commercialization for the
technology are primarily in the insurance and power utility industries. Both of
these industries are interested in risk management and improved ways for
estimating and reducing potential damages. The integration of the thunderstorm
model with wind damage models already developed by the firm could lead to unique
products of interest to these industries as well as others.
