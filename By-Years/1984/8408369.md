This research project focuses on the generic problems of identifying and
managing the causes and consequences of uncertainty in Water Resource System
Planning, Design, and Operations. The objective is the development of better
methods and approaches that integrate consideration of uncertainty into
management decision making. Derived probability distributions for system outputs
are investigated and, where possible, derived for system outcomes. Surrogate
distributions or indicators are investigated where it is not possible to derive
the probability distributions. The integration of such probability information
into a decision making process is approached from simple analytic integration of
probability functions and damage functions to more complex models of management
decision- behavior.
