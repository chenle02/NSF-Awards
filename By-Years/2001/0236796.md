0236796 Tackley

This grant will support the acquisition a 144 CPU Beowulf cluster of PCs for
performing numerical experiments related to understanding convection in the
mantle and the outer core. Many individual projects fall under these themes,
with mantle convection investigations focusing on compositional differentiation,
melting, and plate tectonics, and core investigations focusing initially on a
joint numerical-laboratory study of magnetoconvection. The cluster will also be
used for teaching purposes and will be open to other members of the Earth and
Space Sciences Department and national and international collaborators of the
UCLA Geodynamics group. ***
