Dr. Wu will continue his laboratory measurements of low temperature absorption
cross sections of molecules of interest in the study of planetary atmospheres,
comets, nebulae, and interstellar clouds. The measurements are made in the near
visible through the ultraviolet region of the spectrum. The pressure,
temperature, and relative abundance of the sample of gas of interest will be
chosen to simulate realistic planetary conditions. Accurate knowledge of photo-
cross sections of relevant molecular systems is essential for understanding the
dynamics of photochemical processes in our atmosphere and those of the other
planets. Dr. Wu's measurements deal with the spectral range where there is
plenty of radiation from the Sun, and they are extremely relevant for the
interpretation of phenomena occurring in planetary atmospheres that are
stimulated by ultraviolet radiation.
