Christine E. Evans is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program
to study the effects of pressure as a variable on the binding constants of beta-
cyclodextrin complexes and to determine the effects of pressure on
chromatographic retention and selectivity of such complexes. Such host-guest
interactions form the basis for liquid chromatographic and electrophoretic
separations of difficult positional isomers and enantiometric species. Liquid
chromatographic, nuclear magnetic resonance, and fluorescence measurements will
be used to examine the pressure effects. Capillary electrophoresis at high
pressure will be explored and also used in the measurement of the pressure
dependence of these complexation reactions. This work explores the use of
pressure as a variable in the chemistry and separation of complexes involving
beta-cyclodextrin. A better understanding of the solution chemistry of these
complexes and improved methods for their separation has the potential to impact
positively on the preparation of pure pharmaceuticals and other compounds which
are needed in a high state of chemical purity and structure sameness.
