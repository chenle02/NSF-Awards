The Peromyscus (Deer Mouse) Genetic Stock Center, established in 1985 as an
outgrowth of a pre-existing research animal colony, contains 28 well-
characterized mutant lines and several stocks of "wild-type" animals
representing three species. Live and preserved animals, fresh tissues and other
materials derived from Peromyscus are provided to the scientific community as a
national resource. This project will allow expansion of the Center to include
live stocks of three additional species as well as molecular materials of
Peromyscus origin. The Center will be extended to include any genetic resources
relating to Peromyscus, including purified nuclear and mitochondrial DNA,
molecular probes, genomic and cDNA libraries, cell lines, skins of variant
types, photographs, research and pedigree records and publication reprints, all
of which will be available from this central source. The Center will also add at
least six behavioral mutant lines, and will establish a backup colony at a
remote site in case of a catastrophic disaster. Current services and activities
of the Center, including distribution of live and preserved Peromyscus,
publication of a newsletter, and service as a repository of historical
materials, will continue.
