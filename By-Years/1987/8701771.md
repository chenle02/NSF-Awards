This research will focus on the connections between the geometry of the closures
of conjugacy classes of reductive groups and the characters of groups of
rational points of reductive groups over finite fields. It should provide a
better understanding of the peculiarities occurring over fields of small
characteristic. This research is concerned with problems in the area of
algebraic groups. More specifically, the principal investigator will considered
questions about conjugacy classes of reductive groups and representations of
finite reductive groups. This is an active area in mathematics and the results
will contribute substantially to the overall picture.
