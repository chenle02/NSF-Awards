A workshop on "Embedded Software" was held October 8-10, 2001, in Tahoe City,
California. The purpose of the workshop was to incubate a research community in
embedded software. There were 35 invited presentations at the workshop, with
national and international speakers from both academia and industry. The
presentations covered all aspects of embedded software, including operating
systems and middleware, programming languages and compilers, modeling and
validation, software engineering and programming methodologies, scheduling and
execution time analysis, communication protocols and fault tolerance.
