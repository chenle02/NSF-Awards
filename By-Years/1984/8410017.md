This award will support the proposed Joint Symposium on Refined Modeling of
Flows and Turbulence, to be held in Iowa City, September 16-18, 1985. The
symposium is intended to bring together international specialists on numerical
modeling of flows in complex geometrics, and international researchers and
modelers in flow turbulence.
