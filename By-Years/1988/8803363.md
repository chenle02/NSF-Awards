The equipment requested is to be shared between three laboratories. Each of
these laboratories is prominent in the use of advanced laser diagnostics in
their respective fields. A common theme of their work is the use of light
scattering from laser sheets to determine the structure of flames and flow
field, respectively. Due to the low speed of the present camera system, only
single-shot experiments or very slow flows have been possible. With the Spin
Physics Camera, the evolution of turbulent flames in internal combustion
engines, three-dimensional concentration and velocity fields in gaseous jets,
and mixing studies in liquid flows may all be studied due to its high speed.
This system possesses also the advantage over conventional movie cameras that
quantitative, digital data is obtained. The results obtained will be invaluable
to the understanding of engine combustion, flow field structure, and mixing
processes.
