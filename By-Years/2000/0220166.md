Proposal Number: 0220166&lt;br/&gt; Title: ITR/SY Features, Components, and
Legacy Systems&lt;br/&gt; PI: George T. Heineman, Computer Science Department,
WPI&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; A legacy system is any software system that is in use
and must evolve&lt;br/&gt; to meet changing conditions. These systems must be
re-engineered&lt;br/&gt; because over time, the ability to evolve the system
decreases with&lt;br/&gt; each successive maintenance. The proposed research
combines the&lt;br/&gt; concepts of features and software components in a novel
way to&lt;br/&gt; extract feature-based software components from a
legacy&lt;br/&gt; system. First, the features of the target legacy system are
elicited&lt;br/&gt; and using existing code profiling tools, the code associated
with&lt;br/&gt; these features is identified. This task is made possible by
the&lt;br/&gt; regression test suite that many legacy systems already have to
ensure&lt;br/&gt; proper functioning as the system is upgraded. Second,
software&lt;br/&gt; components are refactored from the legacy system. In short,
the data&lt;br/&gt; generated by execution traces is analyzed for evolution
purposes.&lt;br/&gt; The research will provides a viable long-term strategy for
an&lt;br/&gt; organization to incrementally modernize its software code base.
A&lt;br/&gt; reengineering methodology will be defined and applied. A&lt;br/&gt;
corresponding cost/savings model will be developed based upon&lt;br/&gt;
preliminary success with the legacy system for a financial&lt;br/&gt; company.
The methodology will be packaged and disseminated to ensure&lt;br/&gt; other
organizations with legacy systems can easily benefit from the&lt;br/&gt; results
of this research.
