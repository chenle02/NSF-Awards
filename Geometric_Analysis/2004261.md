This project will study singularity formation of some special geometric
structures governed by non-linear partial differential equations. These
structures are generalizations of solutions to the Einstein?s equation for
gravity and Maxwell?s equation for electromagnetism, and play significant roles
in modern theoretical physics (for example string theory and M-theory). The
solution to these problems will enhance the understanding of deep interaction
between various research directions in mathematics. In the meantime, there are
many interesting related questions that may serve as research projects for the
training of graduate students interested in this area.

The PI will study problems in two specific directions. First, the PI would like
to study collapsing of Calabi-Yau metrics, and connections with algebraic
geometry and moduli compactification. Previous work of the PI and collaborators
has yielded a satisfactory description in the case of minimal degenerations and
the PI proposes to study the more general situation. This requires exploiting
the existing techniques from collapsing theory, and further developing those.
Secondly, the PI will study singularity analysis for Yang-Mills instantons. In
the case of Hermitian-Yang-Mills connections over Kahler manifolds, recent work
of the PI and Xuemiao Chen gives a complete algebro-geometric description of the
tangent cones, and the PI wants to push these further by discovering more
refined structures, and by investigating the case of G2 instantons. This
requires building algebro-geometric framework, as well as extending some of
these to the more analytic setting.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
