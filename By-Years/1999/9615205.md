Following the direction provided by the XVIII Antarctic Treaty Consultative
Meeting (1994), the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) issued a
Call for Proposals to Operate an Antarctic Master Directory for a period of at
least five years. The International Centre for Antarctic Information and
Research (ICAIR) was selected by SCAR and the Committee of National Managers of
Antarctic Programs (COMNAP) to establish and operate the Antarctic Master
Directory (AMD)on behalf of the various national programs. Using the basic
format of NASA's Global Change Master Directory (GCMD) which is part of an
existing International Directory Network, ICAIR will design a data model for an
Antarctic Data Directory System. An integral component of this model will be
development and dissemination of a Directory Interchange Format (DIF) consistent
with existing international data networks but expanded to better enable
description of data sets that are unique to Antarctic research. ICAIR will also
establish links with National Antarctic Data Centers (NADCs), supporting them
and other groups collecting Antarctic data, and coordinating the Antarctic DIF
with them. The DIF developed will be disseminated to all NADCs for their use in
managing Antarctic research data information. The AMD is envisioned as a meta
data center with World Wide Web links to the NADCs and serving, at least
initially, as a repository for information about the data held by the NADCs.
