The Physics Department at Kalamazoo College is upgrading the laboratory
component of an upper-level majors course, Optics and Wave Motion. Optics
experiments are being performed on optical breadboards, using rugged and
reliable components and hardware. A Macintosh II computer is linked to
experiments through a GPIB bus so that it controls the apparatus, takes and
analyzes the data, and presents the results in a useful form. In addition to
handling optical signals via a photodector, the computer system functions with
acoustical inputs through a high-speed digitizer. Commercial software permits
students to present instructions to the computer with a modest investment of
time for programming, as this consists largely of manipulating icons on the
screen. The laboratory offers quantitative experience with wave concepts, from
acoustics and optics, and including Fourier analysis, in such a way as to
reinforce the lecture portion of the course. At the same time it provides skills
that are used in modern research and introduce techniques that are rarely
accessible in the undergraduate physics curriculum. The college is matching the
award with an equal amount of funds.
