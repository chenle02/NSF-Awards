In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry
Division, Bernheim will use polarized laser radiation in five studies. In one
experiment, the effect of optical orientation of a reagent species on chemical
equilibrium will be examined. Light-induced drift will be studied in another
experiment in order to sort and spatially trap species in the gas phase. Other
experiments will deal with molecular polarization pumping, relaxation of
orientation and alignment, and infrared polarization-labeling spectroscsopy of
polyatomic molecules. %%% Bernheim's experimental program uses polarized light
to study the effect of optically induced orientation on various properties of a
molecular system. For example, the equilibrium concentrations of species can be
changed by exciting one of the reagents with polarized light. Studies such as
those under investigation in this project, when coupled with theoretical
analyses and comparisons, will go a long way towards understanding the dynamics
of excited atoms and molecules.
