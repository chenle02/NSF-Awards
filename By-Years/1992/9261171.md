This project focuses on urban emergency services, particularly police and
emergency medical services (EMS). Private emergency repair services and, to some
extent, urban fire protection services are also relevant to the research. The
goal is to undertake a set of research steps to make the "Hypercube Queueing
Model," truly useful for emergency services decision makers. In particular, this
research will incorporate into the Hypercube model the most recent trends in
police and EMS dispatch operations, such as those emerging from community-
oriented policing. Four public agencies, in four states, have agreed to serve as
test sites and to provide data to the researchers for this project. The
Hypercube model will undergo a set of enhancements that will make it compatible
with community-oriented policing, the EMS dispatch environment and other
important emergency response systems. The results could be of significant value
to municipal emergency services agencies in improving the productivity of their
response units.
