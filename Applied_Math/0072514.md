T. Healey and P. Rosakis plan to study various problems from solid continuum
mechanics governed by nonlinear partial differential equations. A major thrust
of the proposed work will be on the static morphology and dynamic evolution of
microstructure due to phase transitions in two-dimensional models of shape-
memory alloys. In contrast to well-known absolute, minimum-energy approaches to
the statics problem, we plan to employ modern techniques of symmetry-breaking,
bifurcation theory. The latter enables systematic determination of metastable
states, which we believe our ensuing dynamical studies will show to be
associated with hysteresis. Another aspect of the work will involve applications
of a generalized topological degree (developed previously by Healey & Simpson)
to global bifurcation problems of nonlinear elasticity - these will be the first
such results in three-dimensional elasticity. The overall goals of the work are
to detect new nonlinear phenomena, obtain constitutive restrictions that are
both physically and mathematically reasonable for general classes of materials,
and to develop new tools/approaches to such nonlinear problems - both analytical
and computational. The proposed approach comprises a blend of solid continuum
mechanics, materials science, nonlinear analysis, symmetry and group-theoretic
methods and computation.

The analysis of models of nonlinear materials at a very general level is
fundamental to the understanding of shape-memory effects in certain advanced
engineering alloys as well as more traditional engineering materials/structures.
The proposed investigation is strongly interdisciplinary, combining models and
techniques from mechanics, materials science and modern mathematics. Broadly
speaking the work will provide new mathematical approaches to difficult
nonlinear problems arising in structural/mechanical engineering and materials
sciences. This has the potentia of leading to a better understanding of material
behavior and design - including the design of "smart" structures.
