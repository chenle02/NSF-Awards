This award will support the participation of ~10 students and postdoctoral
researchers in a workshop focusing on developing strategies to achieve better
understanding of the history of the Greenland Ice Sheet. The workshop will be
held in the fall of 2011 in Corvallis, OR, and will include international
representation in the fields of glaciology, paleoceanography, marine geology,
and climate modeling. Funding provides the opportunity for young scientists to
get involved with and contribute to an interdisciplinary effort that may
eventually lead to a large-scale drilling program through the Integrated Ocean
Drilling Program. The opportunity for participation will be advertised in widely
available newsletters and through disciplinary email listservs. Participant
support will be based on applicants' statements of purpose and will target
under-represented groups.
