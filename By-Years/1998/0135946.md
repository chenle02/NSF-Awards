ITR/SY: Design and Simulation of Biologically inspired Nanolattice





This joint project between the University of Florida and Purdue University is
pursuing scientific principles for designing and engineering biologically
inspired neuromorphic computing architectures using radically new molecular
electronic devices and biologically inspired, ultra-dense, self-assembled
systems. Examples of applications of these architectures include unprecedently
small and inexpensive nanoscale intelligent sensors. The architectures can be
used to implement neurocomputing models and are well suited for
nanotechnologies, thus accelerating the development of useful nanotechnology by
providing clear functional targets for nanodevices. The team of investigators
includes computer architects, neurocomputing experts and device physicists
working in close collaboration along three highly synergistic thrusts. One of
the two thrusts is focused on advancing the understanding of biologically-
inspired dynamic information processing systems in order to understand the
impact of constraints imposed by architectures and technologies on the
properties of these systems. Another thrust investigates neurocomputing system
architectures that can be engineered within the constraints of nanotechnologies.
The third thrust develops a toolbox of novel mechanisms for integration, self-
assembly and interconnection of nanoscale devices. The architectures are
investigated via formal methods and simulation. Internet resources are used to
conduct simulation, and to disseminate models, software and other research
results. A new course, summer internships and educational materials are being
developed to educate students on the key interdisciplinary aspects and results
of the project.
