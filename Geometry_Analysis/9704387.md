9704387 Calabi These conferences are in the general area of differential
geometry; the topics cover diverse areas including classical differential
geometry, geometric partial differential equations and complex differential
geometry. The investigators will continue organizing and holding the annual
geometry festival to be held at various locations in the east coast on a
rotating basis. The Festival has become an annual event for the east coast
differential geometers for the last decade. The Festival will bring together a
number of established researchers with junior investigators and students; it is
hoped that students can quickly gain an appreciation of the scope of current
research and learn of open problems. In 1998, in particular, the Festival will
be held at Stony Brook with an interdisciplinary theme. The 1998 meeting is to
be a two week conference dedicated to the theory of connections and its
applications in mathematics and physics. 3
