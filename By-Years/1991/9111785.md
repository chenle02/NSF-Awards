This is a grant for research equipment to be used in research on
microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). The overall objective of this research is
the development of a new class of actuators, sensors, and spatial light
modulation devices, built on the integration of micro-chip sensing elements with
moving mechanical elements. In some devices, sensory feedback and model-based
dynamics are employed in order to control small object (0.5 to 500 microns).
Specific applications include small sensors to measure strain, deflection,
pressure, angular displacement, and force; small sensors constructed to detect
inertial parameters such as acceleration and roll rate; small,
electromagnetically levitated elements whose orientation can be controlled so
that they function as reflecting micropositioners for modulation of light beams;
and small microactuators for cutting or imaging; and large-scale actuators built
from micron-scale components.
