The general objective of this research is to develop understanding of the
mechanisms operating in higher plants to regulate the biosynthesis of
diterpenoid metabolites that contribute to a plant's ability to survive
environmental and biological stresses. The focus is on the regulation of
cyclization enzymes that catalyze the first committed step of the pathway
leading to a physiologically active diterpenoid metabolite(s), and thus is a
logical site for regulation. One target enzyme is casbene synthetase, which
catalyzes the synthesis of the putative phytoalexin, casbene, in castor bean
seedlings. The casbene synthetase gene is transcriptionally activated in
response to treatment of the seedlings with pectic fragment elicitors. Genomic
clones containing casbene synthetase coding sequences have been isolated. A
major goal of the research is to characterize the casbene synthetase gene and
the cis- and trans-acting factors that participate in the transcriptional
activation of the gene in response to pectic fragment elicitors. These
investigations are of importance in connection with plant disease resistance
since phytoalexins are among the defensive components that appear in a
resistance response. Another experimental target is kaurene synthetase, a key
regulatory enzyme in the pathway leading to the gibberellin family of regulators
that help mediate environmental influences on plant growth and development. A
major objective is to purify kaurene synthetase to homogeneity, and to use the
purified protein to prepare specific antibodies and kaurene synthetase cDNA
probes. These probes will be used to measure kaurene synthetase mRNA levels in
plant tissues, and changes in their levels under different environmental
conditions, as an indicator of their relative potentials for gibberellin
biosynthesis.
