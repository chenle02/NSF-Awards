Proposal Title: PECASE: Analysis and Design of Discontinuity-Driven
Bifurcations&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award focuses on the analysis and design of
nonsmooth dynamical systems, characterized by abrupt and discontinuous changes
in the systems' properties, and commonly encountered in mechanical, biological,
and electronic models. Of particular significance are the potentially dramatic
changes in character and stability of motions of such systems that occur at the
onset of weak interactions with the environment, here referred to as
discontinuity-driven bifurcations. For example, in the case of human gait,
premature, low-velocity ground contact of the swing foot may result in loss of
stability of the sustained gait and subsequent fall, particularly in individuals
with muscular disorders or the elderly. The objectives of this project are to
develop a comprehensive predictive methodology for discontinuity-driven
bifurcations of recurrent and transient motions and to formulate design criteria
for reducing or eliminating the detrimental effects of unintentional collisions
between a mechanical subsystem and its surrounding environment -- in particular,
the prevention of fall-related injury due to premature ground contact during
gait. The research work will closely integrate with an effort to develop a
closed-ended-design course at the junior level emphasizing performance
verification tests for mechatronic systems and the evaluation of a system's
response in the presence of smooth and discontinuity-driven
bifurcations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project was originally funded as a
CAREER award, and was converted to a Presidential Early Career Award for
Engineers and Scientists (PECASE) award in September 2004.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
