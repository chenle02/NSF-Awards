The proposed conference "I. M. Gelfand Centennial conference: A view of 21st
century mathematics" will be held at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
on August 28 - September 2, 2013. It will be a major gathering of mathematicians
working in a large variety of fields, which will review some of the most
significant advances in mathematics since the turn of the century, and
commemorate the late I. M. Gelfand, a giant of modern mathematics, on the
occasion of the centennial of his birth. The speakers at the conference are
mostly mathematicians who have obtained fundamental results in the last ten
years in areas that would be have been of interest to Gelfand, but not
necessarily close to his work or the work of his students.

I. M. Gelfand was one of the geniuses who laid the foundation for the main ideas
of modern mathematics. He also created a unique school known for its breadth,
open-mindedness and originality. The success of Gelfand's school was based on
his remarkable ability to discover talented young students, to educate them, and
to work in harmony with young and established researchers. The conference will
continue this tradition by attracting outstanding mathematicians and will
include many graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. The latter groups will
especially benefit from the broad spectrum of the topics and big ideas to be
presented at the conference. The slides of the talks and other conference
information will be disseminated through its website, which will allow the
discussed ideas to reach a wide audience throughout the world. The conference
website is available at http://math.mit.edu/conferences/Gelfand/index.php
