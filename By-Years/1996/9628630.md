9628630 VASERSTEIN The Department of Mathematics at the Pennsylvania State
University will purchase workstations to be dedicated to the support of research
in the mathematical sciences. Primary attributes of the multiprocessor
workstation are fast integer performance and large main memory. Particular
research projects which are proposed are in automated reasoning and theorem
proving, left-distributive algebras and cryptology, solving for rational points
on cubic curves, and determining global convergence properties of discrete time
dynamical games. Methods involve integer, floating point, symbolic and algebraic
computations.
