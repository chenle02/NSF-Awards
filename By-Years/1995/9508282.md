ABSTRACT: NCR-9508282, University of Southern California, "Algorithmic Theory of
Universal Source Coding with a Fidelity Criterion and Related Topics", PI-Zhang:
This project addresses the question "Can one design an on-line universal
sequential source coding algorithm for lossy source coding?" What is meant by an
on-line universal sequential lossy algorithm is that such an algorithm is
sequential, achieves in one pass the rate-distortion limit, and has a short
delay, good adaptivity, and relatively low coding complexity, so that it is
suitable for on-line implementation. It will be necessary to study the basic
properties of a universal lossy source coding algorithm, and this will require
the development of systematic methods for algorithm analysis such as the
analysis of the redundancy of an algorithm, the analysis of the robustness and
coding complexity of an algorithm and other topics.&lt;br/&gt;******************
