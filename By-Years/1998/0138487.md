This is a U.S.-East European workshop on algebraic geometry and geometric
modeling that will be held in Lithuania. The principal investigators are Dr.
Ronald Goldman from William March Rice University and Professor Rimvydas
Krasauskas from Vilnius University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Algebraic geometry has
in the past affected and in the present continues to affect the progress of
geometric modeling and computer aided design. The purpose of this workshop is to
provide an opportunity to disseminate new trends and techniques in algebraic
geometry to the geometric modeling community. The Lithuanian mathematicians and
computer scientists have taken the lead in investigating applications of toric
varieties to geometric modeling. These applications are largely unknown in the
U.S. and Western Europe and this workshop will serve as an effective mechanism
for promoting and disseminating this work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop in
mathematics and computer sciences fulfills the program objectives of bringing
together leading experts in the U.S. and Central/Eastern Europe to combine
complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and
competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.
