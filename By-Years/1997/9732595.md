9732595 Johnson The goal of the 1998 REU project at Gustavus Adolphus college is
to nurture the development of underrepresented individuals in the geological
sciences. Eight undergraduate women will conduct field and laboratory research
to determine the character, origin, and history of Pleistocene deposits in
south-central Minnesota. Four of the women will be selected from Gustavus
students; the other four from outside the institution. The individual research
projects are concerned with till stratigraphy of south-central Minnesota,
genesis of late-Wisconsin till (possible deforming-bed till) and its underlying
boulder pavement, geomorphology and origin of surface features of the Des Moines
Lobe, and character and sedimentology of tributary outwash streams compared to
deposits of River Warren (outlet to Lake Agassiz). These projects will require
the participants to learn and apply various geologic research techniques
including outcrop description, laboratory analysis, map analysis, and
statistical analysis on the computer. ***
