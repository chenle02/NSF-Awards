One of the most remarkable events in development of the nervous system is the
construction of the diverse and complicated array of neural circuits that
underlie behavior, from the simple circuit of a motor reflex to the complex
circuits that underlie learning and memory. The research objective of this
project is to understand how neural circuits are initially established during
development and how they are modified by sensory experiences. Specifically, the
goal of this project is to identify the patterns of neural activity that act to
stabilize newly formed circuit connections in the mammalian brain. Advanced
imaging techniques and electrophysiology will be used to stimulate individual
synaptic connections and to monitor their strength and stability, in order to
identify those activity patterns that lead to stabilization of neural circuits.
Neural activity patterns that lead to increase in the strength of individual
synaptic connections are expected also to lead to stabilization of circuit
connections. Results from these experiments will advance our understanding of
the mechanisms by which neural circuits are established and stabilized during
development of the nervous system. In addition, this research project will
provide training opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students in
the laboratory. The educational objective of this project is to develop an
outreach program at UC Davis in order to advance public awareness about the
progress and benefits of brain research and to encourage grade school students
to choose scientific career paths. This program will serve to increase
participation in outreach activities from a large and diverse group of
undergraduate and graduate students with the goal that these students will be
encouraged to continue outreach activities throughout their scientific careers.
