This project is building an Open Archives Initiative (OAI) compliant federated
digital library with an emphasis on physics for the National Science,
Mathematics, Engineering, and Technology Education Digital Library (NSDL). This
physics digital library will federate holdings from the physics e-print server
arXiv (http://arXiv.org), Physical Review D from the American Physical Society
(http://prd.aps.org), and the collected holdings from the Technical Report
Interchange (TRI) project (http://egbert.cs.odu.edu/tri/html/). TRI includes
reports from the NASA Langley Research Center, Los Alamos National Laboratory,
and the Air Force Research Laboratory. Other holdings are being imported from
the Arc project (http://arc.cs.odu.edu).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To federate
collections with varying degrees of richness of metadata elements poses a number
of challenging questions, which the investigators are addressing, in the areas
of resource discovery, creation and maintenance of harvested metadata, and
economic sustainability. Regarding resource discovery:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(1)
How do we enable users to search across diverse collections within one common
interface without losing the ability of searching with richer metadata elements
for collections that support them?&lt;br/&gt;(2) How do we address the lack of a
uniform controlled vocabulary?&lt;br/&gt;(3) How do we map the user's view of
the domain into the metadata models of the participating
archives?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Regarding creation and
maintenance:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(1) What is the most effective way of keeping
the metadata between data providers and the federation service consistent almost
all the time? Are the current OAI protocols sufficiently developed and robust
enough to support the consistency?&lt;br/&gt;(2) How do we address the dynamic
nature of the collections?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Office of Multidisciplinary
Activities in NSF's Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences is
providing significant co-funding for this project in recognition of its emphasis
on developing collections and services in the area of physics.&lt;br/&gt;
