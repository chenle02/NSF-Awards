The goal of this research is to investigate highly parallel preconditioning
techniques for solving general large sparse linear systems of equations. Of
particular interest are systems that arise from the discretization of partial
differential equations on unstructured grids. The focuses on efficient
preconditioners which scale well when number of processors is very large. In
this situation, the standard incomplete factorization preconditioners are not
satisfactory. The project investigates a number of non-standard alternatives
which emphasize approximations based on ``high level of accuracy.'' These are
similar to ILU factorizations with high level of fill-in. Many of the parallel
preconditioners, suffer from the disadvantage that entail a larger number of
iterations than standard preconditioners to achieve convergence. This often
outweighs potential gains arising from the higher degree of parallelism.
However, recent experience suggests that increasing the of the preconditioner is
a good strategy for achieving faster execution by reducing the number of
iterations. The use of multi-coloring techniques is also investigated.
