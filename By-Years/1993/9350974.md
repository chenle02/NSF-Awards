The purpose of this proposal is to acquire new equipment for the analysis of
genes and proteins, thereby modernizing and revitalizing the Genetics course in
the Biology Department at Ursinus College. In addition, the equipment will allow
the inclusion of more challenging experiments in the Evolution course, and the
expansion of opportunities for student research.We will revise and update the
laboratory component of the Genetics course by teaching the indispensable,
fundamental principles of Genetics, supplemented by auxiliary lessons which deal
with the history of genetics, knowledge of sexual and asexual organisms needed
for genetics research, and the acquisition of technical and experimental design
skills necessary for careers in science. Such skills will encourage and better
prepare students for an independent undergraduate research experience, an
opportunity which the Biology Department desires to provide to all majors.The
equipment requested will permit us to teach several new principles in our
Genetics and Evolution courses, enhance the student research program, and better
serve the unprecedented numbers of Biology majors we have had the good fortune
to attract to Ursinus College.
