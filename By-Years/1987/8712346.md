The objective of this research is to understand the behavior of electrons at
interfaces, in glasses, and in other structures where crystallinity is either
absent or reduced, and thereby explain structural, vibrational, and electronic
properties of many materials. This will be done by extending the Recursion
Library, a collection of Fortran programs for solving the equations of
electronic motion in non-crystalline materials, to gausssian basis sets, to
applications of the local density approximation, and to applications of the GW
method for calculating excitation energies of solids. The recursion method will
be applied to the theory of small circuits, electronic states near interfaces,
surface adhesion in layered compounds, and the effect of dirt on the
bandstructure of a crystal. The new idea of a conserved momentum in certain
glass structuress will be explored. The understanding of electronic structure
and its consequences in non-crystalline materials is an important step in the
development of quantum mechanics and in the technological application of these
materials.
