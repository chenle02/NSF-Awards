0343198 &lt;br/&gt;Josephson &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Humans presumably lived in
small-scale hunting and gathering groups for most of our history, but few do so
today. Modern human behavior was shaped in circumstances far more like those
seen in modern foragers than in economically complex, densely populated groups.
While the ethnographic record is comparatively rich in descriptions of the
social and cultural lives of foragers, few of these groups have also been
studied quantitatively. Recent theoretical developments have focused attention
on the economics of foraging and its influence on demographic and social
patterns, but opportunities to study this are rapidly vanishing. This research
is a pilot study of a Namibian group called the Tjimba, who have experienced
only sporadic contact and little study over the last century. The Tjimba live in
northwest Namibia in one of the last remaining wilderness areas in Africa, and
apparently make their living through foraging, some rudimentary gardening, and
occasional wage labor. This project will conduct a census of the Tjimba, collect
reproductive and genealogical histories, and compile information about
subsistence behavior, seasonal movement, and settlement pattern. The objective
is to examine how subsistence affects such things as where people live, when and
whom they marry, how many children they have, and how long they live. This will
form the foundation for a long-term study of this group. &lt;br/&gt; The broader
impact of this study will be to expand our understanding of the economics of
foraging and how acquiring food influenced the development of our species.
