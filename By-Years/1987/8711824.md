Experiments and theoretical analysis will be carried out to study the fluid
mechanics and stability of the planar-flow melt-spinning process, a technique
with promise for widespread commercial use in the rapid solidification of molten
metals. Data will be obtained steady-state flows and their dependence on process
operating parameters for ranges of practical interest; this will enable accurate
prediction of macroscopic ribbon geometry. The stability of the steady flows
will be tested against disturbances in flow-field and meniscus; this will enable
prediction and control of ribbon surface-quality. Experiments will test
predictions of the theory and guide the analyses.
