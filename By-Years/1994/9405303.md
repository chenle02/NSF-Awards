This pilot project will enable a very competent young investigator to describe
a number of important fossil hominids from Indonesia. These have been known for
a long time, but not described competently. These human fossil ancestors are
critical in testing ideas concerning hominid evolution in Australasia. These
fossils may or may not prove to be related to more recent human populations in
that area. This joint international effort will also establish professional
relationships between archeologists and paleoanthropologists in three countries:
Indonesia, France, and the United States.
