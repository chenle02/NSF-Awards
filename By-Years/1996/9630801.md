ABSTRACT CTS-9630801 Amon This work is a fundamental investigation of heat
transfer and flow phenomena in microcasting. The spreading and solidification of
molten metal droplets impinging on a surface will be modeled numerically and
tested experimentally. Remelting of the solid substrate by the impacting
droplet, modeling of dissimilar materials with potential simultaneous melting
fronts, and modeling the continuous droplet/substrate system conjugately will be
addressed. Spectral element direct numerical simulations of the governing
thermo-fluid equations will be verified by experiments. Applications of this
technology include manufacturing of multi-layer materials, artifacts with
controlled microstructures, and artifacts with embedded electronic components.
