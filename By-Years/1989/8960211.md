Silicon aluminum oxynitride, commonly called SiAlON, is an industrial ceramic
used in cutting tools, dies, chemical ware, containers for molten metals,
bearings, gun barrels and a variety of engine components such as gas turbines,
diesels, etc. It has high toughness, high strength, reasonable hardness and good
oxidation resistance and thermal shock resistance. It is produced through the
insitu reaction of its constituents Si3N4, AlN and Al203, plus sintering aids.
The solid state reaction can take up to hours to produce a solid block of SiAlON
which is then ground into powder. The properties and reliability of the SiAlON
are affected by the starting materials, their particle size and purity as well
as processing temperature and time. The purpose of this Small Business
Innovation Phase I it to produce a high purity and closely controlled particle
size SiAlON powder to be used in the production of high strength components,
eliminating the need for the insitu reaction process. The PIs plan to develop an
inductively coupled plasma synthesis process for the direct production of a high
purity SiALON powder. Screening reactions will be performed to select the
optimum plasma frequency and precursor to product SiALON powder. The synthesis
process will be optimized with the produce SiAlON powder consolidated for
property valuation and comparison to insitu produced SiAlON. A model will be
developed for the synthesis reaction to directly produce SiAlON powder.
