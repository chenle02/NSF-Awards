The auditory nerve contains thousands of fibers from single nerve cells
(neurons), carrying information from the ear to the brain. A sound stimulus that
is a single tone has the properties of frequency (pitch) and intensity
(loudness). The normal environment is full of far more complex sounds, and in
many cases the intensities of various parts of a complex sound change rapidly
with time. Such fluctuations in sound intensity produce dynamic or transient
responses in auditory neurons which carry important information in complex sound
stimuli such as speech. This proposal explores how the auditory system may have
specialized mechanisms to process dynamic responses and may extend the dynamic
operating range compared to the steady-state range of hearing. A novel technique
of sinusoidal amplitude modulation is used along with electrophysiological
recording of single neurons and with the newly-discovered modulation-following
response, which is a compound response. Results will be important for models of
how the sound information is transmitted from receptor cells in the inner ear to
the nerve cells of the auditory nerve and so to the brain. The results will have
an impact beyond auditory neuroscience to sensory neuroscience in general
because of the importance of coding mechanisms, and may become applicable not
only to hearing disabilities, but to communications technology and artificial
speech recognition devices.
