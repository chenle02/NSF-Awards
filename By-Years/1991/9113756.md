This proposal is part of an integrated scientific investigation to study the
properties of the Arctic ocean, atmosphere, sea-ice and biology in the Northeast
Water (NEW) Polynya, which occurs near northeastern Greenland, in order to gain
an integrated understanding of Arctic shelf-slope processes. This element of the
NEW program will characterize the structure and function of benthic communities
inside and outside the polynya. Grab and trawl samples will be taken to test
hypotheses that benthic biomass and density are greater inside compared to
outside the polynya. The role of benthic organisms in the flux or organic
material between pelagic and benthic systems and in the transfer of energy from
the benthos to higher trophic levels is central to this study.
