A grant has been awarded to Brigham Young University (BYU) for the acquisition
of a next-generation DNA genome sequencer. The sequencer will have three primary
uses at Brigham Young University. 1) Promote and enhance the scope of research
capability to a large group of researchers on and off campus; 2) Provide state-
of-the-art equipment training and familiarity to a large group of undergraduate
and graduate students involved in NSF, NIH, USDA, and university-sponsored
mentored research experiences; and 3) Increase and enhance the involvement of
student researchers in data analyses and bioinformatics that will be useful to
them after graduation. The breadth of impacted research includes plant and
animal systematics, nematode co-evolution, crop improvement, conservation
biology, molecular ecology, and novel algorithms for genome and transciptome
sequence assembly. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The instrument will be housed in the
College of Life Sciences DNA Sequencing Center (DNASC). In the DNASC, it will
provide opportunities for students to gain real-world experience with modern
equipment and to gain training through current and enriched courses. Student
involvement in scientific research is greatly enhanced by additional support
from the University in the form of Mentoring Grants and from the College of Life
Science in the form of in-class genomics projects. For faculty, the instrument
will provide high throughput DNA sequencing capacity for cutting-edge biological
research as well as open collaborative opportunities in the intermountain west
(Great Basin) and throughout the world.
