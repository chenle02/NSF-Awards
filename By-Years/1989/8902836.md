The principle objectives of the program are to examine pressure induced
structural transformations and low frequency vibrational modes in chalcogenide
glasses. The principle methods employed will be Mossbauer spectroscopy and
optical absorption studies. Measurements will be performed as a function of
hydrostatic pressure in the range 0<P<100 kbars using a miniature Diamond- Anvil
cell. The Mossbauer experiments as a function P will be performed on specific
glasses like GeSe2, GeS2 and As2S3. Low Frequency Vibrational modes in 119Sn
doped GeSe2, GeS2 glasses will be probed by studying the Mossbauer T-dependence
of the Debye-Waller factors (f-factor), which are known to yield the first
inverse and second inverse moment of the vibrational density of states.
