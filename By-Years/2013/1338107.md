This project involves the development of an enhanced instrument to study the
composition of trace gases in the atmosphere. The new instrument will be able to
detect a large suite of atmospheric constituents (>100 compounds) at very low
concentrations over short time periods (samples are collected over 25-seconds).
The instrument can be used at the surface and all the way to the lower
stratosphere, as well as in both polluted and clean environments. This new
instrument will enhance our understanding of gas phase chemistry and is likely
to lead to new insights on related air quality and climate issues.

A trace organic gas analyzer (TOGA) will be coupled to a time-of-flight (TOF)
mass spectrometer. The development of the TOGA-TOF involves the construction of
a new inlet and cryogenic sample concentrator, integration of the high
resolution TOF, and optimization of the integrated system to maximize its
qualitative and quantitative capabilities. The TOGA-TOF will be an analytical
system capable of providing comprehensive VOC measurements throughout the
volatile range (C2-C12 and possibly higher) at reasonable acquisition rates (1
minute). The suite of volatile organic compound measurements quantified by the
instrument will be enough to improve understanding and modeling of the
photochemical state of the atmosphere.
