9409215 Filipowski This research is aimed at constructing linear programming
algorithms that provide approximate solutions when inexact data is used. The
algorithms will initiate the solution process by assuming zero values for some
coefficients so as to lessen the degree of data accuracy required to solve a
problem instance. The algorithms will be implemented, tested, and compared with
the performance of interval analysis based algorithms. The results obtained from
this research will be used to develop new computational complexity theory that
incorporates the use of inexact data in solving linear programming problems.
Understanding the complexity of solving problem instances given only an
approximation to the data of the instance to be solved will lead to the
development of algorithms that can solve more efficiently, a wide variety of
engineering problems.
