A 250 MHz Fourier transform nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer will affect
both lecture and laboratory courses. Lecture courses will present the
theoretical basis of FT-NMR spectroscopy and introduce various applications.
Laboratory courses will provide practical experience in operation of the FT-NMR
and extensive practice in interpretation of spectral data. Routine operation of
the FT-NMR and analysis of typical proton and C-13 spectra, including two
dimensional H,C correlation spectra, will be stressed in the organic chemistry
laboratory. Junior level courses will introduce variable temperature FT-NMR to
learn conformational analysis, and physicochemical parameters will be extracted
from NMR spectra. Seniors will learn to obtain more complex spectra such as DEPT
and APT. They will gain practical experience with the NMR of other nuclei
including B, Ga, Fe, Mo, N, and P together with other NMR-active metallic
elements. The grantee will match the NSF award from non-federal sources.
