*** 9622403 Ehsani Fiber Reinforced Composites, FRP, are fast becoming a viable
new construction material. Perhaps the most suitable area of application for
these materials is in the field of strengthening, repair and rehabilitation of
existing civil structures. A major concern, however, is the quality control at
the time of construction and the long-term behavior of these materials. The
primary focus of this study is to develop a Non- Destructive Evaluation system
for determining the characteristics of composites used in the construction
industry. The equipment can be utilized after the completion of the construction
to monitor any deterioration or delamination of the FRP which could result from
environmental effects such as ultraviolet rays, moisture penetration, etc. The
quality of rehabilitation will be monitored nondestructively by ultrasonic
inspection of internal defects, voids and delaminations. In this research
"kissing" and "slip" bonded interfaces, often dangerous for the integrity of
material systems, will be investigated by exciting strong interface waves. It is
expected that one will be able to successfully detect these defects by
generating interface waves at the imperfect bond interfaces using an ultrasonic
scanner. ***
