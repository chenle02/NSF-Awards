Abstract

A D-brane, roughly, is something on which an open string may end. Any detailed
exploration of this notion quickly reveals that the rough notion is too crude,
and that all of the subtleties of the geometry of string theory come into play
in full force in describing D-branes. The proposers will investigate both the
mathematical and physical properties of D-branes, drawing upon techniques from
algebraic geometry (particularly complex threefolds), homological algebra, and
derived categories on the mathematics side, and on quantum field theory and
supergravity from the physics side. The proposers anticipate that the study of
the complementary mathematical and physical aspects of this story will shed
light on each other, and that new results in both pure mathematics and
theoretical physics will be obtained as a consequence.

This study is part of a broader exploration of the mathematical aspects of an
important current theme in theoretical physics: modeling the particles and
forces of nature using one-dimensional objects ("strings") instead of the
traditional zero-dimensional objects ("points"). Physical models of this kind
are quantum-mechanical in nature but also model the gravitational force, thus
reconciling one of the great puzzles in theoretical physics (namely, the
apparent incompatibility of quantum mechanics and Einstein's theory of gravity).
One of the important discoveries of the past decade is that strings may have
endpoints which are constrained to lie in particular directions. The places
where the endpoints of strings "attach" are known as D-branes, and these will be
the subject of detailed mathematical study in the current project.
