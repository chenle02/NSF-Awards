0439124&lt;br/&gt;Keasling&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will
examine the mechanisms regulating mRNA stability, translation, and protein
synthesis in multi-gene operons. It will develop a new method for balancing the
expression of multiple genes in operons. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI has
developed expression systems that allow for the introduction of secondary
structures between the transcription and translation sites of heterologous genes
to protect the mRNA from endonucleolytic cleavage resulting in increases in both
mRNA and protein levels. There are many unknowns in mRNA degradation and a
better understanding of the control of mRNA stability in multi-gene operons is a
worthy objective that may result in the discovery of new mRNA degradation
mechanisms.. This work will use laboratory techniques to evolve the desired
levels of expression of multiple genes in an operon and/or new stability
determinants for mRNA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This technology may find use for the
production of multi subunit proteins such as used for vaccines.&lt;br/&gt;
