This award supports cooperative research in the geochemistry of early volcanic
rock to be conducted by Charles Stern of the University of Colorado at Boulder
and Michael Dobbs of the University of Santiago, Chile. The work will involve
field mapping and chemical analysis of Pliocene and early Quaternary Andean
volcanic rocks near Santiago. These rocks were formed at the boundary between
two distinct segments of the Andes across which important north to south
differences occur in the angle of Pacific plate subduction, in spatial and
petrochemical characteristics of recently active Andean volcanos and in
significant geologic and tectonic features. The study will refine the
understanding of the temporal and spatial relationships between the changing
features near the north-south segment boundary, of Andean magma genesis and of
the economically significant copper mineralization developed during Pliocene
volcanism. In addition to the scientific results, this project allows for a
significant international interchange and the training of graduate students from
both the United States and from Chile. Also, it provides an opportunity for
participation of the Chileans in the advanced analytical chemistry in Colorado.
This kind of training and participation is an important feature of the Science
in Developing Countries program.
