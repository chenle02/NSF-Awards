North Carolina Agricultural and State University, in collaboration with Auburn
University, propose to investigate the potential of a novel program that uses
design and development competitions to impact the underrepresentation of women
and African-American students in computing. The program will involve students in
a year-round set of activities, including coaching, practice sessions, and a
series of intercollegiate meets. It will culminate in a Software Design and
Development (SDDTT) tournament. The project will determine whether these
activities have the potential to increase the retention of students by (1)
enabling them to see how concepts covered in classes are used in practice in the
real world, and (2) integrating them into a community that provides a sense of
belonging and the opportunity to contribute to something larger than a class
assignment. The project will explore the initial development of an SDDTT
approach, assessing its impact in particular on the attitudes and retention of
women and African Americans in computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
