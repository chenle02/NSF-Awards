The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will continue the scientific planning
and management of the Coastal Ocean Processes (CoOP) research initiative. CoOP
planning is being undertaken by a group of scientists dedicated to organizing
large scale efforts in interdisciplinary coastal ocean basic research. CoOP
includes representation from biological oceanography, chemical oceanography,
geological oceanography, marine meteorology and physical oceano- graphy.
Previous planning support has resulted in the publication and circulation of a
major planning document: "Coastal Ocean Processes: A Science Prospectus".
Through a series of workshops and the deliberations of a scientific planning
conmmittee, this follow-on activity will start to define the actual process
studies and long-term measurements to be made.
