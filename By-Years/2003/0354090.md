The University of Alabama-Tuscaloosa establishes an interdisciplinary Research
Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site. The REU Site is affiliated with the
Center for Materials Information Technology (MINT), an NSF-funded Materials
Research Science and Engineering Center. Ten undergraduate students are
recruited every year for a ten-week summer research experience, with a student
recruitment focus on underrepresented minorities and students from the
Southeast. Students participate in a variety of research projects within the
physical sciences and engineering, with a focus on the study of magnetic
materials for information storage. In addition, students participate in weekly
seminars, on-campus social activities and give presentations on the results of
their work towards the end of the summer.
