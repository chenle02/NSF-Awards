This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I research project initiates the
development of a new class of wireless miniature smart sensor labels that
continuously track and record exposure to the environmental conditions, and
directly store the sensed data in digital Complementary Metal Oxide
Semiconductor (CMOS) non volatile memory without requiring any battery. These
batteryless CMOS-sensor micropackaged chips track temperature, humidity and
shock/vibrations. The sensor chip embedded in a standard passive radio frequency
identification (RFID) inlay forms a multi-sensor environmental condition
tracking wireless device that can be deployed in a scalable RFID network.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact will be on enabling new markets and
industries to be formed around this innovative, low cost and small form factor
distributed wireless sensors for the existing live biomaterial delivery and
blood plasma market segments. Commercial delivery logistics is another large
potential market.&lt;br/&gt;
