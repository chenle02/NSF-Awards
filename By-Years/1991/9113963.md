This proposal is part of an integrated scientific investigation to study the
properties of the Arctic ocean, atmosphere, and sea-ice on a transect between
Murmansk, USSR and Nome, Alaska. There are few published measurements of biomass
or production from most shelf and basin regions of the Arctic Ocean. This
project is one of four that will evaluate biological processes in the Arctic
Ocean during the cruise. This research will measure the distribution, abundance
and rates of carbon incorporation by phytoplankton in geographically diverse
regions of the Arctic Ocean. It will examine the factors regulating rates of
production and the partitioning between exportable and total production large
spatial scales.
