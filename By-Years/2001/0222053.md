ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OCE-0222053&lt;br/&gt;OCE-
0222046&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the gross features of atmospheric dust
transport and deposition to the ocean are well established, major uncertainties
remain on the effective solubility of the iron in the dust entering the ocean
and the effects of these deposition on the distribution and speciation of iron
in the upper ocean. A PI from the Bermuda Biological Station for Research and a
PI from the University of Delaware will participate in two cruises to a site
near BATS during summer months to obtain atmospheric and water column samples
when dust inputs are at peak values. Atmospheric samples (precipitation and
mineral aerosols) will be analyzed for total-dissolvable Fe and Al, as well as
readily-soluble Fe and Fe(II). Seawater samples from the upper water column will
be analyzed for total-dissolvable Fe and dissolved Fe and Fe(II) in the
dissolved (&lt;0.4 um) colloidal (0.4-0.03 um) and soluble (&lt;0.03 um) phases.
Results from this work will be used to determine the effect of atmospheric
depositions on the distribution, speciation and biological availability of iron
in the upper ocean. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
