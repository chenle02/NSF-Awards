This project deals with mechanical tolerancing in design. Tolerances play an
important role in precision engineering. The quality, reliability and cost of
products manufactured depend very much on the tolerances prescribed. This
project seeks fundamental understanding of the relation among process
capability, nominal dimensions and tolerances in mechanical design. Two problems
are considered: (1) Can tolerances be rationally assigned (synthesized) given
nominal design dimensions, process capabilities, and cost structure? (2) Can
nominal dimensions be synthesized from process capabilities and constrains?
These two problems will be formulated conceptually as non-linear optimization
problems by developing the explicit modeling, numerical approximation, and
computation structure. The research thus addresses the crucial issue of
quantifying the quality of a design from the geometric and computational points
of view by relating tolerances, nominal dimensions, costs, and process
capability. The concurrent ability to rationally allocate (during the design
stage) and trade off among tolerances in manufacturing, assembly and operation
promises both a drastic shortening of the current design lead time, and a more
efficient manufacturing environment.
