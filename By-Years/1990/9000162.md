Rich animal communities fueled by carbon producing microorganisms are known
from a variety of reducing habitats at the deep-sea floor including vents,
seeps, and organic-rich sediments; these habitats generally are linked to the
boundaries between plates and/or areas of high coastal productivity. During a
recent dive with the submersible, ALVIN, in the Catalina Basin, scientists
discovered a community fueled by a novel source of reduced carbon compounds ---
the skeleton of a 20-m long whale. Preliminary evidence suggests that whale
remains may provide persistent and abundant reducing habitats with faunal
communities similar to those of seeps, vents and organic-rich muds. However, the
significance of whale-skeleton reducing habitats cannot be rigorously evaluated
without much better knowledge of at least: (1) the source and flux rates of
reducing compounds, (2) community composition (including vent-seep affinities),
and (3) community dynamics (e.g., persistence times) associated with these
carbon rich microbial systems. This research will provide a descriptive and
experimental program, using the Catalina Basin whale-fall as a case study, to
address these three topics.
