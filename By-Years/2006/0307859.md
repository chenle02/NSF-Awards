&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AST-0307859&lt;br/&gt;Ellis&lt;br/&gt;This program will
support the collation of new ground-based data for large samples of galaxies
observed at various redshifts and look-back times with the goal of developing a
self-consistent observational story of how galaxies evolve and assemble to
produce the diversity of morphologies seen today. The way forward focuses on
determining the underlying mass of an evolving galaxy, both from internal
dynamics via ultra-deep Keck 10m spectroscopy and from deep infrared photometry
with the Palomar 5m telescope. This is a self-contained data set, which will be
used to trace the growth rate of distant galaxies and the movement of galaxies
from one morphological category to another. It is also a valuable addition to
the DEEP2 redshift survey already being conducted (with partial NSF support) by
Caltech and University of California colleagues. The team has unrivalled access
to the necessary telescopes and instrumentation, and will produce an integrated
picture of morphological evolution and assembly history, based on a sample a
hundred times larger than any currently available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
research includes graduate and undergraduate student training, useful spin-off
in the form of techniques for other researchers to use in their data analysis,
and will be intimately linked with a new public outreach program at Caltech
entitled Unravelling Cosmic History with Large Telescopes.&lt;br/&gt;***
