This project exposes students to the capabilities of a wind tunnel, modern
commercial fluid dynamics instrumentation, and the integration of a computer
into data acquisition, data reduction and control of experiments. Various fluid
dynamical principles are demonstrated and some physical characteristics of
turbulence are illustrated. A pilot turbulence laboratory course for
undergraduates, based entirely upon the wind tunnel, is introduced. In addition
to the enhancement of various courses, the facility is used for demonstrations
in a program for minority pre-college students.
