This project is a study of the effects of antarctic sea ice in the global
climate system, through an examination of how the spatial distribution of ice
and snow thickness and of open water is reflected in satellite-based synthetic
aperture radar (SAR) imagery. The field investigations will be carried out from
the RVIB Nathaniel B. Palmer in winter 1998 and summer 1999, and will produce
observations of the snow and ice distribution, the crystal structure, stable
isotopes, salinity and temperature structure of ice cores, and the stratigraphy,
grain size, and water content of the snow cover. The SAR images from ERS-2 and
RADARSAT will be acquired at the McMurdo ground station, and processed at the
Alaska SAR Facility. These will provide information about the large-scale ice
motion field and the small-scale ice deformation field, both of which contribute
to the observed ice thickness distribution. In addition, a study of the spatial
and temporal variation of the backscattered microwave energy will contribute to
the development of numerical models that simulate the dynamic and thermodynamic
interactions among the sea ice, ocean, and atmosphere. The surface data is vital
for the extraction of environmental information from the radar data, and for the
ultimate validation of interactive models.
