This Presidential Young Investigator award is to support the exceptional work of
Dr. Donald in robot motion planning. Although his undergraduate degree from Yale
was in Russian Literature, he quickly became proficient in higher mathematics
and computer science at MIT. His master's project produced the first implemented
planning system for continuous, collision-free motion of robot arms with six
degrees of freedom -- with a rigorous proof of completeness as well. He then
extended this work to the planning of error detection and recovery in uncertain
domains -- another influential contribution. At Cornell, Dr. Donald is now
developing a new graduate course in robotics while initiating research in
kinodynamic approximation algorithms for optimal robotic motion. He is also an
excellent speaker, able to communicate complex ideas in a straightforward
manner, and shows promise as an inspiring graduate advisor.
