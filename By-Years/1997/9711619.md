ABSTRACT ATM -9711616 Denning, A. Scott University of California, Santa Barbara
ATM- 9711619 Sarmiento, Jorge L. Princeton University TITLE: Sources and Sinks
of Anthropogenic CO2: Integrated Assessment Using Biogeochemical Modeling and
Inversion of Atmospheric Transport The major objective of the proposed work is
to provide a quantitative assessment of the current CO2 budget and develop new
models with more sophisticated integration of atmospheric, terrestrial, and
marine processes with anthropogenic emissions. Integrated multi-tracer inversion
calculations will be performed. This should provide a more accurate CO2 budget.
This study is unique in that it will develop calculations of sources and sinks
of CO2 using CO2 and its stable isotopic composition.
