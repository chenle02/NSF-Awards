This award will support a two-year U.S.-Japan cooperative science project
between Professor Richard Bersohn, Department of Chemistry, Columbia University,
and Professor Masahiro Kawasaki, Research Institute of Applied Electricity,
Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan. The project involves the study of reaction
dynamics using laser Doppler spectroscopy. New techniques in laser-induced
fluorescence detection will be developed using complementary experimental
techniques. Professor Bersohn specializes in laser-induced fluorescence and
Professor Kawasaki in multiphoton ionization.
