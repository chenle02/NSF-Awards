The ECR program of fundamental research in STEM education provides funding in
critical research areas that are essential, broad and enduring. EHR seeks
proposals that will help synthesize, build and/or expand research foundations in
the following focal areas: STEM learning, STEM learning environments, STEM
workforce development, and broadening participation in STEM. The ECR program is
distinguished by its emphasis on the accumulation of robust evidence to inform
efforts to (a) understand, (b) build theory to explain, and (c) suggest
interventions (and innovations) to address persistent challenges in STEM
interest, education, learning, and participation. The motivational context for
this project is that nearly all definitions of 21st century skills include some
aspects of collaborative problem solving. Often the skills associated with such
collaborations are treated separately. In this study the researchers will
investigate these collaborative problem solving skills interactively. The
research team will draw on process data automatically generated as students work
in the virtual environments that support the learning of circuit design and
electronics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical aspects of this research will
use data mining techniques and expert judgment to validate the inferences of the
PI team. In addition the project will engage two critically related components:
(1) the development of a generalizable schema that will measure student content
and collaborative problem solving (CPS) skills in computerized educational
environments, and (2) the construction and validation of diagnostic student
profiles generated by the schema.
