The International Congresses of Mathematical Education are the most important
forums for exchanges of scientific information among scholars in mathematics
education. The Seventh ICME will be held on August 17-23, 1992 in Quebec City,
Quebec, Canada. Given the current reform efforts in mathemaics education and the
emerging and expanding dialogue among international scholars in mathematics
education on curriculum, teacher education, and student expectations, it is
essential that the United States be well represented by key mathematics
educators and that information from the Congress be widely disseminated among
the nation's mathematics educators and educational leaders. The National Council
of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM), with the support of the Mathematical
Association of America (MAA), proposes to select 40 delegates to ICME-7and
provide them with a participation award to subsidize their costs in attending.
In return, each awardee will provide a written summary of Congress sessions they
attended. These reports, along with those of the Awards Committee and invited
papers by selected individuals, will serve as the basis for a monograph on
Congress Activities that will be published by the NCTM. Articles will be
prepared by the Awards Committee for NCTM and MAA newsletters (circulation over
100,000). Presentations will also be made at regional and national meetings of
both organizations. Additionally, materials on the reform efforts in the United
States will be shared with others at the Congress.
