To advance the use of novel technologies to increase student learning outcomes,
educational technology must be coupled with a deep understanding of how students
learn and retain information. Thus, technology and the learning environment must
work together to enable pedagogical approaches that promote student-centered
learning. To set a research agenda for the technology-enhanced learning
environment of the future, this collaborative project will conduct a series of
events that explore the Future of Innovative Learning Environments. These events
will include a series of interactive, online discussions followed by an in-
person workshop. Workshop participants will include twenty-nine expert
participants from academia, industry, and nonprofits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project aims to inform the future of learning environments in STEM higher
education. The project will consider the near-term and longer-term impacts,
opportunities, challenges, and future research initiatives related to the
development and implementation of innovative learning environments. This project
will include three components: 1) Interactive, online discussions (microlabs)
prior to the workshop will introduce participants to different innovative
learning environments and solicit feedback from a range of stakeholders; 2)
Participants at a two-day in-person workshop will engage in creative activities
that help them envision how innovative learning environments might transform
STEM higher education; and 3) the PIs and invited participants will synthesize
the discussions and produce a report that can guide
future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
