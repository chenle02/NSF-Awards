9362153 Lavid The objective of this project is to evaluate a process for the
treatment of hazardous waste streams containing chlorocarbons. It is based on
photo-initiated reactions induced by ultraviolet light that selectively cleave
the carbon-chlorine bond at moderate temperatures. This is a Phase I award based
on a proposal submitted in response to NSF 93-18, Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Program Solicitation. Results are expected to provide the
optimal conditions for application of this concept for use in design of a
prototype. The major commercial applications are expected to be in the hazardous
waste treatment industry. The proposed process is expected to provide a cost-
effective and environmentally benign process for destruction of chlorinated
organic compounds.
