Chance is a quantitative literacy course developed by the Chance Project at
Dartmouth with the help of faculty from other colleges and universities and
support from the National Science Foundation. The goal of this course is to
prepare students to better understand and critically evaluate current news that
involves concepts from probability or statistics. Because Chance deals with new
information and involve issues from a wide range of disciplines, it can be a
difficult course to teach without support. To assist those wishing to teach a
Chance course the Chance Project maintains a Database on the Web. The project
also provides a tri-weekly electronic newsletter that abstracts current chance
articles and provides discussion questions appropriate for a Chance course or
any other probability or statistics course the instructor wishes to enhance by
including real world examples. The Chance project has also developed new
teaching methods and activities to assist in understanding key probability and
statistical concepts that are required for understanding typical chance news.
The purpose of this workshop is to acquaint teachers with the Chance course, the
resources available to help teach a Chance course, and to give the participants
the experience of preparing and carrying out a typical Chance class.
