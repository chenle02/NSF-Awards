9301608 Mann The Solomon Islands is the only place on Earth where it is possible
to examine the tectonic effects of Mio-Pliocene shallow subduction of one of the
world's largest and thickest oceanic plateaus. This is a US-Japan cooperative
program to map crustal and perhaps upper mantle structures in the Solomon
Islands convergent zone. The primary objective of the multi-channel seismic
study is to test two models for the formation of the Malaita anticlinorium-the
deformed wedge of Cretaceous-Cenozoic pelagic limestone, basalt, and clastic
rocks that most previous workers agree to be an emergent part of the Ontong Java
Plateau. ***
