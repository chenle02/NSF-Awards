A unifying theme of this project is the emphasis on combinatorics and
computation. During the last decades, computation has gained an important role
in mathematical research. This stimulated the development of combinatorics, as
the various discrete structures it studies (such as graphs and partially ordered
sets) are particularly well suited for encoding and manipulating complex
mathematical objects. The PI will use combinatorial techniques in representation
theory (which is a fundamental tool for studying group symmetry, and which has
important applications in mathematics and beyond, e.g., to theoretical physics),
and in Schubert calculus (which has its origins in enumerative geometry, e.g.,
counting the lines or planes satisfying a number of generic intersection
conditions, but is currently related to modern areas such as quantum
cohomology). By developing and studying combinatorial models for certain
representations and related algebraic varieties, the PI will pursue efficient
related computations; furthermore, this work is expected to lead to a better
understanding of the mentioned mathematical objects and of the subtle
connections between them. Some of the models developed in the project will be
implemented in the open source computer algebra system SAGE.

This research project uses combinatorial structures and methods to solve
problems in two main areas: the representation theory of Lie algebras and modern
Schubert calculus on flag manifolds. An important avenue of this research is
concerned with the alcove model, developed by the PI in collaboration with A.
Postnikov; this is a combinatorial model for integrable highest weight
representations of symmetrizable Kac-Moody algebras, as well as for certain
multiplication formulas in the K-theory of flag manifolds. New applications of
the alcove model were given in recent work of the PI with S. Naito, D. Sagaki,
A. Schilling, and M. Shimozono. These highlight interesting connections between
Kirillov-Reshetikhin modules for affine Lie algebras, Macdonald polynomials, and
the quantum K-theory of flag manifolds. The PI will further explore some of
these connections. He will also pursue applications of the alcove model to
formulas for Whittaker functions on p-adic groups, which are a basic tool in the
theory of automorphic forms. In modern Schubert calculus, the PI will work on:
unifying and extending various combinatorial models for the Schubert structure
constants in ordinary cohomology, Schubert calculus beyond K-theory (e.g., in
elliptic cohomology), and combinatorial aspects of the geometric Satake
correspondence (which gives a geometric construction of irreducible Lie algebra
representations, based on the affine Grassmannian).
