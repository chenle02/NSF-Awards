This research aims to understand the exciting array of experiments at the Large
Hadron Collider (LHC) in Geneva and the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC)
in New York. Two particle correlation measurements and related fluctuation
studies can reveal space-time information about particle production and dynamics
not measured by single particle observables. The activity supported by this
award centers on an innovative program to develop theoretical tools for the
analysis of correlations in a hydrodynamic context. Applications of this
framework to transverse-momentum fluctuation data already provide a first
estimate of the shear viscosity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RHIC experiments exhibit a
striking "ridge" of enhanced correlations that has garnered substantial
interest. This ridge occurs both with and without a jet trigger, and is part of
a rich correlation landscape. We propose to apply our hydrodynamic framework to
understand this landscape at RHIC and LHC. These efforts promise to reveal
information on both early stages of particle production - the glasma - as well
as the later period of hydrodynamic evolution. This and similar work is driven
by data analyzed at Wayne State. Close collaboration with these experimenters
puts this theory group in an excellent position to understand and influence such
analyses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The colliders RHIC and LHC smash nuclei together,
producing a tiny fleeting soup of elementary particles called the quark-gluon
plasma. By studying the fluid characteristics of this plasma using mathematical
models, we hope to explain what is seen at these massive colliders. I'm
especially excited to be sharing this research with disadvantaged students in
Detroit through a program aimed at students who are studying to become teachers.
