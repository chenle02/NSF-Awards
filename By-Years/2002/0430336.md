&lt;br/&gt;Proposal CNS-0430336&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: New Complexity-
Theoretic Techniques in Cryptography&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Salil P.
Vadhan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research focuses on several powerful techniques
from computational complexity (the study of problems that are computationally
intractable) that they may help in addressing important open problems in
cryptography and security. These techniques include randomness extractors,
Nisan-Wigderson-type pseudorandom generators, complete problems,
diagonalization, and non-black-box use of an algorithm's code.&lt;br/&gt;The
efforts include both strengthening existing applications of these complexity-
theoretic techniques, such as doing cryptography with human-memorizable
passwords, mitigating the effect of key exposure, and biometrics; and seeking
new applications, especially to problems that have remained beyond the scope of
standard techniques in cryptography, such as proving the security of Fiat-
Shamir-type digital signatures, doing public-key cryptography from one-way
functions with no trapdoor, and understanding the extent to which obfuscation,
watermarking, and homomorphic encryption are possible. The research is
foundational in nature, yet it can impact a variety of problems of practical
interest in trustworthy computing.&lt;br/&gt;The research will be closely
integrated with educational efforts, through new courses developed at Harvard
and the involvement of both graduate and undergraduate students in the
research.&lt;br/&gt;
