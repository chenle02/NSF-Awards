As part of its overall strategy to enhance learning in informal environments,
the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program funds innovative resources
for use in a variety of settings. This education project is a time sensitive
opportunity related to the March 9, 2016 Total Solar Eclipse occurring in a
remote part of the world located in Waleia in the Federated States of
Micronesia, a U.S. affiliated Pacific Island nation. The path of totality is
only 100 miles wide and passes through only a few Pacific Island nations ending
in Hawaii. This project uses this unique phenomenon to educate a large US and
international audience about solar science using multi-platforms with integrated
video, social media, and public programs. Project deliverables include the
production of a broadcast of the eclipse live from Waleia in the Federated
States of Micronesia on March 9, 2016 making it accessible to hundreds of
countries and millions of people around the world via satellite and live
streaming on the Internet. Additional deliverables include on-site educational
programs at science centers and planetariums as well as media resources for
long-term use. These resources will enhance the interest and preparedness for
additional public engagement when the 2017 eclipse occurs in the
U.S.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Making new research understandable and accessible to
the public is an important activity of the U.S. research enterprise. NSF is
making a substantial investment in solar physics research by funding the
construction of the world's largest solar telescope, the Daniel K. Inouye Solar
Telescope which is slated to begin operations in late 2019 and operated by the
National Solar Observatory. This new facility will revolutionize researchers'
capability to study the Sun and its magnetic fields. This education project
leverages that investment with a major public engagement opportunity that has
the potential for reaching millions of students, teachers, and the public both
in the U.S. and worldwide through the Internet.
