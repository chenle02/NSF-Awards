The Chemistry, Geology, and Physics departments are establishing a new X-ray
laboratory. Instruments in the laboratory (X-ray diffractometer for powders and
X-ray spectrometer) will be used to support several courses offered in the
undergraduate curriculum. In addition, the instruments are being utilized by
both faculty and students for support of the undergraduate research program at
this institution. The departments are committed to educating students through
hands-on experiments, utilizing a variety of instruments. Rather than through a
single course in which the instruments are being used, an effort is being made
to integrate applications of X-ray methods throughout the entire curriculum. A
Phillips PN1430 spectrometer coupled with the Phillips PW1840 diffractometer
offered the greatest cost advantage to the university. The system includes a
matched computer system interfaced to the instruments.
