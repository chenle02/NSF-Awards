This proposal will develop geological positioning system (GPS) technology for
monitoring moose foraging and assessing effects on ecosystem processes such as
soil development and vegetation dynamics. The GPS will be tested for accuracy
under winter conditions in Minnesota in a variety of terrains. One moose will be
outfitted with an integrated GPS-standard radio collar to assess the utility of
this technology for continued study of moose- vegetation interaction. A model
integrating moose foraging intensity, plant growth, soil nutrient availability
over boreal landscapes will be refined improve understanding of effects of
foraging strategy on nitrogen distribution across the landscape. %%% The spatial
and temporal dynamics of animal plant interactions have important consequences
for ecosystem processes. However, study of the effects of animal foraging
behavior on nutrient availability and vegetation dynamics across landscapes has
been limited by technologies for monitoring foraging patterns. This research
will assess the value of the new GPS technology for monitoring animal foraging
patterns and integrating these patterns with assessment of consequences for
ecosystem processes.
