This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will further
develop a new Flow Path Management System (FPMS) representing an innovation in
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Supply Chain Management (SCM) that is
more effective than existing supply-chain management software paradigms,
incorporates "lean manufacturing" principles, and is more available to smaller
manufacturing companies than existing systems in that it can be delivered via
the World Wide Web. The software has the potential to reduce inventory by 20% or
more in companies with complicated manufacturing operations and/or supply
chains. In addition, the software can recommend supply chain planning policies
that increase throughput, decrease cycle times, and improve customer
service.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercialization strategy is to use
distribution channels: (1) on-site Intranet installations at large companies (2)
delivery as a web service via the Internet for smaller companies, and (3)
licensing the algorithms to larger ERP/SCM vendors for incorporation in their
software suites.&lt;br/&gt;
