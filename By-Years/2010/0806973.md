Thirteen academically talented, financially needy students majoring in space
physics will receive annual scholarships of $10,000 for four years. Included
among the many outstanding features of the project are the quality of the
academic program, the array of student support services, provisions for
strengthening cohort bonding, plans for the long term tracking of graduates, and
the strong management team and management plans. There is an emphasis on the
recruitment of underrepresented groups including minorities and women. The
project builds on previous CSEMS and S-STEM scholarship programs.
