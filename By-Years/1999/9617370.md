Instrumentation: Multiprocessor Computing Facilities This instrumentation grant
enables the purchase of a Unix-based multiprocessor system to develop tools for
analysis and development of parallel and distributed programs. The project
includes a study of parallel implementation of protocols, development of
coordination abstractions that capture common patterns of process interaction in
various applications, empirical evaluation of parallel flow analysis algorithms,
development of an implementation testbed for distributed and shared memory
programs, and development of a general parallel hydrologic routing system for
hydraulic and hydrologic analysis of dams. The multiprocessor system requested
will be used to evaluate the performance benefits of parallelism in the analysis
algorithms and as a part of a network configuration to evaluate the performance
of network/distributed protocols and the throughput gains achieved by their
parallel implementations.
