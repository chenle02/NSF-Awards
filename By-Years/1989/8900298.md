The research will focus on three aspects of non- accelerator particle physics:
1) A large balloon-borne experiment (EXAM) will be used to search for evidence
of large scale quantities of antimatter in the universe. Data from a 1988 flight
will be analyzed and at least one additional fight will be made. 2) The world's
largest underground particle detector (MACRO) currently being constructed in
Italy will be used to search for monopoles and study cosmic ray neutrinos and
muons. 3) Cryogenic detectors will be developed to search, at high levels of
sensitivity, for dark matter, the so called "missing mass" of the universe. This
work will be done by scientists from Boston University in collaboration with
scientists from other institutions.
