9622407 Terry This is a Research Equipment Grant for the purchase of a very high
speed ellipsometer for use in plasma processing/film thickness analysis. The
instrument will be used for research on the effects of reactive plasma on
surfaces in reactive ion etch and plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition
environments. ***
