The significant growth and penetration of smart and Internet of Things (IoT)
devices has driven a large number of new applications and caused a surge in
sensitive and personal data generation. Unfortunately, our ability to protect
that information is limited, and concerns over privacy, trust, and security are
becoming increasingly important to different stakeholders. Emerging IoT
applications also send and receive data in various ways, and each might require
different performance levels of reliability, loss, and latency. To cope with
these various traffic characteristics and requirements, it is now necessary to
have greater visibility and control over the traffic generated from smart and
IoT devices in order to guarantee a high quality of experience to
users.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of this project is to design and develop the
ExtremeDataHub platform, an open, flexible, and programmable networked edge
device that controls and manages access to our sensitive and personal data. This
platform will integrate the European collaborators' SMILE and Databox platforms.
The project will identify new services and applications that can effectively
leverage the combined platform, potentially including applications in the smart
home, smart healthcare, and smart cities domains. This project initiates a new
research collaboration between investigators at Virginia Commonwealth University
and Imperial College London, UK.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
