Certain surfaces have a two-dimensional periodicity that differs from that
expected from a straight forward continuation from the bulk, a phenomena known
as reconstruction. In some cases, a reconstruction can be induced by the
addition of controlled amounts of adatoms. Questions about why and how such
rearrangements occur represent fundamentally inportant topics in surface
science. In addition, the possibility to induce such effects has the potential
of providing a source for new materials with novel and possibly very useful
properties. A study of geometric structure of such reconstructed surfaces using
medium energy ion scattering with channeling and blocking, a powerful, novel,
high resolution technique for surface studies will be employed. These studies
are to be complemented with studies of the electronic structure using angle
resolved photoemission with synchrotron radiation and with inverse
photoemission. Among the systems to be studied are the reconstructions that
occur on the (110) surfaces of gold and platinum and the adsorbate induced
reconstructions that occur on similar surfaces. This research will ultimately
lead to new ways of changing the location of atoms on surfaces and thus produce
synthetic surfaces with useful properties.
