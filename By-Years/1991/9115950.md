Dr. Frank will conduct an investigation of the processes that lead to tropical
cyclone development in the western Pacific. The study, which combines
observational analyses and numerical modeling experiments, will focus on the
earliest stages of cyclogenesis. Occasionally, a strong mesoscale vortex forms
within a loosely organized tropical cloud cluster. Over the years, researchers
have developed a fairly clear picture of the processes which cause some of these
vortices to grow into mature tropical cyclones (the "intensification" phase of
the hurricane/typhoon life cycle). By comparison, the "genesis" phase is very
poorly understood. Dr. Frank will examine the large scale circulation patterns
present during tropical cyclogenesis, the origins of these patterns, and the
physical processes leading to vortex formation. Synoptic-scale surges of
southwesterly flow into the West Pacific Monsoon Trough are frequently observed
to precede cyclogenesis in this region. Particular attention will be given to
their role in cyclogenesis. The observational analyses will be based on a five
year global data set, and on high resolution data sets collected during the
Tropical Cyclone Motion experiment of 1990, in which Frank participated. The
modeling studies will employ the newly developed nonhydrostatic version of the
PSU/NCAR mesoscale model to simulate vortex formation under a variety of
conditions typical of the West Pacific. This research will be important for
understanding, and ultimately predicting, the development of tropical cyclones.
