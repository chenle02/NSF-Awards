Twin Cities Public Television, in association with Red Hill Studios, is
producing and disseminating an Exploring Time television special and associated
outreach material. The project will augment and leverage the Exploring Time
traveling exhibit now being developed by the Science Museum of Minnesota (NSF
grant #99-01919). The goal of both the exhibit and the television special is to
increase the public's understanding of our world by revealing the unseen world
of natural change -- the multitude of changes that are occurring in the present
but at rates too slow or too fast to be seen. The television special will
provide visual explorations of changes that take place over a vast range of
timescales -- from billionths of seconds to billions of years.

The television series and exhibit will be supplemented by a range of materials.
Both low- and high-bandwidth, web-based material will be available and a
teacher's guide will be developed for middle school classrooms. A "Time
Explorers Toolkit" will be available to both formal and informal learners. This
CD-ROM includes detailed, step-by-step instructions on how to create time-lapse
movies. The project also will coordinate outreach with the Community Technology
Centers Network, the organization that supports technology centers that serve
individuals from underrepresented and low-income groups.
