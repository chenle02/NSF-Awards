The objectives of the project are: to utilize concepts from optimal control
theory in designing robust dynamic pattern recognition algorithms for recurrent
neural networks; to generalize derivative propagation algorithms for recurrent
networks through alternative design options revealed in the optimal control
formulation (One example is minimum-time optimal control training); to use state
feedback optimal control schemes for deriving fast weight schemes for use during
radical system disturbances; and to perform qualitative analysis and dynamic
behavior characterization for certain of the neural network dynamic systems
arising from the optimal control training schemes. Noting a formal relationship
between optimal control theory and the derivative propagation algorithms of
recurrent neural networks, this research will go further to reveal more design
options offered by optimal control. Thus an optimal control formulation will be
used to generalize derivative propagation in recurrent networks. The first phase
of this research will use a design option that buffers against the effects of
noise in trained dynamic pattern recognition systems. The second phase will
incorporate minimum-time optimal control to reduce training time in recurrent
systems. The third phase will propose fast schemes for use in mitigating radical
disturbances. The fourth phase will perform a qualitative analysis for some of
the systems resulting from the above schemes.
