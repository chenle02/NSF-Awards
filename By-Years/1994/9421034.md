9421034 Adams Several problems in nuclear magnetism of solid helium-3 will be
investigated at temperatures as low as 20 microkelvin and magnetic fields up to
20 Tesla. Ordering in the high-pressure hexagonal-closed packed phase, which is
expected to be ferromagnetic because of the dominance of triple exchange, will
be achieved by using the helium nuclei for the second stage demagnetization. The
high field to paramagnetic phase transition, which occurs near 20 Tesla where
the system becomes fully magnetized, will be studied by measurement of the
melting pressure to obtain the magnetization. The nature of this transition at
low fields near the triple point ( where the low-field, high-field, and
paramagnetic phases coexist) will be investigated by nuclear magnetic resonance
and thermal transport measurements. These three investigations will provide
additional insight into the fundamental behavior of this model magnetic
substance. %%% Solid helium-3 is considered a model magnetic system for studying
fundamentals of magnetism. Because of the small mass and weak forces between
atoms, the effect of interest occur in a range of temperature near absolute
zero, below that of interest for electronic systems, but above those for heavy
nuclear magnets. Since the helium is highly compressible, effects can be
investigated over a wide range of density by application of moderate pressure.
In particular, the type of magnetic structures occurring in two different type
of crystals can be studied. Methods of investigation include nuclear magnetic
resonance, melting pressure, constant-volume pressure, and thermal conductivity.
Knowledge gained will be of use in understanding magnetic phenomena in more
complicated magnetic systems. ***
