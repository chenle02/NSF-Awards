As the concepts of manufacturability and reliability, and the associated data
acquisition systems become increasingly necessary to the analog design process
in industry, it becomes correspondingly important to incorporate these concepts,
as well as the equipment, into the undergraduate curriculum. Under this project
equipment is to be acquired which will enable the emerging concepts of tolerance
analysis and statistical design of circuits and systems to be added to the
analog design portion of the undergraduate electrical (EE) and computer (CpE)
engineering curricula. This technology is often labeled "Designing for
Manufacturability," and refers to yield, reliability, and performance of
circuits and systems. These curricular topics will be taught to all EE and CpE
majors through laboratory experiments in the sophomore and junior years. This
project is significant because it focuses on the early introduction of the basic
concepts of design for manufacturability at the undergraduate level in analog
design courses.
