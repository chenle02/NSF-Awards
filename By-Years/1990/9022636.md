The New Jersey Marine Sciences Consortium proposes to lead the U.S. effort in
developing and conducting U.S. - Argentina workshops in Coastal Ocean
Engineering Research with due regard to the coastal environment. The subject
matter for both workshops will be approximately the same. The specific content
of the second workshop will be based on the results of the first workshop and
the need to fulfill the objectives of the project. A steering Committee
representing the United States and Argentina will select a maximum of eight
participants for each workshop. Each workshop will last three days in which
preliminary papers will be presented; relevant research needs and opportunities
will be discussed; and future collaboration will be planned. A fourth day will
be available for visiting a few local facilities and laboratories related to the
Workshop topics. The objective is to enable the United States and Argentina to
gain mutually from collaborative discussion of common research needs in
developing coastal ocean space and how best to approach them.
