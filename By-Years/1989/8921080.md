The Computer and Information Science Department at the University of
Massachusetts will purchase: (1) The Utah/MIT Dextrous Hand, (2) the CONDOR
Control Architecture, (3) A Transputer Control Architecture, (4) Brock Tactile
Sensors, (5) Camera/Frame Grabber, (6) An interface from the Sequent
Multiprocessor to the robotics lab. This equipment will be used to support
research in computer and information science and engineering. The equipment will
be used for several research projects, including: (1) The development of
controllers for complex robots: high bandwidth, reflexive controllers and low
bandwidth, task level (behavior based) controllers for multifingered
manipulators. (2) The automatic synthesis of assembly operations using
geometrical reasoning. (3) The interpretation of tactile and visual data; for
recognition, localization, and sensory feedback. (4) The specification of
architecture for autonomous planning and control. The selection of effective
coupling between planning, management, and execution based on task level problem
specification. The implementation of such systems on Distributed parallel
architectures employing the Robot Schema System (RSS). (5) The exploration of
learning and skill refinement in the robot domain.
