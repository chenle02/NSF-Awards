This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate
new materials for use in industrial hydrodesulfurization (HDS) processing. This
project will focus on transition metal phosphide catalysts, a novel class of
compounds recently discovered to be highly active towards HDS, and the effect of
the support material on their chemical and catalytic properties. The support
materials that we will investigate for this project are mixed oxides consisting
of silica, zirconia, or titania. The primary objectives of Phase I research are:
o Determine the nature of the interaction between the active phase and the mixed
oxide supports. o Determine how the support chemistry and microstructure affect
the catalytic activity and stability of a transition metal phosphide
catalyst.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commercial opportunities exist for new HDS
catalysts capable of producing ultra-clean transportation fuels. The
environmental regulations being implemented world-wide to reduce the impact of
pollutants such as SO2, responsible for acid rain, from car exhaust, along with
the declining quality of fossil fuel feedstocks, will provide substantial
motivation for the refineries to seek alternative catalyst materials.
