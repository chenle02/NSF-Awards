The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project
is to further develop a product which allows consumers to listen and learn about
the birds in their backyards. The product will improve the general public’s
scientific literacy and engagement by presenting information about birds in fun
and non-threatening ways. Additionally, it will make environmental research more
understandable, tangible, and valuable to more people and include women and
individuals from underrepresented groups This project seeks to help casual
birdwatchers know more about their own backyard ecosystems, improve their
ability to identify birds by their songs, and recognize the diversity of life
outside their windows. Customers will learn the importance of environmental
stewardship by becoming important partners in bird-centered research and
connecting with others who share their interests. Participation in bird count
challenges saw large increases in 2020 and record-setting participation
continued into 2021. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary technical challenge will
be to design and run birdsong detectors on low-cost edge hardware, while
ignoring non-bird sounds such as dogs, insects, sirens, and machines. Edge
algorithms and prototype hardware will be developed to provide the most accurate
birdsong identifications at the lowest possible cost, which will result in wide
commercialization. This represents a significant technical challenge because the
product’s neural net is much larger than artificial intelligence chips can
currently support. Producing a product priced for the target market will require
the creation of a comprehensive labeled library of bird and environmental
sounds, a well-trained neural net, optimized hardware, a comprehensive beta
testing program, and an informative, easy to use website and smartphone
app.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
