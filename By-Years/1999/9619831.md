9619831 Query-based visualization is put forth as a novel exploratory approach
to understanding distributed computations. The key features of the approach are
the use of queries as a device for searching the state space of distributed
computations, visual presentation techniques borrowed from program animation,
and the ability to navigate through the state space using visual interactions.
Query- based visualization treats the state of a running distributed computation
as if it were the contents of a distributed database. The user explores this
database by issuing queries which are evaluated and the results visualized. A
class of queries called persistent enable continuous visual monitoring of the
state of a distributed computation. All views correspond to globally consistent
snapshots of the computation. The project will produce the first implementation
of query-based visualization which will provide a uniform interface for learning
about distributed applications that employ the PVM library. In the course of
development, contributions will be made to monitoring and snapshot algorithms,
graphical representation forms and ways to combine them, and the visual query
language. ***
