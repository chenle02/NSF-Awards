This project traces the socio-environmental trajectories of rubber, Lat. Hevea
Brasiliensis. This cash crop, which is used in everything from tires to
telegraph cables, fundamentally changed the world. The project combines archival
and ethnographic research in order to answer the following research questions:
What articulations of racial and environmental justice emerge from peopleâ€™s
different modes of relation to Hevea Brasiliensis from colonialism until present
day? What socio-environmental considerations underpin colonial and postcolonial
science? How are postcolonial power hierarchies, such as indigeneity,
citizenship and class, re-negotiated through the cultivation of rubber by
different social groups? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Undertaking a qualitative
analysis, this study explores the ways in which colonial officials,
smallholders, biotechnology scientists, indigenous communities and artists in
colonial and postcolonial contexts have cultivated Hevea Brasiliensis in
different ways and with different socio-environmental implications. The project
critically analyses how cultivating rubber through science, ancestral knowledge
and aesthetics can enable the articulation of multiple forms of social and
environmental justice from within monocrop plantations. Moreover, given the
growing challenges posed by the interdependencies between climate variability
and industrial agriculture, it also speaks to questions of environmental
sustainability and social justice. Findings from this project will provide
insights and recommendations for governmental and nongovernmental actors
interested in aspects of environmental and social sustainability in the context
of industrial agriculture. Also, findings will benefit scholars and the public
through the dissemination of publications and pedagogical materials through
free-of-charge online platforms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
