Two-week summer science institutes for forty grades 4-6 elementary school
teachers from Minnesota and Wisconsin will be held on the University of
Wisconsin-River Falls campus for three consecutive summers, beginning in the
summer of 1990. Teams of underprepared teachers from inner city schools which
consist of sizable Black, Hispanic, Native American, and Asian populations, as
well as from small, rural school districts will be recruited as participants.
The subject matter is concentrated in the field of chemistry, with physics,
geology, and geological applications. This choice of subject matter is
particularly important since participants will be drawn from grades where this
content is often introduced to students for the first time. Institute
methodology is based on both science content and experimental activity. A kit of
laboratory materials for use in the classroom will be provided to each team of
teachers from a grant of the 3M Corporation. On-site visits by institute staff
during the academic year will culminated with a one-day spring follow-up
workshop. During the second and third years, minority teachers from Alabama will
be invited to participate with the assistance of the science departments of
Alabama A&amp;M (UW-River Falls' sister institution). The cost sharing will be
eight percent of the NSF portion.
