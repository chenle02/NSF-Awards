9732555 Ibeh Pittsburg State University will establish a Research Experience for
Undergraduates (REU) Site in interdisciplinary materials research. The site
includes faculty form the departments of Engineering Technology, Chemistry,
Physics, Biology and the Business and Technology Institute. The site has an
undergraduate student recruitment focus on community colleges of the "Four State
Region" (SE Kansas, SW Missouri, NW Arkansas and NE Oklahoma). Students will be
involved in materials research with technological applications that includes
polyolefin binders for fuel cells, non-linear optical polyurethanes, textured
metal electrodes for ultracapacitors, strain gage technology for battery charge
determination, thermoplastics and foams. %%% The REU site will provide students
at community colleges in the region an opportunity to participate in an
interdisciplinary research experience. ***
