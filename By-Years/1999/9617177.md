van Gorkom, Jacqueline 96-17177 Dr. van Gorkom will investigate the evolution of
galaxies and the growth of large scale structure by imaging the gaseous
component of individual galaxies in different environments and by mapping out
the distribution of gas-rich and possible light-poor galaxies on larger scales.
Four specific topics are included in this study -- the environment of nearby
Lyman alpha absorbers, filaments in voids, the evolution of clusters of galaxies
and the end product of mergers.
