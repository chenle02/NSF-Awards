Many situations involving collective action problems occur in groups of
individuals that have formed through a process of voluntary association. There
are a wide variety of examples from lawyers forming partnerships to communities
forming associations for education, neighborhood improvement, and crime control.
Similarly, individuals sometimes will rely upon the support of voluntary groups
when faced with losses from fire, disease or weather catastrophes. Because of
the importance of collective action problems, economists and political
scientists have extensively studied the behavior of individuals in these
settings. However, most prior studies have taken the existence and size of the
groups as a given and have ignored the dynamic manner in which groups form and
evolve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project we investigate the behavior of
individuals in public goods and risk sharing environments when group formation
is endogenous. We ask questions such as the following: "How do different rules
for joining and leaving a group affect individuals' ability to solve various
collective action problems? Can individuals learn to form groups of efficient
size? Are some rules of group formation more conducive to socially efficient
behavior?" Specifically, in the first part of our project we study three types
of group formation rules in public goods provision groups: free entry and exit,
restricted entry with free exit, and free entry with restricted exit. The second
part of this project will extend the analysis to risk-sharing groups. Our
research methodology involves a combination of economics experiments and theory
development aimed at the complex relationship between group formation and
behavior once a group has been formed. The results of the study will be valuable
in understanding how the rules organizations use to regulate their membership
hinder or enhance their ability to achieve their goals.&lt;br/&gt;
