9504202 MURRAY Measurements will be made of particulate carbon export production
in the western equatorial Pacific at the equator and 165 degree E and the zonal
gradient at the equator from drifting sediment trap samples. Comparison of this
particulate flux with 15N-NO3 new production measurements will also enable
estimates of potential carbon export as DOC. Participation in two cruises will
determine the El Nino/non-El Nino variability and make a more accurate estimate
of total export production from the equatorial Pacific. Both cruises are in
collaboration with ORSTOM Noumea French scientists. The first cruise will be
conducted on the French R/V Atalante in October 1994-1996. These cruises will be
part of the graduate research of Mr. John Dunne.
