Abstract ATM-9631291 Jordan, Teresa Cornell University Title: Collaborative
Research: Andean Climate History: Geochemical Proxies from a Holocene
Pleistocene Salt Core, Salar Del Hombre Muerto, Argentina This award supports a
paleoenvironmental study of a 50+meter salt core from Hombre Muerto salar, a dry
lake in the southeastern Altiplano/Puna plateau of the Central Andes. The core
is a register of the history of fill and desiccation of the lake, and is thus a
record of the changes in hydrology and climate extending back through time. In
South America, the climate history of the Last Glacial Maximum and the Holocene
is controversial, and prior to the Quaternary, it is virtually unknown.
Paleoclimate data extracted from this core will address the relative timing of
northern and southern hemisphere climate cycles, and the temporal phase
relations between precipitation cycles and temperature cycles in the Andes.
