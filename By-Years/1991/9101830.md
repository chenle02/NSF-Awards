This project will be devoted to the mathematical aspects of the fundamental
question, "what voting systems are most fair?". The investigation will use
methods of homology theory to study the flow of voter preference in a
multicandidate election. Mathematical fields as diverse as "convex geometry" NP-
completeness, dimension theory, and homology theory will play a role in this
analysis. This project expects to clarify the nature of the "voter's paradox"
which is the main impediment to the existence of completely fair election
systems in the sense of Arrow's Impossibility Theorem. Several new absolute and
relative measures of "power", or influence of the players, will be established
in order to decide the fairness of a system.
