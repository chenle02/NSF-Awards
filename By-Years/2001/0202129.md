Simi&lt;br/&gt;University of Nevada at Las Vegas&lt;br/&gt;DDR: Adult
Consequences of Participation in Youth Subculture&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This
dissertation research will investigate the life histories of early participants
in the Los Angeles white supremacist subculture. The results will supplement our
knowledge of how early social movement participation affects later politics and
life outcomes. Past studies of the long term consequences of social movement
participation have focused almost exclusively on liberal and leftist social
movements. This study will investigate similar consequences but for a white
supremacist movement. Political, occupational, marital, and criminal outcomes
will be investigated in follow-up in-depth interviews with at least 25 men who
were members of such white supremacists movements as youths prior to
1990.&lt;br/&gt;
