9412503 Ghattas The joint research project between Carnegie Mellon University
and Shadyside Hospital proposes to improve our understanding of basic
biomechanical issues related to cementless joint replacement surgery, resolve
related computational problems, and consequently lead to better support and
further improvement of preoperative surgical simulation systems. Specific tasks
of the proposed research are: (1) to characterize the assembly strains in the
proximal femur and the acetabulum, which occur with the implantation of a
cementless press-fit component, (2) to optimize the shape parameters for implant
and bone, and (3) to develop an efficient procedure to create a reliable 3D
finite element model of the hip joint based on CT scan data. Analytical models
will be developed to describe the mechanical performance of the bone/implant
construct, and subsequently the mechanical environment due to normal joint
loads. The mechanical performance of the full-scale three- dimensional
analytical models will be compared to the results from simplified analytical
models and published experimental results. ***
