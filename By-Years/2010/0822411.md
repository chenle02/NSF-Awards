Both plant and animal embryos develop along a polar axis. In plants, this gives
rise to the apical shoot pool and the basal root pole. The proper formation of
this axis is critical for the postembryonic growth of all plants. The
transcriptional co-repressor TOPLESS (TPL) has been shown to prevent the
expression of basal root genes in the apical shoot pole of the embryo. In tpl-1
mutants, the shoot pole is transformed into a second root pole, giving rise to
seedlings with root poles on both ends. TPL acts by forming a complex with the
transcriptional repressor BODLENOS (BDL)(an AUX/IAA protein) and the
transcriptional activator MONOPTEROS (MP)(an Auxin Response Factor (ARF)). The
formation of this complex is regulated by the plant hormone auxin-when auxin
levels are high, BDL is degraded and MP can then activate genes required for
proper root and vasculature development. This project seeks to identify the
target genes that are regulated by the TPL/BDL/MP complex and identify new
components of the pathway through genetic screens. A detailed analysis of the
BDL's ability to repress transcription on a cellular level in the embryo will
also be performed. Finally, the dependence of other AUX/IAA proteins on TPL
activity will be explored during embryogenesis. As this pathway is conserved
among all higher plants, the elucidation and understanding of the mechanisms by
which it acts will be directly applicable to agriculturally important crops, and
will provide us with the tools necessary to modify plants's form and growth
patterns. This work will provide scientific training at the postdoctoral,
undergraduate and high school levels and will include underrepresented
minorities. This proposal will also generate materials used for K-12 student and
teacher educational outreach.
