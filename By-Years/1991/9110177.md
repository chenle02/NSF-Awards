Developing error-free distributed software and coping with processor failures
are among the important problems encountered in the development of reliable
distributed systems. The main objective of this research is to design and build
reliable distributed systems by software testing and recovering from processor
failures. The analytical component of this research is expected to provide a
better understanding of the issues involved and suggest different approaches to
testing distributed programs and crash recovery. The experimental component of
this research effort involves the implementation of several techniques and is
expected to result in the development of software tools for the above mentioned
problems in distributed computing systems.
