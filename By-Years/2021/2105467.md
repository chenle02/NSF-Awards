This project concerns the study of topological shapes, or manifolds, in
dimensions 3 and 4. The classification of such shapes, locally modeled on the
Euclidean space, in these dimensions is an important problem for several
reasons. One is its relevance to physics; indeed, ideas from theoretical physics
have led to new insights into the structure of spaces of these dimensions.
Moreover, some of the outstanding open problems in topology concern manifolds
specifically of dimension 4, and the study of such manifolds has important links
with many areas of mathematics. This project is aimed at several questions in
4-manifold topology, including the classification up to continuous deformations
of manifolds with large fundamental groups where many loops cannot be
contracted. The project also has substantial broader impacts, aimed at training
undergraduate and graduate students, and outreach
activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is aimed at several research
directions, providing different methods and applications to a common set of
problems: invariants of links and of link concordance, and classification of
surfaces in 4-manifolds. One goal is to build on recent advances towards a
resolution of the topological surgery conjecture, an open problem in 4-manifold
topology, for free fundamental groups. This work will involve the construction
of universal surgery problems, and related methods of the A-B slice problem. The
project also aims to apply the techniques of the Goodwillie-Weiss embedding
calculus of functors to embedding problems in 4-manifold topology, in particular
to link concordance and to embedding of surfaces in 4-manifolds. Another
direction of research concerns stable homotopy refinement of link homology
theories, with applications to surfaces in
4-manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
