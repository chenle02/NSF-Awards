The PI will analysis and interpretation of the EMSLAB magnetometer array.
Existing, but recently developed methods of analysis, including robust
multivariate transfer function (or response space) estimates; methods for
combining non-simultaneous arrays (and treating missing data in a large array);
a new method for combining all components of the transfer functions to produce
smooth maps of magnetic fields of internal origin and methods for approximate
(almost linear) inversion of long period anomalous magnetic field data for
integrated surface conductance, will be applied to the 83 station land array.
