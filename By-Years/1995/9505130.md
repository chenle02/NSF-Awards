9505130 Smith Spectra have been important in homotopy theory for many years.
Recently the investigator has constructed a category of spectra with a symmetric
monoidal smash product. The construction is elementary and will provide an
introduction to spectra which will not scare away the novice. The strict
associativity of the smash product means that many other definitions regarding
spectra can be greatly simplified. For example, one can easily discuss ring
spectra, commutative ring spectra, module spectra. The investigator is using
this new definition of ring spectra in the study of topological Hochschild
homology and topological cyclic homology. Spectra have been developed over the
last thirty years as a bridge between the geometric problems that the algebraic
topologist studies and the algebraic techniques which he uses. The earliest
examples were given by Rene Thom in his work on the cobordism classification of
manifolds, where he showed that manifolds, the geometric objects common to
mathematics and physics, are classified up to cobordism by certain spectra. Over
the years, as one needed spectra having more and more properties, many different
constructions have been given. These constructions have became increasingly
complicated, until only a few experts could understand them. However, recently
the investigator has found a much easier way to construct spectra that
nonetheless have all the properties one needs for the applications. This makes
the field far more accessible, especially to graduate students, and should lead
to much fuller appreciation of this powerful tool. ***
