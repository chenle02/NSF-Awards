9705649 Berkovits The Wildlife Conservation Society is developing and
implementing a five-year science program for 420 parents and 210 teachers of
children in grades K-8. Linked directly with school curricula and the new
National Science Education Standards, the program will bridge the gap between
parents and schools, and position the Zoo as a partner and intermediary to help
parents and teachers improve the quality and quantity of science education. The
program consists of four interrelated components: 1) A series of workshops that
will prepare the 420 parents and 210 teachers to work in teams for better and
more widely available science education; 2) A series of education projects that
will enable workshop participants to teach thousands of other parents and
educators about the importance of science literacy, the need for active parental
engagement in children's education, and the crucial role that informal science
institutions play in augmenting formal science instruction; 3) A series of four
Science Advocacy Fairs at the Zoo that are expected to raise the visitor's
consciousness on a large scale about the above issues; and 4) A symposium for
educators from schools and informal science centers in the region to disseminate
successful methods for involving parents in science education.
