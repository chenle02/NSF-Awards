Project Partners will provide a coordinated series of programs and resources to
enhance the capabilities of middle school science and mathematics teachers, many
of whom have only General Teaching Certification, in predominantly rural
southwestern Montana. Mining industry (the predominant local industry) and
college science, engineering, and mathematics professionals will jointly develop
and present a series of academic year and summer workshops and support teachers
in the development of locally-oriented teaching materials. A resource center
will be created containing teaching materials which can be utilized by all the
teachers. An objective will be the establishment of a continuing locally-
supported networking procedure for these teachers. Cost sharing by the schools,
colleges, and industry will total 34% of the NSF funding.
