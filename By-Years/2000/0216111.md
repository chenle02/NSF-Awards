This Major Research Instrumentation RUI grant supports acquisition of a desk top
x-ray diffractometer that will be used in materials science and solid-state
chemistry research at Jackson State University, an undergraduate, teaching-
oriented university. This diffractometer does not require water cooling and is
sufficiently simple that undergraduate students can use it after a short
training period. The diffractometer will be used in teaching laboratories as
well as in research. The research is varied. One example is exploring new forms
of silicon, including amorphous silicon that contains on the order of 40%
molecular hydrogen. New open framework structures such as silicon-germanium and
tin clathrates will also be characterized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This equipment
will see shared use with the University of Alabama at Birmingham and Auburn
University. It should enhance the on-going collaborations between the three
universities. The equipment will also be used as a demonstration tool for high
school students in collaboration with a program called "Alabama Science in
Motion" and will be employed in the continuing education Masters Program for
local high school teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
