9402653 Hennage This award is to support partial travel cost of students to the
1994 Diffractive Optics: Design, Fabrication and Applications Topical Meeting,
presented by the Optical Society of America. Diffractive or binary optics are
finding new and interesting applications in both commercial and military
markets, providing the potential to significantly reduce size, weight and cost
of optical systems which currently use refractive and/or reflective optical
components. The aim of this conference is to foster discussion among scientists
and engineers contributing to, or interested in, current research issues,
fabrication methods, new developments and applications of diffractive optics.
