The Greater Caucasus Mountain Range is a rapidly rising mountain belt driven by
the collision of the Iranian-Turkish and Arabian continental blocks with the
Russian craton. In cooperation with Soviet colleagues a number of problems
bearing on the tectonic evolution of the northern Tethys ocean margin, the
involvement of the Russian craton in active margin processes have been
identified. These have significance for widely- applicable processes of intra-
sialic rifting, the irregular response to deformation of irregular shapes of
collisional blocks and in the recycling of compositionally heterogeneous
basement nappes into new sialic crust by superposed batholithic magmatism. The
work will focus on the structural setting and isotope geochemistry of the Chegem
River Caldera and related rocks and possible relationships to the transcaucasus
structural zone, U/Pb zircons geochronology of previously collected samples from
the Bechasin, Fore Range and Main Range basement zones and the age and tectonic
setting of the Kasbek diabase belt and related intrusions along the southern
boundary zone. Results are expected to increase knowledge of sialic crustal
genesis, mesozoic intra-sialic rifting and the neotectonic regime of this area.
