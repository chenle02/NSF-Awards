The principal investigator studies and develops computational methods suitable
for parallel and vector computers to solve molecular dynamics problems. He
emphasizes time-stepping techniques to compute motion in many-body interactions,
studies the importance of symplectic methods, and investigates strategies for
taking larger time steps. To test the ideas, the principal investigator
implements them in a software package for modeling macromolecules. The many-body
problem-how a set of distinct objects move under the influence of forces that
change as the objects move-is classical and hard. For instance, the motion of
planets in the solar system can be thought of as a 10 body problem where the
primary force is gravity. The motion of molecules is particularly difficult
because such problems involve so many objects and the nature of the forces is so
complicated. The problems arise in areas of material science, structural
biology, and design of drugs. This work aims to develop software and algorithms
to solve such problems rapidly on computers.
