The central goal of this project is to understand the complex linkages between
biogeochemical cycles, vegetation, disturbance, and climate across the full
summer temperature gradient in the Arctic in order to better predict ecosystem
responses to changing climate. The project focuses on frost-boils because: (1)
The processes that are involved in the self-organization of these landforms
drive biogeochemical cycling and vegetation succession of extensive arctic
ecosystems. (2) These ecosystems contain perhaps the most diverse and
ecologically important zonal ecosystems in the Arctic and are important to
global carbon budgets. (3) The complex ecological relationships between
patterned-ground formation, biogeochemical cycles, and vegetation and the
significance of these relationships at multiple scales have not been studied.
(4) The responses of the system to changes in temperature are likely to be
nonlinear, but can be understood and modeled by examining the relative strengths
of feedbacks between the components of the system at several sites along the
natural arctic temperature gradient.&lt;br/&gt;
