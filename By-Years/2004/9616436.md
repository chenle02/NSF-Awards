CISE/EHR/ENG/MPS Collaborative Research On Learning Technologies Program: A
Center for Intelligent Multimedia Instructional Systems The University of
Massachusetts, Amherst has been awarded funding in the amount of $50,000 for 12
months to plan a Center for Intelligent, Multimedia Tutoring Systems (IMTS) for
science, mathematics, engineering and technology education in higher education
and for life-long learning. ITMSs combine the power of visualization and
animation with the student modeling capabilities of intelligent tutors to
produce interactive learning environments that are highly effective for
conveying complex, dynamic processes. The Center plan will incorporate studies
of many existing ITMSs, including a number of systems developed at the
University of Massachusetts. This particular corpus of work, combined with new
systems that the University has pledged to develop, provides both an accumulated
body of experience in IMTS development and an opportunity to submit many of them
to the kind of laboratory analysis that will offer new educational insights into
their effectiveness.
