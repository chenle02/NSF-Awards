This grant in the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is directed
towards the development of new synthetic organic methods, which will permit the
preparation of new materials of biological and theoretical interest. New
synthetic methodology will be developed for the regiospecific formation of
carbon-carbon bonds using a cobalt-catalyzed cyclization. Regiospecificity is to
be obtained by the use of a directing ligand on one of the two cyclization
substrates. Specificity of the ligand directed-olefin-acetylene cyclization to
form cyclopentenones has already been demonstrated. The functionality generated
in an olefin- acetylene cyclization (Khand-Pauson reaction) can be utilized in a
three-carbon ring expansion sequence. Potential applications of the ring
expansion to problems in natural product synthesis are envisioned.
