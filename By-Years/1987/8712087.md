Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) has developed methods of
processesing data from the Neil Brown (CTD) (conductivity-temperature-depth)
profiler which yield data superior to classical Nansen bottle water sampling
techniques alone for measurement of pressure, temperature, and salinity. CTD
derived oxygen data is rapidly approaching parity with bottle smples.
Experienced personnel supporting CTD activities on cruises have always been
limited in number. We are proposing to organize and document our CTD data
processing system to make the at sea processing more efficient and easier for
less experienced personnel to assist in data processing tasks. These attributes
will allow straightforward implementation of a standardized CTD system for a
variety of user groups outside of WHOI. We are also proposing to extend this
basic data processing capability to provide programs geared towards generating a
data report at sea. Developing the capability for acquiring CTD data on a
MicroVAX will consolidate data logging and processing on a single computer, thus
simplifying the maintenance of both hardware and software. These improvements of
the system are in anticipation of the greater work load and wider user community
anticipated for WOCE (World Ocean Circulation Experiment).
