This research project aims to relate and unify recent developments in
mathematics and theoretical particle physics. The mathematical origin of these
developments is the so-called Langlands program, which is the modern view on the
classical mathematical discipline of number theory. The Langlands program
functions today as a bridge between central disciplines of mathematics, such as
representation theory, algebraic geometry, and number theory, and central
disciplines in physics, such as gauge theory and string theory. This project
will use this connection in both directions by applying ideas from physics to
mathematics, through a new use of locality, and applying mathematical
constructions to physics, by constructing the "theory X," the conjectural six-
dimensional conformal field theory that should unify all important quantum field
theories in lower dimensions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central theme of this
project is to extend the geometric Langlands program from objects of dimension
one (in algebraic geometry) to arbitrary dimensions. The goal of the project is
to develop conceptual breakthroughs into a full mathematical machinery. These
breakthroughs include an extension of the basic case of the geometric Langlands
program (the so called geometric Class Field Theory) to arbitrary dimension.
This development is expected to be influential in mathematics, in particular
through the introduction of the relative motivic cohomology. The general
geometric Langlands program will also be investigated, based on recent results
in constructing and generalizing the loop Grassmannian from the point of view of
statistical mechanics.
