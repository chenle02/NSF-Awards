The investigator seeks to develop effective nonparametric likelihood and
resampling methods for dependent or correlated data structures. The project
particularly targets the development of empirical likelihood methodology for
spatial data under nonstandard sampling designs, the investigation of optimal
implementation of the bootstrap in non-stationary temporal and spatial settings,
and the creation of novel resampling methods through data-transformations aimed
at weakening data correlation. This work intends to produce efficient and
accurate statistical methodology for several correlated data structures, which
are applicable without stringent assumptions on the underlying data-generating
process.

Scientific investigations commonly rely on the statistical analysis of data,
which are often correlated in a complex manner. Current statistical metholodogy
depends heavily on selecting probability models to accurately represent the
underlying correlation in data. However, such model selection can be difficult
in practice and any inference drawn from a mistaken model may be misleading.
This research targets developing alternative, model-free tools for valid
statistical inference with correlated data, which are not susceptible to errors
in model choice and can also help advance data inference in scientific areas
such as Environmetrics, Economics, Geology, Astronomy, etc., that naturally
encounter correlated data.
