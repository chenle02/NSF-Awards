The 18th IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks
(ICCCN?09) will be held in San Francisco, CA, USA from August 2 to August 6,
2009. This technical conference is the primary venue for presenting new research
results in the area of computer networking and is widely attended by researchers
and practitioners in the field. Attendance to ICCCN is highly valuable for
graduate students? research and career development. Student participants will
have the opportunity to present their work, attend panel and keynote speech
sessions, and interact with peers engaged in state-of-the-art research in the
field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests funding to support
approximately 10-15 US-based graduate students to attend ICCCN?09. The travel
awards will target graduate students, in particular female and under-represented
minority students, since they often have limited travel funds to attend
conferences, which is an important part of their educational experience.
