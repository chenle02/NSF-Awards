9222684 Lavery The Board on Mathematical Sciences (BMS) and the Board on
Chemical Sciences and Technology (BCST) of the Commission on Physical Sciences,
Mathematics and Applications (CPSMA), National Research Council (NRC) will
conduct a study that will identify research opportunities for the mathematical
sciences, appropriate for both collaborative work will chemical scientists and
for independent work, relevant to computational chemistry. The primary goal of
the study is to engage the talent of more mathematical scientists to work on
problems in computational chemistry, which should produce advances of benefit to
both the mathematical and chemical sciences. This study will produce a report,
written in language accessible to both chemical and mathematical scientists,
that presents a number of open problems in computational chemistry that have
mathematical components, to give mathematical scientists sufficient background
for initiating relevant research either independently or in collaboration with
chemical scientists. The report will also identify some of the intellectual and
administrative barriers that often hinder crossdisciplinary research related to
computational chemistry, and make recommendations to the research communities,
policymakers, and federal funding agencies on how to overcome or minimize these
barriers.
