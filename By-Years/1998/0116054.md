With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at John Carroll University will acquire Isothermal
Titration and Differential Scanning Calorimetry Instruments. This equipment will
enhance research in a number of areas including a) characterization of the
effect of nonpolar solutes on coulombic interactions; b) organic and
organoalkali structure and reactivity; c) determination of protein structure at
solid/liquid interfaces and examination of sol-gel synthetic routes to alumina
films; d) measurement of binding strengths of various metals to organometallic
fragments; and e) analysis of surfaces of powders.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) is an extremely
useful tool in modern analytical chemistry. Calorimetric analysis is used to
measure the thermal energy (heat) exchange that occurs during molecular
interactions and reactions. Thus DSC provides a very reliable and sensitive
method for determining the thermodynamic properties of materials such as changes
in heat capacity of liquid and solid samples. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
