Cronmiller IBN-9723350 During reproduction in most animals, oogenesis is a
multicellular process that appears to require complex patterns of intercellular
communication to promote the growth and differentiation of the mature egg. Basic
follicular form in a wide diversity of animals consists of a germlinederived
oocyte surrounded by a somatically-derived epithelium. The actual assembly of
these sometimes complicated multicellular configurations is not at all
understood; however, it is likely that processes such as intercellular
communication, cell migration, differential cell/tissue adhesion and regulation
of cell proliferation play important roles, and that the study of such cellular
mechanisms of morphogenesis during gonadogenesis, and especially the genetic
networks that direct them, will lead to new insights into similar events in
other tissues and at other stages of development. Oogenesis in Drosophila
melanogaster provides an ideal system for elucidating basic cell biological and
genetic regulatory mechanisms that mediate the derivation, assembly and function
of multicellular follicles. Indeed, functional roles in follicle formation have
been described for a number of genes that also have essential roles in
developmental processes outside of oogenesis, including neurogenesis and sex
determination. The goal of this project is to discover how one of these genes,
daughterless, functions during ovarian follicle formation and maturation. This
project includes three specific aims. First, to test whether daughterless
protein function during ovarian follicle morphogenesis is regulated by
phosphorylation via the MAP kinase signal transduction pathway. Second, to test
whether daughterless gene function regulates somatic cell proliferation and/or
the maintenance of multicellular organization during ovarian follicle formation
and maturation. And third, to define the roles of new genes that participate
with daughterless in its somatic ovary function.
