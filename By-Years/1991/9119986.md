This speculative research is concerned with the preparation of a new family of
materials called CRYPTATIUMs derived from complexes between organic ligand
(cryptands) and metal cations called cryptates. These compounds can be described
as internal or "intramolecular radical anion-cation pairs." The metal is bond by
an organic ligand which at the same time contains on or more unpaired electrons.
These materials will be generated by reduction of appropriate metal cryptates
and will be characterized both in solution and solid phase with cyclic
voltametry, coulometry, ESR, electronic spectroscopy, X-ray diffractometry, etc.
The significance of CRYPTATIUMs as electronic materials remains to be explored.
