The overall goal of this program is to explore the chemical and traditional
synthesis, processing and microwave dielectric properties of novel ceramics in
the system tantalum oxide-zirconium dioxide. The investigation will be conducted
to gain deeper insights into the fundamental relationships between the atomic
level defects, heterogeneous interfaces and dielectric properties. The
measurement results of quality factor, dielectric constant and temperature
coefficients of these properties will be correlated to the observed
microstructure and the far infrared reflectance spectra. The program will
establish the collaboration with engineers and scientists from industries and
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The proposed work will
explore the fundamental understanding and relationship between the atomic level
defects, heterogeneous interfaces and microwave dielectric properties and its
temperature dependence. The program will establish the collaboration with
industries and government laboratories (NIST).
