The objective of this work is to advance the theoretical understanding of
multirate digital filter banks, to develop structures and methods to design the
required filters, to address the computational complexity and architecture for
VLSI implementation, and finally to explore applications such as subband coding
of images and video as well as the analysis and synthesis of nonstationary
signals.
