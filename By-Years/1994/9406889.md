9406889 Ruckenstein With the discovery of conductive polymers, the possibility
to combine the versatility of polymers with the electrical properties of metals
became possible. However, the initial conductive polymers were insoluble and
infusible and thus not processable, and had poor mechanical properties, being
brittle. In this proposal an extremely simple procedure is suggested to prepare
conductive composite materials. The procedure is so simple, that it may acquire
industrial significance. For a composite polymer formed of a conductive polymer,
which is responsible for the conductivity, and a host polymer, which is
responsible for the mechanical properties, to have good electrical and
mechanical characteristics, the two components must be mixed very uniformly. The
present ensures the uniform oxidation of pyrrol, and hence a uniform
distribution of polypyrrol in the host polymer. Electrified conductivity,
mechanical properties and morphology will be determined for the resulting
materials. We expect to develop a procedure for the preparation of a composite
polymer which will have a good electrical conductivity > 1S/cm and good
mechanical properties. The selection of the host polymer and of the surfactant
which will be employed to obtain the oxidative solution are extremely important.
