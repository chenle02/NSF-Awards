The University of Texas at Austin conducts three series of Summer Science Camps
annually for 150 African-American and Hispanic youths entering the eighth and
ninth grades. Designed to build a coherent and solid foundation among minority
middle schoolers for an interest in and understanding of science and
mathematics, these programs are presented in the context of existing Outreach
Centers established by the University in major concentrations of target
minorities in Austin, Dallas, and the Rio Grande Valley. The SSC environment and
activities are designed to bring the participant into immediate and personal
contact with the people and "things" of science, mathematics and technology by
having them participate in a wide range of research processes and interacting
with active mathematicians, engineers and scientists. The focus of each of the
SSC's curricula is embodied in a major yearly theme for each site that is
derived from the particular nature of local student populations and the
available resources of that area (e.g. basic foundations, robotics and space
technology, ecology/plant/animal study, and agribusiness and genetic
engineering, etc.). SSC student participants will interact with teachers trained
in teacher enhancement programs, thus matching the middle schoolers with trained
science and mathematics teachers that they will likely encounter in upper middle
and high school. The ultimate designed outcome of this interaction is the
creation of "student-teacher allies" in the academic-year classroom who are
bound together by both shared interest and common experience in the science and
mathematics learning process.
