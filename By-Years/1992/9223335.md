The goal of this project is to initiate a fine-grained analysis of
relationships between demographic and behavioral processes on the one hand and
genetic structure on the other, in a natural, complexly organized mammalian
population, savannah baboons (Papio cynocephalus), of Amboseli National Park,
Kenya. Data on births, deaths, movements of males among social groups, social
dominance, and reproductive behavior in three groups of free-living baboons
extend back for almost two full generations, over a 20-year period, and provide
a unique data set for the study. A significant characteristic of the multi-male,
multi-female baboon groups, and those of most other monkey species, is their
strongly matrilineal structure. The effects, within and among groups, of this
matrilineal structure will be evaluated through analysis of maternally
inherited, mitochondrial, DNA. Within individual social groups, long-term as
well as short-term patterns of male residency, social dominance status, mate
choice, and variability in female reproductive success are predicted to impact
on patterns of genetic variability, both separately and in combination.
Microsatellite genotyping, involving development of a microsatellite library for
biparentally inherited, nuclear DNA, will be used to investigate these effects.
An understanding of relationships between genetic variability and that of
demography and social structure is critical for use of contemporary information
to make inferences about the history of natural populations and projections of
their future, as in evolutionary and conservation biology. Both the development
of the molecular techniques and the empirical findings obtained in this research
will have potentially broad application to other systems.
