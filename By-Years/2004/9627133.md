This action funds a National Science Foundation Postdoctoral Research
Fellowship in Biosciences Related to the Environment for 1996. The fellowship
supports research and training in the area of ecology. Ecological diversity in
the montane meadows of the Sierra Nevada altered by livestock grazing is being
studied to determine the causes and consequences of spatial variation in the re-
establishment of native graminoid species. A rule-based model will incorporate
site-specific, qualitative, and anecdotal information to predict shrub-
graminoid dyanamics at a given site. A series of field experiments will
investigate the interplay between causal processes regulating graminoid recovery
and physical conditions, such as water availability, known to be important in
determining ecological parameters. This study bridges the gap between ecology
and resource management by combining quantitative and qualitative knowledge to
determine the information necessary to evaluate the ecological consequences of
alternative management options.
