Mechanism of Particle Incorporation Into Microbial Cellulose &lt;br/&gt;Bequette
&lt;br/&gt;BES-0411693&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the proposed research, a rotating
disk bioreactor will be used to produce cohesive cellulose films rapidly because
of the high surface area, high volumetric efficiency, low power consumption, and
easy control at the optimum sugar concentration and pH. The novel feature is
that solids added to the medium enter the gel and are held at selected
locations. Different solid materials such as silica gel, glass spheres, metallic
powders, carbon, and common plant cellulose can be incorporated into the gel in
which stripes or bands of solids can be formed. These new composites have
potential applications for medicine, bioprocessing, and manufacture of novel
forms of paper. There are a number of challenging fundamental problems in
reactor design and control. Incorporation of solid particles into the gelatinous
matrix of bacterial cellulose involves complicated fluid/particle hydrodynamics.
The proposed research will measure rates of incorporation of solid particles as
functions of angular velocity and concentration of particles in the medium by
determining amounts in locations of the gel by examination with a microscope.
Behavior of mixtures of different sizes and types of particles will be studied
with consideration of hydrophobicity and zeta potential. &lt;br/&gt;
