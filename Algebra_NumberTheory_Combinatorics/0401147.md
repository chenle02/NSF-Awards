This project has two parts: an investigation of the independence numbers of the
powers of fixed graphs and a study of the emergence of a giant component in
`guided' versions of the classical random graph. The first part is motivated by
the many open questions regarding the Shannon capacities of graphs and focuses
on the possible behaviors of the sequence given by the independence numbers of
the powers of a fixed graph. The odd cycles and their complements are
particularly important examples and play a central role in this part of the
project. While a wide range of techniques -- including algebraic methods -- may
be useful here, recent progress has come through the interplay of novel
constructions for, and structural conditions imposed on large independent sets
in these graph powers. In the second part of this project we study the component
structure in the random graph processes known as Achlioptas processes, processes
in which a pair of random edges is presented in each round and an on-line
algorithm chooses between them. Here we are interested in the existence, timing
and nature of a phase transition in the size of the largest component. A
principle tool here is the differential equations method for establishing
concentration in random graph processes.

This research is in the area of extremal combinatorics. Questions considered in
this field are of the form: `How large (or small) can an object that lies in a
particular discrete mathematical system and satisfies a certain condition be?'
We are often concerned with the behavior of the size of the extremal objects as
the size of the underlying system goes to infinity. Interest in such questions
grew extensively during the twentieth century. Pioneers of the field, such as
Paul Erd\H{o}s, posed many fascinating questions of this form and devised
powerful methods for solving them even before the close connections between
extremal combinatorics and various other fields (including theoretical computer
science, statistical physics and information theory) were discovered. The
Shannon capacities of graphs are a classic example of the close interaction
between extremal combinatorics and the theory of communication. The Shannon
capacity gives a measure of the optimal zero-error performance of a noisy
communication channel and is centrally important in information theory. At the
same time, it gives rise to natural questions in extremal combinatorics and
graph theory. Some of these questions are addressed in this research project.
