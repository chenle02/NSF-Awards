It is proposed that a statewide, TCP/IP-based network be established,
connecting major universities and research centers in the state of Virginia.
This network will provide needed access for Virginia researchers to the National
Centers for Advanced Scientific Computation, and will stimulate the growth of
the supercomputer user community. This is the second phase of a two-phase
implementation. The first phase involved the establishment of access to
NSFnet/SURAnet at Virginia Tech. The proposed network in this phase would
substantially improve communications amoung researchers within the state, but
would also provide accessibility to the national supercomputer centers for a
significant research community. This project would provide connections to the
SURAnet and NSFnet for, Old Dominion University, Virginia Commonweaelth
University, and numerous other statewide research centers and institutions.
