The detection of the signs of specific diseases in earlier human populations is
a long-standing goal of physical anthropology. By so doing one can better
understand the factors affecting our ancestors and guiding their development and
adaptation. The demographics of earlier groups, the social and biological
responses to disease and the like can be clarified with such information. In the
past, however, there has been much uncertainty in the identification of lesions
on the skeleton caused by specific diseases. Salo and Aufderheide will use DNA
technology to test the ability to identify specific pathogens in ancient human
remains from the New World. They will attempt to identify the DNA of M.
tuberculosis in the mummified remains of New World individuals who exhibit
skeletal and soft tissue signs of the disease. Secondly, if the DNA of the
pathogen is found, they will seek to determine if it varies from contemporary M.
tuberculosis. This may provide insight into the changes in the microbe over
time. Tuberculosis is a good starting point as it has been established in
ancient mummies. If successful, this technique should be extendable to other
pathogens.
