This award provides one-half the funds necessary to construct a micro-sampling
system for the extraction of oxygen from silicates for isotopic analysis. The
system will be attached to a mass spectrometer in the Department of Geosciences
at the Pennsylvania State University. The University will provide the remaining
funds for the project. The micro-sampling system will permit oxygen isotope
analysis of sub-milligram samples and the in situ study of isotope gradients on
the millimeter scale. The improved micro- sampling system will be applied to the
isotopic analysis of diamonds and other mantle-derived minerals.
