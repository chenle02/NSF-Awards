The spotted hyena, Crocuta crocuta, is unique among mammals in exhibiting many
behavioral differences between males and females that are reversed from normal
mammalian sex-role patterns. Of particular interest is the observation that
females are far more aggressive than males, and socially dominant to them. Drs.
Holekamp and Frank will carry out a 3-year field study of behavioral development
in spotted hyenas. The objectives of the research are to (1) document the
emergence in infants, and maintenance in sub-adult hyenas, of behavioral
differences between males and females, and (2) test several hypotheses
suggesting factors promoting expression of such dimorphic behaviors as dispersal
and dominance interactions. The study animals comprise one large hyena "clan" in
the Masai Mara National Reserve, Kenya. Age, sex, kin relations, and social
status are known for all clan members. Data collection will involve radio
telemetry and four behavior-sampling protocols: scan samples, focal-animal
observations, critical-incident samples, and standardized behavioral tests
administered at the study site. The research will generate useful information in
at least three ways: It will (1) provide comparative data on behavioral
development available for no other social carnivores, (2) facilitate
interpretation of data obtained in a concurrent study of behavioral
endocrinology and development in captive hyenas, and (3) permit Drs. Holekamp
and Frank, in conjunction with the captive study, to determine whether any of
the same social, ecological, and physiological variables known to influence
development of sex differences in behavior in rodents and primates also operate
in this species.
