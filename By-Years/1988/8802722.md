This research is to investigate (i) resampling methods for robust assessments
of the precision and significance of statistical estimates, (ii) the
construction of reference sets for statistical inference from experimental and
observational studies, (iii) methods for choosing and using scale
transformations to enlarge the scope of standard statistical methods, (iv)
generalized regression models, (v) likelihood theory and methods, (vi) mixtures
of distributions, (vii) comparative tests with truncated data. This research is
in the field of Statistics. The new methods proposed have become feasible with
affordable computing. Improvement over existing statistical methods is foreseen,
specifically when data is sparse and when they are not obtained under in
controlled experiments.
