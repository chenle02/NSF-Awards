They will concentrate their research on the following subjects: a) to study the
lattice dynamics of the high-temperature superconducting compounds, and b) to
continue their theoretical- numerical investigations of the structure, and the
vibrational and related properties of surfaces of crystals. Finally they will
continue their ongoing collaboration with surface experimental groups to
contribute to the interpretation of experimental data on surface dynamics and
adsorbate dynamics.
