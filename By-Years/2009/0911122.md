With the rapid increase in new research findings, new tools and techniques, the
soon-to-be-finished genome, the increased number of laboratories that work in
all aspects of Medicago truncatula biology, and recent projects on next-
generation genotyping in Medicago, a Medicago-specific meeting would benefit
many researchers. The 2009 Medicago truncatula Model Legume Congress, to be held
July 12-16, 2009 at the Asilomar Conference Grounds, Pacific Grove, CA, will
provide such a venue for the international Medicago community. Scientific
sessions will cover recent advances in legume biology, including symbiosis and
other plant-microbe interactions, plant development relevant to legumes,
nutrient homeostasis and secondary metabolism, and ecological genomics. Cross
cutting themes will include subjects such as genome analysis (especially next
generation technologies, phylogenetics and comparative genomics), ecology and
population genetics, natural and induced variation, as well as bioinformatics
and functional genomics tool development. The Congress will emphasize cross
cutting themes and participation of researchers at all career stages, and will
strive for gender balance. The participation of graduate students, postdoctoral
and beginning investigators will be fostered through travel awards to attend the
Congress. Funding provided by NSF will be used to broaden participation of young
scientists from the US scientific community and from developing countries.
Conference program and abstracts will be publicly available online on the
conference website and through a program book of abstracts that will be
distributed to meeting attendees.
