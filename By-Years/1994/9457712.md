In this NSF Young Investigator Award in the Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, James R. Heath will focus on understanding and controlling
the chemistry and physics of size and shape on a nanometer-length scale, with
emphasis on Group IV and III-V quantum crystals. The physics of size and shape
is probed through a variety of single-particle and time- and frequency-resolved
spectroscopies. Silicon and germanium quantum dots, atomically straight Ge
quantum wires, and atomically flat Ge quantum wells have all been synthesized
and are candidates for study. Ordered, complex structures over three dimensions
will be prepared by coupling wires, dots, and platelets together. Self-assembly
techniques are also investigated. Biological systems are also being examined as
templates on which to fabricate tiny superconducting metal wires. %%% The
synthetic methods developed and investigated under this award offer the promise
for substantially better size resolution than state-of-the-art lithographic
techniques. The challenge in this program is to learn how to assemble nanometer-
size structures over two dimensions with regularity. Such nano-scale structures
are important in the fabrication of miniaturized electronic devices which could
help form the microchips for future applications.
