First order logic is suitable for describing and studying classes of "discrete"
structures: fields, groups, graphs, etc. Model theory, and in particular
stability theory, provided several striking structure theorems for such classes:
for example, the fact that every vector space is determined by (the cardinality
of) a linear base, while every algebraically closed fields is determined by a
transcendence base, are both special cases of Morley's Theorem: in any class of
structure to which this theorem applies, all structures are generated by a
suitable base. Shelah's classification theory is a vast generalisation of
Morley's Theorem, yielding structure theorems to many more classes of
structures. While all these theories were developed for classes of discrete
structures, they seems to hold, at least to some extent, for classes of metric,
or "continuous" structures: for example, compare Morley's theorem with the fact
that every Hilbert space is generated (as a complete metric vector space) by an
orthonormal base. This proposal seeks to further adapt classical structure
results from stability and classification theory to classes of continuous
structures.

This proposal therefore seeks to extend the results and techniques of stability
theory, and in particular superstability, to the setting of continuous first
order logic, aiming towards a generalisation of Shelah's Main Gap Theorem.
Continuous first order logic has the advantage of being a natural generalisation
of first order logic, while at the time accommodating many natural classes of
(metric) structures arising in functional analysis and probability theory
(various classes of Banach spaces possibly with additional structure, measure
algebras of probability spaces and of adapted spaces, etc.) New complications
arising from the presence of a non-discrete metric require us to revise the
fundamental definitions (superstability, ranks, etc.), and renders most of the
classical theory, and in particular the notion of regular types, seemingly
inapplicable. Nevertheless there has been considerable progress recently in this
direction, such as an adaptation of Lachlan's theorem to continuous superstable
theories, and there are indications that similar techniques can be used towards
finiteness of weight and its consequences, which seem the natural next step
towards the achievement of this programme.
