The Sierra Nevada batholith in eastern California may conceal major sinistral or
dextral faults that truncate older structural trends. Within the batholith are
several pendants of metamorphic rocks that extend across several
intrabatholithic breaks inferred from strontium isotopic data. This project will
examine these rocks to determine their structure, stratigraphy and U-Pb
geochronology in order to test whether there are structural breaks that coincide
with the isotopic changes in the batholith. Results will bear on major problems
in the reconstruction of the southwestern United States during the Mesozoic.
