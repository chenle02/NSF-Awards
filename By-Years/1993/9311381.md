Description: This proposal is for group travel to the binational workshop on:
"Durability of Concrete Structures" to be held in Bangalore, India, August
26-28. Professors D.V. Reddy of Florida Atlantic University and V.S.
Parameswaran, of the Indian Concrete Institute and the Structural Engineering
Research Centre, Madras, are the principal organizers. The magnitude of the
durability problem is of considerable concern to the developed and developing
countries. The primary objective of this workshop is to highlight the most
recent advances in the U.S. and India, with special focus on reinforced,
prestressed concrete composites. Composites may be fiber reinforced, ferrocement
or polymer concretes. Scope: Interaction with Indian engineers should be
beneficial for U.S. engineers. The concrete industry is highly developed in
India and quite influential since they provide considerable technical support to
neighboring countries. This is an excellent opportunity for the exchange of
ideas and experience with engineers at Indian universities and research
institutes. The proceedings of the workshop will be published. The India Program
recommends travel and per diem support for six U.S. researchers plus for the
publication of the workshop proceedings.
