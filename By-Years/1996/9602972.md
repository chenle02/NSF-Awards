9602972 Berry This Americas Program award will support Dr. Paul E. Berry,
Missouri Botanical Garden, and Dr. Otto Huber, Fundacion Instituto Botanico de
Venezuela, in a collaborative project to complete an updated and computerized
catalog of the vascular plants of Venezuela. The catalog will be assembled as a
database in Microsoft Access and will become the core of a standardized plant
nomenclature and inventory system centered at the National Herbarium in Caracas.
A printed version of the catalog will also be produced and distributed to all
interested parties. The completion of this project will result in a wider
accessibility and use of plant-related data to Venezuela and a framework will be
established that will facilitate general herbarium curation, as well as provide
structured data for individualized projects such as Geographic Information
systems and environmental impact studies. ***
