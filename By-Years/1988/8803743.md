A biaxial servo-hydraulic testing machine will be used to study interfacial
shear and biaxial interfacial fatigue of an aluminum- epoxy bimaterial. Such
studies will improve our understanding of the dominant failure modes of
debonding, delamination and crack growth in composite materials. The results
would form the basis for designing stronger and tougher composite materials.
