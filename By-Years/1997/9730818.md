This project was submitted for consideration under the NSF Program, "Career
Advancement Awards for Minority Scientists and Engineers". The research consists
of a series of atmospheric methane measurements that will provide a North-South
Pacific Ocean transect distribution for methane abundance and stable carbon
isotopic composition (13C and 12C). The main scientific objectives of the
measurements are to determine the latitudinal mixing ratios of atmospheric
methane in order to understand the dominant sources that might be contributing
to its increasing global concentration levels. &lt;br/&gt; Surface clean air
samples will be analyzed for 13C/12C, D/H and mixing ratios at different
latitudes and longitudes from shipboard collections. The collections will be
made from a transect of the Pacific Ocean between Los Angeles, CA and Auckland,
New Zealand. The air samples (collected using pressurized cylinders) will be
analyzed using GC/FID (methane concentration) and for 13C/12C and D/H abundances
using a isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS, Finnigan MAT). Data will be
incorporated into an existing database for a global distribution of atmospheric
methane abundance and isotopic composition. Overall, the study will help to
develop global information on atmospheric methane that can be incorporated into
models which assess the secular trends, source strengths, and influence of this
important greenhouse on global climate.&lt;br/&gt;
