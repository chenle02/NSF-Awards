AST-0204908&lt;br/&gt;Paczynski, Bohdan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Optical
Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) has undergone a major upgrade from a
2000 x 2000 CCD camera (OGLE-II) to a mosaic 8000 x 8000 CCD camera (OGLE-III).
The new system&lt;br/&gt;became operational in the summer 2001, and it is
expected to be fully streamlined, with a real time detection of microlensing
events, by 2002. The 1.3 meter OGLE telescope is located at the Las Campanas
Observatory in Chile. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the OGLE-II, Dr. Paczynski and
his colleagues were detecting about 170 microlensing events per year. With the
OGLE-III and new software, they expect to detect up to 1,000 events per year.
This high rate virtually guarantees a detection of Jupiter mass planets and
stellar mass black&lt;br/&gt;holes. The same data will be searched for planetary
transits. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Almost all OGLE-II data (1997-2000) are now
available on WWW and on DAT, in a highly&lt;br/&gt;compressed format: 1 Terra
Byte of original CCD images has been reduced to less than 10 GB.&lt;br/&gt;The
archive includes high signal-to-noise images of about 16 square degrees in the
Galactic Bulge, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), and the Small Magellanic Cloud
(SMC), and the photometry of about 30 million non-variable stars. The AC archive
has 300 - 400 data points for about 250 thousand variable stars. The group
expects to make the photometry of about one million variable stars detected by
OGLE-III available on-line, first within 24 hours, and some time later within 10
minutes of taking CCD images. OGLE data will be used to study the structure of
our Galaxy, the structure of the LMC and SMC, as well as to determine ever more
accurate distance scale.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
