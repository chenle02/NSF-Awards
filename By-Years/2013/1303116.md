This is a proposal to improve empirical models of the mapping of ionospheric
field-aligned currents (FAC) as a function of interplanetary magnetic field
(IMF) by using data which are both more accurate and of large volume than those
used in previous models. This mapping will cover an entire solar cycle. The
magnetic field data to be used in the FAC calculation will come from th Oersted,
CHAMP and eventually Swarm missions. Solar wind data will come from the ACE
satellite. The team will use the FAC to develop mappings of the Poynting flux.
This in turn will aid prediction of density and temperature in the upper
atmosphere. Intervals with polar cap potential saturation during large magnetic
storms will be examined to see if the current density and total current will
saturate. &lt;br/&gt;A graduate student will be supported by this grant. The PI
has an excellent record of disseminating his models to the larger science
community.
