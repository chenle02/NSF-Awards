Description: In a joint project, Dr. Victor Zakkay of New York University
(NYU), and Drs. V. Krishna Sastri and A.K. Kolar of the Indian Institute of
Technology, Madras (IITM) plan to extend their studies on Pressurized Fluid Bed
Combustion (PFBC). The studies will focus on the fundamental areas of concern to
PFBC including: parametric studies on vertical heat exchangers; bubble dynamics
with immersed horizontal and vertical heat exchangers; and combustion and
emission characteristics of high moisture lignite, high ash coal and high
sulpher coal. Tests will be conducted at a recently completed facility for PFBC
at the IITM which has a combustor of 30 cm diameter, and is capable of operating
up to 15 atmospheric pressure. Scope: This project extends for two years the
support provided earlier by NSF to the U.S. and Indian scientists for studies
aimed at understanding the parameters affecting the behavior of PFBC and the
usefulness of this method of coal combustion. The facility at IITM and the
Indian staff provide excellent opportunity for extending and broadening the
investigations being conducted in the U.S. and other countries in this field.
The importance of PFBC is well recognized in both countries as well as by other
countries with low quality coal. The project has the backing of the Government
of India as well as major coal users in that country. Funding: The project is
funded under two grants: INT 9106224 to the Indian Institute of Technology,
Madras. INT 9012682 to New York University.
