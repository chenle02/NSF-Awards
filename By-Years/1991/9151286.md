Southwest Texas State University is creating an x-ray crystallography laboratory
for structure determination of inorganic/organometallic compounds in the
advanced inorganic chemistry courses and undergraduate research.Single crystals
of interesting compounds are obtained from their own undergraduate research
laboratories and those at cooperating institutions
