Raleigh, NC 27695-7905 ILI - Leadership in Laboratory Development: Engineering
Title: Freshman Laboratory for Product and Process Engineering A Product and
Process Engineering laboratory has been established for freshmen engineering
students. The purpose of the laboratory is to bring students together in teams
of three in order to explore fully operative, familiar devices (e.g.,
videocamera, videocassette recorder, photocopier, bar code scanner) by playing
the successive roles of user, assembler, and engineer analyst. The lab places
emphasis on a "hands-on" approach to each device and on working in teams.
Results from pilot offerings in summer '93(12 students) and '94(18 students)
indicate that this method creates an atmosphere in which students teach each
other effectively, and in which women and minorities feel very comfortable and
receive a positive and inclusive introduction to engineering. The objective of
the project is the demonstration of a cost efficient manpower design and scale-
up of this novel freshmen laboratory to handle a full cohort of up to 216
students per year for two years. Three 24 student sections/semester are offered
in '95-'96 and five sections/semester in '96-'97. The method of laboratory
execution involves roles for students, undergraduate and graduate teaching
assistants, and the faculty director. The students, working in teams of three,
examine each of six devices or processes. The senior undergraduates provide lab
assistance and are selected so that they serve as role models for women and
minority freshmen. The graduate teaching assistant (one per section) has general
instruction and lab maintenance responsibilities for each section, and serves as
back-up technica l consultant to the seniors. The faculty leader provides an
initial week of hands-on training of seniors and graduate assistants with the
lab devices prior to each semester, and leads the student discussion sections on
outside readings, and maintains oversight of the laboratory operations. The
project is significant because it provides an immediate "hands-on" introduction
to engineering to freshmen students in a manner which includes teamwork, oral
communication and presentation skills, and is conducive to the recruitment and
retention of underrepresented groups.
