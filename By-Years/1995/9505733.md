9505733 Chamot The Board in Infrastructure and the Constructed Environment BICE
oversees programs of study dealing with the broad areas of infrastructure
systems and services, and national policies related to sustainable cities,
development of new technologies for construction and infrastructure renewal,
management of infrastructure services, and other issues in which there is much
interest in many parts of the federal government. As the Board is newly created,
it needs to develop a strategic plan and a new program of studies of interest to
potential sponsors. This proposal provides for partial support to support and
maintain Board activities, promote interchange between the Board the potential
sponsors, and develop a program interchange between the Board and potential
sponsors, and develop a program of studies that will both serve the needs of
sponsors and permit the development of a robust support structure.
