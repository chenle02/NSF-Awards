In this proposal we propose several projects of geometric significance. Among
the projects proposed is the study of the stable sympelctic category. This
category is the stabilization of A. Weinstein's symplectic category (which is a
domain category for geometric quantization). We achieve stabilization by
inverting the symplectic manifold given by the complex plane. The resulting
stable category is extremely tractable, and retains a lot of structure (like an
action of the Grothendieck-Teichmuller group that was conjectured by
Kontsevich). Another project proposed is the continuing study of real Johnson-
Wilson theories, with collaborator W.S.Wilson. This is a computationally
accessible theory that contains higher-level information which can be used to
solve several geometric problems like the non-immersion problem. Among other
projects proposed include the study of the homotopical and representation
theoretic properties of Kac-Moody groups. These groups are of interest in
mathematical physics and topology.

The major thrust of the above proposal is to construct and apply (homotopical)
techniques and methods designed to better understand hard geometric questions
that may be of interest to a wide variety of mathematicians and mathematical-
physicists. One such technique is called stabilization, which suitably
linearizes a possibly intractable question, thereby making it accessible. The
process often allows us to gain a lot of insight into the original problem.
Another technique studied is the study via classifying spaces. The classifying
space is a construction that takes the set of symmetries of a geometric object,
and encodes them into a space that can then be studied in standard ways to
recover information about the original geometric object.
