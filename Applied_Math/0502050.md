This award will support to organize a multidisciplinary conference entitled "The
Sixth Mississippi State - UAB Conference on Differential Equations and
Computational Simulations" with a mission of providing a joint forum where
mathematicians, scientists, and engineers from the academia and industry
exchange research and education ideas. The conference is a collaborative
endeavor between the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Mississippi
State University and Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of
Alabama at Birmingham. The co-sponsors of the conference are Engineering
Research Center (ERC) at Mississippi State University, Electronic Journal of
Differential Equations (EJDE), and Institute for Mathematics and its
Applications (IMA). This two-day conference will offer ten invited lectures by
expert researchers and around 70 contributed papers. The majority of the funds
will be used to provide travel expenses to the graduate students and new Ph.D.s.
In particular, special effort will be made to encourage the participation of
students and recent Ph.D.s from the underrepresented groups.

Lectures by the outstanding principal speakers and the participation and
interaction of around 150 interdisciplinary researchers would significantly
impact the development of this field. The primary objective of the conference is
to optimally fulfill the aforestated mission, while at the same time to promote
research and education in mathematical and computational analysis of
differential equations and associated simulations. The conference will also
provide graduate students and young Ph.D.s an opportunity to present their work,
meet other researchers, educators and practitioners, learn of recent
developments in the proposed interdisciplinary field, and produce a new
generation of mathematical models and challenges.
