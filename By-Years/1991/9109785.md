Large order eigenproblems arise in a variety of applications. The long computing
times and large storage requirements of these problems motivate development of
fast serial and efficient parallel eigensolvers. New numerical methods will be
investigated for computing all eigenvalues and eigenvectors of real unsymmetric
tridiagonal matrices that arise in applications and from reduction of general
real matrices. The immediate goal is to provide new methods for the tridiagonal
case. Because current methods for the general eigenproblem can suffer from
parallel inefficiency or numerical instability, the larger goal is to develop
accurate parallel methods that might ultimately be extended to the general
eigenproblem without initial reduction to tridiagonal form. The research derives
from methods that have been successful for the symmetric tridiagonal
eigenproblem. The work will begin with a study of parallel methods for computing
eigenvectors of an unsymmetric tridiagonal matrix given its computed
eigenvalues. It will continue by developing divide and conquer methods to
compute both eigenvalues and eigenvectors of an unsymmetric tridiagonal matrix.
It will conclude with a mechanism for roughly locating the eigenvalues of any
tridiagonal matrix. The latter technique is geared toward accelerating
rootfinding methods for computing eigenvalues. Serial and parallel algorithms
will be designed, implemented, and tested for all approaches.
