Zhang The investigator intends to study Arakelov theory. The following are some
proposed problems: a) Arakelov theory of stable curves and their moduli spaces
using Poincare metric; b) Application of the equidistribution theorem of small
points to Serre's open image type theorem for high dimensional abelian
varieties, and to Chinberg and Rumely's capacity theory; c) Verification of two
conjectures on Hecke algebras and heights on CM-cycles of high weight for
Shimura abelian varieties; d) Study the Arakelov zeta function and apply it to a
probabilistic version of the effective version of Mordell conjecture. This is
research in the intersection of the fields of number theory and algebraic
geometry. In its origin, number theory studied integral solutions of polynomial
equations, while algebraic geometry treated figures that could be defined by
polynomial equations. Nowadays the fields make use of methods not only from
algebra, but also from analysis, topology, and differential geometry, and
conversely are finding application in those fields as well as in physics,
theoretical computer science, and robotics.
