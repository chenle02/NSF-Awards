This project trains undergraduates in noninvasive techniques to study biological
principles and physiological functions of mammalian animals. They also receive
exposure to new technologies that are developing exponentially, Ultrasound and
computer equipment, for example, are used to monitor lean tissue and adipose
accumulation, identify soft tissue injuries, and monitor reproductive functions.
Ultrasound instruction and computer applications are also being implemented in
laboratory sections of core classes. Overall, Instruction supplements concepts
introduced in lecture, and students become familiar with use of equipment and
interpretation of ultrasound images and scientific data. The noninvasive
capability of the equipment also provides a unique ability to study basic
biological properties which are applicable to all mammals.
