Experiments will be conducted in the millimeter and submillimeter wave spectral
range by using complementary experimental techniques developed at UCLA and at
the Institute of General Physics, Center for Submillimeter Radiophysics, Moscow.
The focus is on the electrodynamics of various highly correlated solids in their
Fermi liquid, in the superconducting and density wave states. These experiments
are expected to give important information on both single particle and
collective excitations. %%% Optical experiments will be conducted at UCLA and at
the Institute of General Physics, Moscow, over a broad frequency spectrum by
utilizing complementary instruments available at the two Institutions. The
optical conductivity and dielectric properties of several new types of materials
will be examined at different temperatures. New methods which will enable the
measurement of optical characteristics will also be developed.
