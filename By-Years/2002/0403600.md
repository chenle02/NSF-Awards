This Interagency Agreement supports activities of the Interagency Arctic
Research Policy Committee (IARPC) for which NSF has lead agency role. These
activities include editing and preparation of the camera copy of the Spring and
Fall 2004 issues of the Journal, Arctic Research of the United States. The
Journal serves an essential step in fulfilling the requirements of Public Law
98-373, the Arctic Research and Policy Act. It contains information on research
activities of the Federal agencies involved in the Arctic and reports and
minutes of meetings from the Arctic Research Commission and IARPC. Under this
agreement, CRREL also provides editorial support services for the U.S. Arctic
Research Plan and the IARPC.
