Data intelligence research on turning data into actionable intelligence and
insights is at the heart of many disciplines, including computer science,
mathematics, chemistry, business, and biology. This research instrumentation
project involves the acquisition of a mass storage system to enhance the storage
capacity of a High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster. This will enable
researchers at the awardee and neighboring institutions to conduct studies in:
scalable computational algorithms for big data analysis; finding answers to
customized questions by reasoning over large-scale unstructured data; the
development of deep learning techniques for two- and three-dimensional
biological and medical image analysis; and other big data research challenges.
The instrumentation also creates an opportunity for students to participate in a
variety of research and training activities related to data
intelligence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project provides better storage capacity
to process and share massive data. The system enables data intelligence research
and training activities by providing flexible storage configurations, data
preservation and recovery, high-performance, large-scale data operations, and
secure data sharing for a broad range of projects. It supports collaboration
across various universities in California, and enables faculty and students to
develop modern scalable solutions to data intelligence
problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
