9412256 Doak This study examines the effects of habitat heterogeneity, spatial
variability, and generalist predators on the structure of the arthropod communty
on rice plants in the Sacramento Valley, California. The research employs large-
scale manipulations (winter flooded vs. unflooded and organically managed vs.
conventionally managed) and small-scale field experiments to assess the
importance of particular species interactions in determining community
structure. Path analysis will allow generation and testing of predictions about
directions and strengths of interactions. This research will improve our
understanding of the factors that control the structure of arthropod
communities. The results of this study will have direct application to
agriculture, especially in assessing the advantages and disadvanteges of organic
farming practices and in rice pest control.
