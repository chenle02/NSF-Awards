This project is mathematical research in complex analysis in dimension greater
than one. The general theme is the exploration of phenomena that cannot occur in
the one-dimensional case. An important notion, well understood in dimension one
but very difficult in higher dimensions, is that of the polynomial hull of a set
in complex space. Recent work by Professor Wermer and a collaborator of his has
led to a new approach to the problem of finding the polynomial hull of a given
set. This approach suggests questions and methods for a number of problems:
polynomial approximation, the study of bounded analytic functions in one
variable, singularities of analytic functions of several variables, and
boundaries of complex manifolds. These problems will be explored using abstract
methods from the theory of function algebras.
