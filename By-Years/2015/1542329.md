This project will support early-career scientists to attend the annual q-BIO
summer conference held at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in
Blacksburg VA from August 5-8, 2015. The conference will bring together
theorists and experimentalists in an effort to advance the theoretical
understanding of complex biological systems. The speaker list includes leaders
in the field from the US and abroad. Junior scientist and students are
encouraged to participate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To gain a deeper understanding
of biology and make use of biological functions for societal benefits, the
biology research enterprise is encouraged to adopt a more integrated approach to
understand the multi-dimensional complexity and dynamics of these systems. This
conference exemplifies one of the ways this can be achieved, namely to bring
together theorists with experimentalists to learn from each other and to forge
meaningful future collaborations. The organizers have made a noteworthy effort
to encourage the participation from underrepresented groups, including women and
minorities.
