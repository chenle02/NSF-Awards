Intellectual Merit: The PIs propose a pilot study to investigate the feasibility
of establishing the structure of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) during
the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) using oxygen isotopes in benthic foraminifera.
While such measurements are plentiful north of the ACC, there is only one
published LGM benthic oxygen isotope measurement south of the ACC. The PIs will
analyze a series of sediment cores south of the ACC to determine if they can
identify cores with the appropriate stratigraphy and sufficient benthic
foraminifera to establish a profile of LGM benthic oxygen isotopes. They will
also investigate the possibility of reconstructing the LGM density contrast
across the ACC based on existing data and dynamical constraints. The outcomes of
this work could provide strong constraints on both the dynamical and
biogeochemical behavior of the ACC, an important component of the ocean-
atmosphere system.

Broader impacts: This work could help fill a gap in current dynamical
understanding of the interactions between atmospheric winds, ocean eddies and
the density structure, which is an area of active research in the climate
dynamics community. The PIs will provide research experience for an
undergraduate student from an under-represented group.
