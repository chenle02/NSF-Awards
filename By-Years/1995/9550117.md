9550117 Eaton Driver's Ed, for Teachers Navigating the Information Superhighway
Northeast Louisiana University This 36 month project directly trains 60 teachers
to use the Internet, to integrate Internet resources with state mandated
curricula, to translate technology into the daily activities of mathematics and
science, and to train their colleagues. The teachers are drawn from the
districts in the vicinity of the university with one or two from each of the
fifteen districts for each year of the project. The intent is to produce a cadre
of well-trained network-literate teachers who can stimulate interest and support
activities using technology. The teachers who participate each year have 12
month graduate assistantships. Preceding their assistantships, they take
"Internet Applications for Educators"via the Internet. While at the university,
they take 9 credits each semester including directed studies and provide 20
hours of classroom support for their peers. Cost sharing is 229%. ***
