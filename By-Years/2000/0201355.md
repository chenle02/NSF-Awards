AST-0201355 Gonzalez, Anthony

Dr. Gonzalez is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral
Fellowship to carry out a program of research and education at the University of
Florida. He will conduct a multiwavelength survey for galaxies of intermediate
redshift which he will use to constrain models of the formation and evolution of
early-type cluster galaxies and assess the validity of estimators of cluster
mass. This redshift regime is one in which the most dramatic evolution in the
properties of galaxies and their clusters occur, and his observations are
designed to provide constraints on cosmological parameters and models of the
formation of structure in the universe. His educational program involves
organizing a public seminar series designed to introduce the general public to
recent discoveries in astrophysics and to serve as a forum for discussion of
astronomical topics appearing in the news. He will also work with science
teachers in local public schools to establish a Project Astro program in north
central Florida. ***
