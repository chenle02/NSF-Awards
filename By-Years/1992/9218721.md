Evidence that large scale extension operates at the same time as overall
compression during tectonic convergence has been observed in several orogens.
The extension is usually at high structural levels while compression is
operating at depth, however the relative extent and displacements are not well
understood. This project continues, investigation of possible Mesozoic extension
in the Bitterroot Mountains of Idaho and Montana that occurred during the Sevier
Orogen. Prior results indicate that extension operated in the Funeral Mountains
of California during this tectonic episode. This work will help determine the
regional extent and importance of this phenomena for the Sevier Orogen. The
results should be applicable to understanding the general significance of
extension in compressional orogens.
