Denali Earthquake SGER Budget UAF&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Geophysical
Institute, University of Alaska Fairbanks carried out a vigorous and immediate
response to the 3 November 2002, MW 7.9, Denali fault earthquake. In the weeks
after the earthquake, UAF personnel installed 28 temporary seismic stations and
surveyed 58 GPS survey points across central and southern Alaska. Three UNAVCO
engineers installed 10 continuous GPS sites near the rupture and UAF currently
has receivers running quasi-continuously at 3 additional survey points. This
proposal requests funding for the immediate earthquake response, for which it is
impossible to wait for normal NSF deadlines and award dates. In future studies,
GPS displacements will be used to determine a coseismic slip model, and GPS data
from the continuous and other sites will provide the critical initial data for
future studies of postseismic deformation. Data from the temporary seismic array
will be critical for aftershock and other seismic studies.&lt;br/&gt;
