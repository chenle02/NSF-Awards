Microwave spectroscopy, with Stark ionization detection, is used on fast beams
of laser-excited atoms, (1) to study high angular momentum states of helium in
order to test relativistic and QED contributions to their structure, (2) to
study such states in the H2+ ion, (3) to study such states in heavy atoms, 4 to
measure the n=4 Lamb shift in H, and 5) to study collisional properties of these
high angular momentum states.
