The Mojave desert between the San Andreas and the Garlock fault zones occupies
a key position in Southwestern U.S. tectonics. Recent results indicate that a
previously unrecognized region of early Miocene-age rifting is present which has
led to the discovery of Mesozoic tectonometamorphic events as well as to an
improved understanding of present strike-slip faulting in the region and its
role in accommodating Pacific- North American plate motion. This renewal will
focus on the structure, timing relations, shear zone petrology and uplift
history of the extensional complex, and will document the depositional history
of syn-and post-tectonic sedimentary rocks in basins adjacent to the core
complex. The timing and conditions of formation of the Mesozoic high-grade
metamorphic rocks exhumed by Miocene detachments will also be addressed. Results
will be applied to the Mesozoic and Cenozoic tectonic and paleogeographic
evolution of the western United States.
