Montana State University operates a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU)
Site affiliated with its Physics Department. Eight students are recruited every
year for a ten-week summer research experience; the recruitment effort targets
Native American Indian Tribal Colleges. Research projects offered to REU
participants focus on materials physics, including research on magnetic, optical
and ferroelectric materials, thin film growth and surface science. Students also
attend research lectures, seminars on written and oral communication skills, and
participate in organized social activities.
