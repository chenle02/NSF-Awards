Historically, the study of plasmas has focused on the evolution of the average
properties of the charged particles in the plasma, the ions and electrons, i.e.,
the density, flow, and temperature of the plasma. In this project, the detailed
motion of both ions and electrons will be investigated under conditions that
reproduce processes that occur naturally in space or at the interface between
plasmas and walls in laboratory magnetized plasma experiments.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The in situ measurement of ion and electron velocity
distribution functions in space has revolutionized the field of space physics,
providing the space physics community an ability to study and understand
kinetic-scale processes; test theories and computational models; and to discover
new plasma phenomena. Through detailed measurements of the ion velocity
distribution function, the group will determine if the observed inverse
relationship between ion thermal anisotropy and the ratio of the plasma thermal
pressure to magnetic pressure in laboratory plasmas is consistent with
theoretical predictions for the ion cyclotron or ion mirror instability
threshold. Beyond the scientific contribution that the proposed research could
make to the understanding of ion energization in plasmas, the broader impact of
the work involves the training of graduate students in a research environment
that emphasizes the synergy between basic and applied plasma physics. The
infrastructure advancement impact of this work is the development of a novel
laser diagnostic to measure transient and steady-state magnetic fields in a low
temperature plasma.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
