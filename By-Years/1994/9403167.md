9403167 Kozlowski Dr. Marisa C. Kozlowski has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral
Research Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. Kozlowski received her doctoral degree
from the University of California at Berkeley under the supervision of Professor
Paul Bartlett. Dr. Kozlowski will continue research at Harvard University under
the sponsorship of Professor David Evans. Her postdoctoral research will focus
on the design and development of titanium(IV) catalysts to effect asymmetric
aldol condensations. Longer term, she will employ computer programs to
facilitate the rational design of chiral ligands to effect asymmetric induction
over a broad range of synthetic transformations. The Postdoctoral Research
Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as an important infrastructural
program designed to broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and
attract them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and
teaching. ***
