Intellectual merit&lt;br/&gt;The 12th biennial meeting on Eukaryotic DNA
Replication and Genome Maintenance will be held September 1-5, 2009. The meeting
is the only regularly occurring meeting exclusively focused on eukaryotic DNA
replication. This year, the conference will be devoted to fundamental research
topics related to chromosome duplication, structure and function, and will place
emphasis on the central role of DNA replication in the DNA damage and
replication stress response and the strategies used by cells to minimize the
threats to genomic integrity arising from DNA replication. The intellectual
merits of this conference include the opportunity for leading investigators at
all stages of their scientific careers to share and discuss their latest results
and concepts. The informal peer review in oral and poster sessions is invaluable
in providing rapid feedback that will fruitfully steer and accelerate future
research. This conference also provides ample opportunity for learning and
building collaborations--no parallel sessions are planned and so all attendees
share a common experience, while the secluded venue maximizes the likelihood of
productive scientific exchange. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
impacts&lt;br/&gt;Unique aspects of this conference that have particularly broad
impact are the active participation of younger scientists who will particularly
benefit from the opportunity to present their latest ideas. The meeting also
reaches out to seek participation by scientists from underrepresented groups.
The conference archive allows participants to share aspects of the conference
with their colleagues who were unable to attend the meeting while protecting the
rights of the presenting authors to present unpublished research.
