This is a study of the effects of the structure of the surface of gallium
arsenide substrates upon the molecular beam epitaxial growth of compound
semiconductors and thin films of metals. The study utilizes reflection high-
energy electron diffraction and transmission electron microscopy to characterize
the structures. The effects of misorientation of the crystals on the stability
of growth and the diffusion of atoms will be determined. The results of the
research will enable the formulation of a model for the epitaxial growth of
compound semiconductors. Under the previous grant (DMR-8319821). Professor Cohen
made significant advances in the field: (i.) improved understanding of
reflection high-energy electron diffraction processes in these materials, e.g.,
determination of the effects of interference on angular dependence of
diffraction oscillations, (ii.) measurement of surface diffusion on gallium
arsenide, (iii.) determination of means to control the evaporation and growth of
gallium arsenide on the level of individual atomic layers, (iv.) measurement of
the thickness that indium gallium arsenide thin films can be grown before the
onset of strain-related defects. These and other advances are described in more
than seven scientific publications. Professor Cohen is acknowledged as one of
the leading scientists in the field. The facilities and the institutional
environment are excellent for the performance of the research and training of
students. His research under the previous NSF grant has been classified by his
peers as the pioneering work in the field. The program includes a Research
Experience for Undergraduates Supplement for two undergraduate students to get
hands-on experience in research. It is hoped that this experience will serve as
a stimulus to attract highly-gifted students into research and teaching careers
as well as to contribute to the overall goals of this program.
