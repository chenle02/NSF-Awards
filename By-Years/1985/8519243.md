Alkyl halides are the most prevalent groundwater contaminants in the United
States and are significant components of hazardous wastes. The potential for
biological transformation of these compounds has been found only recently. In-
situ biotransformation appears an excellent possibility for cleansing
groundwaters of these contaminants, but a better understanding of the
microorganisms and environmental factors is clearly needed. Good potential also
exists for use of biological processes for treatment of hazardous wastes.
Studies will be conducted on environmental factors affecting rates of
biotransformation of alkyl halides and intermediates formed using pure cultures
of microorganisms observed to bring about the transformations. Environmental
factors of interest are redox environment, temperature, electron donors and
acceptors, and microbial species.
