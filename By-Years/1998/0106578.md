Shimizu&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0106578&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is an
investigation of melting and melt migration processes operating for the Cascadia
subduction zone using the geochemical analyses of primitive melt inclusion
hosted in high-Mg olivine phenocrysts from Mt. Shasta, northern California. The
Cascadia system represents one of the hottest subduction systems where
contributions of slab-derived melt components could be tested quantitatively. A
detailed geochemical study of primitive melt inclusions as proposed here has
never been carried out for a subduction zone system. The emphasis of the
proposed work is: (1) to focus on primitive melts so that new insights into
processes of melt generation could be gained; (2) to focus on melt inclusions so
that a representative spectrum of melt composition can be captured, and pre-
eruptive volatile contents can be determined; and (3) to characterize an
endmember case for hot young subduction system. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
primary objective of the proposed work is to establish a geochemical
characterization&lt;br/&gt;of melts involved in all major eruptive stages that
created edifices of Mt. Shasta. The proposed work will be carried out in the
following steps: (1) documentation of geochemical variabilities among melt
inclusions in each sample; (2) clarification of the relationships between melt
inclusions and host rock; (3) evaluation of geochemical variabilities among
separate eruptive units within each eruptive stage; (4) assessment of temporal
geochemical trends for the major eruptive stages. Melt inclusions in olivines
will be homogenized using a Sobolev-type heating stage, and will be analyzed for
major elements with an electron probe. Ion probe analyses will be made in a
sequence beginning with B and Pb isotope compositions, followed by trace element
analysis for light elements (Li, Be, B, H2O ), REE (La, Ce, Nd, Sm, Dy, Er, Yb),
HFSE (Ti, Zr, Nb), alkaline earths (Ba, Sr) and Y.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
