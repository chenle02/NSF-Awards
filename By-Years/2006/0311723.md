Vulnerabilities Analysis

Matt Bishop

This project will develop and test a new classification scheme for security
vulnerabilities in existing computer systems and software. A vulnerability
exists when a system meets certain conditions, the precise conditions dictating
the nature of the vulnerability. The classification scheme will be based upon
these conditions. The goal of this research is to: (1) determine whether every
vulnerability has a unique, minimally-sized set of such conditions; (2)
determine whether vulnerabilities share these conditions; and (3) determine
whether, for a large enough set of vulnerabilities, the number of conditions is
less than the number of vulnerabilities. The methodology will be to examine
vulnerabilities in open source systems and programs, and determine the exact
conditions under which a vulnerability can be exploited. The expression of the
conditions will be refined iteratively, as more is learned about the conditions
needed to exploit vulnerabilities.

The significance of this work is that it will lead to a deeper understanding of
why vulnerabilities occur in systems, how to detect them, and how to prevent
them. Its broader impact is that, if the hypotheses are true, negating
conditions on a system could eliminate vulnerabilities not known at the time.
Vendors and security analysts would be able to use the approach we will develop
to test systems for vulnerabilities more readily than the current, hit-and-miss
methods. Finally, this work would provide a more rigorous basis for developing
and teaching methods of writing programs with fewer vulnerabilities than occur
now.
