Doctoral Dissertation Research: Residential Mobility Following Incarceration

Abstract

Each year, over 700,000 convicted offenders are released from prison and enter
cities and towns across the country. Although existing research has shown that
where they settle has important implications for their chances of successful
reentry, little is known about how released offenders come to reside in certain
neighborhoods. The proposed research will utilize restricted social survey data
that contains both residential and incarceration histories to examine the impact
of incarceration on the sorting of individuals into neighborhoods of varying
quality. As such, the study will examine (1) how incarceration impacts
residential mobility decisions, (2) the types of neighborhoods individuals move
to after prison, and (3) if ex-inmate neighborhood location adversely impacts
individual well-being. Given the scope of prisoner reentry, the results of the
proposed study will provide important knowledge about the role incarceration
plays in shaping residential outcomes. The findings will also suggest avenues
through which policymakers can enact effective legislation that promotes
residential stability in hopes of reducing recidivism rates.
