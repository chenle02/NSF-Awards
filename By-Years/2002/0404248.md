The objective of this research is the fabrication of a working molecular
photosensor based on the molecule retinol (vitamin A), precursor of the active
chromophore present in animal retinae. The approach is to synthesize a thiolated
retinoid, and then attach it as a self assembled monolayer to a gold scanning
tunneling microscope tip. The scanning tunneling microscope will allow the
retinoid modified tip to be brought into close proximity (&lt; 1nm) to a gold
surface; the small distance will allow a tunneling current to pass through the
molecule from tip to surface or vice versa. The retinoid bridged tunneling
junction will then be irradiated using visible light while the tunneling current
is observed; if the excited state of the molecule significantly affects the
tunneling current, a photoresponse should be observed. Such a system would
constitute a molecular photosensor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A successful result for
the described research would constitute a significant advance in the emerging
field of molecular devices and electronics, which could ultimately lead to
microscopic cameras, retinal implants, and nanoscale photodetectors that require
very little power. The development of these methods will help maintain technical
superiority in the critical nanotechnology field. Additionally, this study may
enhance knowledge of the behavior of retinoids under completely uninvestigated
conditions, which may pave the way to a greater understanding of vision and
vision related disorders (an example of which is age-related macular
degeneration).&lt;br/&gt;
