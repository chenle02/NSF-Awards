The PI proposes to hold a unique, interdisciplinary workshop on Arctic
anthropology by bringing together some of the most prominent researchers in
North America to synthesize their work of the last 4 decades. At the workshop's
conceptual core is the recognition of the scientific contributions of Dr. Allen
McCartney whose own research has crossed the Arctic from the Atlantic to the
Pacific coasts of North America and spanned over 4 decades.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With great support from the Arctic anthropology research
community, the PI has presented a compelling case for bringing together seasoned
scientists, novice researchers, and students to discuss the groundbreaking
contributions of Allen McCartney in the areas of: Thule whaling and climate
change; Bowhead whales in Thule and Inupiat society and culture; Thule
archeology conservation; Archeological phases of the Aleutian Islands; Aleut
Eskimo interface; Maritime cultural adaptations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
workshop will have significant impacts in the field as well as for Arctic
residents who are actively researching their past. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
