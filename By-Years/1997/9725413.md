9725413 Henyey This research involves the completion of a regional seismic
profile from Santa Catalina Island in the southern California Continental
Borderland to the western Mojave Desert that began as part of LARSE I (Los
Angeles Region Seismic Experiment) in 1994. This will fund of the cost of the
experiment with the remainder to come from the Southern California Earthquake
Center and U.S. Geological Survey. The new profile, LARSE II, crosses the inner
continental borderland, Santa Monica Mountains, Northridge earthquake epicentral
region, Santa Susana Mountains, and the San Andreas fault. The survey parameters
will allow the determination of both the upper mantle and lower crustal
structure, as well as the structure and velocities of the mountains and basins.
In the first case, the relationship between the subcrustal lithosphere and upper
mantle high-velocity anomaly detected by earthquake tomography is of particular
interest. The primary crustal targets include the buried Northridge earthquake
fault, and the thrust faults beneath the Santa Monica and Santa Susana
Mountains, as well as the velocity structure of the San Fernando basin. This
research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program. ***
