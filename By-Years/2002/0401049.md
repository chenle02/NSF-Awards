The HSCC 2004 {Seventh International Workshop on Hybrid Systems: Computation and
Control, and a satellite workshop devoted to foundations and applications of
Robustness, Abstractions and Computations, were held March 25-28, 2004 in
Philadelphia on the campus of the University of Pennsylvania. The annual
workshop on hybrid systems attracts researchers from academia and industry
interested in modeling, analysis, and implementation of dynamic and reactive
systems involving both discrete and continuous behaviors. The emphasis is on the
interdisciplinary nature of the topic, bringing together researchers in computer
science and control engineering. HSCC 2004 includes tracks on the use of hybrid
systems in computational biology and a special session devoted to foundations of
Robustness, Abstractions and Computation.

NSF support enables participation by U.S. graduate and undergraduate students in
hybrid systems.
