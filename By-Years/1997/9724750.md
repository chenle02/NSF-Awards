9724750 Chrobak This Dissertation Enhancement Award will send the PI's graduate
student, John Noga, to the Institute for Mathematics at the Graz University of
Technology for two months. There he will work with Dr. Gerhard Woeginger in the
area of online algorithms. Dr. Woeginger is well respected as an expert in this
area. The proposed work will find new solutions to several problems in online
algorithms, in particular, the problem of managing two-level memory for paging,
scheduling of machines, vector cover, and vector packaging. In addition to
advancing the state of knowledge in the field, the student's research in Austria
will expose him to new ways of attacking these problems, and allow him to
establish international collaborative partners. It is expected that the contacts
made by the student will continue to grow throughout the rest of his career. ***
