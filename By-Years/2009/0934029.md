This award supports the conduct of a workshop entitled "Engineering Education in
the 21st Century." This workshop will be held concurrent with and co-located
with the NSF Division of Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation 2009
Grantees Conference. It will address the current engineering curriculum,
particularly looking for areas where the curriculum is weak or lacking, and it
will suggest areas that should receive emphasis. Topics that will be discussed
will include the role of the engineer in the 21st Century, the role of liberal
arts in an engineering curriculum, systems reasoning and organizing for a multi-
disciplinary future.

The workshop is likely to influence educators who will be the people who
restructure the engineering curricula of the nation over the next decade. It
will serve as one source of information and thought on fruitful directions of
change, and it will benefit the nation by helping to effect more efficacious
change.
