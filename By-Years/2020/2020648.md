Global health experts are concerned with low nursing rates and are seeking
targeted interventions with the potential to substantially improve nursing
practices, yet there have been few studies of the history of nursing or milk
banking. This project investigates how scientists, medical practitioners,
parents, and policy makers have produced diverse forms of knowledge about
nursing from the 19th century to the present and how these various
understandings have been challenged, upheld, and/or changed. It has five main
goals: (1) examine the production and transformation of scientific knowledge
about nursing; (2) explore the history of nursing techniques and technologies;
(3) investigate changing understandings of the human labor involved in nursing;
(4) consider racialized understanding of the labor involved in nursing; and, (5)
trace the growth and development of milk banks. Overall, the project will
contribute to understanding of why nursing is more or less common at different
moments and for whom, and it will be useful for those involved in efforts to
support maternal and infant health as it relates to nursing, milk banking, and
the decisions families make vis-a-vis infant
nutrition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project applies historical and qualitative
analysis to archival materials and oral histories to examine nursing as
intertwined with the histories of wet nursing and milk banking in relation to
studies of carework and the commodification of biosubstances. In so doing, it
provides a novel perspective on the relationship between racialized
understandings of the forms of labor involved in nursing and the development of
biobanking practices that depersonalize milk from the women who produce it. The
project contributes to ongoing conversations in STS about the ways in which
gender, race, and technology are co-constitutive; to historical and sociological
studies of reproductive labor, intimate labor, and carework; to gender and
womenâ€™s studies; and to histories of medicine, public health, labor, and
gender.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
