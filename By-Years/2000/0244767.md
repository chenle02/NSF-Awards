This research project focuses on a joint experimental and theoretical research
program that will address important questions in the areas of atomic collision
physics, molecular dissociation and high resolution molecular spectroscopy.
Several collision processes will be investigated by developing a technique using
molecular photodissociation to produce fast, excited atoms whose kinetic energy
and internal state can be precisely controlled. Additional experiments will
study the photodissociation process itself and will map out high-lying repulsive
molecular potentials. Finally, a series of spectroscopic studies will probe
high-lying triplet states of the alkali dimmer NaK. On the broader impact of the
program, the experimental results will test the quality of theoretical
potentials and the understanding of molecular interaction. In addition,
education will play a major role in the research, with impact for both graduate
and undergraduate students.
