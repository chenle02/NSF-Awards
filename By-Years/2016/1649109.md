The West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) is a key region of scientific interest in
ice-ocean interaction, global connections and influences on the climate system,
and polar climate change. In addition, the region is one of the largest
potential contributors to sea-level rise in the coming centuries. The overall
goal of this workshop is to foster multi-disciplinary discussion and planning
among a broad array of scientists from different backgrounds and career stages.
The priorities for discussion and further development are guided by a 2015
National Academy of Sciences (NAS) report.

The specific goals for this 23rd WAIS workshop are to (1) air the latest WAIS
science, (2) discuss potential next steps in community planning to respond to
the top priority in the 2015 NAS report, (3) engage students and early career
scientists, (4) discuss new technologies, modeling approaches, and potential
field targets for future research, and (5) encourage research data submission
and good metadata practices. The workshop will be held on 3-6 October, 2016 near
Washington, DC.
