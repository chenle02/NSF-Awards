Professor Igor Kaltashov and Dr. Stephen Eyles of the University of
Massachusetts Amherst are supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
Program to detect and quantify multiple protein conformations present in
solution, and to study protein assembly. The idea is to utilize chemometric
tools such as factor analysis to interpret protein ion charge state
distributions observed in electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectra. Two
processes will be studied in detail: (i) the assembly of mammalian hemoglobin
and(ii) the Tanford transition and dimerization of beta-lactoglobulin. If the
techniques to be developed in this project are successful, they will allow more
useful information on conformations to be obtained from experimental ESI data
and may simplify the process of extracting information from the data.

Electrospray Ionization mass spectrometry is a major method for analyzing
proteins, and is highly used in proteomics. This project has high potential for
making contributions in understanding the roles of protein dynamics in protein
function. Students would be well-trained in mass spectrometry and its
applications to biophysics of proteins.
