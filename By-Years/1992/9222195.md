This is a three year cooperative study proposed by Dr. Wallis Clark, the
University of California, Davis and Professor Ching-Ming Kuo, National Taiwan
University, and Professor C.J. Chen, Tungkung Fisheries Research Laboratory. The
project is supported under the AIT (U.S.)-CCNAA (Taiwan) Cooperative Science
Program. This proposal plans to study the biology of gamete interaction in
penaeid shrimp. The proposed study is an extension of early success with east
Pacific shrimp, Sicyonia ingentis, in understanding the species specific
mechanism for the reproductive success of penaeid shrimp. Dr. Clark is
recognized as the foremost scientist in shrimp gamete research. The Tungkung
Fisheries Laboratory is a world renowned institute for studies of the
reproductive cycles of penaeid shrimp. This institute has excellent science, the
facilities and the availability of the species of penaeid shrimp needed for this
research. The success of this study will have a major impact on the very
valuable shrimp culture industry and can lead to a greater understanding of
crustacean reproduction.
