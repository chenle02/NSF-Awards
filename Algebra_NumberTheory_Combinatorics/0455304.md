The study of Hilbert schemes and vector bundles is a fundamental problem in
algebraic geometry. Their connections with physics and representation theory
were pioneered in the work of Atiyah and Penrose. The Hilbert schemes of points
on smooth surfaces together with its relation to representation theory of
infinite dimensional Lie algebras is a particularly beautiful subject in
algebraic geometry, which is related to other areas including Gromov-Witten
theory, Donaldson-Thomas theory, the McKay correspondence, the S-duality
conjecture, integrable systems, orbifold cohomology, and the n!-conjecture in
algebraic combinatorics. In this project, Professor Qin intends to study several
problems concerning Hilbert schemes and moduli of vector bundles in the general
context of algebraic geometry and its interplay with representation theory and
string theory. The main tools are techniques of vertex algebras, quantum
cohomology, the virtual localization formula, derived categories of sheaves, and
stable bundles on surfaces as well as on Calabi-Yau 3-folds. This project also
involves the participation and training of graduate students and postdoctoral
associates.

Algebraic geometry studies geometric objects described by polynomial equations.
It has been at the central stage of recent confluence between mathematics and
physics. Many of these interactions have led to profound improvement in the
understanding of both mathematics and physics. Professor Qin's research helps to
strength these interactions, and has many of its roots in mathematical physics
