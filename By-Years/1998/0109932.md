This award provides funding to Ithaca College for Heinz Koch to organize a
workshop for Chemistry REU Site Directors. He is being assisted by Daniel Akins
(City College of New York), Lon Knight (Furman University), Nancy Levinger
(Colorado State University), and Barbara Schowen (University of Kansas). This
workshop will be held at NSF headquarters on 2-3 March, 2001 and will involve
all 2001 Chemistry REU site directors. The participants will be divided into
four groups to address seven general issues: recruiting, participant
demographics, impact on the institution, research experience for students,
assessment, communications, and resources. In addition, all participants will
select one of five panels with each panel preparing a report. The panels are:
(1) Research Experience for Teachers, (2) Outreach and Recruitment, (3) REU and
International Sites, (4) Balance between Research and Other Activities, and (5)
Outcomes, Results and Assessments. A written document will be produced as an
result of this workshop which will be distributed to Chemistry REU site
directors, selected NSF offices, and will be available for other interested
parties.
