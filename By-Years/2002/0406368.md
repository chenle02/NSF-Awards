Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0406368&lt;br/&gt;Principal
Investigator: Ping Xu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal is to partially support
a five-day workshop on&lt;br/&gt;"Groupoids and Stacks in Physics and Geometry",
to be held at the&lt;br/&gt;Centre International de Rencontres Mathematiques
(Luminy, France)&lt;br/&gt;from June 28 to July 2, 2004. The workshop is
organized by PI&lt;br/&gt;with Kai Behrend from the University of British
Columbia,&lt;br/&gt;Canada. One objective of the proposed workshop is to
bring&lt;br/&gt;together the groupoid community (consisting of both
differential&lt;br/&gt;geometers and operator algebraists) and the stack
community, in&lt;br/&gt;order to encourage more interaction and cross-
fertilization&lt;br/&gt;between these fields. PI also wishes to bring to the
workshop&lt;br/&gt;physicists working on quantum field theory and string
theory,&lt;br/&gt;since physics has been a steady source of ideas in
the&lt;br/&gt;aforementioned subjects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Groupoids/stacks is
a mathematical notion which arises naturally&lt;br/&gt;in order to study
symmetries of objects such as finite parts of a&lt;br/&gt;crystal. It is related
to mechanics, physics, and geometry. The&lt;br/&gt;subject may also have
potential applications to biology. There&lt;br/&gt;are many bright young people
working in these subjects around the&lt;br/&gt;world and this workshop will be a
great opportunity to bring&lt;br/&gt;U.S. researchers, especially young people,
to exchange their&lt;br/&gt;ideas with their international colleagues and to
broaden their&lt;br/&gt;perspective. PI anticipates inviting many mathematicians
at the&lt;br/&gt;postdoctoral and graduate student level (from the United
States,&lt;br/&gt;Africa, Canada, and Europe) to the
workshop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
