The research will explore, and model impeller fluidization phenomena. A simple
means of producing locally confined fluidized beds of fine particles has been
observed in the laboratories of the principal investigators. The particles are
held dynamically within a cylindrical vessel by the interaction of centrifugal
force and connection, both produced by impeller-driven swirling flow. The
fluidized bed is maintained in a subregion adjacent to clear fluid without
mechanical barriers such as screens. Centrifugal force, due to swirling flow,
moves particles radially outward, and secondary flow sweeps them along the wall
from the impeller into a rotating, toroidal bed. Clear fluid passes through the
fluidized zone. Upon leaving the fluidized zone, the fluid is stripped of
particles by centrifugal force. At high impeller rotation rates, the fluidized
bed becomes small and sharply defined. Qualitative and quantitative information
obtained will determine whether impeller fluidizers have potential for
industrial use.
