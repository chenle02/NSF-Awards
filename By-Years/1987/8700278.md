This grant in the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports research
by Prof. Philip Shevlin on the chemistry of atomic carbon and related high-
energy organic reaction intermediates. Because atomic carbon possesses a large
thermodynamic driving force for bond formation, it is a versatilereagent for
preparation of selected, highly reactive species suchas carbenes. Thus, this
work is useful both as a preparation method for some new high-energy chemical
fragments, and for understanding the bonding and reactivity forces in others. In
general, experiments are designed to prepare and elucidate thechemistry of
monovalent carbon intermediates. Dr. Shevlin's recent work has shown that
reaction of arc-generated carbon atomswith tetraflouromethane results in the
formation of CF, which is observed to react with alkenes to generate
flourocyclopropyl radicals. The products of the reaction of this interesting
species with other substrates such as dienes and aromatic compounds will be
identified in the coming work. Additional experiments are designed to
investigate the chemistry of the other halomethynes and the parent species, CH.
Other studies arebuilt around continuing investigations of novel carbenes
generated as intermediates in C atom reactions. The reaction of carbon atoms
with nitriles will be investigated with the goal of forming cyano- or
isocyanocarbenes. The chemistry of aminomethylene will be investigated to
determine if it undergoes reactions similar to the nucleophilic addition of
hydroxymethylene to carbonyls, followed by hydrogent transfer. Lastly,
experiments designed to investigate the reaction of atomic carbon with
nonvolatile substrates in solution are planned.
