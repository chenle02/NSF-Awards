This project compares three groups of programmers: open source software
contributors, proprietary programmers, and novice coders, on three sets of
variables: 1) aesthetic judgment criteria of software; 2) verbal protocol
measures of cognitive processes occurring during creative problem solving while
revising code; 3) ontogenetic quality trajectories as code is revised. This work
has the strong potential to yield new psychological models of creativity by
shedding light on the dynamic problem solving and evaluative processes that
drive the ontogenesis of creative products. The comparison of two different
groups of experts is also a novelty, certainly within the field of software
design, and is atypical of cognitive studies of expertise more generally. This
research also promises to help answer broader questions on the nature of
creativity and to contribute to ongoing debates in computer science, software
engineering, organizational behavior, cognitive psychology, and aesthetics, on
how to promote innovation, on the kinds of mental processes contributing to
creativity, and on the basic nature of quality of creative artifacts, such as
software.
