NSF Proposal No. 0456579 Support for the Fourth Joint Meeting of the United
States Sections of the Combustion Institute

ABSTRACT

Combustion is a multi-disciplinary field encompassing many diverse disciplines
in science and engineering. It also represents a research area that is vital to
the economy and security of this nation. Recognizing this vital importance, the
three United States sections of the Combustion Institute initiated a biennial
national meeting on combustion. Beginning in 1999, these meetings have been
highly successful, based on the attendance and the number of presentations.
Consequently, this biennial event has gained a prominent stature and become the
premier national conference in fundamental and applied combustion. This proposal
requests funds to provide partial support for the Fourth Joint Meeting of the US
Sections of the Combustion Institute, which will be held at Drexel University in
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania from 20-23 March 2005. The NSF funds will be targeted
to provide partial travel support to graduate students who make podium or poster
presentations. The information about the availability of travel support to
graduate students will be provided in all the meeting announcements and on
appropriate websites. In addition, an announcement about the availability of
travel support will be mailed to members of the Combustion Institute. The
purpose of any technical meeting is the sharing of knowledge and the exchange of
ideas. Providing resources to allow the next generation of researchers to
participate will have significant intellectual merit and impact on the
combustion community, which is vital to the energy future of the country. Making
travel more affordable may allow PIs to send more students than could have been
accommodated with research funds, thereby sparking interest in a broader
population.
