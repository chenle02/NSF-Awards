The goal of this project is to develop, demonstrate, assess, and refine a new
approach to manufacturing education and training which promises to enhance the
effectiveness of the manufacturing workforce across a broad range of technical
expertise. The heart of the effort is a computer-based dynamic simulation and
visualization of the time-dependent behavior of chemical processes and
associated equipment used to execute these processes in microelectronics
manufacturing. The simulations will begin with design, optimization, and control
in the area of semiconductor manufacturing, and will then validate the elements
that represent the physical and chemical behavior of semiconductor manufacturing
equipment and processes. The program includes simulator development and
integration, manufacturing training modules, engineering design modules, and
assessment and dissemination. The long term goals are to provide a range of
simulations that can be used for training industrial technicians, graduate
engineers, and graduate students in the operation of the equipment being used in
electronics ma nufacturing, and to allow research and development of new and/or
improved manufacturing equipment.
