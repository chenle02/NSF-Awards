9560741 Wang The primary objective of this Phase I SBIR grant is to develop a
fast early warning system for impending earthquake motion, called the Integrated
Telecommunications Information System for Disaster Reduction (ITIS-DR). The
system integrates advanced satellite telecommunication technology, intelligent
sensor devices, and accumulated disaster modeling knowledge. ITIS-DR consists of
four major subsystems: (1) a monitor subsystem that collects and transmits
potential disaster data to a (2) central control subsystem that processes the
data and sends final warning via a (3) telecommunications subsystems to a (4)
reception subsystem that displays the data and directly controls system shutdown
for users. The ITIS-DR will provide an early warning that will reduce casualties
from earthquakes. The systems also has the potential to be extended to include
global warning from allied weather, flood and other disaster information.
