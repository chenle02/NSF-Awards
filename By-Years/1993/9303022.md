9303022 Goldman This research investigates the properties of disordered
ultrathin films prepared by vapor deposition onto substrates held at liquid
helium temperatures. The central focus is on disorder and magnetic-field-induced
superconductor-insulator transitions. The physics underlying these transitions
will be identified by mapping out the phase diagram in the space of the magnetic
field, temperature, and disorder, bu determining critical exponents, and by
investigating the transport and magnetotransport properties of the materials.
The structures of the films will be investigated in situ via reflection high
energy electron diffraction, and scanning tunneling microscopy. These studies
will provide information about the nucleation and growth of the films. %%% This
research studies the deposition, growth and physical properties of thin films of
superconducting materials. Interestingly, the films lose their superconducting
properties when a magnetic field is applied to them, and become isulators. The
underlying physics of this dramatic change in electrical conductivity is not
well understood, and a number of measurements are proposed to reveal important
characteristics of the phenomena. The results will be of fundamental interest in
the science of superconductivity. Additionally, the workers will investigate the
structure and nucleation of the films, to see how the materials morphology
relates to the observed properties. ***
