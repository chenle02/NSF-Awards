ABSTRACT CTS-9457111 MIT P.I.: Gregory Rutledge At the heart of this research
initiative lies the fundamental goal of understanding and engineering polymer
properties from a knowledge of first principles of constituent chemical
structure. The need for such capability is manifested in many practical
industrial problems related to the design of high performance polymers, the
control of properties through nanoscale manipulation of chemical structure and
morphology during processing, and current re-engineering of processes to produce
better products from the same raw materials at reduced cost and with less waste.
The groundwork for this plan has been laid in the development of statistical
thermodynamics for complex chemical systems and the computer-aided methods
therein, and in the progress made in such techniques as X-ray diffraction, solid
state NMR, and scanning probe microscopy to determine the accuracy with which
engineering design principles may be reliably employed to develop new
technologies and new materials.
