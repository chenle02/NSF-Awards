Najjar (OCE-9711937) Najjar 9711937 Marine scientists are hampered by their
ability to directly measure many important biogeochemical parameters such as new
production and remineralization, particularly on regional and global scales.
Recent analyses by the PI, Najjar, and colleagues of existing oxygen data
archived at the National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC) show that there are
significant annual cycles of oxygen that can be resolved on a global scale. No
other chemical species has been measured as extensively in the oceans as oxygen
has, and the cycling of oxygen can yield significant information about organic
carbon cycling. In this proposal, Najjar proposes to use the climatological
oxygen data, combined with a three dimensional marine biogeochemical model, to
quantify regional and global scale estimates of new production, remineralization
and DOC cycling. Improved biogeochemical models will be tested and updating and
revisions to the NODC oxygen data set are planned. This approach will also
include an error analysis of the oxygen field and resulting fluxes. The results
from this proposal will represent a significant advance in our understanding of
marine biogeochemical processes on large scales and thus advance our
understanding of how these processes relate to global change. ***
