This grant in the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports
research by Prof. Peter Beak, University of Illinois, aimed at determining the
trajectories of atomic motion during chemical reactions. Reaction trajectories
may be considered among the most fundamental sorts of information to be derived
about chemical reactivity, and knowledge of the geometrical arrangements of
atoms in molecules has provided the basis for understanding molecular structure
and its relationship to chemical reactivity. However, this work is directed
towards determining geometries of transition structures involving nonstereogenic
atoms, which heretofore have been unavailable. Dr. Beak and co-workers will
investigate the trajectories for reactions at nonstereogenic heteroatoms by use
of the endocyclic restriction test. In this approach, the geometry of the
transfer of atom Z will be evaluated by investigations of systems in which the
bond-forming atom X and the leaving atom Y are joined by a chain. The size of
the ring required for a concerted endocyclic intramolecular reaction in the
transfer of Z from Y to X limits the available reaction geometry. If the
transfer has geometrical requirements which cannot be met intramolecularly, the
reaction becomes intermolecular. These possibilities will be distinguished by
double labeling, isotope effect, and kinetic experiments. Alternative mechanisms
involving associative and dissociative steps will also be evaluated.
Investigations of the geometries of reactions at oxygen, nitrogen, halogen,
hydrogen and sulfur will be made. Other mechanistic probes, including
substituent effects and structural rearrangements will be used to provide
mechanistic information about these and related reactions.
