This award supports the symposium "Parasitic manipulation of host phenotype, or
how to make a zombie", to be held at the annual Society for Integrative and
Comparative Biology conference on 3-7 January 2014, in Austin, Texas. Parasitism
is the most popular lifestyle on the planet, so much so that nearly all animals
are infected by parasites. Many parasites change the behaviors of the animals in
which they live in ways that help the parasites. For example, one species of
fungus makes ants it infects leave the ant colony, climb up to a leaf, clamp its
jaws on a leaf, and stay there until the ant dies in just the right place for
the fungus to spread its spores. This sort of ability to control a host far
surpasses anything biologists have been able to achieve, so parasites may have
much to teach us about how to change behaviors. This symposium will bring
together twelve scientists from around the world to give presentations, with the
goal of understanding how parasites can change the behavior of their hosts, and
what the consequences of those behavioral changes might be. The symposium will
help bring in expertise from outside of the field of parasitology (including
behavioral ecologists, immunologists, neurobiologists, ecologists, invertebrate
biologists, vertebrate biologists, and evolutionary biologists) to provide a
more complete picture of how parasites manipulate their hosts. There are plans
for a complementary workshop on parasite identification (geared towards
students) and a poster session to the symposium, allowing others to present
related findings. Papers from the symposium will be published in the journal
Integrative and Comparative Biology. Parasite manipulation is routinely featured
in popular press, and science journalists are interested in covering this event.
