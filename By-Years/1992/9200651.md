This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site project is in the field
of chemistry. Eight undergraduate students will spend ten weeks during the
summer engaged in basic research under the direction of the faculty members in
the Chemistry Department. Students will be recruited from historically Black
campuses in Mississippi. Each of four faculty mentors will work with two
undergraduates, addressing water quality research from the standpoint of their
specialities (Analytical, Inorganic, Physical, and Biochemistry). A seminar will
bring all faculty and students together on a daily basis, building strong
student-student and student-faculty relationships. Participants will also work
with a wide variety of chemistry instrumentation not otherwise available to
them. Related research skills for the chemist will be developed, including
software applications, statistics, and on-line bibliographical retrieval.
