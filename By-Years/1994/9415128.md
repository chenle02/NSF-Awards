This award will provide funds for the renovation of chemistry research and
research training space in Curie Hall, on the campus of Radford University. This
project complements concurrent renovations occurring in Reed Hall. Both science
buildings are interconnected, forming the science center at Radford. With the
renovation to Reed Hall, Curie Hall can be renovated and used for its original
purpose, laboratory research space for faculty and undergraduates. Research,
performed by seven investigators, encompasses a breadth of chemistry, including
the development and analysis of advanced materials, transition metal chemistry,
organic and environmental chemistry. Presently laboratory space is limited and
this project will result in dedicated space for research activities upon
completion. The renovations will include the addition of four fume hoods,
laboratory bench space, storage facilities, and upgraded HVAC, electrical and
plumbing systems to seven rooms. The department has a long-standing commitment
to undergraduate research, and this renovation will allow additional students
the opportunity to participate in research projects, improve the quality of
faculty research, provide a safe working environment for research and research
training, and support curriculum changes that encourage more student and faculty
interactions.*** | H H + (á▀áG À F G ( n H H + ( d ' ╔ @ -- aÝª ▀ ; áª ªá = ÓaOÀ
