The objective of this research is to fabricate and evaluate a novel device
structure demonstrating charge transfer produced by a surface acoustic wave
within a film of the organic semiconductor pentacene. To obtain charge transfer,
a high-value electric field is needed. In conventional charge transfer devices,
a piezoelectric semiconductor is used. Since pentacene is not piezoelectric, the
pentacene film will be deposited upon a highly piezoelectric Bi12GeO20
substrate. In order to overcome the poor carrier mobility of pentacene, the
acoustic wave will be concentrated using waveguiding by the pentacene film
itself. This will require developing beam-compression and waveguiding techniques
to focus the acoustic beam to around three acoustic wavelengths of aperture.
Within this reduced program, sophisticated numerical device modelling and a
detailed examination of varying the charge-detection electrode geometry will not
be undertaken. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit and broader impact
of this work is that the devices proposed are novel and will pave the way for
developing further sophisticated filters, sensors, and other signal-processing
devices. The work will promote teaching and learning through support for a
graduate PhD student, as well as also supporting undergraduate courses in
microelectronics and signal-processing. The program will also enable the PI to
participate in the undergraduate Research Assistant program in this University,
and to offer undergraduate Senior design projects and Freshmen Mentoring
projects. Additional undergraduate involvement will be requested through the NSF
REU program. &lt;br/&gt;
