Researchers have developed an immersive 3D video game to teach programming,
where users have to use Java programming language to complete levels. This
project to date has expanded the boundaries of educational technology in
multiple ways: 1) rather than being a lecture-based system, it is a digital game
with an engaging plot, characters, and setting; 2) it includes a competitive
multiplayer mode; yet 3) the technology is also a full-spectrum learning
platform that includes an interactive textbook, an in-game integrated
development environment (IDE), automated IDE support, live chat support, and a
storyline that progressively introduces complex programming
concepts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project would enable providing scalable
computer science education to a large number of middle and high school students.
Advances in educational research would be made through this project as it
explores what it means to provide engaging game-based education on regional and
national scales. There is a known challenge in hiring qualified computer science
teachers at the K-12 level, and this project could help bring highly engaging
computer science education to the classroom without having to increase
instructional costs.
