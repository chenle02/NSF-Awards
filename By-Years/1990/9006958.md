This program, to be carried out by one of the world's leading theoretical
astrophysicists, seeks to break new ground in the study of large-scale cosmic
structure, and of the infall of matter onto compact objects. It will do this by
implementing modern grid-based hydrocodes, to be adapted from successful
aerodynamic codes. Previous work in cosmological modeling has been based
primarily on sophisticated N-body codes, which, while adequate for studying dark
matter, are less well adapted to observable gaseous matter. True hydrodynamic
computational methods will be developed, which can treat shocks and radiative
processes, and permit the direct calculation of X-ray emission, fluctuations in
the cosmic background radiation, and other phenomena not accessible from the
N-body approach.
