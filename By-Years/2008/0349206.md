Professor Schaus will develop the chiral Bronsted acid catalyzed asymmetric
Morita-Baylis-Hillman reaction as a tool for chemical synthesis. Building from
this reaction chemistry, Professor Schaus will develop general synthetic routes
for the synthesis of clerodane diterpenes, rapidly accessing the highly
functionalized core structures through sequential Morita-Baylis-Hillman and
Lewis acid promoted ring closure reactions. By developing the Chemistry Mentor
Connection, Professor Schaus is fostering mentoring relationships between
graduate student researchers and area high school students.

With this CAREER award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is
supporting the teaching and research efforts of Professor Scott Schaus, of the
Department of Chemistry at Boston University. Professor Schaus is developing
novel methods for the efficient construction of complex organic structures,
providing important tools for the preparation of molecules displaying desirable
chemical or biological properties. In order to provide students with the
opportunity to explore chemcial research at an earlier age, Professor Schaus has
developed a Chemistry Mentor Connection program, pairing area high school
students with graduate student mentors.
