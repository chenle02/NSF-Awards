The partnership that has been formed with the City of Philadelphia will attempt
to create a national model for systemic change in science, mathematics, and
technology education in the public school system of a very large city. The
partnership will be working very closely with the school district as it attempts
to put into place a project which will result in improved student achievement in
science and mathematics for all students. In particular the planning will
include the identification of special needs of urban students and the
programmatic features which will address these special needs; benchmarks and
five-year project outcomes that will demonstrate measurable impact on all
schools, students, and teachers; and a process whereby the Urban Systemic
Initiatives (USI) will become institutionalized by the school district,
individual schools, and educational partners in Philadelphia. In addition, the
governance structure and management plan for such a project will be developed as
will ongoing networking of key stakeholders to the project.
