The project will develop a flexible instrument for conducting field studies of
animals. An array of towers (at least two) permits measurement of XY locations
of miniature radio transmitters, providing nearly continuous data on dozens of
subjects simultaneously if necessary. In suitable habitat, accuracy of direction
finding by each tower is comparable with present labor-intensive techniques
widely used by observers on foot or in vehicles or aircraft. The system has no
moving pans and operates with off-the-shelf or slightly modified radio
transmitters of the kind commonly employed in research on wildlife.

Design goals include high data availability; modularity of software and
hardware; inclusion of autocalibration, environmental data, stares reporting,
and security features; and able to be configured on scales from small study
plots to 500-km arrays of towers. Use of some existing equipment will permit
rapid prototyping of the front end, which in turn will promote robust, user-
friendly interfaces. This is important, because nearly bulletproof operation
will be necessary for such an appliance to be accepted and properly employed by
field biologists. Field testing of the instrument will be done in collaboration
with ongoing projects run by biologist colleagues.

Availability of such an instrument will (1) reduce the cost of many studies; (2)
greatly (by orders of magnitude, if desired) increase the rate and daily
coverage of data gathering; (3) permit critical investigations that are
logistically or technically infeasible without automated collection and real-
time display of data, and (4) provide high availability and flexibility to
gather telemetered information from radio transmitters, alert the investigators
to significant events, and coordinate with concurrent data from other
instruments. Critical investigations include research fundamental to ecology and
conservation biology, investigations of endangered species or their surrogates,
studies of problem species in human-dominated habitats, and investigations of
disease transmittal and wildlife rehabilitation.
