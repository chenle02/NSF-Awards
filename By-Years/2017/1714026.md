This award enables the participation of distinguished U.S. and international
scientists at the Worldwide Interplanetary Scintillation Stations (WIPSS)
Workshop, which is to be held at University of California at San Diego during
December 18-19, 2016. The intent of this workshop is to facilitate communication
for building the infrastructure to combine data from all of the IPS locations
across the globe, which currently operate more or less independently. As a
coordinated international network, they will optimize the effectiveness of the
measurements which contribute to the space weather readiness of the US and
internationally. Interplanetary scintillations are fluctuations observed in
radio signals. These can be used to determine the speed and density of
disturbances in space propagating toward Earth. These disturbances include the
coronal mass ejections, which are the largest and most powerful of space weather
events. These have the potential to disrupt the power grid and communications
satellites.
