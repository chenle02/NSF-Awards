This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial Biology for
FY2003. The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of
protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are
not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides
opportunities for recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in
microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of
established scientists, and to broaden their scientific horizons beyond the
research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These
fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their
research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves
of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign
locations.

The research and training plan is entitled "Genetic mechanisms of social
interactions in a microbial system." Social amoebae hunt bacteria in forest
soils. When bacteria are depleted in a small area amoebae aggregate and living
cells are lifted by dead cells that form a stalk. The proposed research looks at
variation in this system across species and evaluates the genetic basis of this
important social behavior.
