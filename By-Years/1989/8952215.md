The institution's calculus revision initiative is being enhanced through the
establishment of a laboratory of SUN workstations. Students can now see
mathematics as a creative science that builds and analyzes models of real world
phenomena and their enthusiasm for mathematics is kindled rather than dampened.
The institution will match the funds of the grant.
