Environmental change and disasters, such as repeated floods, wildfires,
droughts, and extreme heat, are pushing U.S. residents to move from hazardous to
safer locations. Early knowledge of likely domestic migration, before it is a
crisis, can ensure the well-being of both movers and the receiving communities
to which they go. This planning grant focuses on improving projections and
planning for climate-related population movement, with a particular focus on
receiving areas of inland New England. The planning process involves refining
the scientific model, gathering data sources, conducting a study pilot,
strengthening the research team, and enhancing public engagement.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This planning grant identifies paths toward incorporating
climate stresses and economic/technical conditions into regional migration
modeling. The project combines data on environmental change, demographic change,
and population movement into dynamic, multidirectional systems simulations.
Investigators evaluate conventional data sources such as the Internal Revenue
Service, the American Community Survey, and the Current Population Survey,
alongside novel data sources, such as moving truck rentals and online real-
estate searches in hazard-prone areas. Interregional migration flows are
analyzed using empirical and simulation-based models. A scenario planning
workshop assesses the utility and perceived validity of the projectâ€™s data and
methods for guiding local planning and policy decisions. The workshop brings
together Regional Planning Agency (RPA) partners, Tribal Nations, and groups
representing minoritized communities. Together, the scientific research and
workshop build understanding of climate migration modeling as applied to local
and regional communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
