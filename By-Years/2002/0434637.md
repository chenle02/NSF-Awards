This award by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
supports research by Professor Mahdi Abu-Omar of the University of California at
Los Angeles to study the enzyme, phenylalanine hydroxylase from chromobacterium
violaceum (cPAH). A genetic deficiency in the homologous human enzyme, hPAH, is
responsible for the disease phenylketonuria. This research involves: 1)
determining the rate-limiting step in the catalytic reaction of PAH by measuring
18O kinetic isotope effects; 2) trapping and characterizing intermediates
involved in oxygen activation in PAH by kinetic and spectroscopic methods; 3)
understanding the active site architecture and the origin of the substrate
selectivity through site-specific mutants of the enzyme; and 4) establishing
structure-function relationships by creating and exploring the reactivity of new
PAH chimera composed of the regulatory domain of hPAH and the catalytic domain
of cPAH.

The function of an important enzyme, phenylalanine hydroxylase, which
synthesizes an essential amino acid, tyrosine that is further metabolized to
important neurotransmitters will be studied. The work will focus on how oxygen
is activated at its iron-containing active site.
