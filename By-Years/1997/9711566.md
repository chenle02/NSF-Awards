Instruction-level parallel (ILP) processing has been an area of great interest
in the computer architecture community and the semiconductor industry. Almost
all of the processors developed since the last decade do ILP processing in a
major way. Ongoing advances in ILP processing necessitate a careful examination
of the amount of parallelism that exists in typical programs under various
execution models. The main objective of this research is to investigate the
potential of pursuing multiple control flows in ILP processors. The study starts
by quantifying the effect of different control flow constraints on available
parallelism. Software support for pursuing multiple control flows is then
studied. Novel methods to specify control independence and data independence to
the hardware are part of this study on software support. This research also
studies hardware issues relevant to pursuing multiple control flows, such as
tradeoffs between the number of speculative paths and performance using detailed
simulation models. Preliminary simulation studies have been conducted to get an
idea of the amount of parallelism available with single control flow and
multiple control flows. These preliminary results indicate a factor of 2
increase in available parallelism when multiple control flows is pursued instead
of a single control flow.
