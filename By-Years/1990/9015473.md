Drs. Hoddeson and Westfall are continuing their exploration of the critical
features in the emergence of large-scale research in America through a close
examination of the founding and first decades of operation of Fermi National
Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab), the base of the world's highest energy
particle accelerator. As the United States prepares to enter a new phase in the
pursuit of science on unprecedented scales, e.g., the Superconducting Super
Collider (SSC), the Human Genome Project and the Manned Space Station, deeper
understanding of the workings of "big science" through detailed case studies
becomes especially vital. Through research in documents, supplemented by oral
history interviews with leading participants, the project is designed to examine
historical problems of big science, including: the effects on research of
increased size, scope, and cost of facilities and experiments; changes in
research resulting from much larger working teams, budgets, and time-scales; the
role of theoretical models and computer analysis in experimentation and
accelerator building; and the influences of geographical concentration, national
and international politics, and economic policy.
