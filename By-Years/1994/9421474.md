ABSTRACT CROTTS, Arlin AST-9421474 Mass loss on the Asymptotic Giant Branch
(AGB) is still one of the most poorly understood topics in modern astronomy. The
goal of this program is to study, with unprecedented time resolution, the most
recent mass loss history and changes in dust shell morphology of stars in the
AGB and post-AGB phase. Utilizing the adaptive optics system at the Starfire
Optical Range the investigators will make subarcsec resolution maps of the
scattered light from the inner parts of circumstellar envelopes (CSEs) around
Miras and post-AGB stars. The intensity of scattered light as function of
angular distance to the central star maps out the dust density distribution and
contains information about recent variations in mass loss rate and morphology. A
better understanding of the AGB mass loss process is not only crucial for a
better understanding of the late stages of stellar evolution, but also supports
other areas in astronomy such as the recycling of processed material into
interstellar medium and studies of old stellar populations and galactic chemical
evolution. * * *
