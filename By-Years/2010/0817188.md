Computer Science (31)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this collaborative project, five
institutions are developing courseware for teaching computer network security.
The courseware comprises an open source software platform for a virtual cyber
security laboratory and accompanying lab assignments and is based on prior NSF-
funded projects at two of the institutions. The laboratory materials being
developed give students hands-on experiences in cyber security
courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The courseware being developed makes it easy for
other institutions to create their own virtual laboratories with very little
hardware and requires minimal maintenance and administration cost. The
courseware is extensible so others can augment it with specialized
modules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With respect to critical information
infrastructure protection, the project results in increased national capacity
for education, new entrants to the information security workforce, and increased
national research and development capabilities.
