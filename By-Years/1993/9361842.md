9361842 Ashford This research will develop electronic diagnostics and novel
high- velocity electroflocking for advanced material fabrication. Low- velocity
electroflocking is a common textile technology used in the manufacture of pile
fabrics, such as nylon velour, where electrostatics are used to position large
numbers of short fibers (flock) on and partially into surfaces. This research
will alter the conventional flock electrification and trans port conditions to
enable the attainment of high packing fractions, highly oriented flock that is
strictly vertical and bulk processing of fiber and whiskers made of carbon,
ceramic or metal. These alterations are required if the electroflocking process
is to be useful for the production of engineered novel oriented non-woven fiber
composite materials. A model of the electroflocking process will be developed
and its predictions compared with experimental results gained from flocking
experiments in a proposed basic test configuration setup. ***
