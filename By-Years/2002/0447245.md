The investigator proposes to explore the foundations for a new, full-fledged
theory of stochastic estimation for tracking boundaries of phenomena or objects
that are described as level sets. Stochastic estimation for contours has shown
its power in the literature of active contours, and level set methods have been
shown to be very effective for describing boundaries that change topology
frequently, and shape very rapidly. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part of the proposed
activities are theoretical in nature: the theory must be formalized from
scratch, and several mathematical and computational challenges are to be
overcome, including the formulation of methods for perturbing boundaries in a
stochastically controlled way; the interleaving of boundary shape estimation
with contour motion analysis; the invention of new methods for resampling,
Maximum Likelihood, and Maximum A Posteriori estimation in the context of level
sets; and the development of numerically efficient methods for the update and
propagation of boundary estimates. Another important component of this proposal
is work on applications ranging from the tracking of oil spills or clouds of
pollutants by a swarm of robots; the identification and interpretation of hand
gestures in image sequences; and the analysis of growth of skin lesions for
dermatological diagnosis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed applications are
important in their own right: tracking the spread of oil spills, pollutants,
forest fires and similar phenomena is of clear and immediate usefulness to
society. Tracking techniques for video analysis are of urgent importance for
surveillance of public sites, monitoring of activities, and aiding of the speech
or hearing impaired. In addition, the marriage of stochastic estimation and
level sets is fundamental enough to make possible advances also in fields beyond
computer vision.&lt;br/&gt;
