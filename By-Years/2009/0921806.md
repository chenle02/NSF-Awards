The pace of science and technology has greatly accelerated in recent decades,
whereas the capability of regulatory frameworks to adapt to these changing
technologies has, if anything, slowed down. The problem this creates is that our
laws are increasingly out-of-date for regulating new technologies, and as this
gap between technology and the law grows, so too does the likelihood of
inadequate or inappropriate regulation of new technologies. Since it is unlikely
to be feasible or perhaps even desirable to significantly slow the pace of
science and technology, the only way to keep regulation up-to-date with
technology is to speed up the adaptive capability of law and regulation. The
goal of this project will therefore be to identify and evaluate new legal
regulatory approaches that will be more adaptive and flexible to better keep
pace with rapidly evolving technologies. The problems and limitations
encountered by regulatory systems to keep pace with technology will be evaluated
for six emerging technology case studies: (1) military robotics; (2) direct-to-
consumer genetic testing; (3) nanotechnology health risks; (4) fMRI Lie
Detection; (5) criminal activities in virtual worlds; and (6) surveillance
technologies. Based on the shortcomings of present regulatory systems identified
for these six emerging technologies, the project will develop and evaluate five
new regulatory models to provide more adaptive oversight that are better able to
keep pace with emerging technologies. The five regulatory models to be
considered are provisionally identified in general terms as (1) real time
adaptive management; (2) principles-based regulation; (3) collaborative
voluntary programs; (4) framework agreements; and (5) institutional innovations
such as cybercourts or independent commissions. The project will conclude by
assessing the potential of these or alternative models for keeping law and
regulation in synch with science and technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
