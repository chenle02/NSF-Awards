The project will allow the revision of an established interdisciplinary course
in computer interfacing to reflect current practice in scientific and
engineering applications. While the course will continue to stress concepts
fundamental to computer interfacing, increased emphasis will be given to the
flow of information between the computer and devices responsible for sensing and
controlling experiments or processes. The use of prepackaged hardware and
software components to acquire, process and display data will be introduced
after presentation of the basic concepts. The student projects requiring the
design and implementation of an application of interfacing will be continued and
expanded to make use of the equipment. Ten small portable Tandy model 200
microcomputers will form the heart of the proposed laboratory workstations. A
single IBM PC-XT and large hard disk will serve as a host to the individual
workstations. This system will have enhanced capabilities for processing,
storing, and displaying data acquired from each of the smaller microcomputers.
The requested equipment will be used in other physics, engineering and chemistry
courses including senior research in the spring semester when it is not used in
the interfacing course.
