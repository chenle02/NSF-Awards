The project, Enhanced Macromolecular Chemistry and Engineering Undergraduate
Education in the 1990's and Beyond, is being held as a two-week course for
thirty undergraduate faculty. The course is organized as a joint venture between
the American Chemical Society (ACS), the member Divisions of Polymer Chemistry
and Polymeric Materials: Science and Engineering, and the staff of the Education
Division and Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. The program
provides undergraduate educators with an in-depth exposure to modern theories
and experimental techniques of polymer science and engineering in order that
these topics can be incorporated more widely and deeply into undergraduate
chemistry and engineering curricula, in major universities, small colleges, and
among predominantly minority institutions. This course is in support of the new
ACS Committee on Professional Training Guidelines for approval of polymer
chemistry programs. It includes outreach program activities at ACS national and
regional meetings. The American Chemical Society and the Virginia Polytechnic
Institute and State University are contributing and additional 30% of the costs
of the total program.
