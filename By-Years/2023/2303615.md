People present credentials such as driverâ€™s licenses, permanent resident cards,
or degrees during important events in their lives. However, since the COVID-19
pandemic, the need for establishing touchless, trustworthy interactions has
increased. The pandemic amplified the need to improve society's ability to
engage in the same sort of trustworthy interactions we are used to in person,
online. The US Federal Government has been funding digital credentialing
initiatives in this space through the US Department of Homeland Security's
Silicon Valley Innovation Program (SVIP) and similar initiatives undertaken by
the US Department of Education. While web standards create the possibility of
interoperability, they do not ensure demonstrable interoperability. This NSF
project is being funded to ensure that the verifiable credentialing ecosystem
has the underlying open source infrastructure to facilitate the broader
interoperability effort. These efforts enable secure and reliable open
technologies to gain adoption in the market over proprietary or closed
solutions, lowering the cost of acquisition of these technologies to US Federal
Government and society at large.

This NSF project builds on ongoing work through the World Wide Web Consortium
(such as the Verifiable Credentials, Decentralized Identifiers, Digital Wallet,
and Credential Request/Response protocols). The focus is on upgrading a
strategically planned set of open-source test libraries, test suites, and an
organized interoperability dashboard as foundational infrastructure for decision
makers and developers when adopting standards-based digital credentialing
approaches. This infrastructure is bolstered by an open compliance program
through the Linux Foundation which will both continuously test the open source
implementations and generate revenue for continued operation of the open source
ecosystem. These efforts will help foster an open-market of digital
credentialing software that provides the average citizen with secure, reliable
access to their digital credentials. The US Federal Government will benefit from
a broader set of vendors in the market and by being able to more accurately
determine the level of standards conformance supported by each vendor, which
will help combat vendor-lock in, price gouging, and false advertising in the
digital credentialing space.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
