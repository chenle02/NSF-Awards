This is a proposal to study samples of hydrothermal precipitates that have been
obtained from two sites on the Mid- Atlantic Ridge. The samples have ben
obtained by dredging, drilling and by submersible operations; and the samples
include sulfides, oxides, hydroxides, carbonates, chlorides, and sulfates. The
composition and mineralogy of selected samples will be obtained by X-ray
diffraction, X-ray fluorescence, microscopy, and photography. Collaborating
investigators will perform isotopic and other analyses. The analyses of these
samples is important because they come from a site that is approximately 1
kilometer deeper than similar samples from the East Pacific Rise. It is
important to understand how different pressure and temperature conditions affect
the composition and mineralogy of seafloor hydrothermal precipitates.
