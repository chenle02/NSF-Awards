Objective:&lt;br/&gt; The research objective of this proposal is to explore a
new conceptual approach to a nonlinear microscopy system. The approach to the
system's design is aimed towards portable and fully integrated instrument that
relies on tunable, non-mode-locked, and high-repetition rate (&gt;1GHz) laser
sources. The instrument utilizes a coherent vibrational spectroscopy technique
to detect specific molecular groups/subgroups within a complex chemical or a
biological media. The instrument's high detection sensitivity, compactness, and
robustness promise wider applications that can range from chemical and
biological research to weapons detection.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual
Merit:&lt;br/&gt; The proposed research will i) bring a specific knowledge on
various aspects of generation of picosecond laser pulses that are longitudinal
modes free and are generated at repetition rates of 1GHz and higher, ii) explore
different ways of enhancing sensitivity in detecting important molecular sub-
groups via their intrinsic spectroscopic markers using nonlinear vibrational
spectroscopy and microscopy techniques.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;
The proposed program is based on an efficient integration of the applied and
fundamental research, education and training for undergraduate and graduate
students and extensive collaboration with different University schools and
Departments. The proposed plan arranges for participation of graduate and
undergraduate students with majors in science and engineering fields who are
interested to be involved in interdisciplinary research. The students will have
an opportunity to interact with professionals within academia and industry. The
successful implementation of the project will attract interest of commercial
photonics/biophotonics companies interested in further development of the
approach towards a commercial product.
