This project vertically integrates research and training in Mathematical
Physics, Geometry, and String Theory at the Mathematics Department of the
University of Pennsylvania. The Penn group will undertake a series of training
activities including graduate summer schools, research and outreach workshops,
the development of new graduate and undergraduate courses, and preparation of
course materials, including a graduate textbook. In parallel, three vertical
research projects will be developed: the exciting new connections between the
Geometric Langlands Program and dualities in quantum field theory and string
theory; a geometric and numerical investigation of the action of the
renormalization group flow on the moduli of supersymmetric quantum field
theories; and an exploration of special holonomy metrics. The group will create
a fertile educational environment that will introduce US students of various
preparation levels to cutting edge research questions in the mathematical
aspects of high energy physics.

Mathematical Physics is one of the most active branches of mathematics and
physics today, with increasingly important connections to other branches of
mathematics and science. The project activities are designed to increase the
number and the diversity of Americans who are actively exploring Mathematical
Physics, Geometry, and String Theory, and to improve the quality of their
experience. Strong improvements are anticipated at all levels, with very
significant improvements in graduate and postdoctoral research.. The explosive
growth of interest in the theory of universe has made this a very exciting time
to begin research in the field, but it has also made it difficult for young
researchers to get started. This project will increase the flow of broadly
trained researchers in Mathematical Physics, Geometry, and String Theory,
therefore enhancing the training infrastructure and the research workforce in
these vital areas of mathematics in the twenty-first century.
