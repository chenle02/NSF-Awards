Hope College will add an experiment to its Advanced Physics Laboratory course to
verify the time-energy uncertainty relation (Delta) and lifetime of an excited
level of (57)Fe. The uncertainty in energy of the level will be measured using
the Mossbauer effect which allows the natural linewidth of the emitted gamma
rays to be determined using the Doppler effect and resonant absorbtion. The
uncertainty in lifetime will be determined by measuring the time between the
production and decay of the same nuclear level using fast electronic components.
The equipment needed for this investigation will also be used for general
improvements to the Advanced Laboratory course. In particular, the nuclear
Zeeman effect will be studied using the Mossbauer apparatus with a ferromagnetic
absorber in which the nuclear levels are split by an internal magnetic field
produced by the electronic motion. Hope College will match the NSF funds with an
equal amount of non-Federal funds for this project.
