The project aims to address student retention and graduation in STEM by
providing innovative teaching technologies in introductory mathematics courses,
a pre-freshman summer bridge, undergraduate research opportunities, faculty
development workshops, and graduate school preparation activities in the STEM
academic programs at Elizabeth City State University. This project will
emphasize learning with technology, content and pedagogy for inquiry-based
learning, and faculty professional development in new media and instructional
technology to raise achievement of STEM majors and non-STEM majors in the
algebra, pre-calculus and calculus courses. Faculty learning communities will be
created to support faculty in developing problem-based learning pedagogies and
use of new media and instructional technology, and techniques to integrate
successful practices into effective teaching and learning for STEM students. The
pre-freshman summer bridge, a STEM freshman seminar course, a special college
algebra course for STEM majors, and a STEM learning community through peer-led
supplemental instruction are the strategies employed to increase retention of
STEM freshman. A mentoring program, a "Vikings Explorer's Academy" for
sophomores, undergraduate research opportunities, and preparation workshops for
graduate school are the strategies employed to address persistence and
graduation rates in STEM.
