The broader impact / commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to
completely transform personalized medicine. With this technology in a
compounding pharmacy or hospital clinical pharmacy, a patient can be prescribed
a one-off combination of drug substances in limited quantities, customized for
their individual physiology, and the pharmacy can produce such a custom-made
product to high quality specifications for that patient within minutes. Patients
can be either human or animal, as these challenges exist in both human and
animal health. The long-term beneficial consequences of the work proposed will
include that : (1) patients will attain stable dosage amounts in hours rather
than months; (2) challenging patient subpopulations will have available products
tailor-made to their metabolism; (3) known life-saving drugs which hitherto
could not be commercialized because of severe shelf life limitations can become
viable; and (4) both personalized medicine and pharmaceutical product supply
chain will be transformed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project enables
personalized medicine. The technology is analogous to an inkjet printer,
printing precise quantities of medicine on substrates such as tablets and
capsules. Our past research has proven precision printing to be well-matched to
pharmaceutical production applications. High-precision microfluidics and process
analytical technology have been used to validate both the quantity and quality
of pharmaceutical products made by printing, and the proof of concept is well-
established. Precision of better than 1% relative standard deviation at the
stringent individual dose level is routinely achieved. This project will cause
broader adoption of precision production, additive manufacturing, just-in-time
production, applied microfluidics, and advanced process management.
