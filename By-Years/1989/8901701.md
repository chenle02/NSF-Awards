They propose to measure the absolute thermodynamic phase diagram of superfluid
Helium three, focusing principally upon the magnetic field and pressure
dependences of the transition between the superfluid A and B phases. From this
measurement they will be able to extract thermodynamic as well as microscopic
data on the superfluid which has been unavailable to date. They further propose
to continue measurements already in progress studying the limits to superflow in
superfluid Helium three caused by textural transitions in unrestricted
geometries. Finally they propose to continue their study of the thermalization
rate of electrons taken out of equilibrium in two dimensional conducting systems
at ultralow temperatures.
