Funding is requested to support the coordination of the NSF Geospace Environment
Modeling (GEM) workshops and to provide travel support to key participants and
students. The workshops are held typically during June in Snowmass, Colorado for
1 week, and often a half day workshop is held during the Fall American
Geophysical Union meeting. The goals of the workshops are identify and work
toward solutions of outstanding problems in several focused areas of research
which will contribute to the ultimate development of a magnetospheric global
circulation model. The goal of the workshop coordination is to provide organized
forums to foster the community-wide discussions and research needed to achieve
the GEM initiative goals.
