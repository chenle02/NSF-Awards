This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to apply a
specialized method to develop a rapid, large-scale and inexpensive thin film
deposition technology. The goal is to enable the low-cost mass production and
maintain the optimized nanostructures and film properties of efficient dye-
sensitized solar cells.

The broader societal/commercial impact of this project will be the potential to
reduce production costs of materials used in dye-sensitized solar cells.
Compared to other solar cell technologies, dye-sensitized solar cell technology
has the potential of (1) low cost due to the abundance of elements that
constitute the cell; (2) lightweight thus reduced installation cost and enhanced
flexibility. However, recent advances in photovoltaics industry set a cost
standard of < $1/Watt. If dye-sensitized solar cells were to be at par with
current technologies on the market, the cost of thin film deposition has to be
reduced. This project targets on the development of a high-throughput and large-
scale thin film deposition process, which will make the solar electricity via
dye-sensitized technology more cost-effective and thus more available.
