Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: Preparation of Zirconia
Aggregates for Use as Adsorbents in Bioseparations&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:
CTS-0411632&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Anuradha
Subramanian&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of
Nebraska&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this
research is to develop methods to produce zirconia particles and monoliths of
varying particle sizes with controlled and hierarchical pore structure and to
further modify zirconia surfaces with polymers, inorganic or organic substrates
to yield chemically bonded zirconia surfaces with novel selectivities. Supports
based on zirconia, particles with high density and excellent thermal and
chemical stability have the potential to offer novel selectivities or overcome
the shortcomings of existing supports that are relevant for use in the
preparative-scale purification of proteins. A goal is to develop a reliable
method of producing zirconia particles with the appropriate size, density,
porosity, and thermal stability for use in process scale purification of
therapeutic or diagnostic biomolecules. Previous results have indicated the
possibility of generating zirconia particles and documented their use as a
stable chromatographic support. The primary goal of this application is to
design, synthesize, and develop porous zirconia particles with hierarchical pore
architecture over distinct size scales and that can be used in preparative
chromatography of biomolecules. In terms of the broader impacts, a coherent,
concerted educational effort in bioseparations will be integrated into the
undergraduate curriculum. This work may lead to a promising application of
zirconia as a column-packing material for preparative separations based on
conventional packed-bed or expanded-bed adsorption. Monoclonal antibodies are
increasingly important as potential therapeutics, and there is a need for
improved stationary phases. &lt;br/&gt;
