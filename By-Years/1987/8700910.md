Spatial adaptive filters are techniques for mathematically modelling changes in
causal relationships among geographical variables through time. They modify
original causal relationships by using negative feedback, applied to subsequent
of data observations. This project will further develop the modelling technique
and its applications to temporal data. The case study used will be changes in
the locations of physicians among the 48 continguous states between 1963 and
1985. Spatial adaptive filtering techniques offer the promise of greatly
improving our ability to analyze complex geographically distributed systems
through time. Robust techniques of this kind would improve the effectiveness of
geographic information systems.
