The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AcChR) is a transmembranous protein whose
amino acid sequence is known and organized in an unknown manner from four
different polypeptide subunits. Although several organizational models regarding
the folding of each subunit based on theoretical calculations have been
published, the level of organization remains largely as speculative suggestions.
Because there is no hope of obtaining, in the near future, detailed structural
atomic coordinates of the receptor in the cell membrane, the research
alternatives are to map exposed elements at specific sites (external or
internal) of each subunit of the AcChR in membranes. Electric tissue of the
electric ray Torpedo californica AcChR will be used to develop markers for
detecting the cytoplasmic site and to determine whether the environment of one
particular region containing an amino acid (cysteine) that has been highly
conserved in the evolution of all species is sensitive to changes in other
components of the cell membrane besides the AcChR.
