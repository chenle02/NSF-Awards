0409609&lt;br/&gt;Collins&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the critical
questions in Continental Dynamics is: "What is the rheology of the system?" Do
rocks deform in the ductile regime by diffusion creep (with strain rate
proportional to stress), or by dislocation creep (where doubling the stress
increases strain rates ~10 times)?. Is the lower crust relatively strong, with
efficient coupling of strain between the crust and mantle, or weak, as in the
classic "jelly sandwich" model? Is the upper mantle strong, as expected for dry
peridotite, or weak, due to high volatile content? Is deformation in the upper
mantle localized along shear zones beneath crustal faults, or distributed, as in
thin viscous sheet models?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a project that will use
seismic anisotropy to measure strain in the mantle and that when combined with
mineral physics, to constrain deformation mechanisms and therefore to constrain
rheology. The PIs maintain that the strike-slip system in New Zealand is the
best place to study these relationships because the signal is large and simple
with constraints at the surface provided by geology, GPS, and known relative
plate motions for the last 45 million years. Specifically the project involves:
1) Deployment of 30 Ocean Bottom Seismographs; 2) Measurement of seismic
anisotropy using a variety of techniques (shear-wave splitting, surface wave
dispersion, Pn and Sn travel times, and receiver functions); 3) Calculations of
mantle finite strain fields that might be responsible for anisotropy,
constrained by relative plate motions and observed strain in New Zealand and
considering a variety of vertical and lateral distributions of temperature and
deformation mechanisms; and 4) Combination of laboratory, theoretical and
seismological constraints on anisotropy to bound the conditions under which
dislocation creep occurs.&lt;br/&gt;
