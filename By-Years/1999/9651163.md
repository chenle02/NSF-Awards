A model is being developed for the introduction of technology into chemistry
laboratories in small, rural institutions of higher education. To accomplish
this goal, ten state-of-the-art computers are being networked together in the
chemistry laboratory. These computers are being interfaced with balances and
spectrophotometers, and with pH/ion meters already owned by the department. All
of the computers are equipped with CD-ROM drives for use as data sources, and
the network includes three printers. Students use spreadsheet programs for
recording and management of laboratory data. They use Maple V algebra
instructional software for working problems in class, and the program is
available to students and mathematics classes when chemistry classes are not
using the laboratory. This exposure to Maple also prepares students for more
sophisticated use of the program at the university level. A molecular modeling
program is installed on the system, making it possible to add new experiments in
both General Chemistry I and General Chemistry II. Students are becoming
comfortable with the use of computers as scientific and data analysis/management
tools while they experience new and exciting ways to conduct chemistry
experiments. This cross-curricular, applied learning approach benefits
mathematics students as well as those enrolled in chemistry classes. Oral
presentations at ACS regional and national meetings will disseminate results of
the proposal's implementation, and an article will be submitted to the Journal
of Chemical Education.
