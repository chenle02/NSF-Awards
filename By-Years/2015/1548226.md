The Association of American Colleges and Universities (AAC&amp;U) and its
Project Kaleidoscope (PKAL) propose to develop an interlacing metacommunity of
practice for broadening participation of underrepresented minorities in science,
technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). The proposed metacommunity
mirrors the goals of the National Science Foundation Human Resource Development
(NSF HRD) Division to significantly increase the quality and quantity of
underrepresented minorities who successfully complete baccalaureate degrees in
STEM disciplines, and who continue on to graduate studies in these fields. This
metacommunity will strategically expand the existing STEM Central web platform
to meaningfully include the scholarly works of NSF HRD principal investigators
(PIs), who lend both cultural sensitivity and authority to broadening
participation theory, research, and practice. The welcomed addition of NSF HRD
PIs to STEM Central, and the diverse perspectives and expertise that they will
contribute, are critical in addressing, advancing and accelerating the capacity
of contemporary STEM higher education reform efforts to meet increasingly
complex, multicultural, and multidimensional challenges.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;STEM Central will provide a "digital habitat" for STEM
faculty from a broad range of institution types to: 1) network, both
synchronously and asynchronously; 2) expand institutional perspectives to
include shared goals, commitments and challenges related to broadening
participation; 3) allow for collective and individualized reflection that can
create new knowledge at a faster pace; 4) foster innovative possibilities; and
5) deepen professional connections. The specific objectives of the Metacommunity
for Broadening Participation are to:1) expand the STEM Central web platform to
meaningfully include NSF HRD principal investigators; and 2) enhance a network
of support for broadening participation professional development within
mainstream STEM higher education. The metacommunity will immediately impact
7,000+ STEM faculty through the STEM Central online platform; and, either
directly or indirectly, impact the tens of thousands of students these faculty
encounter, in the classroom or laboratory, by providing tactical tools,
strategies, and evaluation methodologies for broadening participation and
measuring its effectiveness.
