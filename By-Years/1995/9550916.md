This project is funding the purchase of a state-of-the-art Gas
Chromatography/Mass Spectrometer (GC/MS) for undergraduate instruction in
chemistry. Addition of this instrumentation affects many of the undergraduate
courses, including General Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Physical Chemistry, and
Instrumental Analysis. Many new experiments are being introduced into the
undergraduate curriculum. In particular, these experiments (1) give students an
introduction to the theory of mass spectrometry and demonstrate a variety of
aspects of electron impact and chemical ionization spectra; (2) teach students
the basics of structural characterization by mass spectral fragmentation
patterns; (3) give students hands-on experience with a GC/MS and provide
exposure to modern computer-assisted equipment; (4) give students the
opportunity to use spectral library searching routines; and (5) show students
the application of tandem analytical methods and the utility of these techniques
for mixture analysis.
