9411002 Rodgers Theoretical studies of elementary particle physics will be
conducted. These studies will include non-perturbative approaches to quantum
chromodynamics (the theory of the strong nuclear interactions) using string
theories in four dimensions, explicit computer generated solutions, a study of a
hierarchial model as a test of non-perturbative ideas, and some work on extended
theories in gravity. To date there is no satisfactory explanation available for
the non-perturbative nature of strong interactions or the interaction of gravity
with elementary particles. Understanding these fundamental interactions at a
rigorous mathematical level is important for further understanding of particle
physics. ***
