Professor Gabriel Lopez of the University of New Mexico is funded by the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program to develop a fluorescence detection
method for biosensor arrays based on excited state lifetimes. The method, based
on phase information about the emitted light, would have the advantages of
fluorescence in terms of sensitivity with greater selectivity than just
wavelength characteristics alone. The closed loop auto-oscillating system
developed in the PI's lab will be improved for stability and reliability and
will be built into a sensor platform. Students will learn biosensing, optics and
instrumentation. The work in this Small Grant for Exploratory Research will also
have impact in spectroanalysis in general.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One approach to
sensing trace biological agents is to detect light emitted from a molecular tag
on the agents. The development of sensitive detectors that are rugged, reliable
and inexpensive would have impact on our ability to sense and identify
biological agents. This research has national security implications as well as
potential medical and environmental applications.
