This award supports participation of doctoral students in the Thirteenth
SIGART/AAAI Doctoral Consortium to be held July 12-13, 2009 in Pasadena, CA in
conjunction with the 2009 International Joint Conference on Artificial
Intelligence, July 11-17, 2009. The Doctoral Consortium aims to: (1) provide a
setting for feedback on participants' current research and guidance on future
research directions; (2) develop a supportive community of scholars and a spirit
of collaborative research; and (3) support a new generation of researchers. The
Doctoral Consortium organizers strive to recruit and include students from
underrepresented groups (e.g., women and underrepresented minorities) and
smaller schools and schools with less established programs in artificial
intelligence. Each student gives a 25-minute presentation to be followed by 20
minutes of discussion; there are one-on-one meeting with a faculty mentor. There
will also be opportunities to discuss career issues in both academic and other
career pathways. A report on the Consortium will be published in the AI
Magazine.
