9414291 Tandy Theoretical investigations and calculations in hadron physics are
being carried out within a QCD-based model field theory for the non-perturbative
regime appropriate to current and future nuclear physics issues. The specific
topics being addressed include a confining quark condensate model of the
nucleon, off-shell structure of the propagator for selected composite quark-
antiquark mesons, dressed quark and meson substructure effects in
electromagnetic and axial currents of hadrons, and meson mixing related to
charge symmetry breaking in the nuclear force. The work is aimed at providing a
bridge between quark-gluon dynamics and effective meson-nucleon dynamics that
will be necessary as experimental programs, such those at CEBAF, probe nuclear
interactions at a distance scale within the size hadrons. ***
