The objective of the research is to use an alternating current (instead of
direct current) to provide the needed electrical field in the application of
electrokinetics for contaminant management in clays. The study will emphasize
the verification of theoretical concepts by testing remolded soil samples as
well as undisturbed soil specimens in a triaxial cell that has been modified to
permit the application of an alternating electric field.
