The project involves purchase of a voltamograph, differential scanning
calorimeter, and a thermogravimetric analyzer. The equipment will be used to
update theexperiments in five courses ranging from sophomore level tosenior
level and will be used by students for their senior projects. Electrochemical
methods will be used to determine thermodynamic parameters such as equilibrium
constants and cell potentials; to quantitatively determine the presence of trace
amounts of heavy metals, pharmaceutical, and inorganics; to analyze the effect
of ligands on the oxidation/reduction potential of a central metal ion; and to
study the kinetics of electrochemical reactions to elucidate reaction
mechanisms. Thermal methods will be used to study properties of materials
including dehydration characteristics, glass transition temperatures, thermal
stabilities, heat capacities, enthalpy changes, melting points, and solid phase
transitions.
