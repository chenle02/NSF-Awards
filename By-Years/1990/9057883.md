The goals of the assembly-level computer aided design project are : (1) to
provide an interactive design environment that supports conceptual design as
well as shape description and, (2) generate design models that more effectively
support automated design optimization and production planning tools. A
functional computer aided design system in an actual design environment should
be the result of this research.
