Riemann Surfaces, Dynamics and Hyperbolic Geometry-C. McMullen DMS-9806424 This
project will study the classification of geometric structures and dynamical
systems, in settings that allow for a concerted study of specific examples. Its
scope includes iterated rational maps, Kleinian groups, projective structures on
Riemann surfaces, and algebraic dynamics on the projective plane.
Renormalization, the interaction of spectral theory with complex dynamics, and
applications of Teichmuller theory to 3-manifolds are among the main research
directions. From meteorology to robotics, the control and prediction of
dynamical systems plays a central role in science and technology. This project
will include computer explorations of mathematically simple systems that exhibit
rich combinatorial structure and universal analytic features. Its aim is to
advance the theoretical understanding of dynamics and geometry.
