This award will fund commissioning and operations of the Cosmology Large Angular
Scale Surveyor (CLASS) cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization experiment
located in the Atacama Desert in Chile. The first of two planned telescopes was
recently deployed. The main science goal is to detect a polarization signal
originating in a theorized rapid inflation of the universe during the first
moments of the Big Bang. Broader impacts of the work include training of
undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdocs. The project also has an
integrated program of public outreach to engage the Baltimore public through the
annual Johns Hopkins University Physics Fair, the well-established Quarknet
program that trains high school teachers, and interactive planetarium shows at
Baltimore city schools with large populations of under-represented
minorities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultimately, two telescopes will make
observations at frequencies of 40, 90, 150, and 220 GHz. A novel aspect of the
CLASS instrumentation is that its first optical element is a variable
polarization modulator (wire grid with variable offset from a flat mirror). The
main science goal is to search for the inflationary gravitational wave B-mode
polarization signal on angular scales of roughly 10 degrees, associated with the
reionization 'bump' in the CMB angular power spectrum. Another science goal is
to improve the electron-scattering optical depth of the reionization era to CMB
photons by measuring the E-modes associated with the reionization signal.
Development of the telescopes and other instrumentation to conduct the survey
has been supported via two previous awards from NSF's Major Research
Instrumentation program.
