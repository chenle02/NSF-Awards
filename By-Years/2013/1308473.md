The objective of this research is to provide a comprehensive analysis of
interaction of strong ultrashort laser pulses with nanoscale solids, such as
dialectic and metal nanofilms. The approach of this research is based on
coherent description of electron dynamics within duration of ultrashort (less
than 10 fs) laser pulse. Such electron dynamics will be described by systems of
nonlinear differential equations, which will be solved numerically. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will provide comprehensive theoretical
description of ultrashort laser pulse with nanoscale solids and will determine
what kind of optical and transport properties of dielectric and metal nanofilm
can be controlled by ultrafast optical pulse and within what extent, how the
dynamics of dielectric and metal can be probed by the optical pulse, and under
what condition the dielectric or metal show reversible behavior. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will address both fundamental (understanding
the interaction of ultrashort laser pulses with solids) and applied (optical
control of electric properties of nanoscale devices with high petahertz
frequency, which can be used in nanoscale devices) problems. The broad nature of
proposed research activity will encourage graduate students to explore different
fields of physics, both fundamental and applied. Introductory and illustrative
lecture series on modern nanoscale physics will be given to middle and high
school students within the Atlanta, GA area. The PIs will develop undergraduate
course on optics and transport of nanoscale systems. The PIs will also organize
the Science Olympiad team and Math Club team at two Georgia schools.
