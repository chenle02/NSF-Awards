w:\awards\awards96\*.doc 9632789 Genack This condensed matter physics project
involves theoretical and complementary microwave and optical investigations of
wave propagation in random structures. The essentials of mesoscopic physics are
explored by exploiting the analogy between electromagnetic propagation and
electronic conductance. Statistical distributions and correlations in the local
field and in global quantities such as the transmission and conductance in
translucent, diffusing and localizing samples will be studied and characterized.
The dimensionless conductance is changed by varying the scattering medium and
its length and diameter and by tuning through the mobility edge in periodic
metallic networks filled with random mixture of scatterers. Universal aspects of
wave dynamic are revealed in the statistics of the phase of the transmitted
field. The possibilities of acousto-optic imaging use diffuse light and the
nature and applications of lasing in random systems will be investigates. %%%
Classical wave propagation is the means by which we probe our environment and
communicate with one another. The proposal explores the fundamental statistic of
light and microwave propagation in collections of samples with statiscally
equivalent disorder. It will establish the connection between the statistics of
the local fields and the total transmitt3ed radiation and the optic conductance.
This will improve our understanding of wave propagation and of giant fluctuation
in transmission and conductance which occur in the transition from a situation
in which waves can propagate to one in which transport is inhibited. It is thus
a useful model of electronic transport in microcircuit which are of increasing
importance in modern electronics. The possibilities of acousto-optic imaging
using diffuse light as a noninvasive mammography modality will be investigated.
The characteristics and applications of lasing in random systems will also be
explored. ***
