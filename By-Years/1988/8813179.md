The User Interface Design Environment, UIDE, is a tool which assists in user
interface design, prototyping, testing, and implementation. The heart of UIDE is
a knowledge base representation of the conceptual design of a user interface. A
set of user interface design alternatives which can be applied to the knowledge
base a have been defined. The transformed interface can be implemented via a
User Interface Management System (UIMS). The capabilities of the system will be
developed in the following ways: (1) Extend the logical structure of the
knowledge base, to make it more useful and powerful. (2) Incorporated more
sophisticated transformations. (3) Automatically organize menus and dialogue
boxes. (4) Evaluate the interface design with respect to speed of use, using a
key- stroke model analysis. (5) Provide intelligent help to the end user,
especially "help by showing". (6) Support interactive specification of the
knowledge base by the user interface designer, including checks for consistency
and completeness.
