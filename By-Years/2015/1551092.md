Many insects, including pest species that harm crops and transmit disease,
depend on symbiotic bacteria for survival. This community of symbiotic bacteria,
known as the microbiome, lives inside their host's cells and tissues and is
passed directly from mother to offspring. These bacteria often benefit their
hosts, for example, by producing required nutrients missing from the diet. But
symbionts also can undergo genetic changes detrimental to hosts. This project
addresses whether and how detrimental evolution of symbionts affects their host
insects. The focus here is on one such group, aphids, which attack most of our
agricultural crops and require symbiotic bacteria in order to grow and
reproduce. The research will be used as a basis for teaching basic biology and
genetics to University of Texas undergraduate students, including participants
in a large freshman research program. Also, the results will further
understanding of a significant group of agricultural pests, potentially
contributing to the development of new methods of crop
protection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The experiments address how genetic variation
of pea aphids affects their ability to regulate symbiotic bacteria and how
genetic variation of the symbiotic bacteria affects their own multiplication
within aphid hosts. The researchers measure how variation in symbiont regulation
affects aphid growth and reproduction. Experimental genetic crosses of aphids
that vary in levels of symbiotic bacteria will be combined with modern DNA
sequencing methods to identify the parts of the aphid genome that affect
symbiont numbers. In addition, symbiont strains will be transferred between
aphid hosts using microinjection, to determine how different symbiont strains
affect hosts.
