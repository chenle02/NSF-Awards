An acoustic system capable of making accurate shear and compression-wave
velocity measurements in soil specimens has been developed at the University of
New Hampshire. This system has been used to determine the relationship between
acoustic wave transmission characteristics and liquefaction resistance in sands.
The objective of this project is to upgrade an existing cyclic triaxial soil
loading device, and to increase the speed of operation of the acoustic system.
The aim is to determine the capability of this system to investigate the
behavior of clays under dynamic loading, specifically: (1) The generation of
residual pore-water pressures and pore-pressure variation during individual
loading cycles; (2) Shear modulus degradation and threshold levels of cyclic
shear strain; (3) Evolution of material damping with cyclic strain level. This
new testing system has the potential to yield important information on the
failure of earth masses and building foundations during earthquakes due to the
phenomenon of soil liquefaction.
