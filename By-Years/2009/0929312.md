0929312&lt;br/&gt;Guggenheim&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides funding of
$85,141 over 12 months to develop a high pressure cell which will allow real-
time XRD studies simulating the environment of the ocean floor. The chamber will
allow high temperature (200 Â°C) operation simulating hydrothermal regions. The
cell will thus allow analyzing the effects of vent gases such as methane, carbon
dioxide, and oxygen on mineral dynamics and solid phases in suspension will also
be able to be analyzed. The cell will have injection and extraction valves so
that samples can be manipulation and temporally sub-sampled. A mixing pump will
be fitted in-line to keep suspensions mixed and solutes in equilibrium. The
specialized cell will allow studying mineral interactions at temperatures and
pressures previously unobtainable. Targeted environments will be black- and
white-smoker hydrothermal systems and methane-bearing benthic systems. The cell
will be critical for understanding authigenic mineral formation, especially
dolomite. Other research foci include clay mineralogy and biologically-enhanced
illitization. In other clay mineralogy studies, the cell will be used to assay
the function of salinity, temperature and pressure on biological material-clay
interactions. Salinity, temperature and pressure effects will also be assayed in
relation to sedimentation, methane and carbon dioxide content and sequestration,
and mineral-brine interactions. The cell will also be used better understand
continentally-derived material alteration in marine sedimentary basins. The new
system will be critical for studying deep-ocean biogeochemistry and will help
provide an experimental platform for studying hydrothermal and basin systems. A
graduate and undergraduate student will be supported from this award. Student
focus will be on instrument development and testing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***
