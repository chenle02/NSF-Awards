The PI will continue her study of the motion of water waves. The focus is on the
singularities in the water waves motion and the interaction of the free
interface with a fixed rigid boundary. The goal is to understand the mechanism
behind the phenomena of waves with angled crests, and to understand the
interactions of waves with solid boundaries, such as the coast. This
investigation will lead to better understandings of the structures of the
equations, which will eventually lead to better modeling and more efficient
numerical simulations of the phenomena. The project will involve graduate
students and post-doctoral researchers.

In her earlier work, the PI has shown that the two and three dimensional water
wave problems are locally wellposed in smooth regime; she has also obtained the
almost global and global wellposedness of the two and three dimensional water
wave equations for small, smooth and localized initial data. Recently, she has
been focusing on understanding the singularities in the water waves motion. She
has constructed a class of self-similar solutions for the two dimensional water
wave equation, and proved the local in time existence of solutions in a class of
water waves that include interfaces with angled crests. Problems in the current
project include the uniqueness of the solutions; the long time dynamics for
water waves with angled crested interfaces; the extension of the two dimensional
results to three space dimensions; the role of surface tension in non smooth
water waves; and the interaction of the free interface with a fixed boundary.
Besides classical tools from theories of partial differential equation and
harmonic analysis, and from earlier work, the PI plans to develop new techniques
to study the proposed problems.
