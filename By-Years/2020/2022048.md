In biology, as in architecture, form defines function. Biological organisms are
built to tolerate environmental stressors in much the same way as skyscrapers
are built to withstand forces of wind and gravity. This project focuses on
understanding the relationship between form and function in the nucleus, the
cellular compartment that houses and organizes the hereditary material in the
form of highly-compacted molecules of DNA. The key question to be addressed is,
how are nuclear form and function influenced by mechanical properties?
Experiments will apply mechanical forces to individual animal and plant cells,
and changes in the shape of the nuclei and the function of the enclosed DNA will
be measured. The results are expected to improve our ability to predict and
manipulate how organisms respond and adapt to mechanical stresses encountered in
the environment. In addition to the scientific advances, the project will have
educational impact by providing training for early-career scientists to learn
and implement principles and techniques that bridge biology and
engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research combines comparative and
experimental approaches to define rules that specify the physical and
morphological characteristics of nuclei in both the animal and plant kingdoms.
Key to these studies is the ability to measure the physical properties of
individual nuclei through bioengineering and biophysical approaches, using
microscopic examination of isolated organelles and cells as they transit through
spatial constrictions in microfluidic devices. The experimental plan seeks to
understand the interplay of epigenetically-relevant features--such as chromatin
modificationsâ€”with nuclear structure and mechanics to uncover the role that the
environment plays in modulating these interactions. Elucidating the mechanisms
mediating such interactions will bring us closer to an understanding of how the
environment influences (epi)genome function and, ultimately, plant and animal
traits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is funded by the Understanding the
Rules of Life: Epigenetics Program, administered as part of NSF's Ten Big Ideas
through the Division of Emerging Frontiers in the Directorate for Biological
Sciences. Co-funding is provided by the Cellular Dynamics and Function Program,
Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, Directorate for Biological
Sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
