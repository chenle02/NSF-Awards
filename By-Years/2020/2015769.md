The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to address
and mitigate the ongoing problem of pervasive data breaches. It will provide
forensic analysts with tools for investigating database management systems
(DBMS), currently a black box in most investigations. It will do so by combining
previously developed forensic analysis approaches with user-friendly
interpretation and reports. For existing data monitoring security solutions,
this project will eliminate the security gaps that remain exploitable in
cybersecurity tools. Current security solutions can only react to the logged
activity, leaving a variety of hacks (e.g., abusing super-privileges or hacking)
to bypass the log records. The outcome of this project will detect and report
malicious data access stemming from actions that bypassed existing security
mechanisms.

This I-Corps project will develop new approaches for presenting digital
artifacts from a database to forensic and security analysts. Rather than merely
present the individual forensic artifacts, this project will target creation of
evidential reports supporting user search and providing chain-of-custody
guarantees sufficient as evidence. By tracing the data flow occurring inside the
database, this project will enable interpretation and sound evidence in cases of
malicious data access or tampering within a database.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
