This program will study how the performance of some specific nonlinear optical
devices can become degraded through effects such as the development of
instabilities, competition of the desired process with undesired subsidiary
nonlinear optical processes, and through the influence of higher-order nonlinear
optical interactions. One aspect of the work will involve experimental and
theoretical studies of the stability characteristics of two interacting laser
beams. Any instabilities that develop in such beams are particularly important
in that they could lead to a degradation in the performance of any optical
device that involves intense laser fields. This portion of the work will include
studies aimed at determining how the threshold and nature of the instability
depend on the geometry of the interaction and on the physical properties of the
nonlinear optical medium. For definiteness, the remainder of the proposed work
will concentrate on limitations in the performance of one specific class of
nonlinear optical devices, that of phase-conjugate mirrors. Phase conjugate
mirrors based both on degenerate four-wave mixing and on stimulated Brillouin
scattering will be studied. Theoretical work will include numerical modeling of
the phase conjugate mirror with the goal of optimizing its performance.
Experimental work will include measurements aimed at quantifying the achievable
device performance and in characterizing any degradation in performance.
