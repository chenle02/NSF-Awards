This award is made in the Environmentally Benign Chemical Synthesis and
Processing program and is funded by the Division of Chemistry and the Office of
Pollution Prevention and Toxics of the Environmental Protection Agency. In
addition, the project includes collaboration with research scientists at the
Ridgefield, Connecticut, laboratories of Boehringer Ingelheim Corporation and
Los Alamos National Laboratories. Mark J. Burk of the Chemistry Department, Duke
University, will develop chemical synthesis and processing technologies using
carbon-dioxide based solvent systems for asymmetric catalytic reactions.
Asymmetric hydrogenations, hydrogen transfer reductions, and aldol condensations
will be investigated. Chemical industry uses large volumes of organic and
chlorinated solvents which present serious disposal or recycling problems. The
utility of carbon dioxide as a replacement solvent for the manufacture of fine
chemicals will be examined in this project. Asymmetric catalysis is a method
that offers energy-efficient access to enantiometrically pure intermediates for
the synthesis of chiral drugs and agrochemicals. Performing asymmetric catalysis
in supercritical carbon dioxide effectively combines the advantages of both to
reduce chemical release in manufacturing.
