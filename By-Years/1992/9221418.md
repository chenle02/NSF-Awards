This award provides support for Dr. Robert Hemminger of the Department of
Mathematics at Vanderbilt University to make two trips to New Zealand over a two
year period to collaborate with Prof. Derek Holton and Dr. Robert Aldred of the
Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Otago in Dunedin.
The research will be focused in the area of graph theory, specifically, problems
dealing with contractibility and connectivity in graphs. This project draws upon
the theoretical expertise of the investigators working on the topic of
contractible edges. Over the past few years, this collaboration has resulted in
seven publications in the area of graph theory. The visit of Dr. Aldred to
Vanderbilt University, in early 1993 to continue the collaboration, is supported
through the New Zealand Government.
