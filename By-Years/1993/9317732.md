Stoecker 9317732 This study will examine the feeding ecology of two red-tide
dinoflagellates Gymnodinium sanguineum and Ceratium furca. Laboratory and field
studies will test the hypotheses that mixotrophic dinoflagellates: (1) are
primarily photosynthetic organisms that become phagothrophic when nutrient
and/or light environments are suboptimal; (2) exploit a variety of nano- and
microplankton prey, but can exhibit feeding preferences; (3) gain sufficient
nutritional benefits through phagotrophy to promote enhanced photosynthesis and
growth; and (4) feed on a diel cycle with elevated ingestion of prey during the
day. Mixotrophic dinoflagellates appear to have relatively slow feeding rates,
but their sheer numbers under bloom conditions indicate their potential
importance to microbial food-web structure and function. Without a greater
understanding of feeding behavior in mixotrophic dinoflagellates, their
significance to microbial food web dynamics and red-tide ecology will remain
speculation. ***
