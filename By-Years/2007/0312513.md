The investigators will calculate the velocity distribution of oxygen atoms in
the ground and metastable states as functions of altitude in the terrestrial
atmosphere. In previous work, the investigators have developed a set of computer
codes that will enable them to compute the equilibrium velocity distributions of
energetic atoms as a function of altitude in the atmosphere. These will be used
to determine the transfer of energy in collisions of energetic atoms that take
proper account of the dependence of the energy transfer cross sections on the
scattering angle. They will also study the transmission of ultraviolet radiation
through the atmosphere with a focus on the temperature dependence of the
absorption cross sections. This is a continuation of theoretical studies of
energetic atoms and their effects on the chemistry and evolution of the
atmosphere.
