The proposal focuses on the measurement of absolute electron impact cross
sections in gases needed to model industrial plasmas. Processes studied include
dissociative attachment, ionization and neutral dissociation. In addition, some
ion- molecule reactions will be studied to shed light on the mechanisms involved
in Coulomb explosion reactions. These processes may play a role in understanding
the use of high energy radiation to decompose toxic wastes.
