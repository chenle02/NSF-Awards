Quality Education for Minorities (QEM) Network will use an iterative process to
develop an Action Plan for increasing the number of doctorates awarded to
underrepresented minorities in the social, behavioral and economic sciences.
Written information from an initial set of campuses who have been particularly
successful in graduating underrepresented minority Ph.D.s will be summarized and
discussed during a workshop bringing together a few faculty and administrators
from each campus. The outcomes of this workshop will inform further surveying of
additional campuses about the strategies that they use for recruitment and
retention of underrepresented minority Ph.D. students. In conjunction with the
release of the Action Plan, there will be opportunities for the campuses that
are particularly productive in producing underrepresented minority Ph.D.s to
network with one another. Broad dissemination and discussion of the Action Plan
will result in an increased understanding and adoption of strategies known to be
effective in recruiting and graduating underrepresented minorities in the
social, behavioral, and economic sciences.
