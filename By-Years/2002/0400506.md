AAAS will develop and host a PI meeting for currently funded ISE Youth,
Community and ASCEND projects. The goal of the meeting is to maximize the
learning and contribution of the multiple NSF-funded projects enabling
participants to analyze and document existing models, benchmark best practices
and work cooperatively on articulating strategies that improve the quality of
community and youth programming. This gathering aims to affect programs in the
development and implementation phases, thereby contributing to higher quality
programs.

Principal Investigators from a variety of institutions (museums, universities,
schools, community organizations) across the country will have an opportunity to
expand their thinking about program structure, assessment, staff capacity,
institutional infrastructure and sustainability. The meeting will allow
participants to exchange information, interact with experts and to build
relationships. A conference report and evaluation will be published on the web
and shared through regional/national conferences
