To put information and tools at the Internet user's finger tips, the InterNIC
information services will include a full-service Reference Desk, a database of
comprehensive networking materials called the Info Source, training classes and
documentation, and coordination services among all appropriate groups in the
community. Several additional methods will be used to maintain quality over the
life of the project, such as reference desk tracking procedures, reviews by the
Liaison Council, and internal quality scores. In keeping with the innovative
spirit of the Internet, several new approaches to distributing services will be
implemented. Among these innovations is NICLink, a user-friendly hypermedia
interface offering access to the Info Source and all the information it
contains. NICLink will be distributed on both standard computer diskettes and
CD-ROM. Another is the concept of the Info Scout, an individual who will scout
out new resources and innovative uses of the network for inclusion in the Info
Source. Access methods to the Info Source will include services such as WAIS and
X.500, and the InterNIC staff will add additional state-of-the-art access
methods as they come into use by the community. The project is one of three
collaborative activities comprising the Network Information Services Management
Project. To create a single, seamless user interface to the three activities a
coordination plan will be implemented to make the InterNIC appear to be one
network information center--a single source to handle all user questions. The
interface will be intuitive and easy to use, and users will be able to access
the various services using a simple unified procedure.
