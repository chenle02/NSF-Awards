The objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program award is
to determine the couplings of rotational and translational body oscillations
underlying dynamic legged locomotion, and develop strategies to exploit them for
faster, more efficient and more stable running and climbing. The planar point-
mass dynamic models which have informed the design of existing single-mode
running robots will be extended to better capture the three-dimensional dynamics
evidenced by animals that allow for rapid negotiation of a variety of terrains
via multiple modes of locomotion. The benefits of coupled roll, pitch and yaw
with traditional translational motions, as well as inclines, attachment, and
body inertia will be examined for multi-modal legged runners. These findings
will be used in turn to inform control strategies for robots capable of high-
speed running and climbing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of
this research will enable legged robotic systems to run more quickly, across
more treacherous terrains, and maneuver with more agility. The currently
"missing" reduced-order dynamic models for climbing will be developed, affording
better understanding of the mechanisms and methods employed by biological
climbers. These insights will also enable robot designs and controllers to
effectively utilize the inherent rotational dynamics over a range of surface
inclines and geometries. Running reliably down hills, through rough terrain, up
trees, and over obstacles will be easier for these biologically anchored multi-
modal devices. These advances will lead to unprecedented mobility for robots
involved in search and rescue, hazardous material clean up, and inspection tasks
in natural and urban disaster areas.
