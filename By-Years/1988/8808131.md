When loose sands saturated with water are subjected to the cyclic loads
resulting from severe earthquake shaking, excess pore water pressures are
generated if the water cannot easily drain away (undrained behavior). This
excess pore pressure reduces the soil strength, and if sufficient pressure is
generated, will lead to a failure of the soil referred to as liquefaction.
Current methods for predicting the generation of pore water pressure during
cyclic loading often overpredict the pressures generated, that is, they result
in conservative predictions. This research project is investigating the accuracy
of soil models currently used for the prediction of earthquake-generated pore
water pressures, with special attention being given to the effect of the
dissipation of this pressure during and after the earthquake. The predictions
are being compared with laboratory test data as well as data obtained from field
tests using an instrumented site at Owi Island, Tokyo Bay, Japan. This data
includes ground motion time histories as well as dynamic pore water pressure
measurements at two depths in the loose sandy subsoils.
