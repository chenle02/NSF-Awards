GER-9554573 Simpson This proposal requests support for five (5) Graduate
Traineeships in Hydrology, to be supervised in a collaborative effort by the
Departments of Earth and Environmental Science at Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute and Geological Sciences at Columbia University. Faculty from the
Schools of Engineering at both RPI and CU would also participate as potential
dissertation advisors. The strengths of the two institutions related to
hydrology are generally quite distinct, with RPI emphasizing local and regional
surface and groundwater field areas, including a considerable water management
component imparted by Engineering School faculty participation, with CU, though
Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and the Goddard Institute of Space Studies
(NASA), emphasizes interdisciplinary elements of number of fields, including
paleoclimatology, atmospheric science, oceanography, dendrochronology and tracer
geochemistry applications to the past several years that offer important new
tools for investigations of surface and groundwaters through measurements of
natural tracer substances including radionuclides, stable isotopes and chemicals
such as freons. Students would matriculate at one of the tow institutions, and
meet PhD requirements applicable there. Integration would be accomplished by
having each student spend at least one semester in residence at the
collaborating department, attending courses or doing field and laboratory work
during their first three years. One member of the academic advisor team for each
student would also be derived from the collaborating institution. Several
ongoing joint research efforts between the two institutions on surface and
groundwaters in the NYC and Hudson River valley areas would be expanded.
