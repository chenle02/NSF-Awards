A common feature of many convective storms is growth by cloud and cell unions.
Although convective cloud evolution has been the subject of a number of
empirical and numerical studies, documentation of the manner in which mergers
take place and their role in storm development is limited. The objective of this
research is the evolution of convective storms. Specifically, (1) to identify
the ways in which clouds and cells join and the dependence of the mode of merger
on the stages, horizontal proximity and relative motion of the cloud (cell)
pair, and (2) to ascertain the effect of the type of merger on subsequent cloud
(cell) morphology and history. Existing reflectivity data from 10-cm radars will
be used. Objective and interactive computer techniques will be employed in many
phases of the study. The results will provide detailed descriptions of this
important phenomenon from which hypotheses may be developed for numerical and
observational experiments. It will also be valuable for improvement of
techniques for short range prediction of convective storms based on real-time
radar information, which will soon be available in the national network.
