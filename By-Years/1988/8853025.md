This award to Arizona State University's Department of Geology is made in
response to a proposal submitted to the National Science Foundation's
Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement Program. The award will provide one-
half of the funds needed to acquire seismic, magnetic and electrical geophysical
field equipment. The University is committed to matching the NSF contribution
for this equipment. The equipment will be used in a series of field geophysics
courses designed to provide undergraduate students with direct experience in the
use of modern exploration equipment and the interpretation of geophysical field
data.
