Harris The investigator will study the geometry of plane curves, and
specifically the Severi varieties papametrizing plane curves having given degree
and genus and satisfying additional geometric conditions. This will proceed in
three directions. First, the investigator will extend existing work on
irreducibility and degree of Severi varieties to varieties parametrizing plane
curves with singularities other than nodes. Second, he will apply recently
developed techniques to describe certain hyperplane sections of these varieties,
with possible applications to questions (such as the Enriques conjecture)
concerning the Picard groups of these varieties and of the universal curves over
them. Finally, the investigator will attempt to use the same ideas to analyze a
related question, that of the dimension of the linear series of plane curves
with singularities at assigned general points. This is research in the field of
algebraic geometry. Algebraic geometry deals with very basic objects, figures
that can be defined in the plane and in space by the simplest equations, namely
polynomialsis. It is thus one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics--it was
studied, for example by the ancient Greeks. At the same time it is one of the
newest, having had a revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century. Within
algebraic geometry, perhaps the most basic and most thoroughly studied subject
is that of algebraic curves, that is, curves in the plane defined by a single
polynomial equation in two variables. For all the work that has been done on
these objects classically, however, our understanding of them is still
developing, and at a rapid pace; it is a very active field of investigation.
