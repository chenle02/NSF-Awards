This project has two primary goals: (1) the determination of the asymptotic
behavior of minimum energy configurations of points restricted to a manifold in
Euclidean space, and (2) the construction and application of wavelets on
manifolds. This project focuses on two-dimensional manifolds (surfaces) because
of their importance in applications to computer graphics, biological membranes,
and materials science. The connection between geometrical and analytical
properties of minimum energy configurations on a surface and the geometrical
properties of that surface will be investigated and algorithms for the rapid
generation of well-distributed point sets on surfaces will be developed. The
second goal of this project is to develop the theory of a new class of wavelets
generated from "refinable macroelements" for the efficient representation of
surfaces and data on surfaces. Applications to geometric modeling, computer
graphics, and multiscale methods in scientific computing will be investigated.

The main objective of this project is to develop effective methods for discrete
representations of two-dimensional surfaces and data defined on these surfaces.
The recent development of the field of wavelets and multiresolution analysis has
provided tools and a unifying framework for efficiently representing large
classes of data arising in science and engineering. The goals of the first
component of this project are to develop the theory of a class of "nonuniform"
wavelets on surfaces and to develop multiscale high-performance applications to
computer graphics and scientific computing. The goal of the second component of
this project is the investigation of geometrical and analytical properties of
minimum energy (or "ground state") configurations of large numbers of points
distributed on a surface and interacting via a pairwise repulsive interaction.
The research on minimum energy points and its usefulness in discretizing
manifolds will be of significance to methods for data sampling, best-packing
problems, and geometric design. The development of fast algorithms for
generating uniformly distributed points is of significance in computational
complexity theory. Furthermore, the investigation of the ordering of ground
state configurations of particles on curved surfaces will improve understanding
of the physics of membranes and films.
