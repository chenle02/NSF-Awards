The focus of this research involves the synthesis of compounds that mimic the
poly-L-proline type II (PPII) conformation. The strategy involves the
preparation of proline templated amino acids (PTAAs) that when coupled
sequentially populate the PPII conformation in solution. The PPII mimics will
then serve as a general scaffold for the synthesis of inhibitors that target at
least a subset of protein kinases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the
Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research and
educational activities of Dr. Jose S. Madalengoitia in the Department of
Chemistry at the University of Vermont &amp; State Agricultural College.
Professor Madalengoitia will focus his work on developing methods for
preparation of protein kinase inhibitors. These inhibitors are useful for
unraveling complex signal cascades. This project should have broader impacts for
medical science since aberrant protein kinase activity has been linked to many
disease states. Also, the project will offer diverse training to undergraduates
as well as graduate students. &lt;br/&gt;
