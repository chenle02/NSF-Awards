The investigators will develop robust, accurate, and cost-effective methods for
simulating the dynamics of suspensions of flexible fibers in a Stokesian fluid.
Flexible fibers make up the micro-structure of suspensions that show strongly
non-Newtonian bulk behavior, such as elasticity, shear-thinning, and normal
stresses differences in shear flows. By taking a nonstandard approach to this
problem, and designing a numerical algorithm based on a nonlocal slender-body
approximation to hydrodynamical interactions, it is possible to simulate
problems not feasible with standard methods. As this numerical method has a firm
mathematical foundation, method design can be approached as a numerical analysis
problem, carefully treating issues of accuracy and stability in algorithm
design. Technical obstacles to be addressed are the accurate inclusion of
lubrication forces when filaments approach each other, and the development and
application of fast summation strategies for evalluating filament-filament
interactions. The investigators will also develop especially efficient methods
for the special case of rigid filaments. They will apply these methods to a set
of current theoretical issues, such as the development of normal stress
differences in flexible fiber suspensions, the effect on fluid mixing of storing
and releasing elastic stress in the fluidic microstructure, and the large-scale
dynamics of rod-like self-locomoting elements (as arises in modeling bacterial
baths)

The dynamics of microscopic flexible fibers immersed in a fluid are essential to
understanding many current problems arising in biology, engineering, and
physics. Examples range from manufacturing processes in the pulp and paper
industries to new proposed methods for mixing fluids in small devices to the
locomotion of micro-organisms. These are all complicated systems whose dynamics
are not well understood, in part because the large-scale dynamics of the flow
can depend on the detailed nonlinear dynamics of the microscopic fibers. To help
increase our understanding of such problems, the investigators are developing
efficient and accurate methods for numerically simulating the dynamics of such
systems with many interacting fibers. They will apply these methods to a set of
current applications, drawn from the basic physics of fluids, engineering, and
biology.
