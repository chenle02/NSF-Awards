The Research Experience for Undergraduates program was formed by the National
Science Foundation to provide opportunities for undergraduates to perform
research under the guidance of established researchers. It is hoped that they
will find the experience rewarding, and will be attracted to careers in
research. Two types of awards are supported: site grants, and supplements to
exisitng research awards. This is a site grant, under which NSF is supporting 10
undergraduate students in the GTE Laboratories, Inc. in-house training program.
Training of the NSF-supported student researchers consists entirely of computer
information science projects, with emphasis on networking subjects.
