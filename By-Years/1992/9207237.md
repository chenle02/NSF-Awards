In this project, the PI will collaborate, in 1992, with PI's from two other
institutions to measure Chlorofluorocarbons (CFC's), F-11 and F-12, from water
samples collected on three separate legs of a hydrographic cruise along 32|S in
the Pacific from Chile to Australia as part of the World Ocean Circulation
Experiment (WOCE) Hydrographic Program (WHP) (referred to as WOCE line P-6).
This particular project will focus specifically on the eastern portion between
Chile and Easter Island. In 1993 and 1994, similar measurements will be made on
a zonal WOCE line along 17|S (P-21), and a meridional line in the eastern basin
of the North Pacific (WOCE line P-17N). Data will be used to examine
modification by mixing and circulation of all CFC-bearing waters in the eastern
Pacific Ocean.
