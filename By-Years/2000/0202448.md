This proposal studies changes in opinion and judgment that follow as
consequences of the ongoing "War on Terrorism," declared in response to the
terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. It is anticipated that military and
diplomatic success and failure and renewed terrorist events will influence
opinions regarding security versus liberty. The research will be done in the
lab, by national telephone polling, and via the Internet using several of the
new WWW methods for conducting research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary goal
of the research is to study models of how biasing phrases affect judged
agreement with questions posed in polls. It has long been known that the results
of polls depend strongly on how questions are worded. This research will attempt
to separate the effects of bias from those of more stable "true" psychological
values.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A secondary goal is to compare results obtained
with inexpensive, efficient, new Internet methods to those obtained from more
standard polling. This project will also attempt to determine which of several
Internet methods of sampling is most accurate in matching the results of more
standard polling.&lt;br/&gt;
