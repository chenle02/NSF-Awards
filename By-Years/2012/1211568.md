This work is part of a collaborative project to collect direct imaging data of
exoplanets and then model the atmospheres. This work focuses on cool giant
planets, which are the type expected to be first detected with these techniques
(due to their larger orbital distances from the host star). They will use data
collected from direct imaging surveys to test models of the atmospheres, and
include clouds, vertical mixing, non-solar abundances, and non-local chemical
equilibrium effects in their calculations.

This project will also involve public outreach through Lowell Observatory and
the American Museum of Natural History, which will develop and present online
and in-person programs on the scientific results from direct imaging of planets.
They will also train undergraduate and graduate students in research.
