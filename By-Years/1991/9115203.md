An innovative new technique for laser doppler velocimetry will be investigated
that uses a continuous wave (cw) source. The use of a cw rather than the
conventional pulsed laser should result in a light, compact, rugged and more
reliable LDV system suitable for use in both spacecraft and aircraft. In
addition, the use of multiple cw beams and complimentary pseudo random codes
should allow the vector wind to be measured without scanning the beams.
Potential applications are global remote sensing of atmospheric winds, wind
shear and turbulence detection and primary air instrumentation. In order to
obtain range resolved wind and develop the required signal to noise ratio,
pseudo random, diphase modulation of the laser and a novel detection scheme will
be used. The work is primarily experimental with the goal of demonstrating
feasibility of this new, innovative method. An experimental system will be built
and evaluated by making range resolved wind measurements in the atmosphere.
