The U.S. National Academy of Sciences will continue its support of the
activities of the Committee on Astronomy and Astrophysics (CAA). Using the
astronomy and astrophysics decadal surveys, the CAA identifies issues of concern
to the astronomy and astrophysics community and provides guidance to federal
agencies regarding their astronomy and astrophysics research programs in order
to encourage the fieldâ€™s scientific progress. The committee membership itself is
drawn from experts across the astronomy and astrophysics disciplines and as such
is able to identify and assess issues and trends which impact the broader
multidisciplinary arena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CAA has a broad impact by
acting as an established forum to bring together leading researchers from the
scientific community and representatives from across the federal government to
discuss emerging research needs and opportunities for the advancement of
astronomy and astrophysics. In each ad hoc study that the CAA initiates and
oversees, the committee places an emphasis on accessibility by the layperson and
promoting the public understanding of science. By identifying cross-cutting
issues and/or opportunities, the CAA can enhance the research and education
environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
