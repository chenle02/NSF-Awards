The Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE) is a continuous model of two-dimensional
systems in statistical mechanics at criticality.&lt;br/&gt;The proposer will
study the detailed fractal and multifractal properties of SLE paths. A goal is
the further understanding of the relationship between microscopic rules and
macroscopic behavior for critical phenomena and the effect of boundary
conditions and other global geometry on the behavior. Another is to establish
the multifractal formalism for a model with nontrivial self-repulsion
interaction. A long-range hope is to use this structure to understand
configurational measures on discrete paths such as the problem of the self-
avoiding random walk.&lt;br/&gt;The proposer will also try to understand what
ideas can extend to dimensions other than two, in particular for random walks
with self-repulsions in three dimensions, where conformal invariance is not
expected. In higher dimensions, the loop-erased walk, Laplacian walk with
exponent and continuous analogues, and Brownian intersection problems will be
studied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of critical phenomenon, i.e. the
behavior of a system at or near the point at which it changes state, leads to a
number of mathematical constructions. For example, interfaces between different
phases or materials can be viewed as a curve or a surface. At criticality, these
curves and surfaces have ``fractal'' behavior which means that they have scaling
properties like spaces of unusual, often fractional, dimension. For two
dimensional systems (or three dimensional systems constrained so that they are
almost two dimensional), a stronger property called conformal invariance has
been observed. The proposer will continue study of a major new model in this
area, the Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE) with a particular emphasis on the
detailed fractal geometry of the curve and the interaction of the curve with
outside boundaries or walls. The proposer will also explore similar questions in
three dimensions which are of great interest, but much more difficult because of
the lack of conformal invariance as a tool.
