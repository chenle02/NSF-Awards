Technological advances have enabled scientists to develop complete understanding
of the genomes of many crop species. However, there are continued challenges in
linking the differences in plant genomes to specific traits. The lack of tools
to study epigenetic variation, heritable variation that is not due to changes in
DNA sequence, limits our ability to predict plant traits such as seed size and
yield. This project is developing novel tools and approaches for studying the
role of epigenetic variation in corn. These tools require developing a system
for targeted editing of genes that regulate epigenetic variation in plants,
enabling insights into the role of epigenetic variation in crop development. The
outcomes of this project will provide breakthrough technologies to improve corn
and other crops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is focused on
development of biological materials to study the role of DNA methylation in
maize. Prior work has suggested that DNA methylation is required for proper
development of maize. This project will characterize the genome-wide patterns of
DNA methylation in callus of maize in order to document any changes in this cell
type. Genome editing approaches will be utilized to create loss-of-function
mutations in three key DNA methylation pathways in cell culture. These cell
lines can then be used to document changes in gene or transposable element
expression to provide insights into the roles of DNA methylation in regulation
of expression. Several enzymes known to play roles in demethylation of DNA will
also be over-expressed in callus tissue in an attempt to generate partial, or
locus-specific, reductions in DNA methylation. Attempts will be made to recover
plants containing the loss-of-function mutations or over-expressing DNA
demethylases that would be used to study the effects of these changes in
vegetative plant tissues. The materials generated by this project may provide
novel resources for understanding the role of DNA methylation in a species with
a large, complex crop genome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
