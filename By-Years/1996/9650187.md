This project initiates an undergraduate systems and controls laboratory, which
will be utilized by the Electrical, Mechanical, Chemical and Bioresource, and
Civil Engineering Departments. It is well recognized that classroom exercises or
computer simulations alone are not sufficient to develop the critical-thinking
and problem-solving skills students need. The intent of this project is to
address these issues with the use of a multidisciplinary laboratory, built
around a central systems and controls theme and running in conjunction with the
appropriate courses in each department. The students learn how to combine
knowledge from various parts of the curriculum and apply that knowledge to
achieve a desired engineering goal. The laboratory is equipped with experiments
in the following areas: core controls experiments, illustrating fundamentals of
systems and control theory on typically encountered problems such as
mass/spring/damper systems and servomechanisms; electrical emphasis,
facilitating more detailed study of electromechanical control problems,
including DC and AC machines controlled by thyristors, pulse width modulation,
and variable frequency drives; chemical and bioresource emphasis, allowing study
of fluid flow and heat transfer, together with autotuning, and adaptive control
on a model chemical process rig; and mechanical emphasis, involving the study of
hybrid/supervisory control, and how to integrate machines (with appropriate
cross-communication) to perform high-level tasks, using a robotics and automated
manufacturing workstation. The experiments use control problems commonly
encountered in industry and modern real-time control and instrumentation
strategies, with each experiment driven from a PC with data acquisition
capabilities and virtual instrumentation software. This setup enables students
to gain experience on realistic projects and develop practical design skills
that are up to date.
