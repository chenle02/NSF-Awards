The proposed research at Stanford University aims to provide new understanding
of the underlying causes for a fundamental property of nature known as neutrino
oscillations. One of the unexpected results in particle physics during the last
decade has been the discovery that neutrinos have mass, that they have the
ability to change from one species to another as they travel through space or
matter, and that the extent of these transformations (mixing angles) is
surprisingly large. Neutrinos are fundamental constituents of our universe and,
together with photons are the most numerous. Yet, neutrinos are poorly
understood compared to other fundamental constituents and further studies are
required to understand many significant issues in cosmology and astrophysics, to
probe physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics, and to resolve the
mystery of matter-antimatter asymmetry in our universe. The proposed program
consists of the MINOS experiment and planning for an off-axis neutrino
experiment with the neutrino beam currently being completed at Fermilab. The
MINOS experiment is in its final stages of construction. The far detector of
MINOS, located in the Soudan Mine in northern Minnesota was completed in August
2003 and has begun taking data on cosmic rays. The neutrino beam and other
related construction efforts at Fermilab are expected to be complete by the end
of 2004 and data taking with accelerator neutrinos should commence shortly
thereafter. The MINOS experiment will significantly improve our knowledge of
neutrino oscillation parameters in the atmospheric neutrino energy region; will
search for subdominant oscillation modes into electron and/or sterile neutrinos;
and will observe oscillatory behavior of muon neutrino disappearance, thus
providing a conclusive test of the oscillation origin of that phenomenon.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the research will occur at several
levels: (a) Understanding how matter is constructed and how the forces of nature
shape it into the myriad observed forms is a long standing question that
resonates with scientists and non-scientists alike; (b) The research program
poses a set of questions through which students and postdoctoral fellows will
learn not only to frame crisp tests of the fundamental construction of matter,
but also to devise innovative methods and tools for conducting them. Attacking
such problems provides the rigorously educated young people that our society
desperately needs; and (c) the proposal includes elements of outreach to the
broader community.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
