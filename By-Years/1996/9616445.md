CISE/EHR/ENG/MPS Collaborative Research on Learning Technologies Program:
National Center for Collaborative Research The University of Illinois, has been
awarded $50,000 for a 12 month period to develop the rationale and plan for
establishing a virtual National Center for Collaborative Research (NCCR) on
Learning Technologies. The proposed NCCR will perform multi-disciplinary
research and development in learning technologies. The activities of the
proposed center will be directed toward developing and evaluating web-based
learning technologies for application domains in which the community of learners
is relatively heterogeneous. These application domains include learning in K-12
and College environments, learning for industrial competitiveness, and learning
for health care and social services. Partners in this planning grant include
BBN, University of Arizona, Southern Illinois University, and the University of
Southern California.
