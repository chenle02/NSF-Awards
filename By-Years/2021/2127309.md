Due to the pandemic and the resulting uncertain circumstances, academic
institutions are facing major hiring disruptions. This leaves the computing
research community at risk of losing yet another class of young researchers who
cannot afford to wait out the current disruption and thus may leave the research
career path permanently. It is not a stretch to anticipate that the loss of this
workforce in the research pipeline will have long-lasting downstream effects on
computing innovation and impact. The Computing Innovation Fellows (CIFellows)
Program addresses these issues by providing funding for two-year postdoctoral
positions for recent PhD graduates in computer information science and
engineering to provide a career-enhancing bridge experience that will give them
the opportunity to remain in the academic research community and retain a cohort
of early career professionals in areas under the umbrella of NSF CISE.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With funding by the National Science Foundation, the
CIFellows 2021 program will offer two-year postdoctoral opportunities in
computing, with cohort activities to support career development and community
building. This program is open to researchers whose work falls under the
National Science Foundation Computing and Information Science and Engineering
Directorate and who have completed or plan to complete their PhD between 1/1/20
- 12/31/21. Applicants will work with a mentor from a US academic institution
for their postdoc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
