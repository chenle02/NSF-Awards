This research concerns the study of adaptive control of sampled-data systems
which contain at least one non-linearity. The motivation for the study is to
bring the theory of adaptive control closer to the reality of practical
problems. The method of study proposed is to combine the small gain theory with
the method of averaging in the environment of equations written in error space.
The method uses the idea of a tuned system as introduced recently by Kosut. The
class of sampled-data systems to be studied includes virtually every successful
application of adaptive control known. Inclusion of some non-linearity in the
plant to be controlled completes the consideration of non-ideal process already
begun in many studies by consideration of un-modelled dynamics, bounded
disturbances and sensor noise.
