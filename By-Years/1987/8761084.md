Existing steel structures, bridges and buildings, are being rehabilitated to
extend their useful life. This project will investigate a unique method of using
a prestressed stiffening system consisting of kevlar and glass/polyester resin
materials. The result of this strengthening technique is added service life,
increased stiffness, greater fatigue resistance, and excellent corrosion
resistance.
