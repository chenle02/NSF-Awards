This award will provide travel funds for participants in the NSF Grant Proposal
Writing Workshop at the 2016 Annual Meeting of the Minerals, Metals and
Materials Society (TMS) in Nashville, Tennessee. The workshop will be held the
first day of the Annual Meeting, 14 February 2016. Current and former NSF
Program Officers will provide an overview of the proposal review
process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award will support workshop registration and
travel for approximately 10 participants in the workshop. The registration and
travel support for this workshop will be prioritized for researchers from
underrepresented groups as well as early career researchers to help encourage
greater participation by these groups in the minerals, metals and materials
fields. Ultimately, the goal of the workshop is to help foster future
generations of materials scientists and engineers by further increasing PIs'
preparedness in the proposal development and submission process.
