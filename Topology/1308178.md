Most of the proposal is dedicated to the large scale geometry of the outer
automorphism group of a free group of finite rank and of the associated Outer
space. Mapping class group theory developed in the last 15 years serves as a
guide and much of this approach has already been implemented in the last 2-3
years, but the hard questions remain, mostly due to the fact that there aren't
"enough" projections analogous to subsurface projections. Understanding this
could lead to quasi-isometric rigidity of automorphism groups of free groups.
The proposal concludes with several smaller sections involving specific
questions about the second homology of Torelli groups, homology growth of
pseudo-Anosov homeomorphisms in finite covers, and the geometry of quadratic
forms as seen from the well rounded retract.

The subject of the proposal is the study of topological and geometric properties
of several objects that naturally appear in mathematics. For example, consider
the collection of all possible finite graphs with a fixed number of cycles. This
collection forms a space, called Outer space. There is a natural geometry
associated with it, whose intrinsic feature is that it is not symmetric (not
unlike in a city with one-way streets, where it might be quicker to get from A
to B than from B to A). Nevertheless, this geometry displays hyperbolic features
as well. In hyperbolic geometry, if one considers shortest paths joining each
pair of three points A,B,C there is always a "point of congestion" T with all
three of these paths coming close to T. A part of the proposal is to explore
this phenomenon further.
