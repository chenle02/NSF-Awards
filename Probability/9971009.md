This is a joint project of E. B. Dynkin (Cornell University) and S. E. Kuznetsov
(University of Colorado, Boulder). The investigators will continue their work on
relations between superdiffusions and a class of semilinear partial differential
equations. The program includes applications of recently developed probabilistic
tools to fundamental problems on such equations as a characterization of
positive solutions by their boundary traces and a classification of boundary
singularities.

Superdiffusions are a special class of branching measure-valued stochastic
processes also known as superprocesses. During the last decades these processes
attracted efforts of many investigators around the world. Outside of pure
mathematics, they play a significant role in population genetics and they
provide new tools for the study of complex physical systems with infinitely many
degrees of freedom. These researchers will continue their joint work on
relations between superdiffusions and differential equations involving a second
order nonlinear function. The research program includes applications of recently
developed probabilistic classifications of boundary singularities.
