In this research project supported by the Inorganic, Bio- inorganic and
Organometallic Chemistry Program, Stephen L. Buchwald of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology will investigate the syntheses, structures and chemical
reactivities of novel organometallic compounds of the early transition metals.
The aim is to find compounds which display unprecedent- ed reactivity and
structure, and to develope efficient methods for the synthesis of
polyfunctionalized organic compounds including numerous classes of heterocycles.
The work has two thrusts. The first is to examine the tri- methylphosphine-
zirconocene system with benzyne, benztriyne, naphthatetrayne and other similar
organic moieties as ligands and to probe the limits to which a metal can
stabilize an unstable organic fragment. The second thrust is to examine similar
chemistries of cyclopentadienyl compounds of other early transition metals
including titanium, hafnium and tantalum.
