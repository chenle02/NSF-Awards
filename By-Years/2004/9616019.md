In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division,
Scott Auerbach of the Department of Chemistry of the University of
Massachusetts-Amherst will model the microscopic dynamical processes that
control hydrocarbon mobility and reactivity in X- and Y-zeolites. Specifically
benzene hopping, diffusion and reorientation rates will be calculated for
different substituted zeolites. The proton transfer rates between the oxygens
and adsorbed butene in acidic zeolites will be simulated. The proton dynamics
calculations will help understanding the mechanism of formation of hydrocarbons,
which may suggest ways to improve the performance of these materials. The aim is
to develop better understanding for the fundamental processes involved in the
production of hydrocarbons in zeolites. This is of importance in the production
of hydrocarbons from non-traditional sources.
