Form 7 Peer reviews were not required for this proposal because it is an
Interagency agreement and a service agreement. The National Science Foundation
(NSF) Proposal and Award Manual states in section 122 .2.(B) that peer review is
not applicable for " services provided by another Federal agency in support of
Polar Programs" 9314735 Petty The Fish and Wildlife Sevice will further develop
and test lipid dosimeters or semipermeable membrane devices for use in
Antarctica. The dosimeter is essentially a semipermeable plastic tube containing
triolein (a lipid). The device is designed to be placed insitu in water and
simulate the uptake of contaminants by aquatic biota. The contaminants in the
lipid are extracted and analyzed by conventional analytical methods. The
advantages of the technique are 1) deployment of the dosimeter is much simpler
than collecting aquatic biota; 2)data between sampling locations are comparable
whereas data from different species are not; 3). divers are not needed; 4)
aquatic biota are not harvested; and 5). sample holding time are probably
extend. ***
