This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop
a novel manufacturing method to produce high-accuracy, optical encoders.
Encoders are sensors that measure position, either linear or angular, and
convert it into an electronic signal. Modern automation and robotics systems
heavily rely on encoders for precision positioning and motion control. The
global encoder market is projected to reach $4.4 billion by 2028, growing from
$2.4 billion in 2022. Increasingly accurate encoders are needed to further
innovate and enable the manufacturing of complex next-generation products, such
as advanced microchips, implantable medical devices, and precision weapon
systems. As design specifications become more stringent, the need to meet the
demand for high-precision encoders becomes paramount. Successful completion of
the project will establish a pilot capability to cost-effectively produce
encoders with over an order of magnitude finer fundamental resolution.

The intellectual merit of this project is focused on developing a technology
that has the potential to revolutionize the manufacturing of optical encoders.
Traditional encoder production involves using contact photolithography to
replicate a pattern from a master photomask. However, this process requires a
full-size photomask, introduces defects and errors into the device, and limits
the achievable accuracy and resolution. To address these drawbacks, a novel,
high-resolution, projection lithography system is being developed to drive an
additive micro-fabrication technique. The new approach offers numerous
advantages, including economically viable production of precision encoders with
sub-nanometer resolution, improved manufacturing yield, and shorter lead times.
The Phase II research activities encompass the development of a full-size
hardware prototype with performance traceable to NIST (National Institute of
Standards and Technology) standards, as well as the establishment of the
necessary infrastructure to support the newly developed technology.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
