In the course of our work on the control of flagellar formation we showed that
flagelin gene expression was controlled by DNA inversion mediated by Hin
Recombinase. Our detailed studies of the mechanisms of this reaction have
revealed that it involves the formation of nucleo-protein complexes that include
multiple proteins associated with specific DNA binding sites. The assembly of
similar structures involving elaborated DNA-protein interactions has been
implicated in the mechanisms involved in specific gene expression, viral
integration and transposition. Hin-Recombinase offers a relatively simple model
in which to study the role of "enhancers" and other "factors" in the formation
of the complex DNA-protein structures required to achieve efficient, site
specific, directional recombination. Our immediate goal is to understand in
detail the nature of the Hin Recombinase reaction, i.e. the mechanism of Hin-DNA
interaction, the activation of the Hin-DNA cleavage reaction, the nature of the
interaction of Hin with the enhancer complex and the mechanism involved in Hin-
DNA inversion. We will use extensive mutagenesis, studies of invivo function and
in vitro reconstitution with modified protein and DNA sites to understand how
the recombinase and enhancer function during the course of the reaction.
