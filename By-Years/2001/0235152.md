The genomes of all organisms contain DNA sequences called promoters that control
gene expression. The goal of this project is to understand how these regulatory
sequences vary genetically within populations. We will survey variation in
regulatory sequences from several genes in the purple sea urchin, an animal
model system that is particularly favorable for such analyses. We will then test
the function of variant sequences for their ability to bind specific proteins
that regulate gene expression. Finally, we will screen for promoter sequence
variants that alter the timing of gene expression. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Studies
of human genetics have revealed extensive variation in promoter sequences and in
their regulatory function. Our meta-analysis of this data, published earlier
this year, was the first study to provide direct evidence that differences in
regulatory sequences comprise a substantial fraction of the total functional
genetic variation within a population. The current project will extend these
studies in an organism where we can analyze an unbiased sample of genetic
variation in regulatory sequences that has a functional impact. The results of
these analyses will advance understanding of the population genetics of a
portion of the genome that is functionally critical but understudied.
