The Boolean satisfiability method for testing combinational circuits generates
test patterns in two steps. First, it constructs a formula expressing the
Boolean difference between the unfaulted and faulted circuits. Second, it
applies a Boonlean satisfiability algorithm to the resulting formula. This
differs from most current approaches to testing which directly search the
circuit data structure. This method has been shown to be effective in
identifying defective combinational circuits when the defects can be modeled by
the single stuck at fault model. This research is extending the Boolean
satisfiability method to handle a wide variety of nonclassical faults.
Modifications to the method to detect bridging and delay faults are being
investigated.
