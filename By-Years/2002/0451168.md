Proposal #: 04-51168&lt;br/&gt;This award provides renewed support for an REU
Site at the University of Delaware's College of Marine Studies, located in
Lewes, DE. The site will support ten students during a ten-week summer program
each year. Students conduct independent research during the internship on a wide
variety of marine-related topics. They also participate in a series of seminars
designed to provide them with an overview of important scientific topics, and
informal workshops on how to write scientific papers, life in graduate school,
and careers in marine science. At the end of the program, the students present
results of their research in a mini-symposium. After the program, students are
encouraged to continue their research, to submit papers for publication in peer-
reviewed scientific journals, and to present their work at scientific
conferences.&lt;br/&gt;
