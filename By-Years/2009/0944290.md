In the United States of America heart disease is the leading cause of death.
Nearly 2500 Americans die of cardiovascular disease each day, which claims more
lives than cancer, chronic respiratory diseases, accidents, and diabetes
mellitus combined. Human cardiac troponin I (cTnI) is superior to other
biomarkers in the diagnosis of myocardial infarction due to its specificity. The
overall objective of the proposed research is the detection of cTnI based on the
fluorescence spectroscopic technique using a chemically-modified quartz slide
with a mutant monoclonal mouse IgG.

The specific aims are: (i) Surface chemistry characterization of IgG mutants at
the air-water interface; (ii) Surface modification of a solid substrate suitable
for the chemical attachment of the mutant IgG; (iii) Detection of cTnI using
fluorescence spectroscopic technique of the chemically-attached mutant IgG-
fluorophore.

Accomplishment of this proposed project will provide a revolutionary route for
earlier and faster diagnosis using this biomarker. It will open a new avenue to
directly detect the cTnI in a blood sample instead of the plasma and serum
samples commonly used with spectroscopic techniques such as surface plasmon
resonance spectroscopy. The transformative nature of this project lies in its
innovative approach of detection using a chemically-attached mutant IgG.
