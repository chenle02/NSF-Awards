Nutritional symbioses between plants and soil microbes are critically important
to plant evolution and ecosystem function, yet we know almost nothing about the
evolutionary dynamics and mechanisms of persistence of these ancient
interactions. Mutualistic interactions are widespread and obligatory for many
organisms, yet their evolutionary persistence in the face of cheating is
theoretically puzzling. Partner-choice and partner-fidelity are mechanisms for
dealing with cheaters, and can theoretically allow mutualisms to persist.
Evidence for sanctions against cheaters, a form of partner-choice, has recently
been uncovered in several plant-pollinator interactions. Market models assume
partner choice, and hence offer useful paradigms for understanding the
evolutionary dynamics of mutualisms in which individuals attempt to conduct
mutually beneficial trade of resources with multiple individuals (the market).
The proposed studies will test whether partner-choice can explain the
evolutionary persistence of this mutualism in wild legumes of the genus Lupinus,
and Bradyrhizobium, the nitrogen-fixing bacteria that inhabit their root
nodules. Achieving these goals is the first step in an integrated analysis of
genetic variation, symbiotic quality, and plant adaptive responses in the
legume-rhizobium interaction. Our results will begin to construct a framework
for understanding the persistence and evolutionary dynamics of this important
mutualism.
