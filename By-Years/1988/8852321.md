This project extends the use of an existing instrumentation laboratory by
incorporating programmable control capability. The major items of equipment are
eight programmable controllers with the necessary computers and software. A
number of transducers and associated equipment are also used in this lab. The
equipment is used by engineering juniors and seniors to study experimental
aspects of automatic control. They experiment with control of processes and
machines without undue circuitry design and construction. These students gain
proficiency in an area of engineering which is in increasing demand in today's
industry. This award is being matched by an equal sum from the grantee.
