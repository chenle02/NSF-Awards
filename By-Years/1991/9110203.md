This research is on accurate models of the electrical performance of
interconnections on digital circuits. Maintenance of the fidelity of a signal as
it propagates through various interconnections is a key factor in proper
functioning of integrated circuits (IC's). For very high-speed IC's, there is a
complicated electromagnetic nature of the signal propagation. Accurate models of
the complex interconnection structures are difficult to obtain. In the model
being developed transient responses of signal propagation through
interconnections are represented by the three-dimensional, full-wave, finite
difference solution of Maxwell's equations in the time domain. This solution is
being developed to conform to the interconnection geometries found in multilayer
IC's. Attention is being paid to excitation and absorbing boundary conditions to
ensure a high degree of numerical accuracy. Various interconnection structures
are being analyzed, with special consideration being given to bends of different
angles (connections on the same layer) and vias of different geometries
(connections between adjacent layers).
