Abstract - Toward Improved Understanding of Warnings for Short-Fuse Weather
Events&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meteorological and hydrological sciences have
shown dramatic improvements in offering increased lead-times, better long-term
models and integrated real-time monitoring for short fuse weather events. At the
same time the social science research necessary to translate the new knowledge
into improved responses to short-fuse weather events is
missing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project challenges the current state of
public perceptions of warnings for flash floods and tornadoes. A team of
geographers and psychologists will work closely with forecasters and emergency
managers in the two case study cities of Austin, TX and Denver, CO: cities with
high growth rates, great diversity, and significant disaster potential. We have
five objectives: 1) to develop an enhanced understanding of warnings by studying
public and private sources of warning information; 2) to see how changing
demography of the US influences public responses to warnings; 3) to evaluate the
use and potential of new technologies for warning perceptions and responses; 4)
to assess the construct of "false alarms" for short-fuse weather events; and, 5)
to evaluate the applicability of social cognitive theory as a framework to
understand the differences between how people respond to warnings.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results from this research will have broad implications
for future warning procedures providing new directions for local and state
emergency managers and for the federal agencies involved in warnings including
the National Weather Service, the Bureau of Reclamation, FEMA, and the US Army
Corps of Engineers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
