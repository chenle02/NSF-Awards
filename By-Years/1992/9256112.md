Hampton University will initiate a three-week, residential Young Scholars Early
Alert project in Mathematics and Physics for 24 minority students entering grade
7. The program will focus on student involvement in mathematics and physics
projects with Hampton University physics and mathematics professors, scientists
from a Department of Energy site, the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator
Facility (CEBAF) and NASA. Project goals are to enhance mathematics and physics
skills and to stimulate career interest in science-related fields among young
minority students.
