ILI - Leadership in Laboratory Development: Mathematics Title: The Mathematics
Archives Outreach Program: A Program of Dissemination and Education about
Mathematics on the Internet The Internet is becoming an increasingly fertile
source for information and tools of use and interest to the mathematics
community. These resources range from programs and class notes to data sets for
statistics and discussions of timely topics vital to the mathematical community.
Many persons who would benefit from these resources are unable to do so because
of a lack of knowledge of what is available and a lack of understanding of how
to access items on the Internet. Based on experience with the Internet in
establishing and running the Mathematics Archives, this project is informing the
mathematical community about available resources on the Internet and educating
them on how to access those resources. This will be accomplished with an
ambitious program consisting of presentations at sectional meetings of the MAA
and running special sessions, workshops, and minicourses at national and
regional meetings, such as those of the MAA/AMS, AMATYC, and ICTCM. The impact
of this program on the mathematical community is expected to be substantial.
