This grant will provide continued support of research on rare gasses, and
isotopes of other rare gasses, from volcanic centers over hot spots, and along
convergent plate margins and continental rifts. Primary emphasis has been on 3He
as a "primordial" tracer for mantle volatiles, and its association with methane
and the isotopic composition of carbon in CH4 and CO2. The cosmogenic nature of
3He in volcanic lavas has been recognized and its usefulness as a tracer in
erosion studies has been demonstrated. High 3He/4He ratios, relative to Mid-
Ocean Ridge Basalts, have been identified in eight Pacific hotspot terrains,
clear evidence of transport of gases from the less depleted mantle by rising
plumes. These and similar types of research using rare gasses to solve problems
of mantle chemistry and dynamics will continue under the PIs supervision. This
award will provide for the analysis of many samples already collected, and will
support the operation of the PI's lab for another year
