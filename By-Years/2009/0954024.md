Fixing software bugs is a difficult and time-consuming process, accounting for
up to 90% of the lifetime cost of a typical program. Because the number of
defects outstrips the resources available for repairing them, most software is
shipped with both known and unknown bugs. This research builds upon a novel,
fully-automated method for repairing bugs in existing software, producing
trustworthy repairs for real-world programs. The research will be broadly
applicable, targeting large legacy applications with many testcases.

The technical focus of the work is a scalable and trustworthy technique to
automatically repair program bugs. Program variants are evolved, using analogues
of biological processes such as mutation, until one is found that both retains
required functionality and avoids the defect. Thousands of standard software
testcases, program invariants, mined specifications, and "fuzz" inputs are used
to represent bugs, encode program requirements, and build trusted repairs.
Empirical evaluations include an automated hardening scenario: programs and
attacks against them are coevolved over time, simulating parts of the security
arms race. Significant potential outcomes include: a scalable and trustworthy
automated program repair methodology and freely available tools; advances in
formal program analyses; significant efforts in outreach and education; and
dissemination of the results.
