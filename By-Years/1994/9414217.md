9414217 Shapley Univ. of Ill. Urbana-Champaign Dr. John R. Shapley, Univ. of
Ill. Urbana-Champaign, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and
Organometallic Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division to develop the
organometallic chemistry of intermediate sized transition metal carbonyl cluster
compounds which contain six to twelve metal atoms. The specific systems to be
studied include: (1) compounds which are related to a carbido heptarhenium
cluster and which contain a methylene moiety; (2) hydrocarbon ligand derivatives
of a decaruthenium cluster system which adopts a unique structure that
apparently can 'reconstruct' in order to bind a hydrocarbon group; (3) compounds
in which a heptarhenium cluster unit mimics the common cyclopentadienyl ligand
in binding a metal complex fragment but engenders enhanced reactivity at the
metal vertex; and (4) the process of carbon monoxide disproportionation on a
hexaruthenium framework, a reaction that is a direct molecular analog of the
surface Boudouard reaction and one that may be important for initiating the
Fischer-Tropsch hydrocarbon synthesis process. Metals are used as catalysts in a
number of important industrial chemical processes including the refining of
petroleum. However, the details of how metal surfaces are able to carry out and
facilitate chemical reactions is not yet clearly understood. This project
focuses on a series of compounds which contain six to twelve metal atoms. These
complexes are small enough to permit the details of their interactions with
other species to be studied in great detail, but large enough to model metal
surfaces. The species chosen for investigation represent particularly suitable
models for the sites on roughened metal surfaces that are most active in
breaking C-C, C-N, and C-O bonds. In addition to providing a basic understanding
of metal mediated chemical reactions, new classes of organometallic cluster
compounds, which themselves may show catalytic properties will be prepared.
