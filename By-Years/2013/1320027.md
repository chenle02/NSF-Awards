The energy efficiency of high-end computers has reached a plateau for some time
now, yielding devices that are constrained by power and thermal limits and do
not realize the full performance potential of advanced semiconductors. This
research project will explore computing architectures that rely on energy
recycling to operate with significantly improved energy efficiency and are thus
capable of achieving sustained clock speeds well in excess of 10GHz without any
special cooling requirements. The resulting technologies will be assessed
through the design and evaluation of silicon prototype chips. The outcomes of
this research project can be transformative, demonstrating integrated computing
systems that achieve unprecedented performance levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
proposed research is expected to have a significant impact on the realization of
next-generation high-performance computers, promoting discovery, teaching, and
learning in novel design technologies that yield energy-efficient electronics.
Broader outcomes of the proposed effort include the integration of research
activities into graduate-level courses, the development of lectures and projects
for advanced undergraduate-level courses, the direct involvement of electrical
engineering and computer science majors through senior-level design projects,
and the engagement of high school students.
