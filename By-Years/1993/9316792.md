IBN 93 16792 Thomson Abstract The components of an ecosystem are often related
to each other in amazing ways. For example, the movement patterns of bees
foraging on flowers have substantial implications for the pollination of the
plants. If individual bees repeatedly visit a small number of plants in a small
area, gene flow will be restricted. However, studying movement patterns of bees
has proven technically very difficult. Dr. Thomson will carry out experiments to
determine the feasibility of using video cameras to generate the data needed to
evaluate movement patterns and their consequences in bees. If successful, these
methods will be applicable to a variety of theoretical and applied problems.
