Neutron scattering experiments are to be implemented at the National Institute
of Standards and Technology research reactor, pursuing three general lines of
research. The first involves magnetic ordering and spin fluctuations associated
with the copper ions in copper oxide superconductors. The second concerns the
nature of the rare earth ordering in "magnetic superconductors." The third
comprises experiments on the spin dynamics of isotropic ferromagnets.
