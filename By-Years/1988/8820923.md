Studies, involving the development of methods for studying the regulation of
adrenal steroidogenesis in the mallard duck embryo, will be supported. The
studies will ultimately contribute to our understanding of the regulatory
mechanisms concerned with the overall control of the adrenal steroidogenic
function. The experimental system will be the developing adrenal gland in the
mallard duck embryo. Histochemical and immunocytochemical analysis, coupled with
ultrastructure analysis, are necessary to identify the products and identify the
distribution of nerve tissue. Tissue-superfusion technique and radioimmunoassay
are needed for defining the functional characteristics of the developing tissue.
The approach will allow the investigators to establish when the developing
anlage becomes sensitive to corticotropin and angiotensin II.
