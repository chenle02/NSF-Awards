The use of very high pressures to modify reaction kinetics and thermodynamics is
a well known concept that has been rarely used in the context of thin film
growth. In this proposal we request partial funding for the acquisition of a
high pressure reactor system for the synthesis of thin film oxides at growth
pressures as high as 20,000 psi. This facility will allow us to expand the scope
and enhance current research into high pressure thin film oxidation synthesis.
Preliminary experiments have shown that high pressure oxidation processing
allows the use of much lower processing temperatures which minimize interactions
between substrate materials and thin film overlayers. In one project, we have
demonstrated the utility of this technique for the passivation of Group IV
heterostructure semiconductor systems. It also represents a novel method for the
synthesis of oxide thin films for optical, electronic, ferroelectric, and
superconducting applications.
