9406776 Shonkwiler The Principal Investigators of the School of Mathematics of
the Georgia Institute of Technology will purchase a Silicon Graphics Challenge L
parallel computer associated hardware and software. This equipment will be
dedicated to support the mathematical research of the individual of the group
some of whom need the computational power to make their computations feasible
and some of whom are doing research in parallel processing. The equipment will
allow the PI's and their graduate students to carry out several research
projects, including in particular: 1.) Global Dynamics of Ordinary Differential
Equations; 2.) Global Dynamics from Time Series Data; 3.) Proof of the Four
Color Theorem and its Generalization Known as Grotzsch Conjecture; 4.) Numerical
Methods for Hyperbolic Systems; and 5.) Random Restarts in Global Optimization.
All of the projects above have a strong computational component and aim at
developing reliable and rigorously algorithms.
