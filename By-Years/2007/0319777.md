This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop an
environmentally friendly, low cost, fine pitch and high reliability flip chip
interconnect for the electronic industry. The ultimate goal of this technology
is to develop a process that begins with a semiconductor integrated circuit (IC)
with either aluminum (Al) or copper (Cu) bond pads and results in an IC ready
for flip-chip bonding using lead-free solder. The Phase I project will
demonstrate printing the under bump metal (UBM) on Cu pads using a combination
of nanomaterials and thermally converting the deposit into a solder wetable,
layered metal film, and printing the lead free solder bumps on the UBM using a
high temperature solder-jet printing technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
commercial applications of this technology could lead to reduced cost and cycle
time for the electronic industry. Flip chip performance and size advantages
would be available to low volume applications at minimum entry costs. No
photolithography, vacuum processes, plating processes or lead are needed. This
not only reduces the manufacturing and facilities cost but also replaces
historically hazardous processes (photolithography and plating) with an
environmental friendly additive process. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
