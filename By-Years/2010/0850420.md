This project will help support the continued development of the field of
biogeography, an interdisciplinary study that integrates topics of importance in
evolutionary biology, paleo-biology, conservation biology, and ecology. It will
accomplish this through funding the travel costs of 40 US graduate students and
post-docs to attend the annual meeting of the International Biogeography Society
(IBS) in Merida, Mexico, in January 2009. The conference is organized to provide
young scientists with networking and educational opportunities that will provide
many benefits of broader impact to their professional development, as well as
their intellectual development. The IBS meeting emphasizes interaction among
scientists from diverse countries, institutions, and career stages, and is
designed to highlight and explore the frontiers of the field, fostering the
intellectual development of scientists and progress of the field. Additionally,
this project significantly enhances international contacts between U.S. graduate
students, foreign students, and other scientists of all career stages.
