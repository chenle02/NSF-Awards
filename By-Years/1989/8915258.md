The variability of the broad emission lines in the spectra of active galactic
nuclei reveals fundamental information about the structure and kinematics of the
line-emitting region and about the nature of the central source that cannot be
obtained in any other way. This program determines the structure and kinematics
of the broad-line emitting regions in active galactic nuclei through repeated
observations of a limited number of sources. We greatly improve the temporal
resolution of our on-going monitoring project by making use of a Remote
Observing Facility which has been developed for use with the Perkins 1.8 m
telescope. Furthermore, the quality of the individual observations will be
greatly improved through the use of a new CCD spectrograph. The CCD spectrograph
is interfaced to the telescope with a fiber- optic feed which enables us to use
the spectrograph for partial nights without a complete change of instrumentation
at the Casse- grain focus of the telescope. This allows us to observe a few
selected sources frequently with minimal impact on other scien- tific programs.
