Drs. Carlton Pryor and Theodore Williams at Rutgers University will carry out a
set of observations to study processes in globular clusters of stars. They will
determine the mass functions of stars and the frequency of binary stars in
specifically chosen clusters for comparison to a more average population of
clusters. The mass functions will be studied by measuring mass-to-light ratios,
and binaries will be discovered through surveys for stars with variable radial
velocities. The stars in globular clusters represent one of our best samples of
the early generations of stars in our Galaxy. We study them to better understand
more distant old stellar populations and because they are among our few clues to
conditions during the formation of the Galaxy. Globular clusters are also an
excellent laboratory for studying stellar dynamics. Significant dynamical
evolution in the cluster has already taken place. This research will address
three questions about globular clusters. What is the frequency and spatial
distribution of primordial binary stars? Has dynamical evolution modified the
mass function in low-concentration clusters? How common are steep increases of
the velocity dispersion in the cusps of clusters?
