Solar flares are the largest explosions in the solar system that release huge
amounts of energy. Flares are observed as transient brightenings throughout the
electromagnetic spectrum, lasting from a few seconds to hours. The way that this
energy release occurs is poorly understood. This project will utilize 3D solar
flare modeling and new observational data from the Expanded Owens Valley Solar
Array (EOVSA) to better understand how magnetic reconnection leads to the
release of magnetic energy and particle acceleration from solar flares. Software
tools will be developed and upgraded and used to teach high school interns about
solar physics and for graduate physics courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project
capitalizes on the unique ability of EOVSA to quantify evolution of solar flares
by dynamically measuring coronal magnetic fields along with the thermal and
nonthermal electron distributions with high spatial and temporal resolution. The
following fundamental science goals will be addressed: (i) to understand and
quantify the dynamics of solar flares of varying types, with an emphasis on the
3D spatial distribution and evolution of the coronal magnetic field and
nonthermal particles; (ii) to obtain new fundamental knowledge on universal
physical processes occurring on the Sun such as magnetic reconnection, particle
acceleration and transport, and plasma heating. The team will provide open
access to the research products to scientists and the public. The work utilizes
new microwave imaging data from the EOVSA, data from other ground-based
instruments, and data from the latest space missions, coupled with advanced
modeling and forward-fitting, to obtain the three-dimensional magnetic field and
particle distributions in flaring loops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
