This psycholinguistic project will be carried out as a dissertation project in
Japan and the USA. It will experimentally test native speakers of Japanese and
English to see if there are differences in how spoken sentences are parsed for
internal structure and how sentence structure is acquired by children learning
their first language. Both children and adults will be tested in order to
address current issues regarding the interaction of processing strategies and
first-language acquisition. Japanese and English provide a good pair for such
testing, since they are typologically very different sorts of languages.
