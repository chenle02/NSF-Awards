During the past decade there has been an increase in the design and complexity
of compound semiconductor devices and systems. For these devices and systems to
operate effectively, robust device and system designs are needed. Unfortunately
in the case of gallium arsenide devices, design engineers use workstation tools
that describe the complex conduction paths within devices by highly approximate
algorithms that are limited in their predictive abilities. The principle Phase I
research objectives are: (1) to utilize the SRA physically based drift and
diffusion equation algorithm to develop parameters allowing an equivalent
circuit representation of gallium arsenide field effect transistors to be used
in nonlinear device circuit analysis for large signals at high frequency. (2)
Use the nonlienar circuit differential equations in the design of a power FET,
and verify the design using the drift and diffusion equations. (3) Couple the
SRA generated nonlinear circuit differential equations to a general circuit
algorithm, in this case the Harmonic Balance Method. The innovative feature of
SRA's Phase I approach is to obtain the coefficients for the nonlinear circuit
representation of a compound semiconductor from the solutions to the nonlinear
governing partial differential equations. Success in this program would create a
device/circuit design tool useable by a broad range of design engineers that is
applicable to GaAs and other modern semiconductor materials. Under the Phase I
program the design tool shall be implemented for the problem of designing high
power gallium arsenide FETs. Under the Phase II part of the program the drift
and diffusion code and the Harmonic Balance Method circuit analysis will be put
into a workstation with a user interface that circuit and device designers can
use.
