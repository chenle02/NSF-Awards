Masonry construction comprises a large portion of building construction in the
U.S. and the world. Reinforced masonry construction use is increasing in
moderate to higher seismic zones because of its apparent features of economy,
fire safety, architectural flexibility and ease of construction. The present
state of masonry structural analysis and design, and materials and construction
technologies does not enable an accurate prediction of building behavior under
lateral loads such as seismic loads. In the U.S., masonry buildings are designed
and built with methods, codes, and standards that rely upon a mixture of working
stress methods, empirical rules, and questionable methods for determining
allowable stress values. Masonry is also a complex building material because of
the large number of design and construction variables which influence the final
products configuration and its response under seismic loads. In order to
describe the seismic response of masonry buildings it is necessary to develop
the fundamental knowledge base to determine basic design methodologies
consistent with safety and economic requirement. This research project addresses
additional issues and items in the U.S. Coordinated Program for Masonry Building
Research. These include data and information exchange between the research
components of the program, use of photogrammetry to supplement conventional
displacement measurements of in-plane specimens, e.g., shear walls, and
communication and consultation with appropriate code and regulatory groups.
These objectives will be addressed by meetings between researchers, use of
electronic mail, introduction of photogrammetry to enhance analytical model
development, and establishing liaison with technical groups to secure their
advice regarding the form and content of program design recommendations.
