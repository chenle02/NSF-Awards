Implementation Projects provide support to Historically Black Colleges and
Universities (HBCUs) to design, implement, study, and assess comprehensive
institutional efforts to increase the number of students receiving undergraduate
degrees in STEM and enhance the quality of their preparation by strengthening
STEM education and research. The project at Mississippi Valley State University
seeks to build on previous successful efforts to increase participation of
African-American students in STEM disciplines. This project seeks to increase
the number of undergraduate STEM majors being prepared to enter graduate school
in a STEM field by focusing on mathematics preparation and to provide
professional development to pre-service and in-service mathematics teachers. It
is noteworthy that most students who enter the university come from secondary
school systems where they have been taught mathematics by teachers who did not
hold a mathematics or mathematics education degree. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
objectives of the project are to: increase the number of STEM majors going to
graduate school; increase the mathematics content knowledge related to Common
Core State Standards for Mississippi Delta area teachers using a collaborative
team approach; and to prepare military veteran students to major in STEM
disciplines. The project strategies supporting these objectives are evidence-
based. They include a support structure for students, undergraduate student
research, curriculum development, teachers clinics, and a veterans' initiative.
Seventy pre-service and in-service mathematics teachers are involved in
professional development activities in the Teachers Teaching Teachers Clinics.
The project is guided by an on-going evaluation, as well as internal and
external advisory boards. This project is co-funded by the Robert Noyce Teacher
Scholarship Program.
