Quality Education for Minorities (QEM) Network, a non-profit organization, has
been instrumental in improving the education of under-represented groups that
have been undeserved historically by the nation's educational system. As an
agent for change, QEM continues to develop effective strategies for broadening
STEM participation, and focuses on issues and barriers that prevent minorities
from receiving a high quality education. This project supports internship
opportunities for students at the National Science Foundation as a mechanism to:
increase students understanding of science policy; develop the potential of
future leaders and proponents for STEM participation, including students from
low-income communities; and promote the continuation of STEM interests and
studies through the doctoral level. Complimentary to the internship experience
at NSF, students are required to engage in a science-oriented community K-12
outreach activity during the following academic year at their respective
institutions.
