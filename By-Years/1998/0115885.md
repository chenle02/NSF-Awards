EIA-0115885&lt;br/&gt;Diane J. Cook&lt;br/&gt;University of Texas at
Arlington&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MRI: Instrumentation for Intelligent Agent and
Wireless Computing Research &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a proposal for
equipment acquisition under the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program to
support research and student training on intelligent agents in a mobile
environment. The Wireless Intelligent Simulator Environment being established
will integrate software agents, human agents, and robot agents, so that
physically distributed interacting agents can perform a variety of tasks
cooperatively or competitively. &lt;br/&gt;
