The purpose of this research is to undertake a detailed geochemical examination
of megacrysts suites from the Malaitan alnoite (Solomon Islands), and the Sloan-
Nix kimberlite (Colorado). Samples will be gathered from existing collections
and initially characterized by EMP analysis. Fractionation trends thus defined
will allow critical samples to be selected for IMP analysis. Traverses will be
carried out on samples forming end-member compositions to the apparent
fractionation trends defined by EMP analyses. This approach will then pin-point
samples for isotopic analysis (Sr, Nd, Pb, O), using micro-sampling techniques
to investigate potential isotopic zonation within and between megacrysts. This
integrated approach is required to: 1) determine the nature of the parental
magma; 2) evaluate the mode of crystallization within the mantle regime; 3)
determine whether the proposed igneous fractionation occurred in an open- or
closed-system environment; 4) establish any link between megacryst
crystallization and metasomatic processes; and 5) examine the relationship (if
any) between Cr-rich and Cr- poor megacrysts.
