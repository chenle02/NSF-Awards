The elastic and inelastic mechanical behavior of rubberlike and soft biological
materials subjected to large deformation will be studies analytically and
experimentally. The role of the molecular structure and effects due to
prestress, preconditioning, and internal viscous damping will be investigated in
technical and biomechanical applications. Equations that include the molecular
chain number and predict the effect of preconditioning observed in tests on
elastomers and soft tissues will be derived. The theory will be confirmed by
experiments and applied to study the effect of preconditioning of arterial
balloons used in various surgical procedures will be studied theoretically and
in laboratory experiments.
