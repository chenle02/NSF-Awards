AST 0406891&lt;br/&gt;PI: Stephen Zepf&lt;br/&gt;Inst: Michigan State
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this collaborative work, Drs.
Stephen Zepf and Keith Ashman will study the formation and evolution of globular
cluster systems and their host galaxies through ground based observational
studies and semi-analytical theoretical models. The program will focus on two
areas of research. The first of these is to improve the determination of the
total number, color, and spatial distribution of globular clusters through wide-
field imaging and to develop theoretical tools to constrain the sites of metal-
poor globular cluster formation from these data. The second area is a combined
observational and theoretical study of the ages and metallicities of globular
cluster populations through the use of optical to near-IR colors, optical
spectroscopy and the development of semi-analytical models of galaxy and cluster
formation. The program will promote teaching, training, and learning by
including students at all levels into the research program, by incorporating
research into introductory courses and through involvement in outreach programs
for the public.&lt;br/&gt;
