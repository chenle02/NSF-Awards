0429590/0429595 Collaborative Research: Well-Founded Behavioral Software
Contracts

Robert Bruce Findler Matthias Felleisen

MacIlroy's vision of a marketplace of software components requires enforceable
contracts. Such a contract describes the expectations and obligations of a
contract; its enforcement system decides whose fault it is when a program breaks
a contract.

The first goal of this project is to investigate the nature of behavioral
contracts and mechanisms for monitoring contracts for all kinds of component
mechanisms, including classes, mixins, aspects, modules, and related constructs.
The second goal is to study how contracts can help improve static analyses and
how static analyses can partially verify contracts. Finally, the project team
will conduct an experiment with a component marketplace to test their software
contracts and contract monitoring systems.

In the long term, this research may help establish a truly competitive
marketplace of software components. In this marketplace, components will come
with open-source contracts. Alternate suppliers can then produce components with
near-equivalent contracts, and consumers can choose from an array of
interchangeable components.
