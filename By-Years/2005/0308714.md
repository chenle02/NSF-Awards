0308714 Lin This award will support a U.S. graduate student to conduct research
in East Asia. The primary goals of the East Asia Summer Institute program are to
expose students to East Asia science and engineering in the context of a
research laboratory, and to initiate personal relationships that will foster
research collaborations with foreign counterparts in the future. This project
will provide the student with first-hand research experience, an introduction to
science and science policy infrastructure, and orientation to culture and
language in East Asia.
