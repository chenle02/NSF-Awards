This award supports travel and subsistence for graduate students, postdoctoral
researchers, and junior faculty participating in the "Conference on Fluid
Dynamics, Analysis, and Numerics," held 28-30 June 2010 at Duke University. The
meeting focuses on three interrelated areas in theory and applications of fluid
dynamics: (1) analysis of partial differential equations relating to fluid
dynamics; (2) fluid motion driven by interfaces; and (3) computational methods
for fluid dynamics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference features keynote
addresses from leaders in the field and includes an extended poster session,
where graduate students, postdocs, and faculty will present contributed poster
presentations on their research; this is intended to be a central conference
component to foster the interaction of participants across research areas and
levels of experience. The conference brings together leading researchers to
provide an authoritative overview of the current state of the field and new
directions for further work for junior researchers. Participation of members of
groups underrepresented in mathematics is encouraged and
supported.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference web site:
