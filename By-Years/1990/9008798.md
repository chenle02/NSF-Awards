The principal investigator will devote her time on this project to further
understanding the role of algebraic machinery in Control Theory. The purpose of
this planning grant is to conduct research and to retrain, in order that the
principal investigator became an active participant in the Systems Theory
community. Collaboration with Professors Hinrichsen and Grunewald will be
actively developed.
