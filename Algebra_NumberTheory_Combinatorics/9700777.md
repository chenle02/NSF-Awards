Yang 9700777 Since Gross and Zagier proved their celebrated formula ten years
ago, a lot of applications have been found, including to the Birch and
Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture and to Gauss's class number problem. The Gross-Zagier
formula has been extended to the p-adic case and to higher weight case. One of
the main purposes of this project is to prove the Gross-Zagier formula without
any restriction on the ``imaginary quadratic field'' using Kudla's recent
results on the central derivative of Eisenstein series. This is a joint project
with Kudla. Kudla's idea is quite conceptional and should be able to work on
other classical groups. From that point of view, it seems also possible to
extend the Gross-Zagier formula to Shimura varieties of type O(n,2) or U(n, 1).
This will be a long term goal of the Principal Investigator. In the second part
of this project, the Principal Investigator plans to continue his study of the
leading coefficients of Hecke L-functions of CM number fields. The concerned
Hecke characters have a center of symmetry and have root number 1 or -1. When
the root number is 1, the PI has proved a formula to express the central Hecke
L-value as the inner product of some theta lifting from U(1) to itself, and
applied the formula to prove that a family of elliptic curves have rank 0. When
the root number is -1, the central L-value is 0 automatically. The PI plans to
prove a Gross-Zagier formula to relate the central derivative of the concerned
Hecke L-function to height pairing of two distinct cycles on some Shimura
variety associated to U(1) by adapting Kudla's idea. Furthermore, the PI plans
to apply the formula to prove that the central derivatives of the Hecke
L-functions do not vanish in some special cases. In particular, he wants to
prove that certain CM elliptic Q-curves have rational rank 1. When significant
progress is made in the first two parts, the PI will start o tackle similar
questions on the Picard modular surfaces. This proposal is an th e part of
mathematics known as the Langlands program. The Langlands program is part of
Number Theory. Number Theory is the study of the properties of the whole numbers
and is the oldest branch of mathematics. From the beginning problems in number
theory have furnished a driving force in creating new mathematics in other
diverse part of the discipline. The Langland's program is a general philosophy
that connect number theory with calculus; it embodies the modern approach to the
study of whole numbers. Modern Number Theory is very technical and deep, but it
has had astonishing application in areas like theoretical computer science and
coding theory.
