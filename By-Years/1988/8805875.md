A retrieval system model that leads to an integrated approach in which both
local and global feedback naturally blend into a unified process is proposed.
The novelty of this approach is that the relevance feedback of a particular
query instance as well as the accumulated knolwdge from past queries are
directly related to the performance of the present query. This model represents
a cluster-based approach to information retrieval. The cluster-based approach is
developed around a clustering technique that captures the users concept of
closeness between documents. Since the clustering technique to support the
retrieval process is developed. The principal advantage of the proposed model is
that the retrieval performance can be directly influenced by the optimization
criterion employed during clustering. The significance of our approach lies in
the fact that document representation and the measure of similarity among
doucments do not have to be prespecified in an ad hoc manner. Instead such
design alternatives can be dictated by cluster-scope of application than just
information retrieval.
