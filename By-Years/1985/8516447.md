The objective of this research is to investigate, by means of analytical models,
the nonlinear response of tied-back flexible retaining walls, during seismic
events with a view towards developing rationale methods of design. To represent
different practical situations, several anchoring conditions for the tie-rods
are considered, ranging from a fixed condition to anchors that are allowed to
displace within the soil backfill. The research will improve the understanding
of the mechanisms, including failure, by which tied-back walls deform under
dynamic loading. This will identify the conditions under which it may be
desirable to design the wall so that it can experience permanent displacements,
thereby resulting in ground motion that is less than the peak ground motion.
