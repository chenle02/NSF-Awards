The proposed projects has two major objectives: 1) development of a new optical
diagnostic capable of making simultaneous, full-field measurements of all three
velocity components and particle size and number density distributions in two-
phase flows, and 2) characterization of particle trajectories and size
distributions in an arc spray coating system and their relation to coating
porosity and grain structure. The accuracy and dynamic range limitations of the
new technique will first be characterize in a small wind tunnel seeded with
known size particles. Both free stream and stagnation flow measurements will be
made and compared to independently measured velocity profiles. A single solid-
state camera would acquire images of particle velocities (all three components),
sizes, and number densities. The technique will be used to characterize the
relationship between particle velocities, size, and temperature to coating
quality in an arc spray system. Similar conditions exists in paint sprays and
fuel sprays.
