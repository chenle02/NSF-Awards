Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have been playing critical roles in numerous
disciplines and sectors, as well as many emerging fields that might not
otherwise be possible. Examples include autonomous driving, virtual reality,
medical imaging, and parallel computing in HPC systems and data-centers. This
success should be largely credited to the massively parallel computing
capability of GPU architectures, which can integrate thousands of processing
cores on a single chip. To continue meeting growing performance expectations and
energy-efficiency, a key challenge over the next decade and beyond is how to
support on-chip communications among the vast number of processing cores and
provide fast and efficient data transfer to feed concurrent
computations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project establishes an integrated
research and education program to investigate cross-cutting approaches and
techniques to advance and improve the effectiveness of on-chip networks (NoCs)
in GPU systems, as well as to create academic course materials and outreach
activities for the education and broad dissemination of the proposed subjects.
The research component has three main thrusts: 1) increasing fundamental
understanding of GPU NoCs by investigating, among many other open problems, the
criticality, scalability and sensitivity of NoCs to GPU architecture; 2)
designing and implementing cost-effective router-based and routerless GPU NoCs,
and 3) co-optimizing NoC design with other GPU subsystems such as cache and warp
scheduling. The education and outreach components include developing automated
tools to increase the effectiveness of simulation-based course projects and
engage students from diverse backgrounds, strengthening architecture course
offerings, organizing interdisciplinary seminar courses, and leading various
outreach activities on K-12 education, women and underrepresented groups.
