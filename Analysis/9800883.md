Proposal:DMS-9800883 Principal Investigator: Abel Klein Abstract: The subject of
this research proposal is the study of localization of classical waves and
related phenomena, and of phenomena that occur in disordered systems. Classical
waves can exhibit phenomena normally associated with quantum mechanical electron
waves. The quantum mechanical wave nature of electrons is based on an analogy
with the scattering and interference of classical waves. But only recently has
the analogy been reversed and the possibility of the localization of classical
waves started to be investigated. Localization is a generic wave phenomena, not
specific to electron waves. The primary objective of this proposal is to
establish a solid mathematical basis for the investigation of the phenomena of
localization of classical waves. The following subtopics will be studied:
localization effects in complex media, nonlinear effects in photonic crystals,
exactly solvable models, a general framework for the localization of classical
waves, dynamical localization of classical waves, internal Lifshitz tails,
absolute continuity of the spectrum of periodic Maxwell operators. Other topics
to be investigated are random Schroedinger operators (a model for the motion of
an electron in a crystal with impurities) and long range spin glasses. New
optical materials and devices will lead to "lightronics" (electronics for
light), presently a subject of intensive research. Optical transistors are
examples of such new optical devices, and their fabrication will require new
optical materials. The development of lightronics will have tremendous
technological implications. Electronic devices (e.g., transistors) are based on
quantum mechanical phenomena. Electronic bound states, the simplest example of a
localized electron wave, are ubiquitous in nature. But the analogous phenomena
for light are not commonly observed in nature, even if theoretically possible.
Nature provides a variety of readily available materials for electronic locali
zation. But the corresponding materials for the localization of light and other
classical waves have to be fabricated. This requires a fundamental understanding
of how classical waves (e.g., light) can exhibit phenomena normally associated
with quantum mechanical electron waves. One of these is localization, a subject
that the present proposal addresses. This is a new area of research in both
basic and applied sciences, with a potentially huge payoff to society.
