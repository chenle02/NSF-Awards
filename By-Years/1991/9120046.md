This award will support a long-term visit by Professor MaryAnn Jerkofsky,
Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology and Molecular Biology, University of
Maine, to Japan for a cooperative research project with Professor Tokuo Sano,
Department of Aquatic Biosciences, Tokyo University of Fisheries. The
researchers plan to undertake a study of herpesvirus and its relation to tumor
cells in fish. Dr. Sano has isolated two fish herpesviruses and has demonstrated
that each produces a tumor when injected into fish: a basal cell carcinoma for
the YTV and a papilloma for CHV. He has not grown the tumors in vitro nor
characterized viral gene expression in such cultured cells. Professor Jerkofsky
has prior experience with the growth of viral-induced tumors in vitro and with
characterization viral antigens present in such cells. The research will
investigate the two potentially oncogenic herpesviruses in a system that may
allow temperature to regulate virus production and viral gene expression. The
research results have the potential to offer new models of both herpesvirus
pathogenesis and oncogenicity which could lead to better biological
characterization of the viruses CHV and YTV. The Department of Aquatic
Biosciences at Tokyo's University of Fisheries has many ongoing fish tumor
studies underway in its laboratories. Professor Sano is a first-rate Japanese
fish pathology scientist. His experience, coupled with Professor Jerkofsky's
expertise in the area of human herpes virology should provide a fruitful
collaboration. It is expected that this collaboration will continue even after
the formal agreement has terminated.
