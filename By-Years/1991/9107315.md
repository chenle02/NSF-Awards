Methane oxidation affects carbon and energy cycling in wetlands by consuming
the major reduced end product of anaerobic metabolism. In so doing, methane
oxidation couples oxic and anoxic processes within the ecosystem. To the extent
that this coupling is inefficient or "leaky", methane can escape into the
atmosphere. The magnitude of this flux serves to link specific ecosystems, e.g.,
wetlands, with global-scale processes since methane plays a key role in
atmospheric chemistry and the planetary heat budget. However, in spite of the
importance of methane oxidation and the significance of wetlands as methane
sources, relatively little is known about spatial and temporal variability or
controls of the process. Initial studies in several diverse wetlands have
identified light regimes, benthic photosynthesis, water table dynamics and
plant-bacterial associations as some of the most important factors controlling
the rates and extent of methane oxidation. A more complete analysis of these and
other parameters will provide information necessary for predicting the
importance and magnitude of methane fluxes from various wetlands as well as
provide the necessary insights for predicting the response of methane oxidation
and emission to changing climatic regimes.
