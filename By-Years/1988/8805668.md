This project has 4 specific objectives. 1. To complete a study on the
stereochemistry of the 6-B- OH-intermediate of chlorophyll. 2. To study the
enzymatic formation of protochlorophyllide by a mixed function oxygenase using
18O2 incubators. 3. To conduct metabolic studies with 6-B-ketopropionate methyl
ester, 7-propionic acid to assay for protochlorophyllide formation catalyzed by
soluble chloroplast proteins and fragments of chloroplast membranes. 4. To
determine the number of enzymes required for the cyclization using monoesters.
The developing chloroplasts will be fractionated to study these metabolic
transformations with organelle-free (and possibly soluble) extracts.%%% This
research investigates the biosynthesis of a universal feature of all plant and
bacterial chlorophylls; the formation of one of the rings. Chlorophylls are the
essential catalysts in photosynthesis.***//
