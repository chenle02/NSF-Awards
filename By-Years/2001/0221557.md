The objective of this effort is to provide a rigorous understanding of
atmospheric-pressure glow discharges (APGD). This new class of plasmas can
produce large amounts of active chemical species near room temperature and
atmospheric pressure and has potential to revolutionize plasma-based processing
technologies. The research activities have the following components: (1) a
computationally fast, one-dimensional physical model for prediction of APGD
axial structure; (2) a two-dimensional model for investigating bulk flow/plasma
dynamics interactions; (3) analysis of the electron energy distribution function
using a homogeneous, time-dependent electron Boltzman solver; (4) a bench-scale
APGD experiment to assist in model validation and to explore the discharge
phenomena, including visual characterization of discharge modes to establish
stability boundaries as a function of discharge geometry and operating
parameters, and electrical characterization of the discharge; and (5)
investigation of a novel APGD-based silicon oxidation process with potential
application in ultrathin integrated circuit gate-oxide formation.
