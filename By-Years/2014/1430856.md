This project funds travel support for students to attend the 14th IEEE/ACM
International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Grid Computing (CCGrid 2014) to be
held in Chicago, May 26-29, 2014. Conference experience is critical for training
undergraduate and graduate students to be well-prepared computing force in the
future. CCGrid is a premium forum for the latest research findings on the design
and development of parallel computing, Cloud computing, and high performance
computing systems. Participation in such a premium conference will provide an
excellent opportunity for students to interact with peers and world-renown
researchers at an international stage. Awardees will be selected via a rigorous
application and review process that considers both expected benefits and
interests of prospective participants. This project will have an impact in
stimulating students' enthusiasms about parallel computing, Cloud computing,
scientific computing, and high performance computing and training future
computing workforce for the nation.
