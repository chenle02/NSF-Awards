Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program funding is provided to this project to
support the development of instrumental methods for high pressure studies of the
dynamics of gas phase ion reactions. The kinetics and dynamics of reactions
between ions and molecules at high pressures are important to a variety of
processes occurring in the atmosphere, in combustion processes, and a range of
analytical methodologies. The work of this research project will supply much
needed information about the dynamics of ion reactions in the relatively
unexplored high pressure regime. Both basic gas phase ion chemistry and
analytical instrumentation development will be impacted by the work of this
project. Ion-molecule reactions occurring at high pressures are the subject of
this research project. There are very few methods available which can address
questions of reactivity and kinetics in this pressure regime, and the work of
this project will develop tools adequate to this task. The basic science
understanding obtained from this work will strongly impact atmospheric and
combustion chemistry processes.
