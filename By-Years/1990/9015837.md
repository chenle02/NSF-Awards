The translation or conversion of shape into quantitative terms so that
different shapes can be compared and interpreted is a profound problem in
Systematic Biology. The research will provide information on the application of
the fitting techniques that will be of use to researchers in many areas of
biology and on the nature of shape variation of importance to those interested
in ecological and evolutionary questions concerning turtles. The proposed
research has two main goals. The first is to compare existing and newly
developed rotational fitting methods using a set of three- dimensional landmark
locations from biological material. The data will consist of the coordinate
locations of biologically and geometrically defined landmarks on the carapace of
the yellow- bellied turtle. Trachemys scripta scripta. The second goal is to use
this data to investigate shape differences resulting from sexual dimorphism,
habitat-related growth differences, and geographic variation within this
subspecies.
