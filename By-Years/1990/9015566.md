With this grant in the Theoretical and Computational Program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor Cioslowski will develop new methods for the qualitative
understanding and description of the results of modern electronic structure
calculations. He will construct, test and implement a set of standard tools for
interpretation of the molecular wave functions which will lead to a deeper
understanding of chemical bonding. The research will implement a new method of
orbital localization based on the orbital density analysis of Bader extended to
correlated wave functions. These orbitals will be used to discuss the bonding in
molecular complexes and to develop compact representations of excited state wave
functions. Professor Cioslowski will also develop a new index for addressing the
question of molecular similarity and in addition will develop a method for using
pseudo-Wannier orbitals in the calculation of the excited electronic states of
polymers.
