9708991 Judd Is a typical American "undereducated"? This issue has been analyzed
before, but in a fashion that ignored the risky aspects of educational
investments. The return to education is uncertain, but the proper response to
this uncertainty depends on the nature of the uncertainty. This project applies
standard investment ideas from financial economics to human capital and
educational problems. It then integrates the human capital and financial
investment decisions, and analyzes the current tax system and proposed reforms.
The current system is, due to tax-favored savings provisions, partially a
consumption and partially an income tax system. Also, the current system allows
for some expensing of educational expenses through the deduction of state and
local taxes for taxpayers who itemize. True consumption tax reform would allow
expensing of all forms of savings, whether it be in the form of financial
instruments or human capital investments. Many so-called consumption tax reforms
would not allow expensing out-of-pocket education costs, and thereby favor
physical capital investments. This project explores the importance of these
facts in life-cycle models of education and savings. To accomplish these
objectives, this project also develops new computational methods of solving such
economic problems. These new methods will also prove useful in many other
economic problems.
