The goal of this project is to establish a new design and control method for
highly maneuverable underwater robots to perform inspection of underwater
structures. Compact, egg-shaped robots will allow us to bring inspection
instruments to those complex underwater structures that have seldom been
inspected. Those include reactor internals of nuclear power plants and the
equipment of hydro-dams, both of which require access to dangerous sites for
inspection and monitoring. Furthermore, the highly maneuverable robot can be
applied to port security, offshore facility monitoring, and cable network
maintenance. Collaborations with energy industries and others will be sought for
disseminating the new design method.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will study
egg-shaped robots, having no rudders and appendages. The compact and smooth body
shape allows the robot to access complex underwater structures with multi-axis
jets. The spheroidal vehicle, however, is hydro-dynamically unstable and thereby
not appropriate from the traditional submarine design viewpoint. This project
will argue that the vehicle instability can be exploited for quick turning and
agile movements, a design concept similar to Control-Configured Vehicles in
aeronautics, and how such vehicles can be designed optimally from the dynamics
and control viewpoint. The project aims to stabilize the vehicle, yet maximize
the maneuvering capability, through the design of high-speed water valves,
effective configuration of multi-axis jets, optimization of the vehicle body
shape, and control synthesis.
