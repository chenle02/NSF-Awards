The area of lightwave technology as well as materials generally and the
investigation of new fundamental phenomena have been significantly impacted by
the ability to fabricate artificial structures. Central to this ability is the
equipment which makes this possible. Such equipment includes molecular beam
epitaxy. The Optical Sciences Center has been a leading institution in the
investigation of devices made from such materials and their potential
applications to lightwave technology. The present request is for such a
molecular beam epitaxy machine to allow them to obtain the materials needed for
these investigations.
