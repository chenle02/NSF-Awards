This project will investigate the feasibility of integrating two different, but
related approaches to validation of concurrent software systems. Specifically,
the integration of the analysis techniques that are associated with a particular
concurrent system modeling scheme, called constrained expressions, and certain
static analysis techniques for studying synchronization properties of concurrent
systems will be studied. The complementary nature of the strengths and
weaknesses of these two approaches suggests that their integration will produce
techniques that surpass existing analysis techniques in both power and practical
utility. While the theoretical limitation of general approaches to validation of
concurrent software systems are known to be quite severe, little is known about
how limiting these considerations actually are in practice. Experience with
existing concurrent system analysis techniques is limited to "toy" systems, due
to the computational complexity of the techniques and a lack of automated
support. The demand for reliable concurrent software requires experimenting more
fully with these techniques to determine how they "scale-up" to useful,
realistically- sized systems.
