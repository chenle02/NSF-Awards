Automated program analyses developed over the last three decades have
demonstrated the ability to prove non-trivial properties of real-world programs.
This ability, in turn, has applications to emerging software challenges in
security, software-defined networking, cyber-physical systems, and beyond. The
diversity of such applications necessitates adapting the underlying program
analyses to client needs, in aspects of scalability, applicability, and
accuracy. Today's program analyses, however, do not provide useful tuning knobs.
The goal of this research is a general computer-assisted approach to effectively
adapt program analyses to diverse clients. It bridges the gap between decades of
program analysis research on one hand and diverse artifacts built atop them to
address emerging software challenges on the other. In doing so, it broadens and
enhances the benefits of program analysis to its users, as well as users of
software whose quality is impacted by program analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
research has three key ingredients. First, it poses optimization problems that
expose a large set of choices to adapt various aspects of a program analysis,
such as its cost, the accuracy of its result, and the assumptions it makes about
missing information. Second, it solves those optimization problems by new search
algorithms that efficiently navigate large search spaces, reason in the presence
of noise, interact with users, and learn across programs. Third, it builds a
program analysis platform that facilitates users to specify and compose
analyses, enables search algorithms to reason about analyses, and allows using
large-scale computing resources to parallelize analyses. The approach is
demonstrated in the context of analyzing mobile apps -- programs that run on
advanced mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. Mobile apps represent
an increasing use of non-expert programmers and they are likely to be used
across a wide range of users in heterogeneous and demanding conditions that can
benefit from what-if analyses that program analysis can offer.
