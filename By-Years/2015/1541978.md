1541978&lt;br/&gt;Little&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The third IWA Symposium on Lake
and Reservoir Management will be held in 2015. The symposium will focus on all
aspects of lake and reservoir management, including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Water
may prove to be the most critical natural resource impacting human and ecosystem
health. There is mounting evidence that the condition of water supplies in many
regions of the world, including the United States, is worsening. With rapid
economic growth taking place, there are challenging problems occurring in many
water supply reservoirs. This support will be used to develop a balanced array
of presentations from US scientists and engineers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
symposium will address: 1) instrumentation and techniques for water quality
monitoring; 2) in-situ control strategies to remove nutrients and contaminants,
and to diminish the release of greenhouse gases; 3) best practices for the
management of cyanobacteria and algae; 4) in-reservoir water quality management
strategies; 5) evaluating reservoirs as barriers to or as sources of pathogens;
6) understanding the impacts of climate change; 7) employing hydrodynamic and
water quality models to facilitate understanding and optimize operations; and,
8) actively integrating reservoir management and water treatment. While keynote
speakers will be from around the world, this proposed project will fund US
participants to the conference.
