EarthScope is a major earth science research initiative that will integrate
scientific information derived from seismology (USArray), geodesy (Plate
Boundary Observatory), and subsurface sampling and measurement initially for the
San Andreas Fault ...(SAFOD). Integral to the interpretation of EarthScope
investigations is the four dimensional thermal state of the lithosphere and a
better understanding of thermal processes influencing continental dynamics. This
workshop will identify important thermal processes within the context of
EarthScope and strategies for attacking those problems, highlight new avenues of
research, and provide pathways for integrating and coordinating thermal studies
with EarthScope. The workshop will consider 1) important crustal and
lithospheric scale thermal and heat flow problems that need to be tackled within
the EarthScope initiative; 2) thermal data and instrumental needs to address
successfully these problems; 3) the state of the U.S. heat flow data set and
strategies for improving the data base; 4) integrating thermal data with
EarthScope data products and how best to coordinate activities with EarthScope.
The results of the workshop will be captured in a final workshop report that can
be used by a broader community and across disciplines to plan and designing
exciting science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The organizing committee consists of R.
N. Harris (Univ of Utah), D. S. Chapman (Univ of Utah), C. F. Williams (U.S.
Geological Survey), K. P. Furlong (Penn. State Univ.), D. M. Saffer (Univ. of
Wyoming) and C. H. Jones (CU Boulder). Our workshop will be held in Salt Lake
City in March, 2004 and include approximately 45 attendees plus agency
representatives. &lt;br/&gt;
