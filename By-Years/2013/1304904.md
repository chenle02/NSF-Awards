The proposed project, which will build upon a successful NSF EAGER grant, will
help arctic researchers explain the significance of their research widely to the
general public?which, in today?s technologically connected world means not only
in the U.S., but worldwide- and to reflect the diversity of the scientific
enterprise Alaska. As proposed, the current Frontier Scientist?s schedule of
science reporting will be enhanced by a broadcast TV series titled Frontier
Scientists to engage a larger viewing audience. A ?Do It Yourself? (DIY)
component will help scientists to create their, professional-caliber media that
will sustain the publics? interest and feedback in their research. An evaluation
regime will insure appropriate quality and depth of communication, throughout
the lifecycle of each science story.
