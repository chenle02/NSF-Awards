This award supports a program to study sediment cores from the Hudson Strait,
which is widely believed to have been the drainage path for a major part of the
Laurentide Ice Sheet. The goals are to understand the dynamic processes
associated with the last stages of collapse of this marine based ice sheet. The
project will use oxygen isotopes, carbon-14 ages, benthic foraminifera, and
sediment provenance studies to develop a history of the changing
paleoenvironmental conditions during the time that the Laurentide Ice Sheet was
deteriorating.
