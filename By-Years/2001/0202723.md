This award supports purchase of a state-of-the-art scanning laser confocal
microscopy system that includes an upright microscope with motorized stage and
multiple lasers. The instrument is equipped for use of methods requiring oil or
water immersion, and has fast scanning capabilities suitable for study of motile
cells undergoing rapid physiological changes. Research projects that will employ
the microscope include studies of sperm-egg interactions and the physiological
and biochemical events surrounding fertilization in marine and freshwater
organisms. Other projects include studies of metabolic depression in cells
connected with intracellular translocation of a molecular chaperone after
environmental challenges, and studies of photobleaching of corals in the tropics
and its relationship to DNA damage caused by ultraviolet light. In addition to
its role in research, the instrument will be used by undergraduate and graduate
students in formal courses and related training activities. The instrument will
be located in the Fluorescence Imaging Facility at the Bodega Marine Laboratory
along with other instruments used for complementary methods. The instrument will
be available for use by investigators and students from the University's main
campus as well as those at the Laboratory.
