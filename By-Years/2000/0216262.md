With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at Southwest Texas State University will add CCD
capability to their P4 diffractometer, which will allow small molecule
diffractometry. This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas
including the following: a) site-directed mutagenesis; b) combinatorial
synthesis of catalysts and sensors based on bis-bridged calix[6]arenes; and c)
polyhedral borane anion investigations.

The X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full
three dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles,
and it provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of the
molecule relative to the neighboring molecules. These studies will have an
impact in a number of areas, including the preparation of more efficient
catalysts, chemical sensors, and biochemistry.
