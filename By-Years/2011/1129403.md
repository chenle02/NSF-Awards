This engineering education research project seeks to understand how experts
model engineered products and system in computer aided design (CAD). By drawing
from expertise from industry that both design and uses CAD tools, the project
will investigate how to teach students CAD skills that can readily transfer
between CAD platforms, thus helping create a more effective engineering
workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this
project stems from the fact that computer aided design is a fundamental skill in
many engineering disciplines, where students are expected to become CAD experts.
The project also engages students from a predominately minority institution in
order to make sure the findings can be broadly applied across a wide spectrum of
engineering programs. This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of
transforming the frontiers through preparation of an engineering workforce with
new capabilities and expertise. Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for
society is enabled by supporting the development of innovative learning systems.
