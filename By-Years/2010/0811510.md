TITLE: &lt;br/&gt;CPA-G&amp;V: Interactive Stream Views: Visual Analysis of
Streaming Data &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PIS: &lt;br/&gt;Drs. Matthew Ward and Elke
Rundensteiner, WPI CS Department &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Visualization is a
critical component for data analysis and decision-making in a wide range of
application areas, both for its ability to provide rich overviews and to permit
users to rapidly uncover patterns and outliers. While significant research in
information visualization has focused on supporting the process of scanning
static data sets in search of patterns, applying visualization to the analysis
of continuously streaming data remains a largely untapped opportunity. However,
domains of significant societal impact, such as scientific discovery, homeland
security, and health care, routinely have to process digital data streams of
ever increasing scale and complexity in real-time, making the advancement of
information visualization to effectively support such visual stream analysis of
paramount importance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To address this problem, the
investigators are developing a computational infrastructure, called Interactive
Stream Views (ISV), to visualize, manage, analyze, and interactively explore
real-time data streams. This research breaks new ground in the visualization of
and interactions on high-volume streaming data taking screen, computation, and
perceptual resource constraints into account for load control and
multiresolution abstraction. In ISV, analysts express their interests as
queries, either by selecting features in data views or by the explicit
invocation of feature-extraction processes. Customized displays supported by
powerful interactions present the results of these queries, highlighting their
attributes and abstractions, while also linking them to their corresponding
data. ISV enables specialists from diverse domains, such as vital sign
monitoring and tactical movement tracking, to visually monitor and explore their
data, increasing their effectiveness in making real-time decisions in areas of
critical need and high impact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
