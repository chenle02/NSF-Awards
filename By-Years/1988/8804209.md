This proposal requests funds to obtain a DNA synthesizer, an HPLC and ancillary
equipment. The instrumentation will provide oligonucleotides which will be used
in a variety of projects for the sequencing of DNA, mapping of transcripts by
primer extension, site directed mutagenesis and specific probes for the analysis
of genomic DNA. The projects proposed include studies of the regulation of gene
expression in lambda and yeast, the regulation of gene expression during
development in plant and mammalian systems, self-splicing of RNA from T4 phage
and DNA repair processes in E. coli.
