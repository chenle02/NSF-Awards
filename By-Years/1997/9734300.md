This research focuses on developing an integrated multimedia information
retrieval and database management infrastructure that provides support for
multimedia information as first-class objects capable of being stored and
retrieved based on their rich internal content. Specifically, techniques are
being explored to (1) extract and represent multimedia content at multiple
semantic levels useful for retrieval; (2) generalize text-based information
retrieval approaches for content-based multimedia retrieval; (3) map high-level
queries to lower-level representations supported by the database; (4) perform
feature indexing that overcomes the high-dimensionality and non-euclidean nature
of multimedia feature spaces; (5) integrate feature indexing mechanisms as
access paths in database management systems; and (6) support ranked retrieval in
database management systems. Based on the research, a prototype system, entitled
Multimedia Analysis and Retrieval System (MARS), that seamlessly integrates
multimedia data with structured information traditionally stored in databases is
being designed. On the educational front, the existing database curriculum is
being modified to incorporate evolving research and development in multimedia
information systems. Also, the MARS prototype system is being made available as
a teaching, education, and research tool to study human factors issues in
supporting content-based retrieval. This research not only has the potential to
impact the design of future multimedia information systems but will also prove
beneficial to other areas including geographical information retrieval, planning
and reasoning applications over database systems. http://www-mars.cs.uiuc.edu
