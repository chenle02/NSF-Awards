A Nd:YAG-dye laser system offers the chemist a source of powerful, continuously
tunable, highly monochromatic light over a range that is not available with any
other source. This instrumentation allows chemists to perform state-of-the-art
research in molecular spectroscopy using both the infrared and ultraviolet
regions of the spectrum. The Department of Chemistry at the University of
Virginia will use this award from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program
to help acquire a pulsed YAG laser with frequency multipliers, a dye laser
attachment, and wavelength extenders. The instrumentation will enhance chemical
research in the following areas: 1) Photochemistry and photophysics of metal
complexes 2) Lanthanide optical spectroscopy 3) Magnetic circular dichroism and
new matrix isolation source.
