Abstract ATM-9416858 Eisner, Wendy R. Ohio State University Title: Applied
Paleoecology: Vegetation History, soil carbon accumulation and climatic
interactions of the Peatlands on the North Slope, Alaska This award supports
research under the ARCSS/PALE Program . A wide range of paleoecological
indicators from selected North Slope peatlands will be analyzed in order to
reconstruct vegetation history and the relationship of tundra vegetation to
carbon accumulation rates. Cores and surface samples will be taken from sites
currently under investigation within the ARCSS Program initiatives. Surface
samples will be used to calibrate biotic indicators with vegetation type, soil
temperature, thaw depth, and moisture. Pollen, spores, fungi, algae, and
macrofossils will be analyzed as proxy data for the past ecosystem. Vegetation
reconstruction will be compared to changing carbon accumulation rates in the
cores, offering ecologists and soil scientists a very long-term monitoring
device of landscape dynamics in this complex environment. The arctic tundra
plays a significant role as a major repository of the world's carbon. Northern
peat may still be accumulating soil carbon or may actually be losing it. This
question has important consequences for global change scenarios.
