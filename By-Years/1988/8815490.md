A computer system will be purchased and used in support of research in (1)
intermediate energy nuclear physics using primarily the TRIUMF cyclotron, and
(2) on-line nuclear orientation using the UNISOR facility at Oak Ridge National
Laboratory. The computer will be used by the PI's, post docs, and students to
analyze data taken at these facilities and to do Monte Carlo calculations for
the planning and evaluation of experiments.
