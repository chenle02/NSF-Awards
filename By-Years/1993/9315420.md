9315420 Maclay This project is to develop and implement four new
interdisciplinary courses in Microstructure Systems and Mechanics at the
Junior/Senior/First year Graduate level. The courses will be modular in
construction, and based on research advances made at the University of Illinois
Chicago Circle or presented in critical reviews in literature. The student
laboratories, which form a key part of the curriculum, would be based on a
"problem solving" approach. The coarse modules will be available in hard copy or
on CD/ROM. The curriculum will be developed with input from an Industrial
Advisory Board and a faculty advisory group. The evaluation of the curriculum
will be done by the procedure followed by the American Institute of Physics in
their new physics curriculum evaluation.
