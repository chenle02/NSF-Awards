The Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry
Division supports studies of professor Jovica D. Badjic of the Ohio State
University on elucidating mechanisms and operation of gated molecular baskets in
organic and aqueous media. The first objective of the program is to disclose
rules that characterize the kinetics of stereoselective gated encapsulation and
investigate the importance of the process of gating for (a) completing a kinetic
resolution of stereoisomers and (b) controlling the outcome of chemical
reactions. The second objective of the program centers on exploring the kinetics
of gated encapsulation in aqueous media. In particular, the aim is to develop
water-soluble baskets and study/optimize their mechanism of action. The
hydrophobic effect, in synergy with directional non-covalent interactions, is
expected to permit the gating for modulating the encapsulation kinetics and
delivery of useful drugs in water. Finally, the benefit of molecular
encapsulation and gating for promoting organocatalytic transformations in water
is to be investigated for developing aqueous supramolecular catalysts.

A fundamental understanding of the translocation of molecules and its control in
complex chemical systems will help developing more effective catalysts for the
conversion of feedstock chemicals into valuable products in future. In addition,
exploring new ways for a delivery of potent drugs at a precise rate will benefit
society by transforming current pharmaceutical technologies. The proposed
program is designed to educate graduate and postdoctoral students to identify
research opportunities beyond the field of supramolecular chemistry. In
addition, the proposed work aims to enhance cultural and gender diversity at all
levels and increase the number of underrepresented minorities and women
researchers at the Ohio State University.
