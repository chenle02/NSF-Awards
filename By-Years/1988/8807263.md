The Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships are awards to
recent recipients of doctoral degrees. The fellowship is designed to provide 24
months of support divided into 18 academic months and 3 periods of two summer
months. The recipient has the option of a Research Instructorship which allows
the 18 months of academic support to be taken as 9 months of full-time support
and 18 months of half-time support. Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research
Fellowship awards allow fellows to choose research environments that will have
maximal impact on their future scientific development. Dr. George S. Easton
received his doctoral degree from Princeton University, and will pursue research
in the area of statistics, specifically, Compromise Maximum Likelihood
Estimation in Regression and Time Series, Saddlepoint Swindles, and Multivariate
QQ-Plots, under the guidance of Dr. George C. Tiao at the University of Chicago,
Graduate School of Business.
