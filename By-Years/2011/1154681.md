This project will create a network of people and programs that are creating
course-based undergraduate research experiences (CURE) in biology as a means of
helping students understand core concepts in biology, develop core scientific
competencies, and become active, contributing members of the scientific
community. The network will create a catalogue of CURE projects and resources.
The network will also provide opportunities for participants to discuss issues
such as how to document student outcomes such as learning, changes in attitudes
toward and interest in science, and changes in engagement in the scientific
community, as well as mechanisms for broadening participation in course-based
research activities and ethical issues such as who has access to and ownership
of CURE-generated data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The project
will assemble individuals with diverse expertise (instructors, researchers,
information technology specialists, faculty development / curriculum
specialists, education researchers) who represent diverse institutions and
varied CURE projects in terms of data type (genomic, phenotypic, ecological).
These individuals will address the questions noted above through meetings of the
entire group and subnetwork teams as well as through the use of social
networking tools. Mechanisms will be built into the network activities to seek
input from undergraduates and scientific societies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts: The project will produce a clearinghouse website, which will be a
single "go-to" location for finding and publicizing CURE information. It will
also spawn new collaborations aimed at improving CUREs and expanding their
implementation, and will help publicize existing CURE resources so that other
faculty across the country can understand the potential of designing such
approaches in their own laboratory courses but can avoid some of the pitfalls in
doing so.
