A combined experimental and theoretical investigation is conducted to study the
phenomenon of mist cooling of a heated surface. In the experimental
investigation, extensive use will be made of the recently developed two-phase
suspension flow laser-Doppler particle-sizing anemometry techniques at Stony
Brook to measure the dynamics of the two coupled phases in the mist which leads
to droplet deposition. In the theoretical investigation, new aproaches will be
developed towards an understanding of the droplet deposition phenomenon based on
a new theory of the dynamic response characteristics of a particle in a
turbulent flow.
