As part of the Fiscal Year 1985 appropriation of $82 million for NSF's Science
and Engineering Education activities, Public Law 98-371 provided that
"$2,000,000 shall be made available for a contract to develop a science
education plan and management structure for the Foundation." This study
represents a major part of NSF's response to the Congressional mandate. The
purpose of the study is to assess the advantages and disadvantages of
alternative initiatives to NSF to address problems and opportunities in science
education (broadly defined to include science, mathematics, and engineering),
with particular attention to high-leverage, realistic programs. The study will
focus on initiatives the Foundation has put in place to meet its objectives. In
addition, the study will identify new initiatives, not yet in place or funded,
and possible management plans which also might prove useful in meeting NSF's
objectives. The main study tasks are: oTo review the prior experience of NSF and
others in funding and evaluating science education programs; oTo assist in
operationally defining program objectives so that the outcomes of NSF
initiatives can be realistically and clearly measured; oTo assess the advantages
and disadvantages of alternative initiatives available to NSF to meet its
objectives; and oTo design plans for the Foundation to evaluate, on an ongoing
basis, the quality and impact of its work. The result of the study will be an
increased NSF capability to define science education program objectives, assess
the initiatives taken to meet these objectives and, informed by ongoing
assessment, institute necessary changes in these initiatives.
