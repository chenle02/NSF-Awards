The investigator will continue his work in the general area of Markov processes.
Recently, the investigator with a collaborator developed a set of invertible
transformations of a Markov process which preserved the collection of excessive
functions of the process. This collection is a symmetry group which can be used
to construct Markov functions, which when composed with Markov processes result
in a new Markov process (if the speed is corrected). The investigator will
continue to study the probabilistic structure of the Markov process which is
coded in the algebraic structure of the group. This study will yield a new
algebraic technique for analyzing the structure of Markov processes. The
investigator will continue his work in the general area of Markov processes. A
Markov process is a probabilistic model which is characterized by the statement
that in order to characterize the future of the process, it is enough to know
the current state (and not the past) of the process. This model has been used
successfully in fields as diverse as economics to chemistry and physics. The
investigator will be studying the structure of such processes by using a
different branch of mathematics, i.e. algebra.
