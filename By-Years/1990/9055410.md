This three-year demonstration project is designed to educate 75 New York City
elementary school teachers from approximately 15 schools to develop materials
from the urban environment as the vehicle for science teaching in their 4th, 5th
and 6th grade classrooms. Objectives that are unique to the project are: (1) to
identify issues from the urban environment which lend themselves to elementary
classroom learning; (2) to provide opportunities for teachers to use artifacts
and issues from the children's immediate urban environment as the raw material
for elementary science investigation; and (3) to demonstrate how the NY State
Elementary Science requirements can be motivated using issues which are both
familiar and important to children. Participating schools will remain part of
the project for all three years, and active involvement of administrators will
be engaged to guarantee school-wide dissemination. This project is appropriate
for the Teacher Enhancement Program because it targets a needy urban student
population and because it plans to develop a cadre of master teachers who will
mentor their colleagues and work with school administrators to plan school-wide
dissemination of the project. Non-NSF cost-sharing is approximately 78% of the
amount requested from NSF.
