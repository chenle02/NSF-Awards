This project will illustrate fundamental concepts in introductory chemistry
through innovative lecture demonstrations that involve the use of low-cost and
readily accessible laser light sources. Incorporation of these innovations in
the General Chemistry course will enhance students' awareness of the creative
contemporary approaches available to pursue classical questions in chemistry.
The lecture demonstrations will augment teaching of such topics as
thermodynamics, kinetics, acid-base equilibria, chemical bonding, and atomic
spectroscopy. These laser-based activities are designed to enrich the students'
understanding of the course material and stimulate their interest in chemistry.
Students will gain a more accurate reflection of the dynamic nature of chemistry
and the responsiveness of the field to advances in technology as well as an
illustration of the way in which chemistry is currently practiced. Curricular
materials developed from this project will be made available to the
undergraduate community from other institutions and will be presented at
national and local conferences in chemistry and education.
