As nano-scale field-effect devices quickly approach their physical limits in
feature size, their stochastic device characteristics will pose severe
challenges to constructing robust digital circuitry. Unlike transistor defects
due to fabrication imperfection, quantum-related switching uncertainties will
seriously increase their susceptibility to noise, thus rendering the traditional
thinking and logic design techniques inadequate. This work aims at developing a
new logic design paradigm that achieves circuit robustness for stochastically
imperfect transistors and interconnects. To this end, the PI reformulates the
traditional boolean-based digital design problem as a probabilistic logic-
labeling problem and attempts to solve it with two approaches: a graph-theoretic
approach, and a field-theoretic approach. The project also studies two
unconventional logic design methodologies: a bio-inspired logic scaffolding and
a self-correcting logic design. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will disseminate
findings by developing new curricula and creating compelling interactive
learning materials e.g., hardware-based emulations, software simulations, and
interdisciplinary study opportunities to expose students to the new area of
stochastic logic design. The PI will also create mentoring and outreach programs
specifically targeted to attract underrepresented groups, thus preparing a new
diverse workforce for future IC industry.
