This project, funded under the Joint NSF/Private Sector Research Opportunities
Initiative, will use techniques from decision analysis to develop methods for
improving toxic substances risk assessment, risk management, and research
planning decisions. It will explicitly represent uncertainties in exposure and
dose-response, and use the concept of the value of information to evaluate
research initiatives whose outcomes could permit departures from default
guidelines for carcinogenic risk assessments. These include use of the most
sensitive strain and species, linearized low-dose extrapolation, etc. A set of
case studies will develop decision models focusing on representative regulatory
and research alternatives for specific toxic substances. Informal panels of
experts will be used for probability assessments, and the research will be
reviewed with interested parties in government, industry, and other groups. Case
studies will be summarized in terms of specific insights and generalized
principles that may be widely applicable.
