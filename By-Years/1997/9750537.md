The initiation of changes in undergraduate education from a teacher-centered
paradigm to a learner-centered one requires increased hands-on, exploratory,
experiential activities. This is especially true for spatial and cartographic
learning. This project is supporting such activities in undergraduate geography
education through the use of remote-sensing and analytical cartographic
techniques. The ENVISAGE project is accomplishing these goals by allowing
students to experience and explore geographic processes in a semi-immersive, 3-D
stereo visualization environment. The Department of Geography has seen a large
increase in the number of undergraduate majors (from 30 to 140) during the past
several years. A recent initiative on geographic information systems (GIS) and
geo-spatial technologies includes a new GIS instructional laboratory. The
ENVISAGE project is expanding on this initiative and allowing students to
explore innovative approaches to environmental visualization and analysis in a
classroom setting. The ImmersaDesk systems allow interaction with 3-D stereo
images by an instructor and small groups of students, bringing technology that
has been effective in scientific research and industrial development into a
learning environment. ENVISAGE is contributing significant content to several
core courses and providing a bridge from current GIS practice to understanding
through immersion. It is demonstrating the value of advanced technology for
education through measurable changes in student learning, enrollment, and
evaluations. *
