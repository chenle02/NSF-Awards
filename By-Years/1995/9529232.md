AST-9529232 Dr. Fesen will use this award to develop a new observational
technique for identifying young supernova remnants in nearby galaxies. If
successful, the observations could revolutionize the study of supernova remnants
at early phases, which currently are largely undetectable in more traditional
emission-line imaging or radio continuum surveys.
