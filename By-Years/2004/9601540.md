SBR-9601540 LEAVITT The purpose of this project is to complete and prepare for
publication a bilingual dictionary of Passamaquoddy-Maliseet and English,
including complete verb and noun paradigms, a brief grammatical sketch of the
language in lay terms, a pronunciation guide, and audio clips. No other
comprehensive dictionary of the language exists or is in production. The
Passamaquoddy-Maliseet language has about 2,000 speakers in Maine and adjacent
New Brunswick, and elsewhere, but only about 400-500 fluent speakers.
Practically all fluent speakers are 50 years of age or older. Numerous younger
people, however, are learning the language or wish to perfect their speaking
skills. Many educational programs and groups of people in the region are natural
centers around which this project will organize activities to develop the
dictionary.
