Even though all aerobic organisms require molecular oxygen for survival, the
release of activated oxygen species resulting both from normal metabolism and
environmental pollution can cause serious damage to the cell. Enzymes such as
the catalases, protect plants from damage and the resulting reduction metabolic
efficiency. Since metabolic efficiency, particularly in leaves, is a primary
determinant of plant productivity, these enzymes are of significant agrononic as
well as scientific importance. The ultimate objective of this research is to
understand the roles of the various catalases in both normal and stress-related
metabolism. CAT3 is the most abundantly transcribed catalase gene in maize
leaves, and the unusual timing of its expression implies an important, specific
metabolic function early at night. The goal of this project is to clarify the
metabolic role of this catalase, and identify DNA sequences responsible for its
novel light regulation. Ultimately this research will allow the manipulation of
agronomically important plants to increase their resistance to oxidative stress.
