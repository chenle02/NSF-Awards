The proposal examines four topics in Bayesian nonparametric statistics. They
center about a procedure described as A subscript n which assumes that there are
(n+1) observed values of (n+1) random quantities. The observable random
quantities are assumed to be exchangeable and ties among them are assumed to
have probability zero. Given n of the observations the probability that the
(n+1)st observation falls in one of the open intervals created by the ranked
given observations is assumed to be the inverse of the number of intervals.
(There are (n+1) intervals.) The first topic involves the development of a
version of this procedure for multivariate observations. The second topic
involves extending the use of the procedure to the evaluation of the posterior
expectation of future observations. The fourth topic involves extending results
for the procedure to the analysis of mixture data in the context of Bayesian
data analysis. The third topic is the development of a theory of randomization
from a Bayesian viewpoint.
