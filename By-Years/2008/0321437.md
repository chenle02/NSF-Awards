Rice is important both as a crop plant that feeds more than half of the world's
population and as a model for cereal crops of great economic importance in the
US. The recent availability of the genomic sequence facilitates functional
analysis and molecular studies of the rice genes. However, most of these genes
are as yet defined only by computational and not experimental approaches;
computational gene predictions may not identify all RNA transcripts within the
chromosomal sequence. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will use a
transcriptional profiling technology called "massively parallel signature
sequencing" (MPSS) to characterize the diversity and expression patterns of rice
transcripts. Defining the patterns and levels of gene expression in the rice
genome will advance our understanding of rice molecular biology and genetic
factors controlling important agronomical traits. This analysis of rice has
broad practical implications for the improvement of other economically important
cereals, such as corn, wheat, sorghum and barley, because nearly all genes
present in these species are likely to have homologs in rice. The MPSS data will
be used to identify genes missed by computational approaches and will provide
data that validate many genes previously predicted but never confirmed
experimentally. MPSS will be used to assess gene expression under the following
conditions: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-In diverse untreated rice tissues and a
subset of these tissues under cold, drought and salt
stress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-In fungal- or bacterial-infected rice tissues in
both susceptible and resistant plants. A series of timepoints will be assayed
during the infection or resistance response.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-In an
'Indica' rice background and in a hybrid of Indica x Japonica; this experiment
will measure differences in gene expression between the two rice varieties for
which genomic sequence is available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The novel transcripts
identified by the MPSS technology will be validate by microarray analysis and by
sequencing more than 500 novel transcripts. All of these data (MPSS, microarray,
and sequence validation of transcripts) will be made publicly available through
a project webpage. This web site will include query and analysis tools to
facilitate public use of the rice MPSS data and will display the abundance and
chromosomal locations of rice MPSS signatures. This website will be similar to
that which we have developed for the model dicot, Arabidopsis
(http://www.dbi.udel.edu/mpss).&lt;br/&gt;
