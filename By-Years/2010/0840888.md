This project seeks fund to organize a workshop on Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)
to explore developing and understanding commonalities and differences between
the cyber, physical, and social worlds. This two-day workshop will bring
together three traditionally disparate groups: engineers, computer scientists,
and social scientists. It will open up this new area in a significant way,
allowing people from greatly different disciplines to communicate with each
other and form cross-disciplinary bridges. It will add value to the existing
series of workshops in establishing a Cyber-Physical Systems community by
identifying the challenges in cross-disciplinary communication and publishing
the commonalities and differences so that new researchers can be brought into
the Cyber-Physical Systems community.
