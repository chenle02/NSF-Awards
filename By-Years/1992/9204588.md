Phosphatidate (PA) phosphatase (3-sn-phosphatidate phosphohydrolase, EC 3.1.3.4)
in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae catalyzes the dephosphorylation of PA to
form diacylglycerol and Pi. PA phsophatase plays a role in the regulation of
phospholipid and triacylglycerol synthesis in S. cerevisiae. Two membrane-
associated forms (45-kDa and 104-kDa) of PA phosphatase have been purified and
characterized in our laboratory. In this grant application we propose to
initiate a project to clone the structural genes for the 45-kDa and 104-kDa
forms of PA phosphatase. We will use specific antibodies to the enzymes and
lambda-ZAP cDNA expression and lambda-DASH genomic expression libraries. The
cloned genes will be characterized and the essential nature of PA phosphatase
will be addressed. %%% The enzyme phosphatidate (PA) phosphatase in the yeast
Saccharomyces cerevisiae catalyzes the removal of phosphate from the
phospholipid PA to form the neutral lipid diacylglycerol. This enzyme plays a
role in the control of overall lipid synthesis in yeast and in animal cells. Two
membrane-associated forms (45-kDa and 104-kDa) of PA phosphatase have been
purified and characterized in our laboratory. In this grant application we
propose to initiate a project to isolate the genes which encode for the 45-kDa
and 104-kDa forms of PA phosphatase. We will use specific antibodies to the
enzymes and DNA expression libraries in lambda viruses. Once isolated the genes
for these enzymes will be characterized. The essential nature and role of these
genes in yeast lipid synthesis and cell growth will be examined.
