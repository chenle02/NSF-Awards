This research deals with several aspects of the relationship between quantum
theory and gravitation, especially those which are relevant to understanding the
origin and evolution of the universe. This work is part of a line of enquiry
that seeks to better understand the effects of gravitation on quantum systems
and the quantum nature of gravity. The specific research topics include: (1) The
problem of the cosmological constant, a fundamental, unsolved problem in
cosmology. The problem will be studied in the context of possible dynamical
mechanism that force the value of the cosmological "constant" to decay. (2)
Quantum violations of classical energy conditions (e.g. generation of negative
energy densities) and their effects upon gravitation. This will study the extent
to which one can produce exotic gravitational fields with quantum matter and
avoid the singularities of classical general relativity. (3) The limits of
validity of the semiclassical approximation to quantum gravity. This is of
importance both for understanding the early history of the universe and for
guiding the development of a more complete quantum gravity theory. (4)
Alternative approaches to quantum field theory. This is a search for new ways of
studying quantum processes, especially in the presence of gravity.
