w:\awards\awards96\*.doc 9624091 Safinya The structure of artificially
developed self assembled membrane-associating-proteins and peptides in
multilayers will be characterized by synchrotron x-ray diffraction techniques.
The objective is to elucidate protein-protein interactions in these artificial
self assemblies and to develop a new class of advanced materials consisting of
functionalized interfaces manipulated at the molecular level. This should lead
to advanced materials useful in optical, separations, chemical sensors, and high
temperature catalysis applications. We will explore the structure and hydrogel
behavior in a newly invented class of lamellar hydrogels based on fluid
membranes and end-anchored polymer-lipids. "bioactive lamellar gels" useful in
tissue healing or drug delivery applications will be developed with activity
derived from biomolecules and mechanical stability from the polymer-lipid
component. %%% This project seeks to develop a new class of materials consisting
of multilayers of functionalized interfaces which can be manipulated at the
molecular level. The components of these materials will consist of surfactants
(surface active molecules), proteins, and peptides. The materials should be
useful in molecular separations and purification technologies, biological and
chemical sensors technologies, and high temperature catalysis applications. A
new class of recently invented hydrogels invented in this laboratory will be
explored further. The lamellar gels are made from liquid phases by the addition
of water, a highly unusual behavior. Because the gels contains no solid
component they have the potential of incorporating combinations of biologically
active molecules. We will explore the development of "bioactive lamellar gels"
useful in artificial tissue development, in tissue healing, and in drug delivery
applications. ***
