This project continues mathematical research on problems related to the theory
of functions of several complex variables. It will focus on the issue of
separate analyticity of meromorphic functions. Although Hartog's theorem
illustrates that separate analyticity implies joint analyticity for functions
defined in domains, one cannnot make such broad statements if the separate
analyticity is confined to smaller sets. The present work seeks to expand recent
results on restricted analyticity of meromorphic mappings of projective
algebraic manifolds to mappings into compact Kahler manifolds. A second line of
investigation concerns bounds for degrees in solving polynomial equations. If an
ideal is generated by polynomials of limited degree, a polynomial in the ideal
may be expressed as combinations of products of the generators (with other
polynomials). The minimal degree of the multipliers is not known, although sharp
results can be obtained if the locus of roots of the generators can be measured.
Work will continue in an effort to improve the bounds under less restrictive
hypotheses. //
