The Evergreen State College will establish a programming laboratory and prepare
teaching materials specifically designed for the teaching of computer science.
The laboratory facility will consist of thirty-two personal computers/terminals
connected to the College's central Data General computer, a video projection
terminal for group work, and a line printer for program listings and handouts.
Faculty have developed programming and problem solving workshops in computer
science, mathematics, and software engineering which will make effective use of
this terminal facility. In laboratory sessions analogous to those used in the
physical sciences and under the direction of faculty, students will perform
experiments designed to reveal the fundamental concepts of the discipline and to
instill in them the methodology necessary for the successful practitioner. The
laboratory will also be used for extensive student software development projects
as part of Evergreen's year-long project programs in computer science. With this
laboratory facility, students will learn problem solving methodology faster, and
with a higher retention rate, than is now the case. Students will also gain
valuable experience working in programming teams.
