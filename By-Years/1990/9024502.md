This research deals with NMR investigations of molecular motions and relaxation
processes in solids. Some of the work (broken symmetry phases of solid hydrogen)
involves high-pressure anvil NMR methods. Elucidation of mechanisms of anomalous
relaxaton of hydrogen in metal hydrides is also a goal of the work. Finally, a
continuing project deals with stochastic and deterministic aspects of the
freezing of cyanide ions in lattices where the molecules are free to rotate at
high temperatures but are rigid at low temperatures.
