An existing Monte Carlo electron transport code (WETRAN) will be extended into a
time dependent low energy three dimensional transport code. The code must also
be extended so it can transport electrons in semiconductor elements other than
silicon, and composite semiconductor materials. A revised routine to describe
secondary Auger production will be written. Extension to vector and multitasking
machines will be studied. The code will require extensive electron differential
and total cross section data bases. The data base will be used to predict the
energy dependent probabilities for various events which can occur during the
transport process. Elastic cross sections will be computed using the optical
model, preliminary inelastic core ionizations by the Coulomb-Born approximation,
and valence excitations using the dielectric function method which includes
electron-hole, and plasmon excitations.
