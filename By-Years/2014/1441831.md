The University of Wyoming will continue providing the King Air aircraft (UWKA),
Wyoming Cloud Radar (WCR) and Wyoming Cloud Lidar (WCL) as part of the national
Lower Atmosphere Observing Facility (LAOF) suite. The UWKA is a twin turbo-prop
aircraft highly instrumented for measurements throughout the atmosphere up to
altitudes of 10 km (33,000 ft). WCR and WCL are sophisticated remote-sensing
instruments that provide observations of the three-dimensional structure of
clouds and their evolution over time. This cooperative agreement provides base
support to a staff of scientists, engineers, technicians, pilots and mechanics
who operate, maintain and improve the aircraft, cloud radar and cloud lidar
facilities. During this performance period (2014-2018), the University of
Wyoming will deploy the King Air aircraft and WCR and WCL instruments in support
of research projects deemed to be of exceptional merit by the peer review
process. Staff will also upgrade the aircraft and available instrumentation to
facilitate cutting edge research in the areas of atmospheric dynamics,
atmospheric chemistry, and cloud physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual
Merit: The University of Wyoming King Air fulfills a unique role in the suite of
NSF-supported lower atmosphere observing facilities, serving as the only small,
light aircraft available to atmospheric researchers. UWKA carries a state-of-
the-art complement of instrumentation for measuring the physical and chemical
properties of the atmosphere, for understanding the formation and evolution of
clouds and their interaction with atmospheric aerosols, and for investigating
the dynamical mechanisms that cause and maintain severe weather, especially
winter storms and heavy precipitation. Planned development and acquisition of
new instrumentation will facilitate research by the atmospheric sciences
community as it tackles questions related to weather and
climate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: As an advanced-degree-granting
institution, the University of Wyoming and its UWKA facility provide unique
opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students to learn about and
obtain hands-on experience with nearly every aspect of observational atmospheric
science. These opportunities are open to students from UW and other academic
institutions, as well as to high school students taking a summer course on
aviation weather. Most deployments of the UWKA include educational programs for
or outreach to local communities, media, and schools, which exposes the general
public to this unique application of science, technology and engineering
expertise.
