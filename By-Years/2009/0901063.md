This project aims to study the dynamical properties of linear, nonlinear, and
discrete Schrödinger equations. One goal is to identify a minimal set of
conditions (on ambient forces, geometry of the underlying space, etc.) under
which solutions enjoy the same dispersive and smoothing properties as in the
free linear case. Such estimates are crucial to both the short-time existence of
solutions to nonlinear Schrödinger equations as well as their scattering and
long-time asymptotics. When the underlying domain is a discrete graph instead of
a continuous manifold, the level of possible dispersion should reflect the
manner in which individual vertices are interconnected. Techniques adapted from
harmonic and Fourier analysis, and from the spectral theory of differential
operators, will play a prominent role in all these
efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Schrödinger equations are a statement of the basic
laws of motion in quantum mechanics. This is the mathematical model of first
choice for describing diverse phenomena from chemical interactions to the
transmission of information along a fiber-optic cable. It is therefore
instructive to know how the model might behave across different time-scales and
different levels of spatial resolution. The project addresses these issues as an
abstract question in the study of differential equations. Because the equations
are intended to represent actual physical systems, discoveries at this level
should make it possible to apply quantum mechanical principles to a broader
range of scientific problems.&lt;br/&gt;
