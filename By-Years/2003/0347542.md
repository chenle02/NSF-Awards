0347542 CAREER: Type Systems for Secure Code Migration James Riely

Distributed systems increasingly rely on forms of code migration, such as
client-side scripting, downloaded plugins, application service providers, and
networked class loading. In executing migrating code, trust becomes an important
issue: why should a host trust some newly arrived code to run locally? And why
should a migrating agent trust the host where it is now running? One part of a
trust architecture can be the use of type-checking: a host trusts a newly
arrived agent if it can type-check it. This project uses semantic techniques to
provide a formal basis for trust issues in distributed object-oriented systems
with code migration. The formal models are a basis for a prototype language
implementation that provides a secure infrastructure for distributed application
development. The following issues are addressed: foundations of distributed
objects, security properties of code migration, and code migration to hostile
hosts. Work on object foundations brings together research on the semantics of
class-based and aspect-oriented languages and distributed process-calculi. Work
on security properties focuses on the problem of untrusted migrating agents:
when can a host trust a newly arrived agent? The problems are formalized using
type systems incorporating trust and models of encryption and digital signatures
in order to transmit trust across the network. Work on hostile hosts addresses
the other side of the coin: when can a mobile agent trust the host it is running
on? If the host has been compromised, then the results of running the agent
cannot be trusted. However, a notion of partial trust may be developed, again
using encryption and digital signatures.
