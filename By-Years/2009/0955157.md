The objective of this research is to design new cognitive power management
techniques for memory dominated mobile devices that exploit the variable nature
of the wireless channel. The approach is based on redefining the run-time
architectural error tolerance of memory blocks according to the time varying
tolerance of the application to hardware induced errors. This allows the margin
of acceptable performance to be dynamically managed by the needs of the
application utilizing the hardware unit at that instant in time.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the work lies in enabling
designers to abstract the concepts of power efficiency and error awareness for
memory dominated devices early in the design cycle, with significant
implications on the cost, performance and reliability attributes of the overall
structure. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The multidisciplinary nature of the project,
which spans theoretical, circuit, system and experimental work, creates an
exciting framework to engage students, educators and the community. The proposed
research and education plan places an emphasis on expanding the engagement of
the investigator in programs designed to attract undergraduates (particularly
female students) and minority students from underrepresented groups into
engineering. Finally, since power conscious mobile devices are rapidly becoming
ubiquitous in every aspect of modern day society spanning government, corporate
and private life, this work has particular significance in accelerating the
rapid deployment of inexpensive and energy-efficient devices.
