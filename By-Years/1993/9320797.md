Abstract The PI seeks to test his theory of "probabilistic mental models"
(PMMs). The model itself states that people use probabilistic cue relationships
in the natural environment to draw inferences about unknown cues. There are
three main areas to which this model will be applied: the hindsight bias,
overconfidence, and the Hume-Hartley Effect. The latter is manifested in an
increase in a statement's apparent validity as it is repeated. In addition, the
PI proposes to develop computer simulations to test some of the implications of
the model. ! ! ! F 1 1 ( Times New Roman Symbol &amp; Arial m m m " h % % D
