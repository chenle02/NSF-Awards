The objective of this research is to develop statistical tests for some
important properties of stationary spatial random fields. The properties to be
considered are those of direction- invariance (isotropy) and separability, and
variations thereof, of the second-order variation. In addition to having
important scientific meaning in many situations, these properties, when they
hold, can greatly simplify both the computations involved in, and conclusions
made from, the analysis of spatial data. Parametric testing approaches, which
are based on a parametric model for the semivariogram or covariance function,
and nonparametric approaches, which utilize method-of-moments estimators for
sempiparametric approach will also receive attention. Biological environmental,
and physical scientists who analyze spatial data will find the testing
procedures useful. The objective of this research is to develop statistical
tests for some important properties of stationary spatial random fields. The

will have potential impact on fields of biological, environmental and physical
sciences.
