This award will provide partial support to a group of physicists at the
Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, Berkeley CA, who are members of the Berkeley
Particle Date Center, Headquarters of the International Particle Data Group. The
primary task of the center is to provide researchers with compiled and evaluated
information on particle properties and related areas. This information is made
available to about twenty thousand researchers, teachers and students through
the biennial publication of the "Review of Particle Properties" and the
"Particle Properties Data Booklet." The Center also produces other compilations
of value to particle physicists: "Major Detectors in Elementary Particle
Physics"; "Current Experiments in Elementary Particle Physics" and "Guide to
Data in Elementary Particle Physics".
