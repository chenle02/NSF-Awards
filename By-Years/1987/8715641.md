The principal investigators are computational scientists that are developing
algorithms to solve computational chemistry problems on advanced parallel
architectures. They propose to use Monte Carlo methods, specifically the
varational and Green's function Monte Carlo techniques to study the properties
of clusters of He-3; jellium (a first stage model for clusters of alkali metals)
including its polarizability; and Xenon. They also expect to explore new
algorithms particularly suited to the use of the IBM RPX3 parallel architecture
for problems of this kind. The Deputy Director of the Division of Advanced
Scientific Computing is pleased to support the recommendation of the
CISE1/Computational Science & Engineering Panel and recommends a twenty-four
month award for this promising project.
