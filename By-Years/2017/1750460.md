Data is messy. Fortunately, with minimal human intervention, good data cleaning
heuristics produce mostly reliable, usually actionable information from big,
messy data. For instance, analysts might automate their curation workflows by
using classifiers to predict missing attribute values, or by using an entity-
resolver to find and merge duplicate records. Unfortunately, heuristics are also
dangerous, as the result of heuristic curation is often taken as fact. Serious
mistakes like people being denied a loan due to someone else's bad credit,
12-year olds being identified as terrorists, or billion dollar investment
errors, often result when low-confidence, or uncertain heuristic inferences are
treated as truth. Many principled tools like probabilistic databases already
exist for automatically tracking potential errors in unreliable data, but these
tools are not easy to use. As a result, analysts more often resort to simply
documenting potential errors and hoping that anyone using the data will realize
the implications. This proposal will enable data management systems that can
query and organize uncertain data, without being hard to use.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The specific aim of this proposal is to decouple the process of
asking questions about uncertain data from mechanical concerns like why the data
is uncertain, how the user wants to view uncertainty in query results, or which
algorithms should be used. To enable this sort of "declarative uncertainty
management," the project team will build on a system called Mimir that
virtualizes uncertainty by augmenting data curation workflows (e.g., ETL
pipelines) with a form of provenance capture through which heuristics can
register alternative outputs (e.g., a schema matcher may register multiple
potential matches). This provenance can then be used to synthesize a wide range
of different physical and visual representations of uncertainty in data and in
query results. To enable declarative uncertainty management, this proposal will
address specific problems that fall into two general categories: (1) selecting
and efficiently constructing qualitative summaries of uncertainty in query
results, and (2) enhancing database query compilers and optimizers to support
practical, efficient query processing over uncertain data. For further
