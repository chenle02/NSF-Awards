ABSTRACT OPP-9706494 SHEEHAN BARROW ARCTIC SCIENCE CONSORTIUM This proposal is
to establish a Cooperative Agreement between the Barrow Arctic Science
Consortium (BASC) and the NSF Office of Polar Programs. The Cooperative
Agreement concentrates on maintenance and facilitation of research on the Barrow
Environmental Observatory (BEO). BASC will be responsible for management of the
7,644 acre BEO, recapture of unpublished data associated with BEO and other
North Slope and northern research, and facilitation of scientific research and
access of Arctic scientists to BEO.
