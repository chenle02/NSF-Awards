Every day, we are confronted with an abundance of decisions that require us to
choose from a seemingly endless number of choice options. Recommender systems
are supposed to help us deal with this formidable task, but some scholars claim
that these systems instead put us inside a "Filter Bubble" that severely limits
our perspectives. This project investigates a new direction for recommender
systems research with the main goal of supporting users in developing,
exploring, and understanding their unique personal preferences. The project will
develop a new type of recommender system: a Recommender System for Self-
Actualization (RSSA), which will support decisions that have a resounding
influence on our life (e.g., choosing an education or a job) where we do not
want to just take the easiest option, but rather to develop ourselves into
unique individuals with a strong sense of determination that we have chosen the
right path.

In contrast to most existing recommender systems research, this project
carefully considers the psychology of consumer choice processes and develops new
types of recommendations to support these processes in novel ways (the RSSA
features). The PI's team will develop a new recommender system outfitted with
the capability to display a traditional Top-N recommendation list, plus each new
RSSA feature. The team will then test the benefit of each RSSA feature against
traditional Top-N recommendations in an online user experiment. This benefit
will be measured by participants' subjective evaluation of the system and their
usage behavior logs.
