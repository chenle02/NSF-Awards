Non-technical Description

The energy consumption of computing is a significant global challenge, as the
demand for computing explodes. If current trends persist, computing will soon
become the dominant energy consumer. Limits to energy production and storage
will limit availability of critical applications and hinder development of new
technologies. Spintronics, which uses an electronâ€™s spin as well as its charge,
offer a new paradigm for computing that can meet this challenge. This FuSe
project aims to enable a new generation of energy-efficient computing devices by
integrating materials research, device physics and ultimately circuit design and
architectures. These devices will be based on materials with electric and
magnetic properties that can be controlled by external fields, called
multiferroics. The team is committed to educating the next generation
semiconductor workforce. A diverse group of graduate and undergraduate students
will be trained in interdisciplinary research, with a focus on those from
underrepresented groups in STEM. The PIs will also develop educational materials
and participate in K-12 outreach events to inspire a broad audience.

Technical Description

This project explores electrically driven and detected spin transport in a
voltage-switchable multiferroic insulator as the foundation for ultra-low-energy
logic-in-memory computing. By exploiting the correlation and non-volatility in
multiferroic materials, the team aims to greatly reduce the operating voltage of
computers substantially below what is achievable by today's complementary metal
oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology and enable transformative logic-in-memory
computing architectures with significantly alleviated communication costs
between memory and logic. The project seeks to obtain fundamental understanding
and transformative innovations by probing multiferroic materials and devices at
unprecedented dimension, time, and energy scales. The team aims to address
engineering challenges by integrating bottom-up research on materials synthesis,
fabrication, and junction physics, and top-down from systems and circuit
requirements. The project involves significant efforts to develop advanced
characterization techniques including optical spectroscopy, electron microscopy,
and magnetotransport for multiferroic materials and heterostructures. In
addition, the project develops a circuit simulation framework and reference
circuit designs, to realistically evaluate multiferroic spintronics at the
system level and facilitate top-down research.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
