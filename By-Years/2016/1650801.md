The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project stems from the
critical need for improved point-of-care diagnostic devices particularly those
for Zika virus infections. The new tests developed could allow results to be
available within less than one hour, thereby reducing burden on patients and
clinicians, and improving treatment and outcomes. The new tests will potentially
improve the lives of people suffering from Zika infections and will impact
several current clinical treatment regimes and may suggest new treatment
options. Applications for the core technology could also include other types of
infectious disease diagnostics.

This I-Corps project will be the first step in commercializing a new, innovative
and rapid diagnostic test for Zika virus infections. The core technology is
based on molecular imprinting. This method allows building exact casts of
biological molecules that are extremely stable and therefore can be stored
without refrigeration. In this project the core technology is used to create
stable casts of antibodies to Zika virus. The devices will detect binding of the
antibodies to the casts and therefore can detect if the antibodies are present
in a patient's blood, which would point to an infection. The technology is the
first diagnostic test based on imprinting large molecules like the Zika
antibody.
