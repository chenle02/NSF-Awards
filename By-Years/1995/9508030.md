9508030 Hofmeister This grant provides $16,490 for 2/3 support of the cost of
upgrading control software for an infrared spectrometer at Washington-St. Louis
(WUSTL) used in studies of mineral physics. A PC platform will be purchased with
the PI's existing research funds and will replace an outdated DEC PDP-11
platform. Replacement hardware for these computers is becoming increasingly
scarce and software is no longer developed for these platforms. The PI recently
joined the faculty at Washington University-St. Louis (WUSTL) and was able to
bring much of her equipment from her former laboratory at the University of
California-Davis (UCD). Conversion of the control system to a PC based platform
will allow the PI to streamline data reduction and analysis as it will remove
cross-platform transfer that was previously necessary. The principal
investigator's research in mineral physics uses vibrational spectroscopy at
ambient and high pressures to elucidate the thermochemical properties of
rockforming minerals. In this regard she is considered a principal contributor
to this unique field. Many collaborators maintained PCbased control systems for
their IR spectrometers and will donate reduction programs presently available.
Further collaboration should be enhanced by development of common platform data
reduction programs. ***
