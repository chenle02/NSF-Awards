Recent work in extensional tectonics has developed a model to explain the rapid
uplift of deep-seated metamorphic rocks and their juxta position against shallow
rocks that has been based primarily on examples from the southwestern United
States. The objective of this research is to determine pressure-temperature-
time paths of metamorphism for rocks from the Cordillera Darwin, Tierra del
Fuego, Chile, that may also represent the result of extensional tectonics. This
example may contain variations of lithospheric response to extension not
developed in the better studied US examples. Samples of metamorphic and cover
rocks will be subjected to petrologic analysis including geothermobarometry,
zoned metamorphic porphyroblasts, textural analysis, fluid inclusion and
geochronology determinations. Results are expected to elucidate the extensional
processes in this region and provide a model for the thermo-tectonic behavior of
the crust during the Andean orogeny.
