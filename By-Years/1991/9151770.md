Microcomputer-based lab activities are being integrated into the undergraduate
mathematics curriculum. The plan is driven by a philosophy drawn from the
empirical sciences: deep laboratory exercises simulate the research process, and
thereby add a critical dimension to the growth of a scientist. It is expected
that the students emerge with a much broader qualitative understanding of the
underlying mathematics.The laboratory is equipped with 20 Macintosh IIsi
computers running Mathematica, MathCAD, Minitab, and SAS/JMP; the lab is
augmented with two Macintosh projection setups and a 2-unit
preparation/consulting room. A previously piloted lecture/lab calculus course is
being implemented in all sections of the general calculus sequence, there are
improved exercises and demonstrations in the computational modeling and
statistics courses and a lab format is being introduced in differential
equations and linear algebra.
