This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to
develop, as a pilot, a highly efficient, high throughput, and compact continuous
flow structured catalyst fixed-bed reactor unit for cost-effective algae
biodiesel production. Successful establishment of the technical feasibility of
the integrated fixed-bed technology for algae biodiesel production will be a
step forward in addressing the high capital costs, high production costs, and
waste stream produced by using a traditional homogeneous alkali-catalyzed
biodiesel production process. It will further demonstrate the commercial
viability of the technology.

The broader/commercial impact of the proposed project will be economic biodiesel
production using algae oil as feedstock, leading to the substitution of
petroleum diesel with domestically produced alternative fuel, the reduction of
diesel emissions and waste stream generation, the mitigation of global warming,
creation of jobs, and the reduction of U.S. dependence on foreign oil imports.
Algae biodiesel has the potential to provide a breakthrough solution to both
energy security and global warming concerns.
