9353965 Fuller This project offers an undergraduate faculty enhancement workshop
for each of two summers, 1994 and 1995. The purpose of this project is to host
two week workshops on Teaching Physics Using Interactive Digitized Media. Each
workshop will: i) foster a discussion and formulation of new strategies for the
teaching of physics using the capabilities of interactive digitized media; ii)
enable 30 physics professors to become skilled in the use of interactive
digitized media for teaching physics courses for undergraduates; iii) help
physicists develop lessons that change the present physics content using
existing interactive digitized media software and technologies; iv) prepare the
participants to lead local, regional, or national workshops on new science
content using interactive digitized media technologies; and v) make the
interactive digitized media lessons developed by the workshop participants
available to physics educators throughout the country. ***
