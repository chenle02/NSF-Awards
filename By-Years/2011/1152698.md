This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will build upon
recent advances in nanotechnology and laser processing of materials to pursue
the large-scale production of stoichiometrically pure silicon carbide (SiC)
fibers which are very difficult to obtain by other means. The transition from
laboratory scale to industrial production requires a sea change in manufacturing
approach. The proposed research will investigate the parameters involved in
creating a "Digital Spinneret" (DS), a novel technology platform which enables
the production of large qualities of high-quality fibers. The Phase I project
demonstrated feasibility of the Digital Spinneret to produce many fibers in
parallel; the Phase II research will extend and optimize this manufacturing
method.

The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be the enabling of
scaled production of high-purity ceramic fibers for application in military and
aerospace (turbomachinery, rockets, advanced structures), automobile, medical,
energy, and other industries that require advanced materials with exceptional
strength, stiffness, heat resistance, and/or chemical resistance. These are
fast-growing fiber markets with great potential, and with a collective size
exceeding $1 billion. The projected energy footprint of this production method
is 1/1000th that of competing methods, providing a huge cost advantage.
