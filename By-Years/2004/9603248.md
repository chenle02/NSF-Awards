Most educational applications on the worldwide web (WWW) present all users with
the same educational materials, regardless of the user's abilities, background,
or knowledge. Adaptivity is particularly important for educational applications
on the WWW that are to be used by different classes of user. The goal of the
proposed collaboration between the PI's group and a group headed by Gerhard
Weber of the University of Tier is to develop a knowledge-based technology for
creating interactive and adaptive educational applications on the WWW and to
investigate how learners understand and comprehend such interactive and adaptive
texts. Both groups are internationally known for their work on domain knowledge
analysis and application of that analysis to constructing advanced tutoring
systems. One result of the collaboration will be an integrated technology for
the design of adaptive on-line textbooks on the WWW, which will then be applied
to the development of adaptive textbooks for real-world domains.
