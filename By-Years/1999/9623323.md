9623323 Sinsabaugh Assessing humic inhibition of microbial processes in aquatic
systems. Dissolved organic carbon has long been recognized as being a major
source of energy in many aquatic ecosystems. However, in most systems the DOC is
composed of a heterogeneous mixture of both labile and recalcitrant substances
which have not been very well characterized. Previous studies have indicated
that a sizable portion of the DOC pool is composed of high molecular weight
humic/phenolic compounds that are refractory in nature. Some of these substances
may be utilized directly by microorganisms, while others may require enzymatic
processing before they can be assimilated. The presence of these phenolic
compounds may have an important influence on the processing of DOC. The
objective of this study is to investigate the relationship between DOC quality
and the nature of the microbial community. Preliminary work has shown that
certain fractions of the DOC pool, namely phenolic compounds, can act to both
stimulate and inhibit bacterial productivity. Through a series of individual
experiments it may be possible to elucidate some of the underlying mechanisms
behind this relationship. The PIs propose to examine several parameters which
may be linked with bacterial productivity, including extracellular enzyme
activities, plasmid screenings, and elementary DOC characterization. These
assays will be conducted in both microcosm and field trials.
