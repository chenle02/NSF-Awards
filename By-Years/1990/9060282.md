For electronic packaging applications, the three desirable properties of an
insulating ceramic substrate are: high thermal conductivity, thermal expansion
match with the device and low dielectric constant. While some monolithic
ceramics show promise, an alternative approach is to design and fabricate a
composite material which will have these properties. We propose a new material:
glass ceramic matrix-diamond particle composites. Since diamond has very high
thermal conductivity and low thermal expansion coefficient, we expect that glass
ceramic matrix- diamond composites will have the desirable properties of a
substrate. In Phase I research, we intend to investigate the feasibility of
fabrication of these composites. The composites will be fabricated by
sinterforging of powder compacts of glass matrix-diamond particles. The thermal,
dielectric and mechanical properties of the composites will be determined as a
function of volume fraction of diamond particles in the matrix.
