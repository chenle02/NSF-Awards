The object of this proposal is to continue to study several fundamental problems
in differential geometry and related fields. The long term goal is to study the
higher order BCOV conjecture and relations between the existence of Kahler-
Einstein metrics and the stability of complex manifolds. One of the short term
goals is to study the different notations of stability. The proposer will also
generalize the Tian--Yau--Zelditch expansion, study the spectrum problem of
quantum layers.

The work of the proposer is related to string theory, which is a developing
branch of theoretical physics that combines quantum mechanics and general
relativity into a quantum theory of gravity. Using differential geometry, he
solves problems posed by string theorists. He will continue work in the
differential geometric aspects of string theory. The proposer is also involved
in many educational activities such as the California Math Counts Program, the
UCI Anteater Math Club, the UCI School of Physical Sciences Mentor Program, etc.
Currently, he is the UCI math department undergraduate student adviser, and is
involved in the innovation of both undergraduate and graduate studies. He will
convey his mathematical insights to students and to the general public by giving
talks and advising students. He will continue to encourage more people,
especially women and minorities, to study mathematics.
