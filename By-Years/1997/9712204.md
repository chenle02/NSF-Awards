ABSTRACT A great deal of attention has focussed in recent years on the role of
iron as a limiting nutrient in the so-called High- Nutrient Low-Chlorophyll
(HNLC) regions of the world ocean. Because of the paucity of the
ultramicronutrient iron, nitrate and phosphate build up in the water column at
anomalously high levels. The investigators on this project have recently begun
to construct quantitative models to account for the chemistry of HNLC waters and
the associated dynamics of the pelagic community. In this study, the
investigators will continue to explore the critical linkages that must be built
into quantitative models that include both ecosystem dynamics and ocean physics
and chemistry. These studies should eventually help to link the results of both
laboratory studies of iron limitation in primary production and open ocean iron
`fertilization experiments' with sophisticated global-scale models of other
biogenic elements, especially carbon.
