9501249 Simmons The unified theory of electroweak interactions has several
unresolved problems, the key ones being the understanding of what is the
mechanism that breaks the symmetry between the weak and electromagnetic
interactions and how are the fermion masses generated. This research seeks to
address these problems and to propose experimental tests for discovering the
symmetry breaking mechanisms. ***
