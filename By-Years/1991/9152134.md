An integrated lecture-laboratory course in contemporary Applied Optics is being
implemented. The course is addressed mainly to physics juniors and seniors, but
other science and engineering students will be attracted to it. The objectives
of the course are: (1) improvement of student's perception of physics as useful
in the "real world"; (2) enhancement of prospect of employment by industry of
physics graduates, and (3) increase of opportunity for "hands on" experience in
current techniques and methods useful in experimental physics. The laboratory
includes experiments in optical radiation detectors, optoelectronic laser beam
manipulation, holography, optical image processing, and fiber optics. This
course serves as a prototype for other courses in applied physics in the
department. The final goal is the increased participation of minority students
in science careers.NSF grant funds are being matched with funds from non-federal
sources.
