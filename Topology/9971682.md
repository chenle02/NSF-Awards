Abstract: In the current project, the Principal Investigator will continue his
study of the topological structures on which various interesting classes of
groups can act. In particular, the PI will show how various types of Artin
groups, Coxeter groups, braid groups, Burnside groups, and pure symmetric
automorphism groups can be made to act on spaces constructed to have one or more
additional properties. The ability to construct such spaces has long been a goal
of geometric group theorists. Since many of these groups arise as the
fundamental groups of configuration spaces the pattern underlying much of the
proposed work can be summarized as follows: a topologically defined space whose
fundamental group is of interest is made to act on a piecewise Euclidean cell
complex whose structure is understood well enough to have computational
comsequences for the group involved. The aim of this project is to increase the
number and variety of groups to which thiss type of procedure can be applied.

This type of project continues the recent emphasis within geometric group theory
on the practical, computational aspects of mathematics. The results under
consideration will not merely show the existence of various objects, but will
provide algorithms for their construction and bounds of the complexity of the
procedures involved. Thus all of the work described can be implemented as a
computer software package which performs these types of computations. This
explicit emphasis on the algorithms and their complexity makes geometric group
theory a close relative of theoretical computer science and of the real world
applications of these techniques.
