9705620 Pinter A major problem of structural geology is the resolution of the
role of faulting in the subsurface to folding at the surface. This study of the
North Channel Islands, CA will help address this question by an integrated study
of marine terranes, (by mapping and age dating), and of seismic reflection
mapping of profiles both in and near Santa Cruz and Anacapa Islands. The results
will allow the calculation of slip and slip rates on the Channel Island Thrust,
and help resolve the disparate interpretations of the activity and consequences
of the Channel Island Thrust.
