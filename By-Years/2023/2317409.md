Testing amino acid paleothermometry in radiocarbon-dated lake sediment

Climate change poses a major challenge for society. More information is needed
to put recent climate changes into a long-term context of natural climate
variability. This information helps to foresee possible future climate trends,
especially those that involve slow-moving features of the climate system, which
will continue to evolve over hundreds to thousands of years to come. A variety
of geological evidence can be used to extend observations of temperature and
other climate variables back in time. This project focuses on developing a new
method of estimating temperature changes extending back thousands of years by
using amino acids contained in lake sediment. The extent to which these
molecules have been degraded depends largely on the temperature of the
environment in which they have been stored and the length of time since they
were formed. This project will use laboratory experiments to determine the
temperature sensitivity of different degradation reactions coupled with
radiocarbon dating to determine the age of the enclosing lake sediment. Funding
will also be used to sustain the shared use of the Amino Acid Geochronology
Laboratory at Northern Arizona University, which is the only one of its type in
the United States. The project will also prepare undergraduate and graduate
students for careers in the STEM workforce.

Developing new methods to quantify past temperature is a high priority for
climate science. The extent to which amino acids (AAs) in geologic settings have
been chemically altered is primarily determined by the length of time elapsed
since the molecules formed and by the ambient post-depositional temperature.
Coupled with independent age control though radiocarbon (14C) dating, chemical
reactions involving AAs can been used to quantify the timing and magnitude of
past temperature changes. AAs are abundant in lake sediment, which has generally
accumulated continuously in lakes over thousands of years, and thereby can be
analyzed in detailed time series from widely distributed sites. This project
will generate the first major AA dataset on 14C-dated and laboratory heated lake
sediment. This project builds on a growing number of studies of AAs in lake
sediment and it takes advantage of NSF-supported lake-core community resources.
This award will sustain the Amino Acid Geochronology Laboratory as research
infrastructure, enabling it to continue its long tradition of training users,
offering pilot-study analyses, and assisting with data interpretation and
curation. This project will also support STEM graduate and undergraduate
students.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
