This proposal requests funds for the development of a C-terminal sequencer. The
C-terminal sequencer will be constructed as part of an ongoing research program
into automated C-terminal sequence analysis of proteins. This C-terminal
sequencing is a key new step in macro- molecular chemistry. The overall
objective of these facilities is to coordinate macromolecular studies and
promote new research in the area of biotechnology.
