This award supports continuing studies of polarization and spectra of variable
extragalactic radio sources. The work of this group has been unique in providing
long-term monitoring of the intensity and polarization of these interesting
objects. Continuation of this research, together with VLBI studies and
theoretical investigations of their inner structure will further constrain and
test emission region models and refine a new method for the direct determination
of the distances of active galactic nuclei.
