This project aims to improve understanding of how the amount of disorder present
in an environment can promote or suppress transport in a system. This issue is
studied in the context of quantum mechanics at the atomic level. Applications of
new insights about quantum systems include the development of quantum computing
devices and quantum algorithms. The project supports education and diversity
though graduate student training, the supervision of undergraduate research, and
the writing and publication of an introductory textbook on ordinary differential
equations aimed at introducing undergraduate students to a rigorous treatment of
this field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the spectral analysis of
Schrödinger operators and unitary analogues of Jacobi operators. These operators
are relevant in many areas, primarily in quantum mechanics and approximation
theory. The objective is to develop new approaches for the spectral analysis of
these operators, and the methods employed range from functional analysis via
harmonic analysis to dynamical systems and ergodic theory. The project also
investigates the Schrödinger time evolution in terms of transport and dispersion
phenomena. The investigator seeks a complete spectral analysis of Schrödinger
operators with potentials generated by hyperbolic transformations, a proof of
several conjectures in the context of orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle,
an approach to proving zero-measure spectrum for multi-frequency Schrödinger
operators, and a study of quantum dynamics from the perspective of transport
exponents and dispersive estimates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
