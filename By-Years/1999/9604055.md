Champness 9604055 Streptomycetes, filamentous soil bacteria, possess two
characteristics that make them attractive prokaryotes for study: they develop
into complex, multicellular, differentiated colonies and they produce a vast
array of secondary metabolites, many of which are useful as antibiotics.
Antibiotic production is usually coupled to morphological differentiation,
beginning at the transition between vegetative growth and production of pre-
spore differentiated hyphae. The long term goal of this research is to discover
the genes that regulate antibiotic synthesis, to understand how they function,
and to determine their functional relationships in the regulatory network
controlling antibiotic gene expression. The immediate objectives of this
proposal focus on three genetic elements discovered in previous NSF funding
periods: absA, absB and mia. Research will proceed along the following lines: 1.
The mechanism by which the absA-encoded signal transduction system exerts global
negative control over antibiotic gene expression will be determined. Genetic,
molecular genetic and biochemical experiments will: a) characterize functionally
important regions and interactions of the AbsA1/A2 "sensor-kinase" and response
regulator proteins; b) establish the role of protein phosphorylation in AbsA-
mediated regulation; and c) explore the genetic pathway through which absA
regulates expression of the antibiotic "pathway-specific regulators." 2. The
absB gene and its probable gene product, an RNaseIII, will be characterized
through determination of the RNaseIII (absB) null phenotype, functional studies
on the S. coelicolor RNaseIII, and identification of candidate RNaseIII targets.
3. The 190 nt mia sequence, which exerts multi-copy inhibition of antibiotic
gene expression, will be characterized to determine the functional regions of
the sequence. The results of the proposed work promise to elucidate aspec ts of
the regulatory programs controlling streptomycete gene expression, and to expand
our understanding of microbial multicellular differentiation.
