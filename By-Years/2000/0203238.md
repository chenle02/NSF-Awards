Gravity waves have been shown to be very important to weather. They can transfer
significant amounts of energy and momentum, initiate and organize convection,
and generate atmospheric turbulence. Observational studies have repeatedly
demonstrated that mesoscale gravity waves with horizontal wavelength of
50-500-km are prevalent in the vicinity of the upper-tropospheric jet streaks.
The exact generation mechanism of these waves, however, remains unknown.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ultimate goal of this research is to understand the
dynamics and impacts of the gravity waves initiated by the upper-tropospheric
jet-front systems and baroclinic instability. A high-resolution mesoscale model
with nesting capability will first be used to reproduce the life cycle of the
baroclinic waves and to simulate the gravity wave emission from jet streaks. The
characteristics, distribution and variability of the gravity waves and their
relationship to the parent baroclinic jet-front system in these idealized
simulations will be examined in great details. Next, the interaction between
balanced and unbalanced dynamics in the initiation of the simulated gravity
waves will be investigated through applications of the various balance/imbalance
diagnostics including Rossby number, omega equations, nonlinear balance and
potential vorticity inversion and also through an extension/implementation of
the QG+ theory. QG+ is a systematic asymptotic framework from which the
balanced, next-order corrections of quasi-geostrophy in Rossby number are
obtained. The final phase of this research will compare the characteristics and
dynamics of the gravity waves in the idealized baroclinic-wave simulations with
observations and apply the findings from the idealized study to understand the
dynamics of the observed gravity waves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Successful
completion of this research may lead to better understanding and prediction of
the timing and location of local and regional weather events.
