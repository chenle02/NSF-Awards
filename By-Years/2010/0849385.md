The proposal seeks NSF support to bring together scientists, engineers, resource
managers and policy makers across NSF EPSCoR jurisdictions in a workshop format.
The objectives for the workshop include (i) sharing information among NSF EPSCoR
jurisdictions on the nature of water resources issues (management, policy) and
the state-of-the-art in research (science) on water in the NSF EPSCoR
jurisdictions, (ii) exploration of collaboration and outreach strategies for
researchers, managers and policy makers, and (iii) identification of
opportunities across NSF directorates for research support in water dynamics
that will align with the expertise of scientists and engineers in NSF EPSCoR
jurisdictions in order to improve funding competitiveness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Workshop speakers will highlight and share ideas on emerging
scientific innovations in water dynamics. These talks and poster presentations
will profile new studies that focus on examining the dynamics of change in water
systems and new research tools available to scientists and engineers to document
and model these changes. The workshop is specifically designed to build
collaborations among NSF EPSCoR researchers, thereby strengthening the nation?s
research capacity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Workshop participants will
address the relevance of research to water resource management and policy.
Speakers will highlight the opportunities for STEM educational outreach and
workforce development through community based research. The social dynamics of
the hydrological systems will be explored, as will strategies for bringing the
diversity of water researchers and students in line with national demographics,
engaging all jurisdictions and special populations in our national research
mission.&lt;br/&gt;
