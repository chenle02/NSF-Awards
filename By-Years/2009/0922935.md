With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation program, Professor
Christine A. Hughey, Jennifer L. Funkand and Jason Keller will acquire a Triple
Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer. The instrument will support three research
projects: 1) Small molecule quantitation for fundamental negative ion
electrospray ionization studies, 2) Small molecule quantitation of alcohol and
acid intermediates formed during the anaerobic decomposition of wetland organic
matter, and 3) Targeted quantitation for plant
proteomics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mass spectrometry (MS) is employed to identify
the chemical composition of a sample and determine its purity by measuring the
mass of the molecular constituents in the sample after they are ionized and
detected by the mass spectrometer. Mass spectrometry is widely used as an
analytical tool by chemists, biologists and biochemists. Undergraduate students
will be trained in the use of this important tool preparing them for future
careers in professional schools, industry and science education.
