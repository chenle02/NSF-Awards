This project seeks to theoretically and experimentally establish a scientific
basis for laser assisted machining (LAM) of various structural ceramic
materials, which can significantly reduce the fabrication costs and improve end-
state properties for ceramic parts. Theoretical treatments of LAM processes will
be used to determine the thermo-mechanical behavior of ceramics during LAM, by
developing thermal models, temperature dependent properties of the materials,
constitutive models and process simulation models. Supporting experiments will
be performed to characterize machining performance in terms of sub-surface
damage and surface finish of machined specimens, tool wear and maximum material
removal rate. The feasibility study with silicon nitride parts demonstrated the
capabilities of LAM by achieving long tool life of approximately 40 minutes,
surface finish commensurate with those of grinding and little sub-surface damage
cracks and heat affected zone as well as significantly higher material removal
rates than grinding under nominal machining conditions. Based on this successful
feasibility study, laser assisted turning processes will be expanded to
machining of various important structural ceramic materials such as silicon
carbide (SiC), alumina (Al2O3), mullite, zirconia (ZrO2) and silicon nitride
(Si3N4).

In particular, the proposed research seeks to develop the capability to
fabricate parts with complex geometry by developing requisite in-process
monitoring and control techniques. This will lead, along with the developed
modeling capabilities, to facilitating the implementation of LAM in industry.
