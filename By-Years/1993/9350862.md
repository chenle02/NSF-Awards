(# % '0* , .81 3 5@8 : <H? A @ @ 1 @ Rix 1 1 - This project will equip a
Nondestructive Evaluation of Infrastructure course to be offered to upper
division civil engineering undergraduate students at Georgia Tech. The proposed
course will introduce students to several nondestructive evaluation methods
including (1) sonic and ultrasonic measurement of material properties, (2)
defect and void detection, (3) acoustic emission monitoring, (4) optical
generation and detection of ultrasound, (5) integrity t esting of foundations,
(6) nondestructive pavement evaluation, and (7) ground penetrating radar
applications. The requested equipment allows students to gain hands on
experience with all of these NDE methods. This equipment includes ultrasonic
generation, detection, and recording equipment for material characterization and
defect detection; an acoustic emission system; a portable Fast Fourier Transform
analyzer, instrumented hammer, and transducers for foundation integrity testing
and pavement evaluation; and a high frequency transmitter and antenna for ground
penetrating radar tests. The Georgia Department of Transportation is also
supporting the proposed course by offering to demonstrate the use of its falling
weight deflectometer for pavement evaluations.
