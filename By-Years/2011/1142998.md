This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop
low-cost manufacturing processes of Vanadium Nitride (VN) based asymmetric
supercapacitors. The approach is to combine the synthesis of nanostructured VN
with its deposition on a current collector substrate. The combined synthesis and
deposition process reduces manufacturing costs and capital equipment expenses.
The direct deposition of thin layers of active material on the current collector
minimizes the impedance and maximizes peak power capabilities. The plan is to
investigate laser sintering of thin layers of vanadium oxides and laser assisted
nitridation, assess technical performance of the resulting thin VN electrodes in
an asymmetric supercapacitor, and identify design factors critical to
performance enhancement and optimization. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
broader/commercial impact of this project will be the potential to provide a
low-cost deposition method that will revolutionize the manufacturing of
asymmetric, high energy density supercapacitors for automotive and smart grid
applications. This technology is expected to reduce the cost of supercapacitors
by 30% and improve the asymmetric cell energy density by 25%.
