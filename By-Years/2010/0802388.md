Two community colleges and a university are forming a Midwest Digital
Fabrication Partnership (MDFP). The MDFP seeks to integrate Massachusetts
Institute of Technology (MIT)-based Digital Fabrication capabilities and
resources into student learning experiences at the undergraduate levels of
higher education. The major goals of the project are to: 1) integrate Digital
Fabrication Laboratories into selected Product Realization courses to provide
enhanced, hands-on Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM)
learning experiences; 2) assess the ability of Digital Fabrication Laboratory
experiences to enhance student STEM competencies and attitudes; and 3) evaluate
Digital Fabrication Laboratories as a STEM recruitment vehicle. This initiative
also integrates program disciplines with Digital Fabrication orientation through
development of articulation agreements between the three colleges.

A cross-disciplinary Fab Lab project team is being established utilizing staff
and experts from the three colleges in the Mechanical Design, Applied
Engineering Technology, Manufacturing Technologies, Information Technology, and
Electrical-Electronics based programs. The team is identifying selected courses
in their respective programs that have Digital Fabrication relevance for hands-
on learning activities. To support this initiative, partner institutions are
transforming existing laboratory space into new Digital Fabrication Laboratories
with incremental capital equipment investments.
