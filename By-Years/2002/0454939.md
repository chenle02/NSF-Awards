Funds are provided to study the effects of ice aggradation and degradation on
terrain evolution by: (1) investigating the crucial interactions of the active
layer, upper permafrost and other components of ecosystems at 10 primary study
sites in arctic and subarctic Alaska, (2) evaluating the modes of permafrost
degradation as they relate to ground ice structures, (3) quantifying the
variety, extent and rate of permafrost degradation across northern and central
Alaska based on photointepretation of thermokarst at a large number (~500) of
systematically distributed sampling points, (4) relating these changes to the
local climatic geothermal histories, and (5) integrating this information into
conceptual models of how permafrost-dominated landscapes will evolve in response
to climate warming. Key to accomplishing these objectives will be the
recognition of the intermediate layer of permafrost as an integral part of
arctic ecosystems and that better knowledge of the linkage between the surface
and permafrost is necessary for reliable prediction of how permafrost terrain
will evolve in the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The observed rapid warming of
many regions of the Arctic is resulting in similarly rapid changes in the
permafrost with dramatic negative consequences for societal infrastructure, e.g.
roads, building foundations, pipelines. Strategic planning for the further
development of these regions requires an understanding of permafrost evolution
such as this project is designed to provide.&lt;br/&gt;
