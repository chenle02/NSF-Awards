The Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program of the Chemistry
Division continues support to Dr. Mary Rakowski-DuBois of the Chemistry
Department, University of Colorado at Boulder, for studies of carbon-carbon
coupling reactions and synthesis of dinuclear compounds containing metals with
vacant coordination sites. Binuclear molybdenum compounds with sulfide and
hydrosulfide bridging ligands have been synthesized and found to catalyze the
oligomerization of isobutene. Investigation of the mechanism of this reaction is
planned so that the selectivity and stability of this catalyst can be compared
to known catalysts for similar reactions. One part of the investigation will
focus on reaction surveys, stoichiometric reactions, and Extended Huckel
Molecular Orbital calculations to investigate the reaction mechanism. A second
part of the project will be to synthesize new compounds in which the bridging
and/or terminal ligands have been altered to enhance catalytic activity either
by placing the substrate in proximity of the hypothetically critical bridging
ligand or by increasing the likelihood that a vacant coordination site will
form.
