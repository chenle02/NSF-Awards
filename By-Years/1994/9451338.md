9451338 Saxon A Mathematical Instructional/Explorations Laboratory is being
developed and implemented. The laboratory will be used to enhance by making use
of available electronic lecture notes and newly created electronic notes with
colorful text, video clips, dynamic graphics, and motion made possible with
hypertext and windows, and then placing them in the lab for on-line student
review; In addition, laboratopy exercises are being developed that guide the
student in active learning experiences. In addition,students are being assigned
writing activities which focus on analysis of the mathematics of the cooperative
or independent lab experience, metacognition, and the dynamics of group problem
solving.
