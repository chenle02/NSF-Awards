This project is a cooperative effort to produce twelve highly-qualified
secondary science and mathematics teachers for regional high need school systems
in California. It involves the College of Arts and Sciences and the School of
Leadership and Education Sciences at the University of San Diego (USD), the San
Diego Unified School District, and three community colleges, Grossmont College,
San Diego Mesa College, and San Diego City College.

Intellectual Merit: The program uses and expands upon several strong teacher
preparation initiatives within the teacher preparation programs already in place
at USD. For example during their early (induction) years of teaching, teachers
will be supported through two existing programs, an Induction Mentoring
Partnership Program and a research-based induction program, in which new
teachers are mentored by content specialists and by Nationally Board Certified
Teachers. Research within the project on the effectiveness of these approaches
is adding to the knowledge base concerning effective approaches to science and
mathematics teacher preparation.

The broader impact resides in the high need school districts benefiting from the
graduates of the Noyce scholarship program and the deepening ties developing
between USD and its community college and school district partners as they
realize the part each can play in strengthening science and mathematics teacher
preparation.
