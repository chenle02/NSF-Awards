The world-wide market for methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE, an octane enhancer) is
projected to reach 26 billion pounds per year during the 1990's. A recent ARCO
study concludes that ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE) is a more desirable fuel
additive than MBTE. Conventional technology requires distillation of
fermentation ethanol prior to the synthesis of ETBE. One focus of this proposal
is the acid-catalyzed synthesis of ETBE in near- or supercritical water, thereby
avoiding costly distillation. Because ETBE is insoluble in water, separation of
ETBE from the aqueous phase exiting the reactor is facile. A second focus of
this proposal is the acid-catalyzed synthesis of a mixture of ethyl butyl ethers
(EBE) in near- or supercritical water from fermentation products ethanol and
1-butanol. Mixed EBE's should have fuel properties similar the ETBE, and would
be a fully renewable high octane fuel additive. The proposed research emphasizes
kinetic studies of the acid-catalyzed mechanism of ether formation in near- and
supercritical water using two plug flow reactors. Kinetic models developed
during this work will be useful for reactor design and scale-up. This research
will also help to clarify the extent to which kinetics can be used to detail
mechanism.
