A novel diamond-like carbon coating has been developed that has an extremely
low work function. Using a proprietary deposition method, this material can be
coated on a variety of metal and ceramic parts. Phase I of this project will
test the applicability of this material for use as a cold field emission source
of electrons to replace hot filaments in electron guns. The concept will first
be tested by obtaining emission from a sharp tungsten tip coating with this
carbon material, then replacing the hot filament cathode in an electron gun, and
finally obtaining preliminary operating parameters (e.g. maximum emission
current, emission voltage etc.) for the gun. This information will then be used
to design a direct replacement tip for hot filament electron guns. Since this
material has a very low work function, the Wehnelt power supply in most electron
guns should serve as the extractor supply.
