This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop engineered
wire waveguides for time-domain terahertz (THz) spectroscopy and imaging
systems. Design of waveguides for various materials will be accomplished by
finite element modeling and finite time difference simulation. The precision
waveguide shapes will be produced by advance laser micromachining techniques, as
an alternative to chemical etching methods while are difficult to control or
reproduce.

The broader impact of this program will be to enable new commercial
opportunities in industrial non-destructive evaluation as well as innovative and
important research areas such as near-field microscopy, characterization of
metamaterials and determination of surface charge on conductive polymers used in
solar cells and organic light emitting diodes (LEDs). The implementation of
practical THz waveguides will simplify THz technology and reduce its cost and
expand its use. This project involves graduate and undergraduate students,
preparing them for innovative work in a rapidly developing high tech field.
