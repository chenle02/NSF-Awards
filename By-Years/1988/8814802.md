This project supports a three week mathematical research institute organized by
the American Mathematical Society to be held in the Summer of 1989 at the
University of California, Santa Cruz. This institute will be the thirty-seventh
in a series planned with the purpose of bringing together a group of
mathematicians who are interested in a particular field of mathematical
research. Emphasis is placed primarily on instruction at a very high level, with
seminars and lectures by distinguished mathematicians in related fields.
"Several Complex Variables and Complex Geometry" is the topic of the 1989
institute. Complex analysis has grown considerably since 1975, the date of the
last institute which focused on this topic. A significant component of this
growth has stemmed from the interaction with other parts of mathematics. One
principal purpose of this institute is to foster further such interaction.
Proceedings of the institute will be published in the American Mathematical
Society's series "Proceedings of Symposia in Pure Mathematics".
