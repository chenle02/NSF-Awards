The goal of this project is to strengthen the undergraduate chemistry program at
Saint Mary's College through the use of a nuclear magnetic resonance
spectrometer in the curriculum. Four courses (Organic Chemistry II, Physical
Chemistry II, Quantitative Analysis and Chemical Research) will be revised to
provide students with an opportunity to put NMR principles into practice through
"hands-on" experience, both in class projects and in independent research. Use
of the NMR spectrometer will complement the current chemistry program in which
students use infrared and UV-visible spectroscopic methods as well as methods in
chromatography and electrochemistry. Thus, integration of NMR spectroscopy in
the curriculum will give students a more complete preparation in the areas of
instrumental practice and molecular structure determination.
