The project creates a new physical science course at the introductory college
level especially for pre-science teachers. In addition, the project determines
the student's attitudes toward science before and after taking the course. The
project also surveys in-service elementary teachers in several area school
districts to determine their beliefs and practices with regards to teaching
physical science. The project also raises awareness for quality teaching of
physical science both for pre-service and in-service teachers. Finally, efforts
are devoted to methods of best teaching physical science to elementary education
students.
