Marietta College will purchase electronic sensor sets, rotational dynamics
apparatus sets, microcomputers and associated peripherals and software. This
equipment will be used to improve instruction in lower-division physics
laboratory courses. Improvements will be made to nine basic experiments in these
courses, and students will have the opportunity to enhance their understanding
of the underlying physical phenomena through the use of modern sensing equipment
and data analysis techniques. Marietta College will match the NSF grant with an
equal amount of funds.
