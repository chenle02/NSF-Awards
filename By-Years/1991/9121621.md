In this program sponsored by the experimental physical chemistry in the
Chemistry Division, the Hedberg husband and wife team (Oregon State University)
will conduct structure determinations using gas phase electron diffraction at
high temperatures. The development of high temperature apparatus allows the
Hedbergs to study relatively nonvolatile materials such as C60 and higher
members of the fullerene allotropes of carbon. %%% Buckminsterfullerene, a
compound containing only carbon atoms arranged like a soccer ball, has received
widespread attention because of its unique structure and the potentially
valuable properties of its derivatives (high temperature superconductivity,
substrate for diamond synthesis). The Hedbergs (Oregon State University)
provided the first gas phase structure determination of the parent compound, and
will extend their studies to the burdgeoning class of chemically important
higher members of the fullerene series.
