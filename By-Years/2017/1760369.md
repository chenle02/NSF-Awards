Networks of autonomous underwater and surface vehicles (AUVs and ASVs) allow
direct and continuous monitoring of the ocean. New deployment strategies are
needed to obtain maximum coverage from a relatively small number of vessels.
This will require better understanding of the structures controlling transport
in geophysical flows such as ocean currents. New results show that AUV/ASV
motion planning and adaptive sampling strategies are improved by incorporating
models of ocean current dynamics. However, these currents change continually and
apparently unpredictably, and this makes it highly challenging to take full
advantage. The goals of this project are to better understand the dynamics of
the dominant structures in ocean currents, and to explore their impact on
AUV/ASV autonomy. Additionally, this work will produce robust motion control
strategies for both single vehicles and teams of vehicles, to track desired
structure boundaries, while leveraging the environmental dynamics to prolong
operational lifespan. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In pursuit of the project goals, the
research objectives are to: 1) identify and evaluate key kinematic features that
control transport in oceanic surface flows of greatest relevance to autonomous
vehicle navigation and control, 2) develop a general mathematical and control
framework for teams of autonomous vehicles that leverages key transport
controlling features in oceanic flows for improved navigation and monitoring of
dynamic and uncertain environments, and 3) apply the control framework to the
tracking of salt wedge fronts using the WHOI Jetyaks to establish the transition
from the laboratory to the ocean. This work has a significant experimental
component that leverages the PIs' existing research infrastructure. The work
addresses the theoretical and experimental challenges needed to develop a
general mathematical and control framework for applying geophysical fluid
dynamics to the development of novel planning, navigation, and control
strategies for individual and networked teams of autonomous vehicles.
