Project Abstract In this project the principal investigator conducts
theoretical research on the welfare and information aggregation properties of
market institutions (exemplified by auctions and double auctions), elections,
and related institutions. A common feature of these institutions is that they
involve the interaction of a large number of agents. Whether large markets
effectively aggregate decentralized private information is one of the central
questions in economic theory. This project analyzes this question for auctions,
double auctions and related environments. The advantage of the auction setting
is that it provides an explicit model of how individual actions and information
translate into prices. This is in contrast to the price-taking model of a
competitive market that is characterized by equilibrium conditions on prices,
but provides no explanation of how prices satisfying those conditions are
arrived at. The findings define conditions (necessary and sufficient) on the
structure of the market that lead to `full information equivalence` . Full
information equivalence is satisfied if the equilibrium price is the same
whether or not buyers or sellers have private information about the quality of
the objects for sale. The question of whether elections effectively aggregate
private information is central to political theory. A strong argument for
elections is that society may be collectively better informed about the relative
quality of a set of alternatives than any individual. Elections provide a
mechanism for aggregating private information, ensuring a better collective
decision. This idea inspired some of the earliest mathematical models of voting
in elections and dates back at least to Condorcet. The set of environments in
which elections might usefully aggregate private information about the relative
quality of a pair of alternatives goes well beyond the Jury setting that was the
focus of Condorcet's work. In most elections voters have private information
about the relative quality of the alternatives. This project characterizes the
voting environments that lead to full information equivalence, i.e., situations
in which the alternative elected is the same whether or not the private
information of voters about the quality of the alternatives is made public
before the election. Finally, this project develops an analytical framework that
includes both elections and auctions as special cases. Analyzing this more
abstract setting promises to provide a deeper understanding of the underlying
characteristics that lead to institutions to have good information aggregation
properties.
