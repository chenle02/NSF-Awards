There is much interplay between the areas of algebraic geometry and the
geometric aspects of several complex variables - areas which have engendered a
significant amount of current research activity and excitement. Among the
fundamental problems on which important progress has been made are: (a)
applications of Hodge theory to complex and algebraic geometry; (b) properties
of holomorphic and meromorphic mappings of complex manifolds; and (c) theory of
the classification of algebraic 3-folds. This grant will help support a
conference to be held at Johns Hopkins University in April, 1991, which will
focus on the above mentioned areas. This conference will provide an excellent
chance for U.S. mathematicians to interact with their Japanese counter- parts, a
number of whom are visiting Johns Hopkins under the auspices of the Japan-U.S.
Mathematics Institute.
