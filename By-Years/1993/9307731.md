9307731 Bledsoe This renewal project continues the effort to build more powerful
theorem provers with automated proof discovery as the central focus. The
principal problem domain is mathematics with offers a rich source of theorems
that automated provers cannot yet prove. Methods developed for mathematics apply
to many areas, such as reasoning in expert systems, inference in large
databases, program verification, reverse engineering, factory automation, etc.
The work focuses on basic heuristic methods either modelled from human behavior
or discovered through analysis of individually targeted domains. Specifically,
the research focuses on "large- step" methods, second order logic, analogy,
proof plans or scripts, interactive theorem proving, and the combining of these
efforts Implementation of analogy in automatic proof discovery remains an
important long term goal. Analogy as used by mathematicians is an extremely
powerful proof methodology. This project uses proof plans and scripts, and
centers on proving a few very difficult theorems with analogy. ***
