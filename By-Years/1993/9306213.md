9306213 Rocken This award provides funds for the acquisition of nine Global
Positioning System (GPS) receivers by the University NAVSTAR Consortium
(UNAVCO). The UNAVCO facility is supported by NSF to provide instrument and
logistical support for researchers using GPS technique in investigations of
global, regional, and local crustal motions where maximum accuracy (in the
millimeter range) of baseline measurement is required. Research projects
dependent on the UNAVCO facility include investigations of lithospheric plate
motions, intraplate strain, strain associated with earthquakes, and movement of
glaciers. ***
