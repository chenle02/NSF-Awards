Georgia Tech continues a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site. The
REU Site has been funded since 1999. The general topical area of the REU Site is
Structure-Property Correlation across Nano-, Micro-, and Macro-Length Scales in
Advanced Materials. Research projects are grouped under three multi-disciplinary
themes: Microstructure-Based Structure-Property Models, Structure-Property
Relations in Engineered Hierarchical, Heterogeneous Structural Materials, and
Structure-Property Relations in Electronic, Ionic, Photonic, and Magnetic
Materials. Ten-to-twelve undergraduate students from all disciplines in science
and engineering are recruited nationwide every year for an eight-week summer
research experience. Some students also participate in an international research
experience at research institutions and Brazil. The program also includes
participation of six high school teachers, including three teachers from inner
city schools.

This award is co-funded by the Division of Materials Research and the Office of
Multidisciplinary Activities of the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical
Sciences, and the Office of International Science and Engineering.
