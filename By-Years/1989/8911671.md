This proposal will examine the seasonal retroflection of the North Brazil
Current as it flows northwestward along the coast of South America after
crossing the equator. Inverted echo sounders will be moored in an array designed
to monitor the current by acoustical means. This project will cooperate with
others in NOAA and internationally with France and FRG.
