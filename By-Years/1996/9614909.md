This Minority Research Planning Grant initiates research leading to a novel
approach in ATM network bandwidth allocation and call admission. The key
contribution of the proposed work is the use of indices of dispersion (in
addition to traditional parameters) and low-pass filtering to characterize ATM
network traffic. The resource allocation schemes will be implemented on existing
ATM testbeds.
