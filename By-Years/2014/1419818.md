Air quality over the western United States is determined not only by local
emissions, but also by the transport of pollutants from outside the region,
namely, from Asian emissions that have been transported across the Pacific
Ocean, and by stratospheric intrusion events that bring naturally-occurring
ozone-rich air to the surface. Quantifying the contribution of the large-scale
atmospheric transport to present-day air quality is of vital importance for
policy makers, since the ability of an area to be in compliance with current air
quality standards is partly a function of the background meteorological
conditions. Furthermore, increasing greenhouse gas concentrations over the next
century are expected to drive large changes in the midlatitude circulation, but
the effects of these changes on pollutant transport are not well understood.

The goals of this project are (1) to gain a fundamental understanding of the
dynamical mechanisms that couple synoptic variability and pollutant transport
and (2) to explore how changes in synoptic variability with increased greenhouse
gas concentrations may modify this transport. The two goals will be addressed
using a hierarchy of models: a large-multi-model data set, a chemistry-climate
model, a stratosphere-resolving atmospheric GCM and an idealized, dry dynamical
core. Future pollutant emissions are largely unpredictable, but the dynamical
processes that drive tropospheric transport have the potential to be understood.
By decoupling emissions from the circulation, this work aims to assess the role
of changing atmospheric variability in modifying tropospheric transport.
