1328023&lt;br/&gt;Lin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports the participation
of 30 U.S. graduate students in the North American Membrane Society's (NAMS)
2013 national meeting in Boise Idaho, June 8-12, 2013. This is the largest
American meeting focused in the area of membrane science and engineering.
Students will have opportunities to present their work, meet other scientists
and engineers from around the world with similar interests, and see state-of-
the-art presentations from other research groups working in this
area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This funding will be used to help disseminate
knowledge about state-of-the-art research in membrane science and engineering
from around the world to students. This is the premier meeting for students and
engineers in the American membrane community, and this technology represents one
of the fastest growing separations techniques. It is widely used in the
chemical, petrochemical, food processing, food packaging, medical and
pharmaceutical industries. The most respected and accomplished membrane
scientists and engineers from around the world will participate in this meeting.
Students will also have extensive opportunities to network with potential
employers and with students and faculty from other research groups with similar
interests. Society will benefit from this activity by having better trained,
more knowledgeable graduate students prepared to push the frontiers of this
unique enabling technology in a wide variety of practical applications.
