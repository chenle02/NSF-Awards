9407310 Johnson ABSTRACT Animal mating systems are a central topic in
evolutionary biology, because mating patterns can greatly affect the speed and
path of evolution in a population. Recent advances in molecular biology have
revealed that avian mating systems are not always as they appear: for example,
many species long thought to be faithfully monogamous are actually quite
promiscuous. Dr. Johnson will describe the social mating system (behavior) in a
colony of Great-Tailed Grackles, use DNA microsatellites to characterize the
genetic mating system (parentage), and test existing hypotheses for the
evolution of polygynous mating systems.
