The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) project is to enable greater electric vehicle use; furthermore,
the technologyâ€™s potential to double battery life will reduce the environmental
impact of disposed batteries. This project accelerates electric car adoption by
enabling use of 100% of battery operating ranges and maximize usable energy
capacity, increasing ongoing driving ranges by 50-100x. This project is a key
enabler for expected growth in the global lithium-ion battery market (expected
to grow to $68 B by 2022) and the annual hybrid and electric car market
(forecast to exceed 10 million vehicles annually by
2025).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase II project proposes to optimize the
technology for battery fast charge and capacity retention targets. Battery
performance advancements are most often limited by chemistry and materials
improvements to electrodes, electrolytes, or cell structure limiting the trade
space (i.e., requiring power vs. energy tradeoffs). The proposed charging
technology and associated software will selectively optimize cell design for
various performance metrics by controlling electrode surface phenomena, such as
lithium plating and dendrite formation, that otherwise cause permanent capacity
loss during normal use and accelerate internal physical processes limiting
charge rate. Technical tasks include: 1) Demonstration of performance
improvements to commercial Li-Ion and fabricated Li-metal battery cells; 2)
Adaptation of the process from small cells and modules to electric vehicle
battery packs; 3) Development of refined sensing and feedback-based control
algorithms using Predictive Learning (PL) and Machine Learning (ML) systems; 4)
Verification and validation for Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) and System
on a Chip (SoC) formats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
