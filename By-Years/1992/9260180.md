The hydroperoxyl radical plays an important role in the photochemistry of both
the troposphere and the stratosphere. In the troposphere, HO2 participates in
ozone formation chemistry in urban environments. Recombination of HO2 is the
only known source of atmospheric hydrogen peroxide, which is important in the
chemistry of acid precipitation. Direct measurements of atmospheric hydroperoxyl
radical concentrations would provide important data for use in testing and
improving models of atmospheric photochemistry. The proposed research will
utilize near-infrared diode lasers to measure tropospheric HO2 concentrations by
absorption in spectroscopic bands near 1500 nm. This approach offers improved
sensitivity, as compared to mid-infrared methods, due to the high power and
improved optical characteristics of near-infrared diode lasers. In Phase I,
laboratory experiments will be conducted to measure the absorption cross
sections of HO2 near 1500 nm. The results of these experiments will provide a
basis for critical assessment of the feasibility of this technique for
tropospheric measurements and will establish the crucial design parameters for
development of field instrumentation in Phase II.
