The focus of this research is the use of aniodic coupling of electron rich
alkenes to provide a method for triggering oxidative cyclization reactions. New
terminating groups for cyclization reactions will be developed, temporary
silicon tethers will be employed to control the relative and absolute
stereochemistry of quaternary carbon synthesis, sequential chemical reaction-
electrochemical cyclization strategies will be used to construct complex ring
systems and the aniodic initiation of tandem cyclization reactions will be
explored. %%% With this renewal award, the Synthetic Organic Program is
supporting the research of Dr. Kevin D. Moeller of the Department of Chemistry
at Washington University. Dr. Moeller will focus his work on demonstrating the
versatility of organic electrochemistry as a tool for organic synthesis.
