Units with a longer time basis than the traditional phones or sub- phones may
provide a better structural basis for ASR systems customized for recognition of
naturally spoken discourse. In this project, syllabic-length acoustic models are
being explored for the recognition of conversational speech. The project
entails: definition of the acoustic features derived from energy trajectories
spanning ca. 250-ms intervals of speech; statistical modeling of these syllable-
length regions; development of a decoding scheme designed to combine the outputs
of these acoustic models with the more traditional phone- and sub-phone-length
models; and embedding the syllable, phone and sub-phone features into a multi-
tiered representation of language designed for robust recognition under a wide
range of acoustic-environmental and speaking conditions. A complete ASR system
is being developed that will incorporate the results of this research, and will
be evaluated on fluent speech. Successful results with the recognition system
have the potential to improve practical ASR systems that must deal with the
decoding of spontaneous discourse. Additionally, the analysis of longer-time
structure at the acoustic, statistical, and lexical levels should improve our
basic knowledge about the structure of conversation speech.
