This is a tie project between the Industry/University Cooperative Research
Center (I/UCRC) for Photopolymerization at the University of Colorado and the
I/UCRC for Coatings at the University of Southern Mississippi. The objectives of
the research are to synthesize a series of novel thiol-ene monomers and study
their photopolymerization behavior under a variety of conditions. The mechanisms
and kinetics of photopolymerization will be investigated. The fundamental
knowledge about the structure-property relations will be used to develop stable
photopolymers as industrial coatings.
