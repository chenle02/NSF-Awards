In a renewal of a highly successful program of taxonomic research and training
in the PEET activity, Partnerships for Enhancing Expertise in Taxonomy, Prof
Gustavo Hormiga at George Washington University and colleagues at Harvard
University, the California Academy of Sciences, and the Smithsonian seek to
train additional systematic biologists (two likely Ph.D. students and one
postdoctoral scholar) in monographic and revisionary study of a megadiverse
group, spiders. The trainees, working in close collaboration with the PIs and
several expert collaborators, will study and describe spider species in the orb
weaving families Tetragnathidae and Mysmenidae. The main goal is to train three
taxonomic experts in several critically understudied groups of mostly tropical
spiders. These trainees will receive state of the art education in systematic
methods and will interact with a diversity of project collaborators and academic
and research institutions. Their training will allow them in the future to carry
out systematic research on any taxonomic group of spiders. The phylogenetic
component of these projects will use character evidence from morphology,
behavior and DNA sequences. The taxonomic aspects of this research will make
extensive use of computerization and web-based dissemination. The monographs and
systematic data resulting from this research will be published in peer reviewed
journals. &lt;br/&gt;In addition, the project web site (www.gwu.edu/~spiders/)
will serve as an outlet to advertise research results and to disseminate these,
including: Interactive identification keys, Digital Image Banks (of taxonomic
images of the world genera of Tetragnathidae and Mysmenidae to assist with
identification), Database of images of web architecture (with images hyperlinked
to a file with the specimen voucher data), and Specimen&lt;br/&gt;databases of
geo-referenced material for the monographed taxa. &lt;br/&gt;
