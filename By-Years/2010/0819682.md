Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Dynamic Factor Demand: Frictions and Aggregate Productivity
Effects&lt;br/&gt;PI: Russell W. Cooper, University of Texas,
SES-0819682&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research studies the dynamics of capital
and labor utilization and adjustment in the firm. The goal of the research is to
specify and solve dynamic optimization problems of a firm, or its plants, taking
into account the difficulties faced in adjusting capital and labor inputs.
Capturing the complexity of this adjustment is one of the research
accomplishments. &lt;br/&gt;One novel feature of the research is the use of an
"Euler equation" continuous-optimization approach to estimation even though
adjustment of the factors is intermittent. The project develops an approach for
estimating the demand for capital in this way. Other research extends this
approach to applications with occasionally binding constraints. This includes
the study of a problem in which a firm faces financial restrictions which only
bind in some states, and a household problem of limited access to capital
markets.&lt;br/&gt;Understanding dynamic factor demand is quite important for
policy purposes. For instance, the analysis of a reduction in the cost of
capital through an investment tax credit, must be consistent with the nature of
micro-level adjustment frictions. Otherwise, the predictions of the policy
effects may be erroneous.&lt;br/&gt;Studies of aggregate productivity likewise
need to take account of the significance of frictions in the reallocation of
capital and labor. This research builds upon characterizations of the micro-
level frictions to study the dynamics of aggregate productivity. Specifically,
it provides an environment to evaluate the significance of endogenous
reallocation costs for measured aggregate productivity. The methods developed
then are applied to study productivity behavior during disruptions such as those
caused by the Great Depression in the United States.
