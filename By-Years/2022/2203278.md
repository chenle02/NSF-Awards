Efficient methods of storing and querying large data volumes play a crucial role
in a majority of computer applications. In many situations, both the stored data
and the queries can be represented as geometric objects, such as points, lines,
and rectangles. This scenario is traditionally studied in computational
geometry. However, geometric data structures have numerous applications in other
areas of Computer Science, from spatial databases to geographic information
systems, from computer graphics to bioinformatics. This project will study
geometric data structures and their connections with other areas of theoretical
Computer Science. The investigator and his students will also study the
implementations of obtained algorithms and their potential applications.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will focus on fundamental
geometric data structuring problems: the orthogonal range searching problem, the
point location problem, the nearest neighbor problem, and the dynamic convex
hull problem. Despite several decades of extensive study, there are still
several important open questions related to these problems.&lt;br/&gt;This
project aims to extend and deepen the knowledge of this area: reduce or
eliminate the gaps between the lower and upper bounds, investigate the relative
complexities of problems in different models of computation, and find more
efficient ways to dynamize the static data structures. The investigator will
also explore the connections between geometric data structures and algorithms in
the external memory model, making the project's contributions applicable to a
larger class of applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
