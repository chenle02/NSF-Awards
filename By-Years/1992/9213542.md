This award is to conduct an experimental study and model the functioning of
thin film material handling equipment. This effort, being conducted in close
collaboration with an industrial co- sponsor, will result in a better
understanding of such material handling mechanisms and provide a sound
theoretical basis for the design of thin film handling equipment. The test
equipment that will be fabricated to conduct the study will be based on the
latest mechatronic design techniques, provide for the variation of critical
parameters and include sensors and actuators so that the cause effect
relationships can be studied and quantified. Material handling of thin films is
a frequent occurrence in many electronic equipment and devices in the industrial
and consumer sector. This research will develop a scientific and theoretical
basis for the design of such equipment, with competitive benefits to many
producers of such equipment.
