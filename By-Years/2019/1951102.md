This project examines the role of the financial industry in reallocating
investment in the U.S. electricity system. The U.S. electricity system has
experienced a range of regulatory, technological, and ideological
transformations and today is comprised of traditional competitive markets, state
energy policies and initiatives, and increases generation from natural gas and
renewable energy. This research will illustrate how investment is being
allocated amongst different utilities, markets, and generation technologies, and
how financial firms are owning and operating power plants and trading
electricity in markets. It examines the relationship between monopoly and
competition in the U.S. electricity system, and how financial entities react to
technological change in the choices of generation fuels. The findings from this
study will be disseminated via publications that will inform various industry,
government, and policy organizations that work on issues related to the
electricity industry. The results will provide the basis for curriculum
development that broadens participation students&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project investigates how financial actors, strategies, and practices are
reshaping the U.S. electricity system. It uses a mixed methods approach that
combines the results of case studies the activities of major investment banks
with in-depth interviews with key investment analysts, investors and electricity
traders. The results will determine the new financial actors that have emerged
in the electricity sector, and how and why financial entities are influencing
the activities in large investor owned utilities. Finally, these results will
illustrate how electricity traders are using financial instruments to respond to
changes in the types of generation, ownership, and regulation in the electricity
industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
