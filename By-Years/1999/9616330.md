ABSTRACT SBR 96-16330 PIs: Hyman & Lowe The present project continues efforts
to develop the Comparative Bantu On-LineDictionary (CBOLD) which currently
serves as a basis for theoretical, descriptive, and historical research on this
important and vast language family. During the first three years of the project,
CBOLDcreated a unified database for comparative research in Bantu based on
lexical materials, including over two dozen complete dictionaries, scores of
smaller wordlists, and other lexical databases. Of the 500+ daughter languages
in the Bantu family, CBOLD now has representative data for over 120. CBOLD has
become a major international collaboration and now distributes (electronically
and soon by other means) these lexicographic materials to linguists, historians,
other social scientists and even epidemiologists throughout the world. In this
second three-year period, activities at CBOLD will center around three essential
activities: 1) Development of the etymological (comparative) component of the
database; 2) Continued analysis of linguistic phenomena as exemplified in the
Bantu lexicon (semantic, morphological, phonological); and 3) Completing the
inventory lexical material from throughout the Bantu zone. In parallel with the
CBOLD database development effort, resident and visiting researchers at
Berkeley, as well as scholars accessing materials through our WEB site
(http://bantu.berkeley.edu/cbold.html) will continue to utilize CBOLD to produce
scholarly works in their respective fields.
