This proposal includes a broad spectrum of modeling activities concentrating on
the high speed transport of polar wind plasma into the magnetosphere.
Specifically, the work involves a detailed comparison of the predictions of our
improved polar wind model with observations, for developing a high-speed
interhemispheric flow model, for the development of the first three ion species
polar wind model (with H+, O+ and He+ ions), for developing a time-dependent,
multispecies, gyrotropic twenty moment flow model, and for plasma kinetic
simulations of microphysical processes developing into high speed ionospheric
flows.
