ABSTRACT OPP-9614537 OPP-9614557 NELSON, FREDERICK BARRY, ROGER STATE UNIVERSITY
OF NEW YORK UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO AT ALBANY This research project uses Global
Circulation Models (GCMs) to derive climatic conditions in the permafrost region
of the Arctic during predicted warmer climatic conditions. The model output for
a warmer climate scenario will be used to predict the areas where permafrost
could thaw and cause great disruption to human populations. The disruption would
greatly affect engineering practices, coastal erosion, as well as ecological
changes that could affect subsistence economies. The results of this study will
provide a framework for assessing potential impacts on the infrastructure and
social culture of areas in the Arctic where global climate changes resulting
from natural or human activities have been predicted. The study will incorporate
data from the Russian Arctic that has not been available previously.
