9313861 Singpurwalla Techniques for estimating software reliability abound. Over
a dozen models exist for estimating software reliability. Most of these models
primarily use the failure time and fault data obtained during program testing.
Usually these data are used to estimate the parameter of the model, and the
parameters are then used to estimate the probability of program failure during
an exposure period. This probability is widely used in the literature as a
measure of software reliability. In contrast to such black-box models, white-box
models require a knowledge of the program structure. This research seeks to
develop and evaluate white-box models that make use of code structure and
coverage information obtained during module and system or sub-system testing, in
addition to the failure time and fault data. ***
