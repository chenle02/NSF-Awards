This three-year award provides support for US-France cooperative research on
improving ocean circulation models of small-scale mixing processes and mesoscale
eddies. The project involves Marie-Pascale Lelong and her colleagues at
NorthWest Research Associates, Inc. and Patrice Klein and researchers at the
Physical Oceanography Laboratory of IFREMER (the French National Institute for
Research on the Sea). The investigators will collaborate on the development of
new parameterizations that take into account the small-scale signal and
mesoscale features of regions of intense thermohaline- front formation. This
includes regions in the vicinity of turbulent eddies and jets in the ocean. The
project takes advantage of recent results by the French investigators, which
indicate a high correlation between thermohaline-front formation and high
ambient potential vorticity gradients at the mesoscale. The US investigators
bring to this collaboration expertise in theory and modeling. This is
complemented by French experience in turbulence dynamics. The collaboration will
allow US investigators to extend their theoretical results into an area of
realistic oceanic conditions.
