North American species of chickadees are well-studied in terms of their
biology, ecology, and behavior, but their evolutionary relationships are poorly
understood. They are generally thought to be descended from a Eurasian ancestor
or ancestors, but the number and timing of invasions are not known, and the
order in which species have diverged remains unclear. Dr. Frank Gill of the
Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia, proposes to use restriction enzyme
patterns in mitochondrial DNA to unravel these questions. These patterns will be
compared with data sets of morphology and enzyme proteins, and then synthesized
in an evolutionary study. The proposed research has implications beyond the
interests of taxonomists specializing on chickadees. Biogeographers will be able
to compare the timing and ecological conditions of invasions against those known
for other groups. The framework of ancestor-descendant relationships will be
available for comparative ornithological studies of behavior, ecology and
anatomy. Molecular biologists will gain an important case study for comparing
the rates at which different molecules evolve within a taxonomic group.
