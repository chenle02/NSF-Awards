This project will extend past research on parallel optimization in solving
problems with embedded network structures. The research will be mainly concerned
with stochastic network models and multicommodity network flow problems. The
agenda for algorithmic research is to design and analyze decomposition
algorithms for both problem classes. The agenda for parallel computing is to
design implementations of the algorithms for two broad paradigms of parallel
computing: coarse-grain MIMD architectures, and fine-grain massively parallel
computing SIMD architectures. The plan is to implement and evaluate empirically
all of the algorithms on: a CRAY Y-MP supercomputer with 8 processors, a Sequent
Symmetry S81 with 21 processors and the Connection Machine CM-2 with 32K
processors. The goal is to solve problems with over 1 million variables and
500,000 constraints within acceptable solution times, using models derived from
real applications.
