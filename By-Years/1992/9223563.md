The PIs describe a program of theoretical work on processes occurring on the
surfaces of small ice particles in the atmosphere. The plan is to adapt existing
models of crystal growth with and without impurities to the cases of atmospheric
interest. Focus will be on the effects of foreign gases and impurities, surface
heating and surface melting on the growth and evaporation rates of ice
particles. The work will be carried out in close cooperation with two groups
engaged in relevant laboratory experiments and one group making field
measurements, and will build on theoretical work already underway in the PI's
group.
