The primary goal of this research is to investigate resource management and
traffic-related issues that will enable efficient transport of compressed video
streams over an ATM network. These issues include the determination of network
resources to be allocated for a given traffic stream, the prioritization of
compressed video streams, the design and management of scheduling techniques
that the network can implement to provide differential service to various
priority levels, and the effect of resource sharing on the effective bandwidth
and buffer size allocated to a stream. In order to study the aforementioned
issues, an accurate characterization of compressed video traffic is required.
Accordingly, we will first capture, digitize, and compress (via compression
standards) several video streams (e.g., movies), whereby the picture dynamics
(in terms of scene changes, panning, zooming) varies from one movie to another.
These captured traces will be used to develop traffic models for single and
aggregate (statistically multiplexed) compressed video streams. The traffic
models developed will extend beyond the entry node of an ATM network to include
compressed streams at intermediate nodes inside the ATM network. Performance
studies (queueing-based) will be done of interfering traffic mixed with
compressed streams (MPEG-2). The ATM testbed at Michigan State University will
be used for the proposed research. Refer to our URL address
