The purpose of the subject proposal is to provide travel funds to assist in the
payment of travel expenses for 16 U.S. researchers to attend the International
Solid State Sensors and Actuators Conference in Tokyo, Japan, from June 2
through June 5, 1987. The researchers to be funded will be chosen by a committee
chaired by the P.I. based on a priority system given in the proposal. Funding is
also sought from other Federal agencies, to provide for a total of approximately
50 U.S. participants.
