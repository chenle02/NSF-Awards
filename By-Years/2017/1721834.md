The Computer Science for All: Researcher-Practitioner Partnerships program aims
to provide all U.S. students the opportunity to participate in computer science
(CS) and computational thinking (CT) education in their schools at the K-12
levels. This program focuses on researcher-practitioner partnerships (RPPs) that
foster the research and development needed to bring CS/CT to all schools. To
enhance the strength of researcher-practitioner partnerships, the project will
host a workshop that brings together teams of educational researchers, computer
scientists, and school and district based educators to build strong partnerships
that can advance the knowledge base while addressing problems of practice that
will expand CS/CT education for all students in
schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Working in collaboration with the
Research+Practice Collaboratory, the project will host a workshop on January
9-10, 2017 at Spelman College, a top Historically Black College for women. The
focus of the workshop is to provide teams of 3-5 participants with a grounding
in the design and execution of RPPs. Given the need to broaden participation in
CS to underrepresented groups including women, this project will support teams
to attend the workshop to expand opportunities for diverse groups to participate
in Computer Science for All.
