This research will study the movement to abolish the death penalty in the
United States. The award is made to an investigator at an undergraduate
institution (RUI award). The project will trace the activities of selected anti-
death penalty movement organizations from 1972 to the present. The study will
examine how the organizations' ability to mobilize and recruit members depend on
their organizational infrastructure, on the resources they are able to marshall,
and on the political climate. The investigator will examine organizational
records, and perform interviews with members active in the organizations. This
research will make an important contribution to the study of social movements.
It will also provide important insights into the organizational strategies and
dilemmas the anti-death penalty organizations have developed in response to
widespread hostility to their cause and difficulties in maintaining the
commitment of their members.
