In this investigation an attempt at providing basic data on the behavior of
joints of realistic size under simulated cyclic loading is made. Nine tests on
full- and three-quarter size specimens, supplemented with three one-half size
specimens, will be performed. The selected member sizes provide a wide spectrum
of section geometries including those on which no previous U.S. work is
reported. In seven of the proposed tests, the thickness of the column flanges
and its effect on the panel zone doubler and continuity plates will be studied.
Two tests will be conducted on beam-to-column web connections, the capacity of
which is poorly defined. Three experiments on various length beam links
connected to column webs for eccentrically braced frames will also be carried
out. The experimental work will be accomplished by analysis with the objective
of formulating design rules.
