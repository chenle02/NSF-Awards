This is a travel award for an exploratory visit to the University of Florida to
visit faculty and examine facilities, to the Basel Institute for Immunology, and
to attend the Annual Meeting of the American Ornithologists Union. Initial
contacts have been made with Dr. Edward Wakeland at Florida, Jim Kaufman at the
Basel Institute, and several of the attendees at the ornithology meeting, all of
whom have expressed an interest in serving as postdoctoral mentor. Initial
discussions of possible arrangements for a postdoctoral appointment will also be
held.
