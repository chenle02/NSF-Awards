Many search and optimization problems that occur in the real world consist of
"constraint satisfaction" tasks where we wish to simultaneously satisfy many
demands. These problems occur in scheduling, manufacturing, compilers, and many
other contexts. Many of these problems are "NP-complete," meaning that they can
probably not be solved with less than an exponential amount of computational
effort. However, this definition of computational complexity focuses on the
worst case, not on the typical cases we might find in the real world.

As a mathematical bridge between the worst case and real-world problems, we will
consider random, or average, cases of NP-complete problems. Many people have
observed that when the density of constraints passes a critical threshold, these
problems undergo a phase transition from solvability to unsolvability.
Approaches from physics have already helped us understand this transition. We
will prove rigorous upper and lower bounds on the value of this threshold,
analyze the performance of heuristics that attempt to solve these problems
quickly, and research the effectiveness of the "Replica Trick" of statistical
physics in this area.
