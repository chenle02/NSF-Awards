This Research Equipment Grant (REG) provides funding for a laser-Doppler
Anemometer (LDA) which well be employed to investigate a variety of thermal and
fluid flow problems of interest to three different faculty and a larger number
of graduate students. Among these projects is one whose objective is to examine
a particular scheme for augmentation heat transfer coefficient associated with
the active cooling of integrated circuits mounted on parallel circuit boards.
Two unrelated investigations involve fundamental fluid mechanics of rotating and
stratified fluids. A fourth investigation is concerned with eliminating the
influence of water droplets on airborne thermometry measurements through flow
field manipulation in the neighborhood of the sensor. Another study focuses on
the turbulent flow field and heat transfer behavior in counter-swirled, coaxial
jet mixing that models the flow in "can" type gas turbine engine combustors. A
final investigation seeks to extend recent progress in understanding the
influence of high rates of free stream turbulence on convective heat transfer,
by extension to internal flows.
