The main objective of this proposal is to clarify the ecological conditions in
East Africa at the time our early ancestors were evolving. Suids (pigs) are very
well represented in the fossil record of the area and are sensitive to
ecological changes. The PI will construct a temporally controlled history of
suid taxonomic diversity and relate it to ecological change. In this manner the
research may help to clarify the conditions under which our species evolved. In
addition, pigs are the only East African large-bodied, dietary generalists other
than hominids. Thirdly, the species diversity of suids and hominids are
approximately parallel over this time period. Thus the reconstruction of suid
evolution will provide information on several aspects of hominid evolution.
