The proposed research will lead to new information regarding the molecular
processes by which animals respond to environmental change. The model system
employed is the euryhaline crab, an animal capable of adjusting to broad changes
of salinity, at the same time maintaining a relatively constant salt level in
the blood. The process by which the crab regulates its blood salt includes two
transport systems at opposite ends of the cells making up the gill lining. One
system brings sodium ions into the cell from the ambient water, in exchange for
hydrogen ions, thus helping to regulate the acid-base status as well as the
ionic level of the animal. The other system pumps sodium ions from the cell into
the blood, this time in exchange for potassium or ammonium ion. A similar
mechanism operates in the mammalian kidney, retaining sodium ions while hydrogen
ions and ammonium ions are excreted. The advantage of studying the crab is that
the animal naturally experience wide fluctuations in demand on the sodium
transport systems. The approach will be to examine the molecular responses of
the crab to salinity change, including changes in the synthesis or degradation
of specific RNA and protein molecules. Both the sodium/hydrogen ion exchanger
and the sodium/potassium pump will receive detailed attention in the research
program.//
