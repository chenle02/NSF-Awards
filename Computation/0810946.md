Proposed research will improve the accuracy and efficiency of numerical
simulations in unbounded domains. Investigations in two important areas of fluid
dynamics are pursued. The first is the development of absorbing boundary
conditions based on the Perfectly Matched Layer (PML) technique for Large Eddy
Simulation (LES) of turbulent flows. Following recent successes of extending the
Perfectly Matched Layer methodology to the nonlinear Euler and Navier-Stokes
equations, further development of the PML technique for Large Eddy Simulation of
turbulent flows is proposed. Formulations of absorbing equations for LES, as
well as other turbulent flow simulation, such as the time-dependent Reynolds
Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations, are proposed. The second area of
research is the development of non-reflecting boundary conditions for numerical
schemes for the Boltzmann-BGK equation in gas kinetic theory. Proposed work will
develop, analyze and implement the absorbing boundary condition based on the
Perfectly Matched Layer methodology. Implementation and analysis of PML
absorbing boundary condition in the Lattice Boltzmann Method will also be
carried out in proposed research.

Due to the ubiquity of non-reflecting boundaries and the importance of Large
Eddy Simulation in the computational studies of complex turbulent flows,
proposed work will have a direct impact on the quality and efficiency of a broad
class of numerical simulations in computational fluid dynamics and computational
acoustics, such as in the reduction of airframe and jet noises, in studies of
turbulent combustion in reactive flows, and in numerical models for weather
predictions. The PML for the Boltzmann-BGK equation developed in proposed
research is applicable to a diverse field of scientific investigations that
employ the kinetic theory, such as multiphase and multi-component flows,
microfluidics in nanotechnologies, particle suspensions and microflows in micro-
electro-mechanical systems (MEMS).
