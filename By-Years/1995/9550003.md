HRD-9550003 *BOWEN* The University of Washington was awarded a three-year grant
in 1992 from the National Science Foundation to undertake activities to recruit
and retain students with disabilities in science, engineering, and mathematics
(SEM) programs. The project is called DO-IT (Disabilities, Opportunities,
Internetworking, and Technology). DO-IT has helped high school students with
disabilities realize their academic and career potential, and transition to
college studies in SEM; SEM faculty have become more receptive and capable of
including students with disabilities in their courses; and parents, service
providers, and the public have become more aware of the potential contributions
and special needs in SEM fields of individuals with disabilities. Specific DO-IT
activities proposed for continuation include: (1) summer study programs which
allow high school students with disabilities to explore SEM fields and learn
college transition skills and strategies; (2) a mentoring program that matches
high school students with disabilities with successful role models in SEM
academic programs and careers; (3) Internet access for communication and
information retrieval; (4) disability awareness presentations to faculty; (5)
transition and adaptive technology workshops; and (6) dissemination of program
and disability- related information through electronic resources, printed
materials, and videotapes. DO-IT efforts are proposed to be extended to: (1)
make undergraduate campus SEM programs more accessible to individuals with
disabilities; (2) help students with disabilities successfully complete college;
(3) help students transition to employment and graduate studies; (4) increase
outreach efforts to students with disabilities; (5) identify factors leading to
college completion and employment in SEM; and (6) increase dissemination
activities.
