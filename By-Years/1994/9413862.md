9413862 Shridhar The research instrumentation along with the existing facility
will support both basic and applied research in three-dimensional computer
vision, pattern recognition, dynamic scene analysis, machine vision, intelligent
systems, and parallel architecture for real-time implementation. Specifically,
the research activities that will benefit from the acquired instrumentation
include parallel processing for machine vision applications involving 3-d image
processing, handwritten address recognition on mail pieces, document analysis
and interpretation, 3-d image segmentation, medical image analysis, glass
inspection, analysis of shattered glass for automotive applications, design of
image processing hardware for morphological processing, lanes/road/automobile
detection in visual/infra-red/millimeter wave images and compression of digital
images and videos. The instrumentation requested in this proposal falls into two
categories, namely, those pertaining to image data acquisition and display, and
those pertaining to computing. The image equipment consists of a video camera,
digitizer, frame grabber, and recording media. The computing equipment consists
of high performance workstations. ***
