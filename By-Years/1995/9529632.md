9529632 Niiler Mean fields, seasonal cycles, eddy variances will be computed
from over ten years of satellite-tracked drifter tracks for the Pacific Ocean.
These Lagrangian drifters were deployed as part of the WOCE/TOGA Surface
Velocity Program. Of special interest are the general circulation and
variability of the subtropical gyres, the western boundary current and the
relationship of time variable surface circulation to time variable winds.
Comparisons of the drifter data with ocean circulation model output, the high
density XBT sections and satellite altimetry will be conducted.
