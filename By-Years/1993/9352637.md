Modern equipment will substantially enhance the nature of undergraduate
Astronomy observing labs at the introductory level. It is absolutely vital to
update antiquated equipment so that Astronomy is not perceived as an old, drab
science without innovation. The project centers on student use of modern light
detectors (CCDs) and image processing techniques which closely match what the
professional does. Much of the thrill, motivation and excitement of science
comes from discovery. A variety of observational exercises, using this modern
equipment, are oriented towards projects which emphasize the discovery aspects
of Astronomy. To meet these objectives, a wide field imaging system is used so
that a single CCD exposure images 1-4 square degrees of sky. With similar
systems, students are able to image a wide variety of astronomical targets.
These new labs represent an exciting addition to the traditional textbook
curriculum. Such labs should increase the scientific and computer literacy of
undergraduate and allow them to understand more effectively the coupling between
instrumentation and computers, and motivate them to pursue a career in science
by emphasizing the process of discovery and the relationship between data and
scientific model making.
