Abstract

Award: DMS-0076085 Principal Investigator: Robert Kusner

This project continues research on extremal surfaces and related geometric
variational problems, with applications to low-dimensional topology and the
natural sciences. The principal investigator will work on (1) existence and
uniqueness of surfaces minimizing the Willmore bending energy, (2) determination
of the moduli spaces of complete constant mean curvature surfaces (CMC) with
finite topology, (3) geometric analysis of brownian motion and potential theory
on properly embedded minimal surfaces with infinite topology, and (4) the
existence and geometry of energy-minimizing knots and links. In addition, the
principal investigator will work at GANG with senior scientist N. Schmitt on the
approach to constructing CMC surfaces using monodromy of flat (loop)
SU(2)-bundles over a Riemann surface; this will include an experimental aspect
(computation and visualization of families of examples), as well as a
theoretical aspect (relationship between integrable systems and the functional/
geometric analysis methods).

While the motivation for most of this work is primarily aesthetic, it should be
noted that minimal, CMC and Willmore surfaces arise in physical situations as
interfaces between fluids, and thus their geometry may have some value in
predicting the behaviors of certain natural and synthetic materials. For
example, vast resources are wasted when automatic soldering of electronic
microcomponents results in short- or open-circuits: some of the principal
investigator's work on CMC surfaces has direct application to this problem; he
has freely shared his ideas (at NIST and elsewhere) with people trying to solve
it. The principal investigator's recent work on ropelength of knots and links
(some published in the general science journal, Nature) represents the first
careful effort to mathematically investigate -- and, in certain instances,
correct -- claims in the literature about the geometry of long polymeric chains
(such as DNA); he is actively collaborating with natural scientists around the
world on this topic. Schmitt's visualization work on new CMC surfaces has been
documented in the recent GANG film "Surfaces, Flows & Holonomy," scenes of which
are available at www.gang.umass.edu. This award is cofunded by the program in
Computational Mathematics.
