9503610 Zhu This proposal supports the collaboration of Dr. Da-Ming Zhu,
Department of Physics, University of Missouri at Kansas City and Dr. Hiroshi
Kawazoe of the Research Laboratory of Engineering Materials of the Tokyo
Institute of Technology. Project funding will enable Dr. Zhu to spend three
months in Japan, resident at the Tokyo Institute of Technology, in order to
participate in on-going research projects on ionic glasses, and learn the
techniques and methods used in synthesizing advanced materials in Dr. Kawazoe's
group. This proposal brings together research scientists from two countries
working in the area of condensed matter physics and materials research. The U.
S. scientist will have the opportunity to become familiar with research
techniques, data, equipment, and facilities at the Tokyo Institute of Technology
while contributing to the overall research effort. Therefore, this proposal
fulfills the objectives of the Program in its exchange and transfer of
scientific knowledge through an international collaboration. ***
