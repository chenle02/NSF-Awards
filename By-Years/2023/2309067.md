A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the
science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and
research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the
Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the discipline-based research and STEM
curricular offerings at these institutions expands the opportunities of their
students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for
research studies in areas that may be culturally significant, and encourages a
community and generational appreciation for science and mathematics education.
This project supports that goal by disseminating the achievements and findings
of the colleges that have been realized with federal funding, and to increase
the knowledge and understanding of tribal colleges and their role in economic
and community development for a significant portion of the Nation's Native
citizens.

Since its founding in 2015, Native Science Report has been working to build
needed awareness of STEM-related programs within TCUP institutions and the
communities they serve. Published online and available subscription-free, the
website, NSR.org, provides regularly updated news about the needs and
accomplishments of TCUP institutions, analysis of trends in STEM that affect
Native nations, and examples of exemplary student research. This project
significantly expands the work by enlarging the websiteâ€™s news reporting staff,
supporting production of broadcast quality videos about NSF-sponsored research
taking place at TCUP institutions, and providing journalism workshops and
internships for TCUP students.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
