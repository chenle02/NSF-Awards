Funds are requested for a tissue culture sterilizer. This instrument will be
used for sterilization of a variety of materials used in daily cell culture
work. This instrument will support research in molecular mechanics of eukaryotic
organisms, ontogeny of immune responsiveness, the development of capillaries,
and the interaction of growing axons with their target tissue.
