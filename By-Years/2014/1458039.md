Recognizing that the neurosciences are a vibrant and dynamic area of research,
with implications for biology, STEM education, behavioral and cognitive science,
engineering, computer science, medicine, and understanding of the human
condition, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) established in 2006 a Forum on the
Neuroscience and Nervous System Disorders. With funding from the National
Science Foundation, the Forum brings together leaders from private sector,
sponsors of basic, biomedical and clinical research, federal agencies,
foundations, the academic community, and consumers. Through its regular meetings
and public workshops, the Forum provides a venue where its members, other
leaders from the neurosciences and related disciplines, and members of the
public can have important discussions about issues of mutual interest. The Forum
has undertaken a broad set of initiatives, including meetings on data sharing,
the BRAIN initiative, and neuroscience workforce development. The Forum on
Neuroscience and Nervous System Disorders focuses on building partnerships and
enabling interdisciplinary large-scale research between the basic and applied
sciences, which will be necessary to understand the brain and nervous system.
