The long-term objective of this research program, which has remained the same
over the years, is to develop a systemically collected body of phase equilibrium
data that imposes progressively tighter constraints on the origin of basalt and
the formation of the earth's crust from the mantle. In order to generalize
results and to develop a more comprehensive body of data in an important
pressure range, it is proposed to determine, using a piston-cylinder apparatus,
the phase relationships at 15, 25, and 30 kbar and the effect of Na2O on melting
relationships. The data would provide new constraints on (1) the origin of
primary mid-ocean ridge basalts, (2) the composition, depth of generation, and
percent melting of primary tholeiitic magmas in the Hawaiian Islands, and (3)
the origin of high-alumina basalts in subduction zones. In addition, it is
proposed to study melting relations in the system Mg2SiO4-SiO2 up to pressures
of 250 kbar using an MA-8 apparatus at the University of Alberta. This study
would bear on very high pressure magmatic processes in the early history of the
earth.
