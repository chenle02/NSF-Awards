Title: Advances in Numerical Magnetohydrodynamics - Novel Schemes and Adaptive
Mesh Refinement on Structured Meshes

The recent literature has seen an explosion of interest in the field of
numerical magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). This stems from the fact that robust total
variation diminishing (TVD) schemes have been formulated and adaptive mesh
refinement (AMR) techniques have been designed. The MHD equations evolve the
magnetic field in divergence-free fashion and this divergence-free evolution is
essential for physically consistent computation of the MHD system. The ideal MHD
schemes that have been formulated have second order accuracy. In this project we
focus on the formulation of second order accurate methods for resistive MHD on
AMR meshes. The work will rely on the use of Krylov subspace techniques.

The equations of resistive magnetohydrodynamics are used in various settings in
physics, astrophysics and engineering. They are useful for advanced methods for
rocket propulsion as well as in nuclear fusion-based power generation. As a
result, being able to understand how to solve these equations will help society
because it will help us make progress on those very useful applications. In
several of these societally useful applications, interest often focuses on
solving these problems on an adaptive mesh in order to efficiently resolve
solutions. As a result, we will focus on formulating second order accurate
techniques for resistive adaptive mesh refinement magnetohydrodynamics in this
work. Date: June 24, 2002
