This project will study evolutionary responses to extreme weather events and
increase our understanding of how genetics influences a populationâ€™s response to
selection. We know that extreme weather events such as hurricanes can have long-
lasting, evolutionary effects on wild populations. However, no information
exists about how genomic factors that might facilitate or impede that
evolution.The project will focus on brown anoles (Anolis sagrei), a widespread
invasive lizard in Florida that is native to Cuba. It will compare populations
sampled in 2018 to those same populations following Hurricane Ian. Information
on evolutionary responses (or lack thereof) to increasingly intense and frequent
catastrophic weather will be a key component of our understanding of the
response of wild populations to global change. The project will also train
graduate and undergraduate students in field methods, as well as morphological
and genomic and data analyses.

Prior work consisted of high-quality genomic, habitat use, and morphological
data from brown anoles. Sampling covered 30 populations distributed along the
latitudinal extent of Florida and into southern Georgia. Guided by previous
research, it is hypothesized that the strength of selection will be correlated
with wind speeds, such that stronger winds will favor longer limbs. In addition,
the evolutionary response to limb-length selection will be strongly affected by
an interaction between a large-effect limb-length locus and the genomic
background of brown anole populations. Specifically, there will be a weaker
evolutionary response to hurricane-mediated selection on limb length in
populations with extensive hybrid ancestry. Previous research found epistatic
interactions between an otherwise large-effect locus for limb length and the
genomic background for hybrid populations. Because these genomic backgrounds
vary across Florida, these effects should vary geographically.
