The PI proposes to evaluate the possibility of gene targeting in somatic plant
cells. The experiment involves first the introduction of a mutant selectable
marker gene and the establishment of a set of stable transformants. These mutant
lines will then be secondarily transformed with a complimentary mutant in the
same selectable marker gene. At this time selection will be imposed so as to
identify transformed cells in which there has been site specific recombination
between these complimentary mutants thereby reconstructing a functional
selectable marker gene. The molecular details of this event will be examined.
This technology could allow for gene replacement or inactivation in plant cells
and targeting of sequentially introduced traits to a single locus to expedite
plant variety improvement.
