9410967 Weggel The Department of Civil & Architectural Engineering at Drexel
University will purchase a water-wave generation/data acquisition system which
will be dedicated to support research in coastal engineering. The equipment will
be used for basic coastal engineering research on waves, coastal processes and
coastal structures in Drexel's existing 2-D wave flume. Initially, the research
will focus on studies of cross-shore sand transport under beach-building waves
and on the onshore transport of nearshore bars such as might be constructed as
beach nourishment by bottom dump dredges. This research is important for the
economic design of beach nourishment projects and for the evaluation of their
performance. Subsequent studies will address the functional performance of
coastal structures including the sand-structure interaction of perched beach
structures (nearshore sills) and seawalls. Sand transport through rubble-mound
structures by wave agitation and the presence of a sand level gradient across
the structure will also be investigated. The wave generation system will include
active wave absorption to reduce the re-reflection of waves from the generator
paddle so that 2-D studies of beach profile evolution in the presence of
structures can be conducted. ***
