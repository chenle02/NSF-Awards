Ferland, Gary 96-17083 Dr. Ferland will continue to improve the large- scale
code called Cloudy, which computes the spectrum of gas in photoionization or
collisional balance, and will apply it to a number of problems in nebular
astrophysics. Cloudy requires updates which reflect advances in the atomic data
base which it uses and improvements in the numerical and computational methods
used in the simulation. The code will be tested on ablating molecular clouds,
the likely origin of some gas in quasars. For quasar studies the first step is
to deduce the composition of their emitting gas from the spectrum, then to
determine the dependencies of this spectrum on the shape of the ionizing
continuum and to correlate this with observed changes in the spectral energy
distribution.
