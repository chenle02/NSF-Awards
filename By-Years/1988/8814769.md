As part of the Foundation's Global Geosciences Intiative, Global Ecosystems
Dynamics seeks to understand inter relationships between the physical and
biological processing governing atmospheric composition, climate, and elemental
circulation that have structuring effects on the biosphere. Ecosystems in
aquatic and terrestrial systems may respond tophysical forcing in drastically
different ways, converesly, responses in different systems may have substantial
commonalities. To date, terrestrial and marine sectors have, for the most part,
been considered separately, therefore similarities and differences are only
conjectural. This workshop is supported by the Divisions of Ocean Sciences and
Biotic Systems and Resources to considerbtheoretical and practical integration
of ecosystems studies at local to global scales in terrestrial, freshwater and
marine systrms.
