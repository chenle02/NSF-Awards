Equipment will be purchased for field and laboratory experiences in the survey
of aquatic ecosystems, environmental monitoring, study of mechanisms of sulfur
dioxide damage to plants, nutrient limitation, non-living organic matter
contributions to aquatic food webs, and predator/prey interactions in aquatic
systems. Funds will be used to purchase a boat and motor, HACH portable
laboratories, air pollution monitoring systems, a microscope and
photomicrographic system, a spectrophotometer, computer and software to
interface the system. The equipment will be used to introduce freshman non-
majors to aquatic field studies, to enhance field and laboratory offerings in
ecology, and to introduce a new course in environmental science. It will also be
used for students in individual research projects. The curriculum will be
enhanced by emphasizing analytical methods and synthetic approaches to field and
laboratory exercises, as well as creating additional opportunities for student
research. The college will provide 50% matching funds.
