This research focuses on the problem of succinctly storing shortest, or near-
shortest, path routing information in a distributed network which experiences
changes in topology and edge costs. The emphasis is on both identifying such
routing schemes and efficient algorithms for constructing them. Three
interrelated problems are investigated: 1. Design of compact routing schemes
that incrementally adapt to changes by computing a small amount of additional
information, which is then used to restore good routings. 2. Design of compact
schemes that route messages along two or more node-disjoint paths of low total
cost, thus making the routings resilient to faults. 3. Investigation of an
interval property of graphs that allows very succinct encoding of shortest
paths. This finds application in the updating of routing information when edge
costs change. The techniques used will be based, in part, on naming nodes
appropriately and on interesting properties of distances in graphs. Thus, in
addition to yielding space-efficient routing schemes, this research will also
provide new insights into the succinct encoding of information within node names
and on the structure of shortest paths.
