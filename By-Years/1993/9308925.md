9308925 DeBrunner The goal of this project is to investigate the use of multiple
bases representations of digitized speech signals to improve the performance of
speech enhancement and speech syntheses systems. In the past it has been shown
that the use of several basis sets simultaneously provides better energy packing
than a single basis set for speech compression systems. This research will
determine the quality of reconstructed speech using multiple bases
decompositions with the overall objective of improving the performance of
digital hearing aids. The proposed technique will be compared to sinusoidal
model based algorithms and traditional noise suppression and cancellation
techniques. This research is important since it has the potential to advance the
fields of speech enhancement, speech synthesis and speech recognition as well as
provide useful results that could be used to design new digital hearing aids.
