This project is supporting up to seventy-five S-STEM scholars in biotechnology
and bioengineering over the five-year period of funding. Student support
services include tutoring, career development, and strong academic advising. The
Bioengineering and Biotechnology Career (BCC) Program is preparing students by
developing analytical, computational, and communication skills. The BCC Program
is partnering with Brooklyn College (BC) and Stony Brook University (SBU) in
creating a seamless path to a baccalaureate degree for community college
students. Upon completion of an Associate's degree, students are encouraged to
transfer to an appropriate baccalaureate degree program at BC or SBU. This
program also plays an essential role in developing the workforce pipeline for
the biotechnology industry. The participating faculty are disseminating the
success of the scholarship program via an annual educational conference at KCC
and by presenting project results at other educational conferences.
