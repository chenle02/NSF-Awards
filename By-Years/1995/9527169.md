9527169 Keyes This project will develop public use software to implement two
important paradigms for domain decomposition: medium-grained data decomposition
and course-grained task decomposition. In addition, it will enhance the theory
of task decomposition with respect to two specific applications involving
multiple physics, aerodynamics and physics. It will attempt to verify the theory
behind the two paradigms, and the develop software which combines the strength
of both. Effective multi-domain parallel solutions to multi-model coupled field
problems will have widespread usefulness, particularly in light of the growing
emphasis on multidisciplinary analysis and optimization. The current pioneers of
multidisciplinary optimization are finding it necessary to revisit the lower
levels of the constituent modeling hierarchies. It is not practical to
simultaneously upgrade all of the low-level models employed inside of
optimization loops to the complex models used in the state-of -the-art of the
individual disciplines, for reasons of complexity and severe ill-conditioning.
This creates an obvious niche for the deliverables of this proposal - highly
performant solvers with built-in support for multi-model analysis.
