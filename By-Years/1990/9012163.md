In accordance with the Agreement on Scientific Cooperation Between the National
Academy of Sciences and the Academy of Sciences of the USSR, the NAS plans to
hold a bilateral workshop on "Photosynthesis and Related Processes and their
Relationship to Plant Productivity" in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, from September
15-20, 1990. Biochemists, organic chemists, and physicists who have dealt with
photosynthesis and chemical reactions have made major contributions. Trained in
the physical sciences, these students of photosynthesis have studied reactions
in chlorophyllous cells, although they have neglected some of the biological
aspects. Meanwhile, plant scientists, particularly physiologists, agronomists,
and geneticists, have increased their interest in enhancing plant productivity
by optimizing photosynthetic activity. The themes and the composition of both
the Soviet and the American delegations represent a mix consistent with the
historical development of the workshop topic.//
