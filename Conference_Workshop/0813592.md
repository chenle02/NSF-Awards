This award supports the Workshop on Multidimensional Localized Structures, held
18-19 July 2008 in Rome, Italy, to prepare junior researchers for participation
in the Conference on Nonlinear Waves and Coherent Structures, held 21-24 July
2008 in the same location by the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.
The workshop consists of lecture series by four leading senior researchers in
the topical areas of the conference. The series of introductory expository talks
are designed for advanced graduate students and postdocs. The award supports
travel for the junior participants.

Pre-conference, introductory workshops of this kind are exceptionally effective
vehicles for quickly introducing junior researchers to the technicalities of
fields to be discussed at the conference. Participation in such a workshop gives
the participants an unparalleled opportunity for efficient entry into research
in the area and for developing connections with each other and with senior
leaders in the field.
