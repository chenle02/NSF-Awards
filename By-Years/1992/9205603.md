The PI will continue exploration of field behavior as recorded in Matuyama-aged
volcanics from the Hawaii, Society Island and Reunion hotspots and others
currently under investigation. In various stages of completion are studies of
six transition zones corresponding to events which bound the Olduvai and Reunion
subchrons recorded on the islands of Molokai, Moorea and Reunion. For each
investigation, he will conduct complete-vector studies utilizing, in particular
new-refined multi-specimen approach to absolute paleointensity. In order to
ascertain with certainty the actual reversals involved,m he will also obtain
radiometric ages for each thus far undated section.
