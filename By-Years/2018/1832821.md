The 17th Workshop on the Economics of Information Security (WEIS) will be held
at the University of Innsbruck, on June 18-19, 2018. WEIS is an annual event
which acts as a leading forum for interdisciplinary scholarship on information
security, combining expertise from the fields of computer science and electrical
engineering, economics, social science, business, law, and policy. The event
will feature keynotes from experts in privacy and security research, as well as
speakers with research experience in interdisciplinary topics of interest to
WEIS (e.g., behavioral economics and cognitive science). This award supports
graduate and undergraduate students (who are US citizens or based at US
Universities) to travel to the conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
