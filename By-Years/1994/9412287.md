The PI proposes a three-year effort for a theoretical investigation of the
nonlinear electrodynamic coupling to the mesosphere and the lower ionosphere of
intense short duration electromagnetic pulses originating in lightning
discharges. He will develop a three- dimensional model describing the changes in
the electron density, chemistry, and optical emissions in the D region
stimulated by electromagnetic energy released in tropospheric lightning
discharges. Expected results include (1) determination of the 3-D configurations
of the disturbed ionospheric regions within which significant changes occur in
temperature, airglow, electron density, and chemical processes; (2)
determination of the fraction of electromagnetic energy from lightning deposited
in the lower ionosphere and the dominant sinks of such energy; (3) determination
of the dependence of the resulting disturbances on the type of lightning
discharges; (4) development of the theoretiaal framework upon which
spectroscopic measurements of the airglow enhancements can be based to remotely
diagnose the ambient electron density profiles; and (5) assessment of the
effects of the lightning electromagnetic pulses on the thermal and chemical
balance of the upper atmosphere on a global scale.
