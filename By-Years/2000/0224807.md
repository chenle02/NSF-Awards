This project is an analysis of the separate contributions of greenhouse gases
and tropospheric aerosols to the surface energy budget, including feedbacks
associated with the hydrological cycle. The raw materials for the project are
data on surface radiation and weather parameters from global and regional
observing stations. The data will be used to test some of the current ideas
about the positive and negative feedbacks associated with aerosols and changes
in aerosol deposition rates. This work will be a step in the complicated but
very important problem of determining the role aerosols play in climate, one of
the major sources of uncertainty in the assessment of anthropogenic trends in
climate variations.
