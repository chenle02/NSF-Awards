During this proof-of-concept project, an extensive survey of the diversity of
terrestrial nematodes at two shortgrass steppe sites will be conducted, in order
to assess whether it is worthwhile to conduct additional surveys of the same
type in additional sites and habitats. Even though nematodes are known to be
very important players in soil ecosystems, free-living soil nematodes from the
shortgrass steppe are poorly known taxonomically. A taxonomic baseline will be
established for these organisms, which will contribute to a better understanding
of soil nematode communities and the role played by nematodes in ecosystem
function. The shortgrasse steppe habitat was chosen for this initial project
because it is likely to be affected by global climate change, and the two sites
(Central Plains Experimental Range LTER and the Sevilleta LTER) were chosen
because they have similar plant communities despite differences in annual
rainfall. The results of this survey will therefore provide results that can be
compared within the project itself as well as externally to results from other
nematode surveys from other sorts of habitats. The databased results of the
survey will be made available via the Internet from the LTER network server or
another suitable server, and will for the first time bridge the gap between the
taxonomy and ecology of soil nematodes in the shortgrass steppe biome. f8 Û-ª þ
