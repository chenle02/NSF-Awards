The focus of this research is to prepare phenylenes, compounds that have unique
electronic properties due to the position of fused cyclobutadienes alternate
with benzene rings. Also, new alkene and alkyne substrates will be subjected to
cobalt-mediated [2+2+2] cycloadditions, including alkynylboranes and
heteroaromatics systems. To test the validity of the approach, the challenging
natural product morphine and the core of aspidospermidine, both systems having
known or potential physiological activity will be targeted for total synthesis

With this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is
supporting the research and educational activities of Dr. Peter C. Vollhardt in
the Department of Chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley. Professor
Vollhardt will focus his work on developing methods for the construction of
novel aromatic molecules. The project will produce a new class of conjugated
benzenoid hydrocarbons termed the phenylenes and will focus on the development
of methodology for the synthesis of natural products. Broader impacts are strong
in the area of training undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctorals.
