959623279 Caudill/Bryan This research project concerns the study of inverse
problems which arise in using thermal methods for the nondestructive evaluation
of materials. The focus is to investigate the mathematics involved in the use of
techniques for imaging inaccessible portions of some object, e.g., an
inaccessible part of the boundary, or the interior of the object. Such inverse
problems arise when one uses thermal methods for corrosion detection. The
program includes the study of uniqueness and continuous dependence questions,
and explores the nature of the dependence of solutions on relevant model
parameters. The results of this analysis serve as a foundation for designing
inversion algorithms which are both theoretically sound and computationally
efficient and reliable. The investigators also consider other thermal imaging
problems, including the location of interior cracks, delaminations, or voids.
%%% Inverse problems arise naturally when one mathematically models physical
systems. Such systems almost always have certain unknown properties which one
cannot easily measure directly. Instead, one gathers more readily available
information and uses mathematical analysis to infer something about the unknown
quantities. For example, by measuring the energy of an x-ray beam passed through
a human body one can create images of the interior of the body, a process known
as a CAT scan. Other important examples of inverse problems are medical imaging
using MRI and PET scans, acoustic sonograms, and non-destructive evaluation of
metal parts using electromagnetic methods, e.g., eddy currents. This project
concerns the investigation of inverse problems which arise when one uses thermal
methods to detect the presence and extent of corrosion in the interior of
material objects such as aircraft wings and fuselages. ***
