This collaborative grant workshop lays a foundation for building joint US-
Hungarian research projects. The proposed set of activities is an outgrowth of
ongoing discussions between NSF program managers and Hungarian Research
Scientists visiting NSF in the Fall of 2002. These discussions culminated in
Hungarian researchers attending and participating in the annual meeting of
digital government PI's and their government agency partners in May 2003
(dgo2003). Two US researchers who organized an International Digital Government
Research Collaborations panel at dgo2003, in discussion with the Hungarian
participants, accepted an invitation by the Hungarians to organize a small group
of US researchers to meet in Hungary later in the year. This is a natural step
that enables collaborations within the following domains:

1. E-government research 2. Information society technologies 3. Information
society studies, social informatics, research on information issues
