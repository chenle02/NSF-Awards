Spectroscopic studies of negative molecular ions will be performed using a
coaxial ion beam/laser beam apparatus. Laser- induced transitions produce
excited states of the ion, which then autodetaches or dissociates, producing a
fast (keV) neutral. The vibrational-retational spectrum of negative ions can be
measured with sub-Doppler resolution. It is intended to explore in particular
negative cluster ions. In addition to obtaining structural information about the
ions, it is intended to probe unstable negative ion states.
