9410194 Holmstrom This project covers three related topics in the economic
theory of organization: the design of incentive systems when account is taken of
the wide range of tasks and activities that employees may engage in; financial
intermediation; and a theory of trust in face-to-face economic exchange. The
first part explores the use of implicit incentives and their interaction with
explicit incentives; the optimal design of jobs and job related constraints with
an eye on the current trend towards increased worker empowerment and less
bureaucracy; and the optimal allocation of activities across firms, with the
goal of explaining where boundaries between firms are drawn. The second why
firms use different sources of financing, what factors influence their relative
roles and how severe financial crises affect real investment and the choice
between funding options. Third part explores why verbal promises are useful in
economic exchange. It is well known that most contracts are not enforced in
court but depend on honoring one's word. Will contracts be simpler or modified
in other ways when they rely on promises?
