DMS-0308331 James S. Marron High dimension - low sample size statistical
analysis

Abstract

Research is proposed in the areas of medical image analysis and the gene
expression micro-array analysis. These seemingly divergent fields have a common
structure. The over-arching abstraction that contains them both is "High
Dimension - Low Sample Size" (HDLSS). HDLSS data are completely outside of the
domain of classical statistical multivariate analysis, because the critical
first step of "sphering the data" can no longer be performed. This motivates the
development of a very large new toolbox of statistical methods, which will be
useful in fields far beyond those motivating this research. An important part of
the proposed analytical work is the development of a completely new type of
asymptotic analysis, where the sample size is fixed, and the dimension tends to
infinity.

The proposed research will be on the development and assessment of new data
analytical methods. These will provide critical statistical infrastructure for
the large teams of people that are tackling current major challenges in the
field of medicine. The first challenge is the ongoing war on cancer. The second
challenge is to make the rapidly developing breakthroughs in medical imaging
technology much more useful to practicing medical professionals. Both areas will
be substantially benefited by the creative new methods of statistical analysis
that will be developed during the course of this research.
