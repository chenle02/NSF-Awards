Laboratory instruction for chemistry students will be improved by implementing a
gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer and the corresponding computer work-station
and software. This instrument will strengthen the chemistry curriculum through a
new laboratory course (Organic Spectroscopy Laboratory) to complement our
current lecture course "Organic Spectroscopy". It will also improve instruction
in the organic chemistry course, and it will greatly enhance the individual
study and research programs of the Department. The grantee will match the NSF
award from non-Federal sources.
