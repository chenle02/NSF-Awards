Engineering Protein-Based Logic Gates

Living cells use protein-based signal transduction circuits to decide how to
respond to environmental stimuli. In eukaryotic cells these signaling networks
are organized in a hierarchical, component-based manner -- they are assembled
from multiple interacting proteins, while individual proteins are assembled from
combinations of a finite toolkit that includes catalytic domains (e.g. kinases,
phosphates) and protein interaction domains. Current hypotheses suggests that
complex cellular circuitry may have evolved through recombination of these
protein domain components. The overall goal of this project is to exploit this
framework to engineer novel protein-based sensors, circuits, and computational
devices. The initial focus is on individual signaling proteins that function as
input/output switches, analogous to the fundamental logic gates used to build
complex electronic circuits. The proteins often have an output activity that is
only triggered by a specific set of upstream inputs. Recent studies suggest that
these regulatory properties result from a relatively simple mechanism in which
the interplay of intra- and intermolecular domain interactions controls protein
conformation and therefore activity. In this project domain recombination is
being used to reprogram natural catalytic activities (e.g. acting nucleators,
kinesis, phosphates) such that they are precisely controlled by a combination of
selected molecular inputs (e.g. specific peptide ligands,
phosphorylation/dephosphorylation). Targeted switch designs include AND, NAND,
NOR, and XOR-type input/output relationships. If successful, this project will
allow for engineering of complex cell-based sensors.
