The 32nd annual meeting of the Wind River Conference on Genetic Exchange to be
held at the Wind River Ranch, Estes Park, Colorado June 5-9, 1988, is primarily
concerned with the biology and molecular biology of genetic exchange systems in
a variety of prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems, and is the major meeting
devoted to this subject area internationally. One significant feature of these
meetings is their accessibility to graduate students and post-doctoral
candidates, whose travel funds frequently are limited. Specifically to address
this problem, funds will be used to provide travel and support scholarships to
facilitate the attendance of graduate students and post-doctoral candidates
working in various areas of genetic exchange and related subject areas.
