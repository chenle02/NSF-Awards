This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will use a novel
high throughput platform comprising of many, small gene arrays, contained within
the wells of microtiter plates. This platform, termed Multi-Array Plate
Screening (MAPS), allows simultaneous testing of the expression of a specific
group of genes of interest and appropriate controls using RNA derived from 96
separate samples, within each well of a 96-well plate. MAPS provides the
endpoint assay for a high throughput screen, in which investigators can evaluate
how different chemical compounds, applied to cells, tissues, or organisms in
vivo, affect the expression pattern for the genes of interest.

This technology will address an unmet need of the agricultural industry to make
efficient use of novel genomics information in a manner that does not require
distribution of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in the form of transgenic
plants. The plants are grown in each well of a 96 well plate to facilitate high-
throughput screening. The platform allows facile and efficient testing of gene
targets including newly identified genes, and also provides important
information about selectivity and specificity. The commercial potential from
this project is in the agricultural market.
