The past few years have seen unprecedented growth in mobile data consumption.
Powered in large part by the rapid adoption of smart phones and tablets, the
growth in wireless data creates phenomenal challenges for the wireless industry,
which has been unable to meet the demand for rich mobile content through
cellular networks. This has led to the investigation of solutions by network
operators that aim to utilize WiFi radios present in these mobile devices to
deliver content without using the cellular radio links, also known as content-
offloading. Industry-led approaches aim to utilize WiFi infrastructure in the
form of access points to offload this content, but these have various deployment
issues. Research has lately focused on the potential of proximity-based peer
content sharing, since proximity enables low-power, high speed data exchanges
which in turn allows mobile devices to proactively share data with one another.
No large-scale study using real-world situations has established the potential
for such content-sharing to provide capacity gains, until now. This proposal
aims to conduct solid, preliminary pilot studies evaluating several of the
foundational claims in this area, specifically as to whether sufficient
potential exists in the right time, right place, and with reasonably viable
deployment scenarios. The proposed work will gather and evaluate pilot data in
both highly amenable environments (WiFi across multiple tailgate offerings of
hundreds of users) as well as more challenging environments (daily commuter
trains to / from Chicago).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the work
will be to either demonstrate the potential viability for proximity-based
solutions or to present compelling evidence that such proximity solutions are
unlikely to yield significant benefits. Further broader impacts for the work
include data sharing capabilities with respect to temporal characterizations of
redundancy across mobile devices in several real-world scenarios.
