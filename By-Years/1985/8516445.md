This action is concerned with the transfer of the project on Design Techniques
of Nonlinear Optimal Control Systems from Colorado State University to the
University of Illinois-Urbana. A nonlinear operator interpolation and smoothing
technique is adapted to steady-state system models and is applied to modeling
problems in cardiovascular and pulmonary physiology, to periodic signal
reconstruction with application to electrocardiograms, and to pharmacokinetics.
