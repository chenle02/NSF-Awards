Dr. Catherine J. Murphy, of the University of South Carolina, is supported by
the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program under a Faculty
Early Career Advancement Award for the study of uses of luminescence as a probe
of surface structure. Three areas are targeted: (1) Trisdiimine ruthenium(II)
complexes will be designed such that luminescence will be observed only when one
of the diimine ligands is of the appropriate length to fit a cavity in a large
molecule such as DNA that is formed as a result of tertiary structure. (2) The
known sensitivity of the luminescence of "quantum dots" of cadmium sulfide to
the nature and amount of surface adsorbate will be investigated as a means of
determining the nature of the interaction of DNA with these particles. It is
hypothesized that DNA that can bend will adsorb to particles that are of the
appropriate diameter and that this adsorption can be monitored by changes in the
luminescence of the particles. Distances between the ends of DNA molecules
wrapped about suitably sized particles may be further investigated by the extent
to which energy transfer between molecular tags on the two ends of the duplex
(fluorescein and rhodamine) occurs. (3) Synthesis of hollow "quantum dot"
cadmium sulfide particles will be attempted in an effort to model the
luminescence reported for porous semiconductor particles. Optical/structure
relationships for these particles will be used to develop a model for the
electronic structure of porous semiconductors. The teaching plan outlines
several ways in which materials chemistry will be introduced into the
undergraduate and graduate curricula through formal course work and through both
undergraduate and graduate research. Also detailed are plans to foster the
development of female scientists through interactions with women's organizations
on campus and in local high schools and middle schools. Luminescence is a unique
property of certain classes of molecules in whic h the absorption of light
results in emission of light, usually of a longer wavelength. The wavelength and
intensity of such luminescence is generally very sensitive to the environment
about the absorbing molecule. This research aims to utilize the luminescence of
several materials to probe the structures of their environments. These
applications may provide unique information about the structure of certain types
of DNA that is not readily determined by other techniques. The teaching program
is designed to increase the exposure of undergraduate and graduate students to
materials chemistry and to foster the development of female scientists.
