MEMS is an important research field with promise of significant applications in
a variety of areas, including healthcare, security, safety, and power
conservation. Commercial applications range from micro-accelerometers, to micro-
pumps, to million mirror projection displays, to self-discovering networks of
wireless sensors, to optical micro-scanners. NSF participation in this important
area of nanotechnology will further stimulate research and development of micro
and nano devices and have a significant impact on improving the design,
manufacture, accuracy, and utilization of these and other devices. Such
investments by NSF will ultimately have a significant and beneficial effect on
the economic health and global competitiveness of the United States.

This award is the second 5-year phase of the Industry/University Cooperative
Research Center for Micro-sensors and Actuators. In 1998, the I/UCRC Berkeley
Sensor and Actuator Center (BSAC) was extended from on-going research in this
area to research in new areas with a multi-university component at UC-Davis.
