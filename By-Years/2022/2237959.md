This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) grant will contribute to
the advancement of national health and welfare by integrating individual-level
and population-level models of infectious diseases to support data-driven
healthcare decision making. This project aims to build a unifying theory of
disease modeling to incorporate variation in human behavior that can affect
epidemic trends in disease transmission, progression, and recovery. The research
will provide insights into how these models can be used to improve both quality
and cost-effectiveness of public health services. Partnership with clinicians
and health policy makers will ensure that the models address policy concerns and
advance interdisciplinary collaboration and data sharing. The educational goals
of the project aim to advance STEM education among clinical collaborators and
students, including those from underrepresented and minority
communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research studies state space aggregation
methods to unify individual-level simulations with compartmental models for
disease modeling. The objectives are to optimize these models in single and
repeated decision contexts, and to integrate these methods in cost-effectiveness
analysis. This work is motivated by the need for tractable disease models that
incorporate behavior and population heterogeneity, which require data-driven
methods to aggregate individuals into interpretable groups while respecting the
dynamics of the underlying disease process. Understanding how simulation
outcomes can be projected to a lower-dimensional space and bridging the gap
between individual and group-level representation in modeling will allow for
these methods to better inform policy. Specifically, structural properties,
equilibria, and transition dynamics of these models will be studied with the
goal of using them to simplify optimization and Markov decision process
frameworks on disease dynamics. Innovations in this area can then be integrated
into cost-effectiveness and probabilistic sensitivity analysis to provide more
efficient and thorough evaluation of the feasible policy
space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
