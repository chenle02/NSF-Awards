Long term potentiation (LTP), a long lasting enhancement of synaptic efficacy
in the hippocampus, a brain structure, is considered a model for memory and
learning. However, the stimuli used for its induction, typically 50-400 pulses
delivered at frequencies of 100-400 Hz, are distinctly above physiological
levels. Long term potentiation (LTP) of principal cell groups of the hippocampal
formation may play an important role in learning and memory. The precise role
that LTP might fulfill is unknown, but possible models of neocortical-
hippocampal interaction are currently under consideration. Whatever the
circuitry underlying learning and memory, and whatever the role of LTP may be,
it is clearly of interest to determine the physiological conditions under which
LTP is actually induced in the normal, unanesthetized animal. Dr. Jonathan
Winson proposes here to carry out a series of experiments, first in anesthetized
and then in freely moving rats, to investigate the phenomenon that may be
present and physiologically relevant to the induction of LTP. Assuming that LTP
proves to be a physiologically relevant aspect of hippocampal function, it will
be of considerable importance to determine the conditions underlying its
induction in the normal animal. This will have a two-fold benefit. First, it
will further our understanding of the function of LTP and its possible role in
memory. Second, it will provide a knowledge of physiologically relevant stimuli
to serve as a basis for the investigation of the pre- and/or post-synaptic
mechanisms, at the cellular level, responsible for LTP. Dr. Jonathan Winson
proposes to study particular conditions by which LTP may be induced in normally
behaving rats. The proposed experiments are based on the following. 1) He has
recently shown that LTP is preferentially induced in the rat at 400 Hz compared
to lower frequencies. The same effect is achieved when lower frequency input
volleys are applied to the medial and lateral perforant pathways asynchronously
such that the composite stimulus seen by granule cell dendrite is 400 Hz. Such
asynchronous inputs may reflect the manner in which LTP is induced
physiologically. 2) In preliminary studies he has found that LTP is
preferentially induced on one phase of the theta rhythm. 3) Studies in the
hippocampal slice in other laboratories have demonstrated a "priming" effect on
the CA 1 field, i.e., bursts applied to CA 1 afferents separated by 170-200 ms,
the periodicity of theta rhythm, preferentially induced LTP. Dr. Winson proposes
to study these newly revealed phenomena in the dentate gyrus, first in
anesthetized and then in freely moving rats during several behaviors. Time
permitting, similar studies will be performed in the CA 1 field.
