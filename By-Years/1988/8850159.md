McNeese State University will offer a two-year summer Young Scholars Program in
the field of engineering for 20 academically high achieving black students who
have completed the 8th or 9th grade. The program will have three main
components: "hands-on" engineering; counseling; and class work in geometry,
trigonometry, and computer aided design. This commuter program will be held for
eight weeks during the summer in the College of Engineering and Technology.
During the "hands-on" portion, students will build a 24-foot diameter geodesic
dome. Classroom work will be directly related to the two "hands-on" projects.
Most of the instruction will be computer directed, using teaching software for
mathematics and the AutoCad program for drawing designs. Students will be drawn
from those who completed a Pre-Freshman Engineering Program (PREP) sponsored by
the U.S. Department of Energy at McNeese State during the summer of 1987. The
Young Scholars Program will function as a follow-up for the PREP program.
