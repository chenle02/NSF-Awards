The dynamic analysis of large complex structures either by direct integration or
by modal superposition is often prohibitive due to cost. Recently mixed
integration and modal synthesis techniques have been proposed to more
efficiently perform the dynamics analysis and to reduce the computational cost.
These developments are at an early stage and substantial work still to be done,
most notably in the implementation of various theoretical schemes to exploit the
vector and parallel processing capabilities of the new computer systems. This
research project deals with the implementation of finite element mesh
partitioning, the use of independent operations in each partition, and the
determination of the response of the complete structural system utilizing these
operations. Only direct integration will be employed, since these are more
readily applicable to nonlinear problems. A Newton- Jacobi mixed integration
approach will be study in detail and implemented on vector and parallel
processors.
