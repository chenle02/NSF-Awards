This project aims to reverse-engineer the human brain's ability to control the
hand. &lt;br/&gt;The project begins by combining a robotic hand previously
developed by the PI with a new type of sensitive skin, with a hundred biomimetic
tactile sensors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goal of this project is to
understand how it is possible to achieve dextrous, approximately optimal control
of a hand, performing familiar but challenging tasks in manipulating objects.
New, more advanced learning-based control algorithms will be developed and
tested on the four empirical testbeds of the project: (1) robotic manipulation
by the biomimetic hand; (2) data from recording of human hands performing the
same tasks; (3) computer simulations of physical hands; and (4) computer control
of cadaver hands via their tendons. The project will use the same algorithms
both as models of human motor control and to go beyond the present state of the
art in robotic manipulation; this unified approach to biology and engineering is
an essential part of the transformative goals of the COPN topic. Dextrous
robotic hands have a wide variety of possible applications in industry, space
and national security. Improved understanding of how humans can learn to perform
better with their hands will also have broader benefits, particularly for the
disabled. The team proposes a vigorous plan for education and outreach,
capitalizing on the human interest aspects of the demonstrations they will be
developing.
