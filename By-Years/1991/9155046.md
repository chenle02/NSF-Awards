The Colorado School of Mines will initiate a three-week, residential, "Early
Alert" Young Scholars project in Mathematics for thirty American Indian middle
school students entering grades 7 and 8. The program will be held jointly with a
Teacher Enhancement project that is sponsored with institutional funds. Emphasis
is on critical thinking, problem solving, use of similar triangles and
trigonometry to estimate heights attained by student-constructed rockets, and
use of LOGO to create American Indian designs and tessellations. Students
complete a research project with the advice of a professional mentor from AT&T
Bell Laboratories. Career exploration and higher educational goals are an
integral part of the program.
