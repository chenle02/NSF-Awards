Pseudorandom sequences (PRS) exhibit a statistical randomness and are widely
used in applications where randomness is needed and PRS generation can be
effectively done. Many everyday applications in digital computing and
communication require randomness to operate correctly. For example, these
include secure network communications, global positioning systems, and even
weather prediction simulations. Yet, few general generators of high quality
pseudorandom sequences are known. This research will develop algorithms and
software tools to make high quality usable pseudorandom sequences, particularly,
which would lead to improvements in performance and security over current
symmetric key ciphers.

This project concerns the design of high speed mechanisms for data encryption:
Feistel networks, a widely used architecture for block ciphers; Boolean
functions, building blocks for both block ciphers and stream ciphers; and
feedback-with-carry shift registers (FCSRs) and generalizations (AFSRs),
generators of sequences with many desirable properties. Many basic properties of
FCSRs have been determined and they have been used in stream ciphers and quasi-
Monte Carlo. We propose to (1) develop new designs of block ciphers with new
Feistel-like networks or time varying keys using PRS generators; (2) study
stream ciphers with FCSRs replacing LFSRs; (3) study measures of randomness of
Boolean functions; (4) further analyze AFSRs, e.g. solve the register synthesis
problem for more general AFSRs; and (5) develop efficient implementations of
sequence generators.
