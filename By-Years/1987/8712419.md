Columbia University is being supported to establish a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) SITE. The purpose of this SITE is to provide meaningful
hands-on research opportunities in contemporary chemistry for outstanding
undergraduate students under the supervision of experienced research chemists.
The Program will support 9 students for the summer of 1987, of which almost half
will be recruited from other institutions. Research activities will include the
following: o Photochemistry of Organic Molecules adsorbed on Porus Solids
oDesign and Application of Conformation and Site- specific probes of Biopolymers
o Infrared Diode Probes of Kinetic Processes o Synthesis and Properties of
Materials that Provide a Helical Conduction Path for Electrons
