Existing theories of innovative organizations have been based on the experience
of firms in developed economies. Consequently, these theories take certain
"minimal" institutional environments as given, and build their insights and
explanations upon the framework of these assumptions. Some theorists go so far
as to claim that without these pre-conditions, innovation is not possible. Thus
the institutional characteristics of developed nations are described as
necessary -- if not sufficient -- ingredients for innovation. In contrast,
evidence from high technology firms in developing countries demonstrates not
only that firms operating without such institutions can innovate, but also that
innovative organizations can thrive in environments considered hostile to
innovation and entrepreneurship.

Despite their obvious innovative accomplishments, the institutional
environments, uncertainty, and risks faced by these organizations differ greatly
from those in the developed countries. This research project will develop a
theory that explains the rise, behavior, and capability development of
innovative organizations in a particular emerging economy: China. The aim is to
build a theory useful for understanding and better predicting: i) the innovative
output of high technology organizations given their set of firm-level
capabilities and the institutional structure of their operating environment; ii)
the types of capabilities these firms are likely, and unlikely, to develop; iii)
the relationship of these capabilities to their innovative performance; and iv)
given a set of capabilities and institutions, their likely development
trajectory. The latter can be better used to aggregate from the firm level to
the national or regional level, adding to a more accurate understanding of
innovative and economic performance in emerging economies.

In addition to the intellectual contributions described above, the data and
findings from this project should be of use to managers and policy makers
seeking to ensure innovation and competitiveness in the context of rapidly
globalizing supply chains.
