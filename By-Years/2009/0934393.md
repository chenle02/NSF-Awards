PROGRAM DIRECTOR'S RECOMMENDATION&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IIP
0934393&lt;br/&gt;Mississippi State
University&lt;br/&gt;Banicescu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mississippi State University
(MSU) is planning to join the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center
(I/UCRC) entitled "Center for Autonomic Computing (CAC)" which currently is a
multi-university center comprised of the University of Florida (lead
institution), the University of Arizona and Rutgers, The State University of New
Jersey. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MSU brings to the existing CAC much needed
complementary capabilities in the areas of model-based autonomic computing, and
resource management and scheduling in parallel and distributed systems. The
proposed site will closely collaborate with the industry to identify generally
applicable approaches to IT management, based on scientific principles that
guide the selection, modification and integration of these techniques into
demonstratively efficient solutions. The activities at MSU will target the
optimization of individual or combined properties of autonomic computing-enabled
applications and systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expected outcome of the
research initiative of CAC at MSU is a set of technologies to convert a
significant number of system management tasks into systematic and semi-automated
processes, using rigorous mathematical models and proven optimization
techniques. The planned research has the potential to significantly improve the
performance and effectiveness of autonomic-computing (AC)-oriented applications
and AC-enabled systems, to reduce the operating cost of current and future
large-scale distributed systems, as well as to improve the quality of service of
the various services hosted on such systems. For broadening participation, the
PIs plan to investigate partnership opportunities with local and national
outreach programs including the Increasing Minority Access to Graduate Education
program, and the QUEST summer research program.
