*** 9623018 Finzer This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project from
Key Curriculum Press leverages recent understanding of dynamic geometry and new
power of machines to a second generation of dynamic geometry software--The
Mathematician's Sketchpad--with much greater ease of use, improved integration
with other areas of mathematics and science, and new conceptual and visual
metaphors for building dynamic mathematical models. The starting point for the
project is The Geometer's Sketchpad, one of the most highly regarded and
commercially successful software systems presently available in the United
States. From dynamic geometry mixed with symbolic algebra and graphing comes
dynamic algebra which will allow students, teachers, and authors to create
Sketchbooks based on user-specified sets of tools. This new technology combined
with classroom materials will fundamentally change how teachers and students
learn and do mathematics. The commercial success of The Geometer's Sketchpad
demonstrates the commercial potential of the Mathematician's Sketchpad. The new
program will have even more utility for the geometry classroom than the current
generation of The Geometer's Sketchpad and, if our research is successful, will
have ready application throughout the secondary and college mathematics
curriculum. The enthusiastic response of teachers to prototypes of both software
and curriculum materials produced during Phase I indicates that there will be
high level of teacher support. The curriculum materials to be developed during
the project provide another proven avenue of commercial sustainability for the
eventual products of the proposed research. ***
