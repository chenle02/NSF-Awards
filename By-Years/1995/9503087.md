9503087 Hsu This award supports collaboration between Shaw Ling Hsu, University
of Massachusetts, Amherst, and Yang Xiaozhen, Institute of Chemistry, Academia
Sinica, and Wu Dacheng, Chengdu University of Science and Technology, on
characterization of the structures and the deformation behaviors of heterophase
polymers via molecular simulation. This is an area of great interest in polymer
science, with potential applications for improved understanding of the phase
separated structures of various polyurethanes. Simulation studies will be
conducted directed toward characterization of phase separated structures
involving semi-rigid polymers used as hard segments; improved understanding of
the mechanical properties of these materials; and interpretation of factors
governing molecular miscibility. This collaborative effort will pursue a better
understanding of the properties of polyurethane and various other advanced
heterophase materials.
