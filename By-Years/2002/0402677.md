The award to the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers Foundation (SHPEF)
is to provide support for a Design Contest for SHPE Student Chapters for the
purpose of stimulating the creative intellect of the undergraduate engineering
students. The competition engenders a team environment and instills cooperation
essential in a design project. The competition challenges each student chapter
to design and make a formal presentation before a group of peers and
professionals from industry, academia and government at the Annual SHPE
conference. The competition is open to all student chapters, with preliminary
designs evaluated by professionals in the field. Those selected to continue
participation in the full competition are provided an industrial mentor and a
resource package. Ten of the final design projects are selected to attend the
SHPE Annual Meeting, where the teams make oral presentations and the top five
teams receive recognition. This activity has a broad impact upon the students,
the colleges of engineering, and industry by recognizing excellence in
educational experiences, by recognizing contributions to strengthening diversity
in engineering, by advancing higher educational goals for the students, and by
creating the interaction between the student teams and industry&lt;br/&gt;
