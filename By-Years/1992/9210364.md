This Conference on the Biology of Ultraviolet Light Reception will be held in
association with the annual meeting of the American Society of Zoologists. A
number of species, both invertebrate and vertebrate have been shown to have
photosensitivity to ultraviolet (UV) light. During the conference, leading
researchers in this area of visual science will address the way in which UV
light is received and processed, the morphology and distribution of UV-sensitive
cells and the characteristics of the photosensitive pigment in these cells, the
relationship between UV sensitivity, polarized light sensitivity and color
vision as well as the behavioral responses to UV stimuli and the ecological
significance of UV light reception. The interactions between leading researchers
in this field that occur at the conference should generate new ideas, suggest
novel lines of investigation and produce a more integrated approach to
understanding this unusual sensory capability. The published material generated
from the conference will be of interest to scientists working on a wide range of
subjects in visual neuroscience, ecology and animal behavior.
