Course offerings in the neurosciences at Williams College form the basis of an
interdisciplinary Psychobiology Program with content ranging from single cell
analysis to the neural basis of learning and memory. From this, a student-
initiated interdisciplinary major in the neurosciences has developed. As a part
of this unique major, students are required to participate in research and to
prepare an Honors thesis. The instrumentation acquired for this project
(preamplifiers, digital oscilloscopes and computerscopes) allows students to
participate in comprehensive laboratory experiences in the Psychobiology Program
and in the neuroscience major. Laboratories in intracellular recording, voltage
clamping and evoked potential recording in lower vertebrates and humans expose
students to the diverse nature of physiological recording techniques and data
analysis, providing a firm background for these students' professional careers.
