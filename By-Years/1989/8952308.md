This project integrates empirical learning modules into a select cross-section
of the economics curriculum: introductory, required, and economics elective
courses. In these modules, students perform analyses with real data and interact
with realistic economic simulations. By contrast, the standard economics
curriculum isolates empirical analysis in statistics and econometrics courses,
giving undergraduate students a mistaken sense of the practice of economics, a
discipline which relies heavily on observation and discovery. This project
promotes students' capacities to apply economic concepts in solving problems and
in evaluating economic arguments. Integration of the modules accomplishes this
goal. To enable the department to proceed with this project, a microcomputer
laboratory with attendant peripheral devices, software, and databases is being
installed. The resources of this facility are essential as current facilities
are not sufficient for these purposes. The laboratory has twenty one
microcomputers, five printers, a projection/demonstration system, and a central
processor/file server with computers linked by a local-area network (LAN). Data
and software are stored on the file server and accessed via the network. In
addition to hardware, funds are requested for econometric software, economic
databases, and economic simulation programs. The institution is matching the NSF
grant with an equal amount of funds.
