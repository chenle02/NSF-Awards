The American Mathematics Project is a three-year program designed to enhance
mathematics teacher competence by increasing substantially the number of local
Mathematics Teacher Projects (MTPs) in the United States. An MTP is a local
cooperative effort by teachers, college and university faculty, and
professionals in industry to stimulate excellence in teaching at all levels, but
especially in grades K-12. The project will first organize and conduct a
national MTP Workshop to bring together teams from 20 local areas interested in
establishing MTPs in their communities and 25 resource leaders from existing
successful MTPs. The Workshop will allow for extensive discussions between
mentors and the participant teams and help the teams formulate specific action
plans for local implementation. During the two-year period following the
Workshop, the AMP staff will maintain close ties to the 20 teams and provide
assistance to them in several ways until active MTPs have been launched. This
assistance will include a quarterly MTP Newsletter containing useful news and
information for the developing MTPs, and consultant visits to the sites of
developing MTP's. In addition, an MTP Resource Manual will be published, using
the experience of the Workshop and follow-up activities, containing a
comprehensive kit of information and guidance for emerging MTP's.
