This grant addresses making and characterizing composite materials of metal
fractal clusters that are embedded in a polymer host with the goal of
investigating the possibility of making organic materials with exceptionally
enhanced nonlinear-optical susceptibilities. Owing to the large enhancement in
the local fields within metallic fractal clusters, it is anticipated that the
nonlinear-optical response of a dye- polymer composite can be made significantly
larger in the presence of such clusters. We propose to use a standard metal
evaporation technique to form clusters with maximized local fields. Owing to a
polymer's ease of processing, we propose to make planar and polymer- optical
fiber waveguides with the most promising materials to assess the possibility of
using fractal cluster composites in all-optical waveguide devices. The expertise
for cluster formation, nonlinear- optical characterization, and fiber
fabrication is self-contained in a collaborative effort between Washington State
University and McGill University (Professor Mark Andrews, Department of
Chemistry). The proposed studies are a natural extension of work in progress at
both of these institutions. Evidence of a fractal-enhanced nonlinear-optical
response has already been reported by this collaborative effort.
