This award provides funding to renew the existing successful CISE Research
Experiences for Undergraduates Site at Virginia Tech University. The REU Site
will provide undergraduate students with immersive, high-quality learning and
interdisciplinary research experience in cognitive communications, an emerging
wireless communications technology. The students will implement their projects
on the Virginia Tech Cognitive Radio Network testbed (VT-CORNET). The students
will participate in professional development activities that make them more
aware of graduate school and professional aspects of a computing career.
&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The students will join a variety of funded research
projects ongoing at the Wireless@VT center and work with a faculty team with
outstanding experience and expertise to direct the intellectual component of
each project. Cognitive communications is an emerging and exciting field that
promises to transform the wireless communications industry. The focus will be on
topics such as spectrum management for wireless networks, public safety
interoperable radios, rural broadband access, usability and human factors
principles for cognitive engines and interface design that are important and
timely. Thus the project has the potential to contribute to the advancement of
research and discovery in an important and timely area of
computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the project include
providing a quality research experience to undergraduate students, particularly
students from underrepresented groups and from institutions with limited
research environments. Thus this project has the potential to produce new
computer science graduate students and faculty members and to advance discovery
and understanding while promoting learning.
