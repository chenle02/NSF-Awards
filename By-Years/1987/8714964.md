This award will enable Professor M.S. Dresselhaus and Dr. G.F. Dresselhaus of
MIT and Professor P.C. Eklund of the University of Kentucky to collaborate with
Professor M. Endo of Shinshu Univeristy, Dr. T. Enoki of the Institute for
Molecular Science at Okazaki, Dr. H. Touhara of Kyoto University and Professor
M. Inagaki of the Toyohashi University of Technology, Japan over a period of two
years. The physical properties and potential applications of intercalated
compounds will be studied. Structural and compositional changes of graphite
fibers and other layered materials which have been subjected to intercalation
with fluorine, fluorides, hydrogenated species, organic magnetic and
superconducting species will be characterized using electron microscopy,
calorimetry, and conductivity and magnetic measurements. An understanding of the
physical properties of graphite intercalation compounds will further the
development of new materials with interesting electrical, optical and magnetic
properties. Such compounds may have important application as conducting
materials and electrodes in batteries. Professors Endo and Dresselhaus are
leading authorities on intercalation compounds and cooperative work between
their two research groups will provide broad and complementary expertise.
