With this award, the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program
and the Chemical Structure and Dynamics-B Program of the Division of Chemistry
are funding Prof. Kevin Kittilstved of the University of Massachusetts-Amherst
to conduct fundamental research toward better understanding the properties of
nanoscale semiconductors. These are potentially useful in light-emitting devices
and display technologies. In addition, Prof. Kittilstved is developing new
partnerships with regional community colleges and strengthening existing
educational programs aiming at increasing the retention rates of
underrepresented minorities in the STEM fields. This CAREER award will provide
summer research opportunities for underrepresented rising STEM scholars from
Springfield Technical Community College and female students who participate in
the Eureka! Program of Girls Inc. of Holyoke. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The long
term goal of this research is to gain a thorough understanding of how defects
form on the surfaces of semiconductor nanocrystals. This CAREER project focuses
on elucidating the thermodynamics and kinetics of the metal ion exchange
reactions of impurities into zinc and
cadmium-(chalcogenide)-benzenechalcogenolate clusters using a range of
spectroscopic and analytical techniques. The specific objectives are: (1) to
determine the effect of targeted, substitutional chemical defects on the
formation kinetics and thermodynamics of the clusters of varying sizes; (2) to
study the electronic structure of impurity-doped clusters and related impurity-
doped colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals; and (3) to broaden the participation
and increase the retention rates of underrepresented minorities in the chemistry
and STEM undergraduate curriculum through summer research opportunities, and
increased mentoring, advising and networking.
