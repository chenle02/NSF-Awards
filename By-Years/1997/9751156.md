The project develops two new courses: Mathematical Computing I &amp; II, within
the Mathematics Department for mathematics majors and secondary education
majors. These courses teach the principles and techniques of computer
programming by using MAPLE as a programming language. The use of MAPLE affords
an easy, effective, and rich environment for learning the art of programming
without the hassle of input, output, and formatting concerns. The content of
these courses focuses on programming tasks designed to reinforce mathematical
concepts learned in previous courses (calculus, differential equations I,
discrete math, and linear algebra I) which are not part of the programming work
in senior-level courses (such as numerical analysis, differential equations II,
PDE, and advanced engineering mathematics). To make this curriculum development
successful, the project augments existing computing environment with a new
Inflatable Lab, consisting of 25 laptop computers. The physical location of this
laboratory varies throughout the day and night. During the day, the laboratory
can be scheduled and set up in any traditional classroom, connecting to the
Intranet by wireless infrared technology and serving to establish a computer
classroom for lecture, demonstration, or testing. At night, the laboratory can
be set up to function as a traditional computer laboratory used by all students.
In addition, over the weekend and during special semesters, some of the laptops
from this laboratory can be checked out for use by our commuting students and
students in the proposed new courses. *
