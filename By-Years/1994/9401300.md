9401300 Price The study consists of a series of numerical experiments to study
the broadening of outflows of dense water from marginal seas to adjacent oceans.
The method will be to run a three-dimensional ocean model and analyze the
simulated outflows that will be guided by existing observations. The model uses
the hydrostatic primitive equations, with horizontal resolution of 5 km along-
stream, and 2 km across-stream on a 60 x 100 grid (domain size is 300 by 200
km). Specific questions to be addressed are: (1) what processes set the range of
the product water T-S characteristics in a given outflow?; (2) how does the
overlying ocean circulation interact with an outflow?; and, (3) can a large
scale baroclinic instability of an outflow alter the mean T-S characteristics of
the product water? ***
