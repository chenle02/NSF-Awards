Hazardous waste management is a world wide concern. The French Ministry of
Environment is initiating an Industry/University Cooperative Research Center
with a consortium of French universities to address this area. If this Center is
successfully initiated, it represents an opportunity of complementary research
with which the New Jersey Institute of Technology's Industry/University
Cooperative Research Center for Hazardous Waste Management might interact. Such
a collaboration could occur as part of a new experimental program, International
Industry-University-Government Cooperative Research Initiative. This award funds
a case study of the French efforts to establish an Industry/University
Cooperative Research Center for Hazardous Waste Management. Upon the completion
of French activities initiating the Center, the New Jersey Institute of
Technology is to publish a report detailing the case history and its success. If
the Center is successfully formed with a significant number of companies
providing support, a second phase of the award funds a study to design an
international cooperative research program. The study will address potential
research areas and organizational ties that need to be developed to have an
International Industry-University-Government Cooperative Research Initiative.
The Principal Investigator and colleague are internationally recognized experts
and have both the industrial and international contacts necessary to perform the
studies. The Program Manager recommends the New Jersey Institute of Technology
be awarded $45,000 for a two (2) year continuing grant. The first phase is
recommended for $25,000 for one (1) year. The second phase of $20,000 for one
(1) year from the Directorate for Science, Technological and International
Affairs will be contingent upon NSF evaluation of the phase one report
indicating the success of the French Center.
