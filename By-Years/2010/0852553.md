&lt;br/&gt;CBET-0852553&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this
exploratory SGER research is to obtain preliminary experimental data to support
the hypothesis that sludge from wastewater treatment plants can be used as a
feedstock to produce biodiesel. Such a process would produce not only renewable
fuel but would also alleviate the problem of wastewater treatment plant sludge
disposition. Students will participate in the research and will present their
results at the next Mississippi State University Biofuels Conference, three of
which have been held so far. Efforts will be made to recruit students to work
during the summer from underrepresented groups
