This is an investigation of the mechanical anisotropy in hexagonal close-packed
metals deformed by multiaxial stresses. The anisotropic creep behavior, the
crystallographic textures, and correlations between texture and materials
properties will be determined, including the effects of other material variables
such as slip behavior and microstructural characteristics. These studies should
permit the development of more predictive models of micromechanisms of creep in
these anisotropic metals.
