This proposal is to support the work of the Wei Zhang who propose to work on
several projects on arithmetic algebraic geometry, in particular, automorphic
forms and Shimura varieties. In particular to prove the refined Gross-Prasad
conjecture for unitary groups in three variables using the relative trace
formulae of Jacquet-Rallis secondly to prove a Gross-Zagier type formula for
unitary Shimura varieties using the approach of the arithmetic relative trace
formulae initiated by W.Zhang recently,and thirdly to study their applications
to the Beilinson-Bloch conjecture and Bloch-Kato conjecture on the relation
between Chow groups, Selmer groups and L-values.

This proposal will provide support for a recent PhD, now a PostDoc at Harvard to
pursue research in Number Theory and Representation Theory. This research
concerns a special type of function known as an L-function which encodes
information about geometry and arithmetic.
