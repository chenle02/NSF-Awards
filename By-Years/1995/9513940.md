This grant supports research in particle physics by a faculty member and a
graduate student. Its goal is to extend analysis of data on high-energy proton-
antiproton elastic scattering and total cross sections obtained at the Fermilab
Tevatron collider. Improved values of forward-scattering amplitudes will be
obtained.
