The objective of this research proposal is to gain an insight into the
relatively unexplored area of surface waviness (or wrinkling) which can occur
during sheet metal forming, to obtain a fundamental understanding of the
influence of material parameters on those process parameters that cause surface
waviness, and to provide technical guidelines for avoiding such defects in
forming high-strength materials. The research will include: (1) Experimental
studies on rectangular and square punch stretching of peripherally clamped sheet
metals, (2) Analysis of rectangular and square punch stretching, (3) Study of
various constitutive equations and establishment of those best suited for
predicting surface waviness/wrinkling in sheet metal, (4) Experimental
determination of biaxial strength of selected materials, and (5) Establishment
of process design guidelines for forming panels without surface waviness and
testing those guidelines on an actual stamping process. Surface waviness is one
of the main types of failures in the sheet metal forming process which is a
manufacturing process employed in many industries. The proposed research should
lead to a better understanding of this failure problem and result in an
improvement in the sheet metal forming process. This research will be conducted
jointly by two universities with collaboration from a national laboratory and an
industrial company.
