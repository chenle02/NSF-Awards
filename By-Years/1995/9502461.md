The research portion of this CAREER project seeks to develop a conceptual
framework and prototypes for an organizational learning approach to software
development. The project addresses the codification of knowledge as it emerges
in development organizations. The goal is a form that can be used as the basis
for the continual improvement of software products and the development process.
A domain lifecycle methodology is being developed that shifts the focus from
individual projects to recurring design problems and solutions developed by an
organization. The research is based on empirical observations of a large
software development organization. Project goals include: (1) Creation of reuse-
based software development methodologies incorporating organizational learning
tools; (2) Development of domain knowledge from individual cases to design
guidelines to formal reasoning systems supporting domain-oriented design; (3)
Development of prototype systems using case-based technology to support
organizational learning; (4) Provision of a body of empirical results based on
studies of real world development projects and evaluations of prototypes
supporting organizational learning. The educational goals of this project are
to: (1) develop active learning techniques for teaching software design
concepts; (2) stimulate lifelong learning through organizational learning
techniques. While organizational learning is integrated with the research
portion of this project, active learning techniques are explored through the
development of a multimedia design studio for teaching software design concepts.
