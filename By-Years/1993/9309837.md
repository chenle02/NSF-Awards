The proposed research entails questions in commutative and homological algebra.
The investigator proposes to examine the Buchsbaum-Eisenbud conjecture for
finite length modules over classes of complete hypersurface rings. Also,
resolutions over such rings will be considered in order to estimate the lower
bounds of betti numbers of modules over the regular ring.
