Regulation of Assimilatory Nitrate Reductase: Dr. Solomonson proposes to
elucidate the regulatory mechanisms operative in the regulation of nitrate
assimilation. This is the process by which plants convert nitrate in soil to
usable organic nitrogen. In an algal model system he will use molecular and
biochemical techniques to learn how cellular activity is affected by light
intensity, concentrations of oxygen, carbon dioxide, nitrate and fixed
nitrogens. Nitrate reductase is the key enzyme in nitrate assimilation, the
major process responsible for the conversion of inorganic nitrogen of soil and
fertilizer to organic nitrogen in the plant kingdom. The net global production
of food protein is eventually dependent in large part on nitrate assimilation.
Understanding how nitrate reductase is regulated in the green alga, Chlorella,
will certainly increase our knowledge of how this enzyme is regulated throughout
the plant kingdom. Thus the results of this study will not only be of
fundamental importance but may also in the future be agronomically significant.
