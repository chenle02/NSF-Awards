The Department of Chemistry is purchasing computing equipment and software to
incorporate computational chemistry throughout the undergraduate curriculum.
General chemistry students are using the workstations to examine bonding and
structure of simple molecules, while in organic chemistry the energy differences
between the various possible molecular conformations are calculated calculated.
The equipment is used in physical chemistry to study ab-initio and semi-
empirical methods. Expansion of the types of projects available to students for
independent study is also occuring as a result of the increased computional
capabilities.
