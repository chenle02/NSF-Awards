This proposal calls for the study of the physical mechanisms responsible for the
spatio-temporal dynamics of the beam patterns in a self-pumped BaTio3 phase
conjugator using beam fanning and internal total reflection (a "cat" phase
conjugator). The study will involve systematic measurements of nonlinear
dynamical behaviors of the cat phase conjugator. Theoretical models will be
established and numerical simulations will be carried out based on experimental
results.
