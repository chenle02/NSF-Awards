Investigating Automated Biomonitoring as a Management Tool Toward the
Elimination of Pollutants that Adversely Affect Aquatic Environmental Quality.
This award is to support Phase I research to determine the feasibility of using
fish ventilatory response profiles in an automated and continuously monitored
system to detect toxicity of effluents from wastewater collection and treatment
systems. The involves assessment of those profiles to determine or predict the
cause of toxicity and to relate fish responses such as cough behavior, activity
patters and orientation behavior to the pollutant- exposures. The proposal
leading to this award was submitted in response to NSF 91-20, Small Business
Innovation Research (SBIR). Results of this research are expected to determine
the technical feasibility of the proposed concept and the basis for potential
continuation of the research into a subsequent Phase II.
