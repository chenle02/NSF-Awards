The aim of the Science Communications Project is to have the undergraduate
students experience how to approach a scientific problem while learning how
information is communicated in science. Students are required to write a
research proposal, design and perform an independent team project, write a
research report, and conduct a poster session at the end of the semester. Also
required are peer reviews of other teams' proposals and reports. The purchase of
a dual-beam spectrophotometer with a computer linkage is expanding the research
capabilities of the students and accelerating their progress. The instrument is
used primarily for enzyme activity assays and protein determinations. This
program is more akin to real biological science than the standard cookbook
laboratory experience in which the results are known ahead of time. The college
is contributing an amount equal to the award.
