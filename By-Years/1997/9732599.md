Abstract Koranyi Koranyi will continue his investigations of harmonic analysis
on Riemannian symmetric spaces with an emphasis on harmonic functions and
relations with complex analysis. Of particular interest will be solving the
long-standing problem of a local Fatou theorem for harmonic functions on
symmetric spaces. This will be approached through the theory of discrete
buildings. A second direction of research will be the use of quasiconformal maps
in several complex variables. A primary concern here is the extension of
quasiconformal maps of the boundary of a strictly pseudoconvex domain to the
interior as symplectic quasiconformal maps with respect to the Bergman metric.
The analysis involved in this research rests on the theory of Lie groups, named
in honor of the Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie, which has beenone of the
major themes in twentieth century mathematics. As the mathematical vehicle for
exploiting the symmetries inherent in a system, the representation theory of Lie
groups has had a profound impact upon mathematics itself, particularly in
analysis and number theory, and upon theoretical physics especially quantum
mechanics and elementary particle physics.
