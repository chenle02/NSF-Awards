The Principal Investigator is requesting funds requested to continue Office of
Polar Programs (OPP) support for Graduate Student Participation in the Annual
Arctic Workshops. OPP has supported attendance at this workshop through payments
of registration, per diem meals, and lodging for four nights since 1993. The
last grant supported the Arctic Workshop at the Universities of Colorado and
Tromso (Norway). The budget was based on an attendance of 25 students, but the
actual number per workshop was closer to 50. The next three workshops will be
held at the University of Colorado (2005 and 2007) and the University of
Alberta. The composition of the Arctic Workshops typically consists of about 55%
professional Arctic scientists (academic and government), and 45% graduate
students. A major effort is placed toward providing all the graduates with a
forum for their research and to establish the appropriate "network" with their
peers. The format for each Workshop differs depending on the composition of the
speakers, themes, and particular, expertise that exists at the hosting
institution. However, four main elements of professional scientific
communication are always present: 1) keynote talks, 2) short 20 minute oral
presentations, 3) one or more extensive poster sessions, and 4) specific times
and meeting places for interest groups to focus on specific research problems,
logistical interests, or certain geographic sites. A publication of extended
abstracts of both the talks and posters is distributed to all participants. Past
Global Change remains a dominant scientific theme, but increasingly arctic
ecology, cold-region hydrology and oceanography, glaciology, and the human
dimensions of climate change are among the popular topics. The Arctic Workshops
have participants from several countries with significant attendance from the
United States, Canada, Norway, Iceland, Sweden, Germany, Austria, and the United
Kingdom.
