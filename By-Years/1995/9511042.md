9511042 Eagleson This research will investigate early forebrain development in
the vertebrate. The animal to be used was chosen because a mutation found within
this species directly affects forebrain and eye development, and this mutation
provides a negative condition whereby development is disrupted. Using normal and
mutant organisms, a detailed forebrain fate map will be produced with
fluorescent labeling techniques. A comparison of the mutant and normal embryo
neural plate brain fates will test whether, and when, specific midline early
neural plate tissue is defective in the mutant embryos. Using in situ
hybridization techniques, stage by stage gene expression changes in forebrain
specific genes will be followed in normal and mutant embryos. These studies will
test to see if differences in the timing or amount of forebrain specific gene
expression occurs in mutant and normal embryos, and if gene expression events
can be related to the specific forebrain defects. Additional studies will test
how the mutant condition might alter later axon growth and neural connections.
These studies will follow axon and synapse development in normal and mutant
embryos by using immunocytochemistry for a protein that is formed in developing
neurons. These studies will reveal how a single mutant gene can result in
defects that manifest themselves much later in development. In addition these
studies will provide a developmental framework and model for further studies
investigating vertebrate neural development.
