The implementation and performance of intelligent support mechanisms for query
processing and optimization in deductive databases will be investigated. First,
the efficient evaluation of multiply-defined rules will be examined. The
evaluation of such rules results in the processing of more than one relational
query. In contrast to the traditional single command-at-a-time optimization
multiple-query optimization techniques can reduce the cost of processing a set
of queries through sharing of common execution paths. The second major target is
the idea of storing results of previously processed rules in secondary storage
(caching). Using a cache, the cost of processing a query can be reduced by
preventing multiple evaluations of the same rules. Various techniques for
implementing efficient caching mechanisms, including replacement policies and
validation schemes will be evaluated. Addressing the above issues successfully
will improve the ability of future deductive database systems to support non-
traditional application areas, like engineering environments and artificial
intelligence, which require the use of advanced control mechanisms such as
rules.
