The proposal is to support the participation of US researchers in a 5 day (week-
long) conference on singular solutions of various problems in partial
differential equations and the calculus of variations to be held at the Centre
de Recherches Mathematiques in Montreal.

This is an exciting area of current research in nonlinear analysis. Singular
solutions arise in many applications including the theory of vortices, in
geometry, in the theory of dislocations of liquid crystals and the theory of
monopoles in quantum field theory. This grant will be used to support the
expenses of US researchers who do not already have NSF support to attend this
conference.
