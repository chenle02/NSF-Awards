Stonick This research addresses the use of numerical optimization methods to
develop real-time adaptive filters for estimating, identifying, or predicting
time-varying and potentially nonlinear processes. The first phase of this work
will be devoted to the development, analysis, and simulation of an optimal
adaptive infinite-impulse response (IIA) filtering algorithm for
telecommunications using homotopy continuation methods to perform the necessary
nonlinear optimization. This research will increase our understanding of IIA
filter structures in time- varying environments, and will ultimately lead to
their more widespread use.
