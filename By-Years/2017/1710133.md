The mathematics department at Johns Hopkins University will host a conference
from March 22-26, 2017, to be organized around significant recent developments
in the study of local zeta functions and the arithmetic of moduli spaces. These
research areas have applications to cryptography and to mathematical physics
(string theory and gauge theory). One goal of the conference is to bring
together researchers in these two areas so that they will constructively
interact. A second goal is to encourage young researchers to participate in
these developments. A significant portion of NSF funding will be used to fund
the travel and housing of junior participants (e.g. graduate students and
postdocs).

The study of local zeta functions has undergone a dramatic revolution thanks to
the introduction of motivic local zeta functions in the mid-1990s. This has led
to many important developments that will be discussed at the conference,
including (among others) bounds for heights of rational points on algebraic
varieties, connections with model theory, and connections with the Langlands
program. The above is closely entwined with the emerging study of motives
associated to low genus curves and their Jacobians, and relations with Siegel
modular forms. The conference will also explore connections with birational
geometry of moduli of abelian varieties of low dimension. The conference will
feature 22 invited lectures over five days.
