0802666 (Strobel). This SGER award is to support research to obtain experimental
data to confirm that that a recently isolated fungal strain has the capability
to convert biomass into hydrocarbons useful as alternative fuels. Data will be
obtained by applying GC/MS and PTR-MS techniques in concert with comparative
analyses of standard authentic hydrocarbons. In addition, studies will be
launched to determine the best conditions for fungal growth and the best biomass
substrates that may serve as precursors for hydrocarbon production.
Undergraduates will participate in the research. Results will be submitted for
publication in the open peer-reviewed technical literature.
