This work concerns problems in the Langlands program. The PI and S. Rallis will
study the combined use of relative trace formulas and theta liftings in the
theory of functorial liftings. The PI with M. Baruch will study the local theory
of relative trace formulas and its application to central values of automorphic
L-functions.

This research is in the area of number theory. Number theory has its historical
roots in the study of natural numbers. It is among the oldest branches of
mathematics. Within the last half century it has become an indispensible tool in
diverse applications in areas such as data transmission and processing, and
communication systems.
