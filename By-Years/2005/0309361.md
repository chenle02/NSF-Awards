One of the great questions in evolutionary biology concerns the extent to which
evolution is deterministic. If it is deterministic, evolution may be repeatable;
alternatively, the unique historical attributes of different lineages may mean
that evolutionary direction is unpredictable. Studies on the evolutionary
radiation of Anolis lizards on Caribbean islands have become a model system for
the study of evolution. In this proposal we initiate a study of day geckos of
the genus Phelsuma on islands in the Indian Ocean. Our general goal is to
compare the evolutionary radiation of day geckos to that of anoles and to
investigate the extent to which these two lizard groups from very different
ancestral stock have followed similar evolutionary pathways. Using a combination
of field studies, experiments, and laboratory work, we will describe in detail
the way that communities of day geckos have evolved together. If day geckos show
similar patterns to those found in Anolis, we will conclude that these two
groups have evolved convergently; alternatively, if day geckos show their own
unique idiosyncratic evolutionary patterns, we will conclude that this is a
result of historically contingent differences between these two lizard groups.
