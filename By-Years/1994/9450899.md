9450899 Seidman The Chemistry and Department of Randolph-Macon Woman's College
has purchased lasers and associated instrumentation to support the development
of a new senior level laboratory sequence in the Chemistry Department and to
also strengthen the intermediate level laboratories in the Physics Departments.
Students in both departments are being introduced to a variety of laser
applications, including fluorescence and luminescence studies and Raman
spectroscopy. The students are gaining experience with the use of
monochromators, lock-in detection and digital oscilloscopes. This project goes a
long way towards both strengthening and modernizing the laboratory offerings of
both departments, and providing our students with an exciting array of state-of-
the-art experiences.
