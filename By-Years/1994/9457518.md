9457518 Danzig This project deals with packet networks for computer
communications. A major portion of the project deals with control algorithms, in
the context of multimedia traffic, reserved-bandwidth channels, and high-
bandwidth and asymmetric-bandwidth paths. Simulation and emulation are the tools
utilized for performance evaluation, and the work contributes to as well as
utilizes these tools. For the admission control algorithm to meet its delay
bounds and maintain high link utilizations, must it know the traffic model a
priori or can it adapt to observed traffic behavior? Is "predictive service"
only usable with high-levels of multiplexing? What innovations are required for
efficiently software implementation? Hybrid-simulations are under development to
study high-bandwidth wide area networks. The tools are driven by artificial
workload models of TCP/IP traffic. An emulator, consisting of 10-30 workstations
configurable into arbitrary topologies, driven by the workload models, has been
built and will be used to evaluate reliable multicast and traffic control and
load sensitive routing algorithms. ***
