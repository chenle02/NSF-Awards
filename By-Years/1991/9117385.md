There is now convincing evidence on many levels that metabolic pathways within
the mitochondrion are organized. These pathways include the Krebs TCA cycle,
fatty acid oxidation, amino acid metabolism, and the Krebs urea cycle. Three
areas concerning molecular organization which are still to be elucidated concern
the chemical nature of the specific protein-protein interactions, the metabolic
consequences of disrupted metabolons, and the relation of the supramolecular
complexes to the overall morphology of the mitochondrion. The specific aims of
this research are to: a) determine the binding sites on citrate synthase that
interact with its membrane binding protein (citrate transporter?) and with its
reaction partners, malate dehydrogenase, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex,
thiolase, and aconitase; b) analyze the growth and metabolic pattern of yeast
cells containing peroxisomal citrate synthase in their mitochondria; and c)
determine whether cristal morphology of yeast mitochondria can be changed by the
introduction of a characteristic membrane protein from adrenal mitochondrial
inner membranes.
