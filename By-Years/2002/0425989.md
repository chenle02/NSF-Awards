This project is an experimental laboratory investigation of the impacts of
atmospheric aging on the optical properties of components of mineral dust
particles as functions of spectral wavelength, particle size, shape and
composition. The absorption and scattering of light by various classes of
mineral dust including metal oxides, carbonates, and clays will be measured for
wavelengths from 0.3 to 15 micrometers. The particles will be exposed to various
physical and chemical processes designed to simulate those occurring in the
atmosphere. Theoretical treatments of light-particle interactions will be
employed to the fresh and aged particles in an effort to derive formulas that
can be used for actual atmospheric mineral dust
aerosol.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This fundamental information will improve the
understanding of the impact of mineral dust on the radiation budget of the
earth's atmosphere. This can lead to better predictions of the impacts of
perturbations to the earth's climate system. This project will have significant
student involvement, including direct support of a graduate student and
postdoctoral fellow.
