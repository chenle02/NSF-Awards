This proposal supports student travel to attend the 2017 Computer Security
Foundations Symposium (CSF) to be held in Santa Barbara, California, August
2017. CSF is an annual conference for researchers in computer security, to
examine current theories of security, the formal models that provide a context
for those theories, and techniques for verifying security. This travel grant
will enable career development and learning opportunities for US-based and/or US
citizen graduate students. Attending conferences is an important component of
graduate school education for our society's future computer security
researchers. Students have the opportunity to discuss leading edge research with
world-class computer security researchers, and establish networks, connections,
and mentoring relationships that will serve them well during their research
careers.
