The corrosion of steel reinforcing bars in concrete structures is a problem with
multi-million dollar impact in both the private and public sectors. Chloride
intrusion from natural (seawater or marine environments) or man-made (deicing
salts) sources contributes to the breakdown of the protective iron oxide film on
the steel. The subsequent reactions create voluminous corrosion products,
causing cracking and spalling of the overlying concrete and reducing the
effective strength of the entire structure. In the proposed program, an
electrochemical method for enhancing the corrosion resistance of the rebar
during the initial concrete curing period will be investigated. The method is in
situ passivation of the rebar surface by application of an anodic potential.
This treatment will enhance the protective iron oxide film on the rebar by
making it thicker and more uniform. The effectiveness of this treatment in
enhancing the corrosion resistance of rebar will be evaluated in simulated
environments and in mortar-rebar samples.
