This proposal requests a portion of the costs for a series of seminars and
workshops that will bring together funders and operators of teacher networks,
policy makers from state and local levels, leaders of significant educational
reform projects, academics and researchers, and representatives of major
professional educational organizations and associations. These planning
conferences will be devoted to issues of policy and technical issues of the
funder-project relationship. The policy seminars will include issues of "school
restructuring", the teaching profession, and future funding areas. The technical
issues seminars will include the delivery of technical assistance to funded
programs, assessment issues across projects, and ideas for sustaining teacher
networks. The NSF portion of the entire effort will be less than one fourth of
the actual costs and will be approximately equal to the Carnegie Foundation and
the Ford Foundation share.
