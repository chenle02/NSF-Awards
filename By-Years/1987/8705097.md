This Engineering Research Equipment Grant will be used to study highly-ionized
dense plasmas in capillary discharges by optical measurements. In the capillary
structure the walls are in close contact with the plasma and large heat
conduction can lead to rapid plasma cooling rates. Intense electronon
recombination is likely to result in the amplification of radiation in the XUV
spectral region. The equipment provided in this grant will contribute towards
completing the required facilities for detailed emission and absorption studies
of the recombining capillary plasmas. An intensified gatable VUV-XUV diode array
detector will be built and used with an existing vacuum spectrograph in time
resolved measurements of the emitted plasma radiation. A dye laser will be
pumped by an existing excimer laser and used to measure population densities of
levels of interest. A mode locked dye laser pulse will be injected in an excimer
pumped dye amplifier to generate higher energy subpicosecond pulses.
