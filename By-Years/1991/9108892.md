The homeotic genes of Drosophila act as switches selecting the developmental
pathway a segment will follow. These genes encode transcription factors which
are thought to specify segment identity by regulating other, target genes. The
target genes would establish individual segmental characteristics. Although much
is known about the homeotic genes, little is known about the genes they control
or how the homeotic gene products select among their many target genes. During
the past two years, a genetic search was undertaken using insertional
mutagenesis to tag genes required for head development. The goal was to identify
genes regulating or regulated by those homeotic gene products required to
establish proper larval head segment identity. Three genes, having expression or
phenotypic qualities suggesting they are targets of the protein encoded by the
homeotic gene, Deformed, were chosen for further study. A genetic and molecular
characterization of these three genes is in progress to determine their role
during development of the larval head. In addition, experiments are underway to
test whether regulation of Deformed is direct. Future experiments will use these
genes as models to study target gene selection by the homeotic proteins.
