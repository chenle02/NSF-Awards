This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Facilities Program will
help the Department of Chemistry at the University of Louisville acquire a 300
MHz NMR spectrometer. The research activities to be supported include: (1)
Sulfur-Centered Chemistry in Metal- Sulfur Complexes; (2) Cage Formation in
Organophosphonates of Aluminum, Gallium, and Indium; (3) Synthesis and
Confirmation of Oligosaccharides of Bacteria; (4) 1H NMR Studies on Paramagnetic
FeIIFeIII and FeIIICoII Iron-Oxo Complexes of Polyimidazole Ligands; (5)
Synthesis and Characterization of CO2-Bridged Bimetallic Complexes; and (6) the
molecular basis of carcinogenesis, solution structures of peptide receptors, the
synthesis NMR Studies on Peptides and Pseudopeptides. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
(NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists for the
elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown
substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to
study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to
state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out
frontier research. The results from these NMR studies are useful in the areas
such as polymers and catalysis, and in biology.2
