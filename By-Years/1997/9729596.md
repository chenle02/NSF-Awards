A laser scanning confocal imaging microscope will be purchased for fixed and
live fluorescent analysis and for high resolution three dimensional imaging.
Among the problems to be explored are: cytokinesis, synaptogenesis and synaptic
remodeling in the nematode C. elegans, epithelial morphogenesis in C. elegans
epidermis, and chromatin remodeling factors and the molecular mechanisms of cell
fate in Drosophila development.
