This award will support the University of Arizona participation in a
collaboration of the University of Arizona, Smithsonian Astrophysical
Observatory, and Naval Research Laboratory in the construction and astronomical
use of a mid-infrared array camera. This camera will use a Hughes Aircraft
Company 20 x 64 Arsenic Doped Silicon Impurity Band Conduction Hybrid Array with
a Capacitance Transimpedances Amplifier readout. This detector is particularly
suited to providing high sensitivity in both the 10 and 20um atmospheric windows
under high background flux ground-based observing conditions. Reflective optics
will provide both diffraction limited (0.7 arc seconds/pixel) and
superresolution (.34 arc seconds/pixel) operation. The camera electronics and
computer provide for operation up to 5000 frames/second to prevent detect
saturation at high backorder. The initial observing program will focus on a
variety of continuum and spectral line observations of star forming regions in
the Milky Way and other galaxies. Some examples are: thermal emission from
circumstellar disks of low-mass stars, shocked gas in star formation regions,
velocity flows in the galactic center with NeII line imaging, and the nuclei of
active galaxies.
