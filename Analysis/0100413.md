Abstract Moy

Moy will investigate two topics in the representation theory of reductive p-adic
groups. In the first project, Moy will study the use of the Bruhat-Tits building
of a reductive group in its representation theory and harmonic analysis. Moy
will investigate by two different methods the very old fundamental conjecture
that every irreducible supercuspidal representation is compactly induced from an
open compact modulo center subgroup. The first of these two methods is based
upon extension of earlier joint work of Moy and Prasad which proved the
conjecture in the case the supercuspidal representation has depth zero. The
second method would be to show that any irreducible smooth representation which
does not contain a cuspidal representation of a parahoric subgroup must have a
nonzero Jacquet functor. Both these methods involve the Bruhat-Tits building.
Also as part of the first project, Moy will extend his joint work with Barbasch
which gave a new proof of the Howe conjecture on orbital integrals to other
twisted cases. For the second project, Moy will investigate explicit
construction of G-invariant essentially compact distributions on the group G.
