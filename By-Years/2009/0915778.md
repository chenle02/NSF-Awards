The Oakland Museum of California (OMCA) will develop, implement, and evaluate
Hotspot California, a research-based natural science gallery transformation that
will explore the educational potential of wildlife dioramas to engage the public
in urgent environmental issues. The exhibition will showcase five real places in
California that exemplify high biological diversity and complex environmental
issues. Innovative approaches to interpretation will emphasize personal
connections to these places and infuse static dioramas with visualization
technologies that illustrate environmental change over time. The project will
explore how such enhancements to dioramas might help visitors develop place-
based connections to the natural world.

The project has four major deliverables: 1) an innovative 25,000 sq ft gallery
exhibition installation featuring five specific California places where
California's unique biodiversity is threatened; 2) an application and evaluation
of a new participatory exhibit design model involving community contribution,
collaboration, and co-design; 3) a two-day "synthesis symposium" for informal
science education professionals to consider broad applications of project
findings for the field; and 4) "Diorama Dilemmas: A Source book for Museums,"
synthesizing relevant literature, case studies, and findings from the project's
research and evaluation generalizable to the field.
