The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to advance
artificial intelligence computing for a wide range of applications including in
data centers and for unmanned autonomous vehicles. According to Forbes, in 2017
U.S. data centers consumed more than 90 Billion Kilowatt hours of energy. Due to
Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Things, the expectation is that data
center energy consumption will have grown by 2X by 2023, or 15% year-over-year
increase. On the side of power-constrained machines, such as drones and robots,
power consumption for computing is severely limited to milli-Watts of power. The
impact to these industries, to enable AI inference computation is the power
savings of 80X over traditional electronics.

This I-Corps project develops ultra-low power reconfigurable nano-switches as
memory. Artificial Intelligence inference cpmputing has high energy costs due to
the large number of multiply-accumulate (MAC) functions required at each node in
the neural network, often millions to hundreds of millions of operations for a
single inference calculation. These ultra-low power reconfigurable switches
store the AI model weights, and replace dynamic ram (DRAM) memory. Simulated
results indicate 80X power reduction for each memory read needed for MAC
operation. These switches are compatible with complementary metal-oxide
semiconductor (CMOS) technology and can be produced at a minimal cost adder from
a standard CMOS process.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
