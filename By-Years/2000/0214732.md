This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop
novel flexible, transparent and photocurable nanocomposite barrier coatings to
prevent the degradation of conducting polymers by oxygen and water vapor.
Conducting polymer electronic devices can be made rapidly, low-cost, flexible,
lightweight and mechanically more robust than inorganic electronics; the main
limitation to their wide-scale commercialization is the problem with
degradation. The solution to this problem is to use a barrier layer to prevent
oxygen and water vapor from reaching the conducting polymer. Current barrier
coatings do not block oxygen and water permeation well enough to make long
lifetime conducting polymer devices possible, and the need is especially great
for flexible products such as roll-up displays. Nanocomposites, polymeric
materials that contain inorganic particles smaller than 100 nm, have exceptional
barrier properties and are ideally suited for display applications because the
small size of the nanoparticles allows the composite to be transparent. This
project will utilize nanoparticles in a photocurable urethane-acrylate coating
system to prevent oxygen and water vapor from reaching the underlying conducting
polymer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coatings are needed to extend the lifetime of
conducting polymer electronic devices including: flexible OLED (organic light
emitting diode) displays, thin film transistors, new rapid scan chips used as
bar-code replacements, printed electronic circuits and lightweight electronics.
