9632606 Gallager Theoretical studies have shown that turbulence, prey motility,
depth, and light intensity are critical to the foraging success and recruitment
of larval fishes. This project will conduct an intensive program of field and
laboratory research to investigate the effect of these variables on cod larvae.
The results will be useful for modeling interrelationships between bio-physical
coupling, trophodynamic interactions, and climate change. This project is a part
of the U.S. GLOBEC Northwest Atlantic Field Studies, Phase 2 program. ***
