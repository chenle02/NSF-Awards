This equipment grant will provide funds to upgrade the data analysis computer
system at Hope College. The system will be used for nuclear, intermediate
energy, and atomic, molecular and plasma physics research. An important aspect
of these research programs is the significant participation, and consequent
training, of Hope College undergraduate students.
