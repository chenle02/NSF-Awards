Through its Financial Aid for Science and Technology (FAST) Student Grant
Program, Trinity University is awarding an estimated 176 individual scholarships
of $4,600 per year to academically talented students who demonstrate financial
need, offsetting a significant portion of the need-based loan portion of each
student's financial aid package. The scholarships are renewable by individual
students for up to four years. Through the program, Trinity especially seeks to
recruit first-generation college students in order to reach institutional goals
of increasing the diversity of students majoring in a broad range of STEM
disciplines, including Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Engineering
Science, Geosciences, Mathematics, and Physics & Astronomy. Moreover, FAST
student grants are also available to eligible transfer students matriculating at
Trinity after commencing their college careers on one of the campuses of the
Alamo Community College District. The FAST Student Grant Program is linked
strongly with two other Trinity programs: an Upward Bound program for secondary
students at area high schools and a Ronald E. McNair Post-baccalaureate
Achievement Program for undergraduate students moving on to doctoral studies.

The FAST Student Grant Program has three major objectives:

1. To decrease the loan indebtedness of a significant number of academically
talented students majoring in the STEM disciplines by offering multi-year
scholarships, thereby making if easier for economically challenged students to
attend Trinity University and complete their degree within four years; 2. To
increase the diversity (economic, ethnic, cultural, physically-challenged,
and/or gender) of students majoring in the STEM disciplines , with a primary
focus on first-generation college students; and 3. To provide academic support,
faculty and peer mentoring and career placement counseling services to
scholarship recipients by utilizing existing Trinity practices and programs and
by strategically strengthening and focusing these programs to improve the
college experiences of the recipients and enable their success.
