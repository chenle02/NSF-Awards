This project will continue the development of methods involving gem-
dichloroepoxide intermediates for the safe and economical preparation of
substituted carbonyl compounds and biomolecule analogs. Established routes to
such materials generally require inefficient reaction steps, expensive reagents,
or dangerous reaction conditions. Studies to establish safer and shorter methods
for homologating carboxylic acids and preparing beta-amino acids, deoxy-C-
glycosides and amino-C-glycosides from readily available trichloromethyl
carbinols will be explored. The resultant products will be evaluated in terms of
yield, preparation cost, and the stereo- and regioselectivities of devised
reaction steps. Structure-reactivity analyses and product analyses under
carefully adjusted reaction conditions will also demonstrate how specific
parameters affect the formation and reactivity of the transient gem-
dichloroepoxide intermediates involved in each method.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry
Program is supporting the research of Professor Timothy Snowden of the
Department of Chemistry at The University of Alabama. Professor Snowden's
research efforts revolve around providing safer and more efficient methods to
prepare synthetically versatile substituted carbonyl compounds, and
therapeutically valuable unnatural amino acids and heterocycles. These methods
will offer marked improvements in environmental influence, operational safety,
and materials costs over currently employed approaches. Successful development
of the methodology will have an impact on synthesis in academic research
programs and in the pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and materials science fields.
