New high expansion thermally stable multifilament fiber reinforcements are key
to developing significant advances in composite materials. It has been
identified that titanium aluminides allayed with carbon is a highly desirable
high coefficient of thermal expansion, thermally stable materials for
reinforcing aluminide intermetallics and other matrices. Conventional fiber
forming methods including thermal chemical vapor deposition (CPD) has not
produced the desired composition of titanium aluminide allayed with carbon.
Recently plasma assist CVD (PACVD) has been demonstrated to produce aluminide
intermetallic particles and multifilament fibers of TiB2, SiC and TiC on
multifilament substrates of graphite, quartz and molybdenim wire. The PACVD
process is explored here to produce titanium aluminide allayed with carbon
fibers on multifilament substrates of graphite and other substrates. Metal
evaporation and CVD are combined in a plasma to synthesize titanium aluminide
allayed with carbon as a fiber material.
