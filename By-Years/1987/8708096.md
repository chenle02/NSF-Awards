Abstract Narrative The doctoral student supported by this award will investigate
regional changes in income distribution in the United States from 1968 to 1986
by analyzing data from the Current Population Survey compiled by the Bureau of
Labor Statistics. Her specific interest is in changes in the size and location
of the middle segment of the earnings distribution (the "middle class"), which
will be defined and measured in two different ways. The purpose of this project
is to determine whether the middle class is shrinking as a percentage of the
total population, as is often alleged, and if so, how changes in the middle
class vary from region to region in the United States. The changes and regional
variations documented by the analysis will then be related to national and
regional changes in economic structure during the period of analysis. This
project will yield important theoretical and policy insights concerning the
relationships between regional industrial development and regional income
changes.
