This project will maintain the system to provide the Subcommittee of Federal
Oceanographic Fleet Coordination (SFOFC) with a comprehensive, up-to-date and
searchable database of research ship schedules. The system will be available on-
line over computer networks and a twice-yearly hardcopy will be distributed. The
system will optimize the planning and scheduling of research ship time by the
participating agencies. It will also provide a ship characteristics database to
allow users to find ships in the database that fit their scientific
requirements.
