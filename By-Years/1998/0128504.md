aborative Research: Elevated Atmospheric CO2 Alters Plant Detritus Nutritional
Quality: Effects on Microbial and Detritivore Food Webs in Aquatic
Ecosystems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2)
resulting from the combustion of fossil fuels, directly affects the
photosynthesis rate, growth, and chemical make-up of tree foliage. The
investigators have demonstrated that when aspen trees are grown under elevated
CO2 levels, their leaves contain less nitrogen and higher concentrations of
plant defense compounds (phenolic compounds, lignins and tannins), which renders
them less nutritious to their animal and microorganism consumers. Since small
headwater streams in forested landscapes rely heavily on tree leaf litter to
fuel their food webs, parallel field and laboratory studies will measure the
effect that the CO2-induced change in food quality of aspen leaf litter will
have on the growth and reproduction of stream bacteria, fungi, and invertebrate
consumers. The difference in microbial and invertebrate growth rates in turn
could affect food web structure and functions and carbon dynamics in aquatic
ecosystems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
