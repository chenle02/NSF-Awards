This project concerns several problems involving viscosity solutions and optimal
control problems. The first problem involves the extension of viscosity solution
results to systems with quadratic and non-local coupling terms. These coupling
terms can represent interaction terms in competition and cooperative systems.
Monotone iteration schemes will be developed to solve such systems. The second
problem involves viscosity solutions for second order elliptic systems
associated with two player games. In an illustrative example, one player
controls the switching of a diffusion process and the other player controls the
stopping of the process. One wants to show existence results for the system and
prove that the viscosity solution gives the value of the saddle point of the
game. The third problem is a direct study of optimality systems in which the
state is governed by first order PDEs. In minimizing a cost functional involving
a target function, the goal is to characterize the optimal control and solve the
optimality system (state equation with optimal control and the adjoint
equation).
