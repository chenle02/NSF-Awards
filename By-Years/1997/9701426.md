9701426 Tsui This research is in the area of semiconductor physics, probing the
behavior of electrons forming a 2-D gas in extremely high mobility semiconductor
devices. The research is in the area of the Quantum Hall Effect (QHE) and the
Fractional Quantum Hall Effect. The PI in recent research has contributed to
dicovery of a duality symmetry. The proposed research aims to explore the
duality symmetry between the QHE liquid phase and the newly discovered
insulating phase. Another topic to be studied is the universal relation between
the longitudinal and transverse conductivity in QHE liquid to insulator
transition. Another class of transitions is proposed in extremely low mobility
samples. %%% This research project experimentally studies the behavior of
conduction electrons in state-of-the-art semiconductor devices. It is found that
conduction electrons n extremely pure semiconductor samples, when confined to
move in a nearly two dimensional planar region, at low temperatures and high
transverse magnetic field, behave in unique ways. These previously observed
effects are known as the Quantum Hall Effect and the Fractional Quantum Hall
Effect. They are basic effects resulting from the laws of quantum mechanics
applied to a dense gas of electrons interacting with each other by Coulomb
repulsion. New behaviors are expected, described as new phases of the electron
gas, and this research is devoted to finding and describing these new behaviors.
The understanding gained can be expected to contribute to improvements in
microelectronic device technology. ***
