Bildsten, Lars AST-9731632 Dr. Bildsten's research will lay the theoretical
groundwork for studies of astero-seismology of rapidly rotating stars. He will
investigate the effect of rotation on pulsation mode stability, and develop
methods required for the calculation of pulsation eigenfunctions and mode
frequencies. His work will have implications for the understanding of the
internal structure and evolution of two classes of stars : upper main sequence
stars, particularly the slowly pulsating B stars, with the potential of
measuring the convective core mass as a function of evolutionary state in the
star, and accreting and rapidly rotating white dwarfs, with the potential of
determining the masses, rotation rates, and properties of the accreted envelopes
of white dwarf stars in these systems. ***
