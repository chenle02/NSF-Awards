This project consists of a scholar's award for methodological training to a
cultural anthropologist at the University of California-Santa Barbara. The funds
will support the training in geographic information systems of a specialist in
several research areas: the human and environmental consequences of he
globalization of the shrimp mariculture industry in Central America, population
tourism, environment and development in the Western Caribbean, and agricultural
development, migrant health and environmental justice in central California. The
purpose of the training is to advance the investigator's research skills in
applying spatial analysis with demographic, socioeconomic and environmental
data. This project will enhance the expertise of an academic scholar in global
environmental change research with policy relevant knowledge, and contribute to
graduate and undergraduate methodological training in these areas.
