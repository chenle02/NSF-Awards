Students in this program are immersed in the Santa Fe Institute's
multidisciplinary and multigenerational scientific environment; in this context
they team up with one or more mentors to work on meaningful complexity science
research problems to which they can make a significant contribution. The aim of
the program is to enrich the academic and practical career preparation of these
students through exposure to a transdisciplinary approach to science. Typically
this approach is used to gain a better understanding of complex adaptive systems
in the biological, social, and physical sciences.
