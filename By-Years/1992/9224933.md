This project will bring seven undergraduate students to the University of
California, Berkeley for an eight week period in each of the summers of 1993,
1994, and 1995. The research projects will focus on microelectronics,
communications, and computer science. The participants will have completed their
junior year, and will all be women, or members of an underrepresented ethnic
minority. In addition to working one on one with a faculty member in the
Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, each participant will
be assigned to a graduate student co-mentor of the same gender or ethnicity.
