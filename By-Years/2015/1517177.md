The coolest stars and brown dwarfs, with mass less than 10% that of the Sun,
compose the majority population in the Milky Way Galaxy. It is not yet clear how
these objects were formed. An accurate measurement of the fraction of low-mass
stars that are actually systems of two or more stars can constrain or rule out
several currently proposed theories. The proposal team has developed a method to
identify short-period, low-mass multiple systems. They will determine the low-
mass multiple frequency, and for some binary systems they will measure their
orbital properties and masses. The program will specifically engage students
historically underrepresented in science fields. Analysis tools will be
constructed in a manner that facilitates participation by high school and
undergraduate research students in stellar research, with a focus on engaging
students from historically underrepresented groups in
science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program's primary goal is to measure the very
low mass (M &lt; 0.1 Msun) binary fraction by determining a volume-limited and
bias-corrected multiplicity fraction of "spectral blend" binaries, systems
identified by their combined-light spectroscopy. It involves four primary
investigations: (1) a near-infrared spectral survey of M7-L5 dwarfs within 25 pc
of the Sun, (2) analysis of these spectra to identify and characterize blended
light pairs; (3) numerical simulations to determine the selection function and
its dependence on population age and mass distributions; and (4) multi-component
radial and astrometric monitoring observations, with full orbital coverage of
five previously identified binaries, to measure orbits, individual component
masses and spin-orbit alignment. The data collected and analysis tools developed
in this program willm be made publicly available through the SpeX Prism Library
and Virtual Observatory frameworks for scientific investigations by the larger
community.
