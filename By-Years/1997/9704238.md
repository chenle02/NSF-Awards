Matching support for upgrading of a departmentally shared facility for Electron
Paramagnetic Resonance Spectrometery to allow time-domain and multidimenional
Fourier-transform experimentsis requested. The selected spectrometer system is
the Bruker ESP-380E-FT-300/FT/CW EPR spectrometer and DICE/stochastic-Pulsed-
ENDOR accesory. This instrument will be the first of its kind on the Princeton
campus and will stimulate new research applications that are currently not
accessible here. An initial group of 12 investigators distributed across three
academic departments and an industrial laboratory will employ the instrument to
extend their research programs in the following primary areas:(1) Structure and
function of multi- nuclear metallo-enzymes, (2)molecular robes of the mechanism
of Cytochrome P450, (3) Zinc finger proteins and heme protein folding, (4)
Probing conformational changes in actin by EPR, (5) Observing and exploiting
intermolecular multiple- quantum coherences in solution ESR, (6) Selenium-
dependent molybdo-pterin enzymes.
