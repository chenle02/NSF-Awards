CTS-9307518 Kentucky Research Foundation D. Allen Butterfield ABSTRACT Methods
for the immobilization of enzymes often lead to reduced activity due to
conformational changes, unfavorable orientations and other factors. A new
technique for more specific and uniform attachment with spacers will be explored
in this project on membrane bioreactors. Site-directed mutagenesis is to be used
in modifying the genetic code for a cysteine residue and then expressing the
variant enzyme (subtilsin). Functional groups at one terminus of the spacer
compound will be reacted with amino or hydroxyl moieties in a polymeric membrane
while the other terminus will contain a thiol to be oxidized to the disulfide in
completing the immobilization. The immobilized enzyme and intermediate
structures will be characterized by NMR, x-ray fluorescence, spin-label studies,
and other methods. Catalytic behavior is to be examined under various reaction
conditions including aqueous and organic solvents. Immobilization of enzymes
facilitates a continuous mode of operation and aids the purification of
bioproducts. This fundamental research could help improve the production
processes in many biotechnology companies.
