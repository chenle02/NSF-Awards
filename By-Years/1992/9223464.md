ABSTRACT -- CTS-92-23464 PI -- Bankoff The appearance of dry or nearly dry
regions on a heated surface is important to many engineering technologies
utilizing boiling or evaporative heat transfer. Previous work by the PI's has
demonstrated new mechanisms, involving thermocapillary and recoil effects, for
precursor formation. It is proposed to extend these studies by incorporating Van
der Waals effects. These studies will involve numerical calculations for the
advance of contact lines on the heated surface, including the formation of
revulets in the wetting of initially dry surfaces, as well as experimental
measurements of local film thicknesses.
