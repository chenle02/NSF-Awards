In this award, supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Prof. Christoph G. Rose-Petruck of Brown University will
conduct research studying the dynamics of ligand substitution of iron
pentacarbonyl in solution. The dynamics will be primarily studied using
ultrafast x-ray absorption spectroscopy based upon tabletop femtosecond x-ray
sources. Additional studies will use FTIR spectroscopy and Density Functional
theoretical methods to build a complete picture of the bonding in the solvated
iron pentacarbonyl and how this changes upon photoexcitation. Ultimate goals of
the research include (1) gaining a better understanding of the ligand dynamics
in this prototypical saturated, sterically uncrowded metal carbonyl and (2)
developing ultrafast x-ray sources for chemical research.

The proposed research will have a broader impact in its development of new
spectroscopic probes of chemical systems, as well as its training of
undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral researchers in using these new methods.
