This award supports research that focuses on the collection and analysis of
palynomorphs and megafossils of Permian and Triassic age from the Beardmore
Glacier region in Antarctica. Research will include the biostratigraphy,
correlation, and biology of plants preserved as impressions, compressions and
permineralizations. Systematic collections will be made of samples with the aim
at recovering palynomorphs that will help to better correlate the Buckley,
Fremouw and Falla Formations (Beacon Supergroup) with those in other areas of
Antarctica and other Gondwana continents. A component of this research will
investigate digenetic effects on palynomorphs from areas (e.g., Mt. Achernar)
where pollen is preserved in the vicinity of diabase sills. In addition,
palynomorphs and megafossils (where available) will be collected in the vicinity
of known vertebrate localities in order to better correlate these deposits and
to contribute to paleoenvironment reconstructions. Impression/compression
specimens will also be collected with the aim to better understand the floral
composition and its possible use in biostratigraphy and biogeography.
