Fourier transform infrared and ultraviolet/visible spectrometers have been
introduced to students in the first semester general chemistry laboratories at
St. Edward's University. Student use these instruments to incorporate
spectroscopic measurements into three existing groups of experiments; basic
experimental techniques, qualitative analysis, and quantitative analysis. The
integrated spectroscopy components include both experiments that emphasize
spectroscopy and the use of spectroscopy to supplement existing experiments. The
experiments reinforce discussions of the electromagnetic spectrum and chemical
bonding presented in the lecture portion of the course. This project will more
than double the number of students who acquire a working knowledge of modern
spectroscopic instrumentation and techniques. *
