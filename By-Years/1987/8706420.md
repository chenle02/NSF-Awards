Professor John Imbrie is an outstanding, young mathematical physicist who has
made significant contributions to our understanding of constructive quantum
field theory and of disordered systems. His proof of the existence of a long
range order for the three dimensional random-field Ising model was a major
advancement for the field. He now proposes to investigate the behavior of
directed polymers in a random environment and to develop rigorous
renormalization group methods for gauge theories. He also plans to study
interacting walks, such as the self-avoiding walk in four dimensions. Two of the
most interesting problems in condensed matter physics and high energy physics
have to do with disordered systems and quantum field theory, respectively.
Professor Imbrie's research on these problems has been excellent, advancing our
knowledge significantly. He proposes to continue and to expand his research in
these areas. These are difficult problems, but if Professor Imbrie can solve
them, their impact on the scientific community will be important. For example,
applied physics and chemistry are concerned about his work on the behavior of
directed polymers. Funding for this exciting and fundamental research is
strongly recommended.
