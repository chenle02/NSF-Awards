This project proposes to use magnetostratigraphy and single crystal argon dating
methodologies to more precisely constrain the age of floras in the Warner
Mountains in northeastern California. These floras are believed to record
climatic deterioration from the late Eocene to early Oligocene. A refined
geochronology of the Warner Mountains will help resolve whether or not Late
Eocene/Early Oligocene boundary cooling was abrupt and synchronous both within
the North American continent and globally, and whether it correlates with the
Early Oligocene cooling seen in marine oxygen isotope curves. This, in turn,
will help the community to better understand the nature of climatic change
across North America during the transition from the greenhouse climates of the
Eocene to the icehouse climates of the early Oligocene, and should be of broad
interest to a wide spectrum of paleontologists, geologists, biologists, and
paleoclimatologists. Outreach efforts by the PI continue to be extensive and
will include training undergraduate students in both field and laboratory
geology. The PI has, to date, published peer-reviewed scientific papers with
more than 30 of his undergraduate students. Many of these students have gone on
to successfully pursue the PhD at graduate institutions.
