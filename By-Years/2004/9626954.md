9626954 Scott The Genome Radio Project, through the Pacifica Foundation, will
produce nine one-hour radio documentaries and a live two-hour Town Hall on
current genome research. The goals of the project are: o to provide background
information on the theories and techniques of human genetic science, o to raise
the social, ethical, and legal issues and concerns associated with human genetic
research, and o to provide an opportunity for the public to interact with the
scientific experts and policy makers. The specific programs include: o DNA and
Behavior: Is Our Fate in Our Genes? o Prenatal Genetic Testing: Better Babies
Through Science? o Gene Testing; Do You Really Want to Know Your Future? o Gene
Therapy: Medicine For Your Genes. o DNA and the Law o The Commercialization of
Genetic Information o Eugenics, Past and Present o Race, Evolution, and
Philosophy in the Age of Genetics o The Human Genome Project: Roadmap to the
Human Body The radio programs will be supplemented by a variety of printed and
electronic ancillary materials exploring the science, ethics, and social impact
of human genetic research. The project will be under the Bari Scott who will
serve as PI. She has most recently been Executive Producer for The
Telecommunication Radio Project. The Co-PI's will be Mat Binder, an Independent
radio producer and instructor at the University of California, and Jude Thilman,
the Project Director/Host of The communications Revolution, the nationally
syndicated, live series on new telecommunications technologies. The principal
consultants responsible for the science content of the project will be Sylvia
Spengler, Deputy Director of The Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory Human Genome
Center and Lane Conn, Coordinator of the Human Genome Education program at the
Stanford University Human Genome Center. The science consultants and production
staff will work closely with approximately thirty genome scientists nationwide
who have formally agreed to advise the projec t.
