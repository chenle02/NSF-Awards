Research on this project is directed toward the application of analysis and
computation to mathematical modeling problems in fluid dynamics. Specific
problems under study are drawn from magnetohydrodynamics as well as the dynamics
of incompressible fluids. A general and unified variational approach will be
employed to address a variety of questions concerning the existence, regularity
and stability of both magnetostatic equilibria and steady vortex flows having
one spatial symmetry. These questions involve nonlinear elliptic eigenvalue
problems formulated from basic physical principles as optimization problems with
many nonlinear constraints. New iterative methods for solving this class of
variational problems will be developed, and their convergence properties will be
examined analytically. Similar methods will be adapted to improve numerical
solvers for the governing evolution equations by a nonlinear projection
technique. The investigations also address certain nonlinear wave motions in
fluids, especially internal waves in density- stratified fluids and inertial
waves in swirling flows. The goal of the research is to enhance the theoretical
aspects of fluid dynamics by studying the relevant nonlinear partial
differential equations. ***
