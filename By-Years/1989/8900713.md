This is a Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site grant. The award permits
undergraduate students to participate in a research program in the materials
field under the supervision of faculty members actively engaged in research.
Students who might not otherwise have a research opportunity are included within
the program. The program enhances current research activities as well as adding
to the number of scientifically trained individuals.
