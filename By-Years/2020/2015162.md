The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is upgrading the public’s existing electronic
U.S. dollars to match and exceed the capabilities of private cryptocurrencies.
Distributed-ledger technology has the potential to transform every sector of the
economy, but today’s blockchains require users to purchase specific assets
before sending payments or using related applications. This has delayed
mainstream adoption of blockchain technology and raised concerns that a
transition to decentralized commerce could threaten the value of savings held in
traditional currency. The proposed project will develop a new technology for
protected digital transactions. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase I project
proposes to develop a decentralized blockchain that will eliminate the need for
cryptocurrencies by allowing the owners of U.S. dollars to unlock fiat-derived
tokens at zero cost. By adapting recent advancements in biological signaling
theory to computer science, the project aims to advance new methods in
distributed computing. It will replace symmetric Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-
Stake vote-weighing mechanisms with a new technology, Proof-of-Balance, that can
deliver significant enhancements to security and performance. The proposed work
will explore application of the formal mathematical models by developing and
deploying an operational Proof-of-Balance network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
