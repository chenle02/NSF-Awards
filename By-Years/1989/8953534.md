This is a continuation of earlier work to provide educational experiences that
enhance development of innovative and creative skills through interactive
computer modules and open-ended problems in each required Chemical Engineering
course. The modules are designed to complement traditional approaches to
learning engineering fundamentals. The modules and problems are developed
through student and faculty interaction with industrial companies and represent
problems of current interest to the companies. The grantee provides funds for
this project that are approximately an equal match for the NSF award.
