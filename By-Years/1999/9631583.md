The operation of markets and the determination of prices are central issues in
economics. The research will look at financial market microstructure, shifting
the focus away from price information alone. Instead, the research will examine
the information contained in order flows with market makers. The assumption is
that not all information is contained in price data. Information between market
makers and traders is asymmetrical. The market maker changes his beliefs about
the value of the underlying asset as orders come in from traders, reacting by
changing his posted bid and ask rates.
