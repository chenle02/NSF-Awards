This grant will support an REU Site at the Santa Fe Institute, so that SFI can
expand its existing program which provides undergraduates with the opportunity
for research in the field of adaptive computation in particular and complex
adaptive systems in general. Such studies are particularly appropriate as an
entry point for undergraduates into research. The program will be open to
students in a broad range of the physical, biological, and computing sciences.
