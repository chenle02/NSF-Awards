9603863 Collins The task of maintaining an upright posture involves a complex
control system even in a healthy, young individual. This project is designed to
increase the understanding of the nervous system, muscle, and biomechanical
factors that influence postural control. The project uses a newly developed
quantitative approach to studying postural control called "stabilogram-diffusion
analysis" (SDA) to analyze the subtle postural adjustments and movements
individuals make as they stand. Experiments use this analysis to examine such
adjustments in relation to different influences on posture such as muscle
activity levels and the body's inertia. The results are then used to understand
the role of different sensory and motor control systems in maintaining effective
postural control. This project will significantly improve the understanding of
how the body effectively controls posture and movement, and in so doing will
provide insights important for understanding the postural control difficulties
that result from aging or balance disorders. Its results will also be important
for the development of mechanical systems such as prosthetic limbs or robotic
devices that require fast, effective control of stable platforms.
