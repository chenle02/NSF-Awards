9320001 Coopersmith From overthrowing governments to ordering food and following
football, the fax machine provides easy, instant written communication worldwide
without the alienation of the computer. Although most people assume that faxing
is a spontaneous spinoff of the electronic and computer revolutions of the
1980's, in reality, fax technology has existed for 150 years. Major companies in
the US, Britain, and France had the opportunity to promote fax technology. Yet
the social needs in Japan, which has an "alphabet" that is not easily
accommodated to the keyboard, led to its commercial success in the past twenty
years. Dr. Coopersmith is examining why it took so long for people to develop
and utilize a machine that has revolutionized the way we communicate. The fax
machine appears to be a free-standing device, but it is intricately embedded in
a system of telephone and computer networks, standards, business and social
mores, and legal and economic structures. Studying the fax machine provides a
gateway into understanding the construction and evolution of this system of
communications. Dr. Coopersmith is using a comparative international approach to
capture the evolution of fax technology. His main themes are innovation and
diffusion, failure and the development of niche markets, the role of large
organizations in shaping technical evolution and personal choice, and changes in
communication. The recent widespread use of fax machines resulted from a
convergence of technical, economic and social factors. To understand this
convergence and the failure of prior efforts, comparisons among the United
States, Great Britain and Japan will illuminate how different social and
economic systems shaped the debates and development of fax technology. By
analyzing how faxing has changed the way people communicate and work, this
research will deepen our understanding of the evolving shape of
telecommunications on the "information revolution." For decades predi ctions
about the uses and importance of fax machines outpaced the reality, but when
widespread acceptance came in the mid-1980's, the plethora of applications and
further innovation surprised everyone, including proponents of the "electronic
office of the future." Dr. Coopersmith's study is not a narrow history of a
machine, but an exploration of how technologies, economics, politics, and
societal values shaped the evolution of the fax machine and how fax technology
influenced societies in which it is embedded. This research will contribute to
the growing literature on innovation and further the study of the information
revolution. ***
