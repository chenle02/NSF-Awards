Distinct and diverse laboratory experiences for undergraduate chemistry and
biology students, as well as advanced high school students, are involving the
capabilities of an integrated gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer system. The
system features ChemStation computer software to coordinate analyses of
compounds in the benchtop Hewlett-Packard HP5890A GC/Hewlett Packard HP5917A
Mass Selective Detector system. Classes for both majors and non-majors are using
the instrumentation. The following areas have been greatly impacted by the new
instrumentation: (1) organic chemistry courses for biology and chemistry majors,
(2) the analytical instrumental chemistry course for chemistry majors and
minors, (3) chemistry courses for non-science majors with emphases in either
forensic science or environmental science, and (4) the Forensic Science Project
for talented high school students, a two-week residential experience. The
institution has contributed to the project in an amount equal to the NSF funds.
