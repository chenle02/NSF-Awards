Geology (42)&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this project is to design and test 12-15
laboratory-style exercise modules for publication in a geology laboratory manual
or uploading to the Internet. The purpose of the exercises is to teach
mathematical material to geology students in geologic context. Each exercise
includes one or more spreadsheet models designed to address a geological-
mathematical problem (i.e., a geology problem with mathematical content). The
exercises are being designed with the expectation that the students can figure
out the cell formulas from the mathematics provided in the written material;
that is, the spreadsheets show the layout of the algorithms but not the formulas
themselves. The written material of the exercises also guide the students to
explore, through the repetitive calculations made possible with spreadsheets,
both the mathematics applied in the problems and the geology of the problems
themselves. The mathematics covered include algebra, trigonometry, analytical
geometry, probability/data analysis, calculus, and problem-solving heuristics.
The exercises are hands-on, interactive, student-friendly version of much of the
material covered in the PI's column, "Computational Geology," in the Journal of
Geoscience Education. The exercises are being piloted in the PI's geological-
mathematical problem-solving course, and at several other institutions.
