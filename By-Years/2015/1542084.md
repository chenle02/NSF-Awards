Non-technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;This award provides partial support for the
activities of the Condensed Matter and Materials Research Committee (CMMRC). The
CMMRC is a sub-committee of the National Academy of Science Board on Physics and
Astronomy and is tasked with serving as a conduit for interactions between the
condensed matter and materials research communities and the federal government,
including the agencies that support this research, and with monitoring the
health of and identifying important new developments in these fields. The
members of the CMMRC are leading scientists from across all the subfields
encompassed by condensed matter and materials research. The CMMRC carries out
its mission using regular meetings to discuss emerging research areas, working
with sponsoring agencies to organize topical workshops, interacting with
professional societies, and developing resources for the general public.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;This project provides partial
support for the National Research Council's (NRC) Condensed Matter and Materials
Research Committee (CMMRC). The CMMRC is a multidisciplinary group with
membership drawn from universities, industry, and government laboratories. The
areas of expertise represented on the committee are intended to cover the
breadth of the condensed matter and materials research fields. Nominees for
committee membership have been and will continue to be selected on the basis of
demonstrated intellectual leadership in these areas and thoughtful consideration
of cross-cutting issues. The operating guidelines of CMMRC include the following
objectives: (1) to respond to requests for technical information and assistance,
both from within the National Academies and from outside federal research
agencies; (2) to initiate and oversee ad hoc studies in these fields and their
multidisciplinary connections to other fields of science and technology; (3) to
serve as long-term stewards for studies initiated under CMMRC's direction; (4)
to act as an educational resource for the condensed matter and materials
research communities and the agencies that support them; and (5) to provide a
forum for discussion among condensed matter and materials scientists and
Washington D.C. policymakers. To carry out those objectives, CMMRC meets on an
annual basis and between those meetings, conducts its business through telephone
conferences.
