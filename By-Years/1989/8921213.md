SIPP ACCESS has created, designed and maintained a national facility for shared
use of a database on the 1984 Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP).
The record of work by researchers across the United States using the SIPP Access
facility shows that great economies in research can be achieved by using its
capabilities. Continuing that facility and effectively transferring capabilities
of the facility to a permanent site in the Census Bureau are the objectives of
the current grant. An evaluation that will communicate insights from the SIPP
ACCESS prototype to others with complex data management tasks will also be part
of the project. It will discuss: 1) the sources of efficiency in the SIPP ACCESS
system, 2) management of a complex database, 3) data enhancements and their
value-added, 4) relational databases management systems, query languages and
strategic thinking about preservation of data in a dynamic environment, 5)
training, information overload and the learning curve, and 6) the implications
of the SIPP ACCESS System for data and information systems in the 1990s. A
revised version of PC-SIPPTEST, a highly innovative personal computer version of
the project which has been tested at six beta-test sites in the past year, is to
be produced.
