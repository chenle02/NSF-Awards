This proposal explores some of the main research areas where algebraic geometry
interacts with quantum field theory and string theory including: the moduli of
super Riemann surfaces and the related issues of superstring measure and
superstring perturbation theory; the geometric Langlands program; heterotic
string phenomenology; F theory; and quantum sheaf cohomology. The proposal also
considers some issues in moduli spaces of curves and abelian varieties, and some
more exploratory math/physics connections such as amplitudes, Grassmannians, and
twistors; and some conjectures regarding the 6-dimensional conformal field
theory and its mathematical consequences.

The significance of this project is in developing the connections between
mathematics (mostly algebraic geometry) and high energy physics (mostly string
theory). Each of these areas involves a mixture of issues from math and from
physics, and most will be explored in teams involving both mathematicians and
physicists. The first research area in particular is expected to have a major
impact on the (mathematical) foundations of perturbative superstring theory,
while the second addresses one of the major open problems in mathematics using
new tools inspired, at least in part, by high energy physics ideas. The PI
proposes also to continue a wide range of broad impact community and educational
activities, including: the development and guidance of a series of conferences
emphasizing the interactions of physics and mathematics, and of other channels
for the dissemination of new knowledge concerning interactions of mathematics
and high energy physics; curriculum development at the graduate and
undergraduate level; writing a strings-for-mathematicians text; extensive work
with graduate and undergraduate students and evaluation of the math major at
Penn; membership of national bodies such as the AMS Committee on the Profession,
and editorship of several journals and book series.
