The discovery of stem cells in the adult brain has generated a great deal of
excitement in the neurosciences. Thousands of new cells are produced each day in
a healthy hippocampus, a key brain area for learning and memory. However, soon
after the cells are born, many of them die unless they are exposed to a learning
experience. Thus, new neurons in the adult are rescued from death by learning.
With this award, a number of important questions about the relationship between
learning and neurogenesis will be answered: What do new neurons do once they are
rescued from death? Are they used for memory or for acquiring new information?
Are new cells retained with each new learning experience and if so, do they then
contribute to learning in the future? Also, do the absolute numbers that are
born relate to the numbers kept alive by learning? And finally, what
physiological mechanisms and brain rhythms keep them alive? To answer these
questions, behavioral, electrophysiological, molecular and biochemical
techniques will be used. These studies are important because they will identify
the critical features of learning that keep new neurons alive and in turn how
those new neurons then contribute to optimal learning in the future. The
discovery of neurogenesis has transformed the way we think about the adult brain
and generated much interest in the public, especially educators of children and
young adults. These findings will be disseminated to the public with writings in
lay magazines (i.e. Shors, Scientific American, 2009) and public presentations
(i.e. Quark Park, a public art installation about science). The project will
train postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate students in this new field of
research which intersects biology, psychology, physiology, as well as biomedical
and stem cell engineering.
