This award supports the research of Professor Zhang to work in combinatorics.
The investigator will continue his investigations in the topics of circuit
covers, circuit decompositions, integer flows, and edge-colorings of graphs. The
major targets in this project will be the circuit double cover conjecture and
integer flow problems together with some related problems, including the
question of 3-edge-coloring for some families of graphs. The research is in the
general area of combinatorics.Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods
to study how discrete collections can be organized. The behavior of discrete
systems is extremely important to modern communications. For example, the design
of large networks, as in telephone systems, and the design of algorithms in
computer science all deal with discrete objects, and this makes use of
combinatorial research.
