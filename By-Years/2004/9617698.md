9617698 Chang The study of materials science and technology is inherently
interdisciplinary, organizing the study of chemistry, physics, biology,
technology and mathematics about problems rather than as separate disconnected
disciplines. Six modules have been developed that apply important concepts in
science and mathematics to the properties and use of materials. This project is
to add assessments to the modules and subject them to extensive field testing to
gather data about student achievement of important learning goals. The teacher
materials provide information about the design process and addressing the
learning goals. Two more modules on Materials and Environment and Sports
Materials are developed and tested. All of the modules are indexed to
comprehensive curriculum materials in the disciplines. The project develops
kits, interactive CDROM with databases, and support for teachers both on-line
and through organizations, as well as print modules and teacher materials.
