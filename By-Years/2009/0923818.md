The objective of this research is to develop technology that utilizes alkali-
activated fly ash concrete for fabrication of precast emergency residential
shelters. The fly ash ingredient in this material is a readily available
byproduct of burning coal for electric power generation. However, most fly ash
is currently land filled, and the potential beneficial use of this sustainable
material is not fully realized. The research will focus on material and
structural characterization of alkali-activated fly ash concrete and its
suitability for producing high performance and durable precast emergency
shelters. The potential for industrial implementation will also be explored, as
the work will be conducted in collaboration with a leading manufacturer of
precast concrete, Oldcastle Precast. It is expected that this partnership will
result in the development of new technology to produce precast residential
shelters that use material characterized by lower environmental impact and lower
cost, as compared to ordinary portland cement
concrete.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Emergency residential shelters are required to
protect the civilian population in times of natural disasters where evacuation
to safer surroundings is not possible. The many deaths and injuries associated
with hurricanes and tornados, clearly demonstrate the need for shelters that are
safe and economic. The material and structural testing in this proposal will
provide a clear understanding on how to achieve this objective. Additionally,
the research team has a strong commitment to engineering education and outreach,
especially where economically disadvantaged grade school students are concerned.
In response to this commitment, funding for undergraduate participation will be
solicited and an invitation will be extended to a group of local Philadelphia
High School students to tour the Structural Engineering Teaching and Research
Laboratory at Villanova University and observe the structural testing
activities.&lt;br/&gt;
