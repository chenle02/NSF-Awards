The PI (principal investigator) plans to continue his research program in metric
and comparison geometry. The PI is pursuing to solve or make progress on some
basic problems in the following two areas: collapsed Riemannian manifolds with
curvature bounded from below and positively curved manifolds with symmetry. In
this research, mathematics from several disciplines interact, such as metric
comparison geometry including Alexandrov geometry, geometric analysis and
topology. This project is buit on the early success by PI in the study of the
collapsed Riemannian manifolds with curvature bounded from above and below.

Mathematics is the foundation of the natural sciences, and differential geometry
and Riemannian geometry are among the most important branches that interact with
other natural sciences such as physics. The PI is pursuing to solve some basic
problems in the above fields, which will have a broad intellectual impact. The
PI will continue to actively pursue collaborations with other mathematicians in
the United States and abroad, and speak at several national and international
conferences in the next three years.
