This research is concerned with the extending the capabilities of probabilistic
networks as the basic mechanism of representing and managing uncertainty in
automated reasoning applications. The project consists of three parallel
investigations: 1. The formalization of relevance and causation using extensions
to the theory of graphoids. 2. The mechanization of qualitative non- monotonific
reasoning based on sound probabilistic semantics. 3. The automatic recovery of
causal structures from data.
