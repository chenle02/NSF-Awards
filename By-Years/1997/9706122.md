9706122 Rockwell This research is to continue paleoseismic excavations at a site
on the central Garlock fault in southern California that could potentially
provide a longer record of prehistoric earthquakes than any site studied and
published to date. A long record of prehistoric earthquakes is critical for
determining the distribution of earthquake recurrence intervals along faults and
for placing constraints on physical models of earthquake recurrence. In prior
work, these scientists showed that the central Garlock fault has produced 5-8
large earthquakes in the past 5145 years, on average at intervals of 700-1230
years. The radiocarbon ages of earthquakes exposed in the initial trench
indicate that the recurrence intervals for the central Garlock fault are
irregular and that earthquakes may be clustered in time. This research will
extend the earthquake record to 10-15 large earthquakes and better document the
timing of all events. This research is a component of the National Earthquake
Hazard Reduction Program. ***
