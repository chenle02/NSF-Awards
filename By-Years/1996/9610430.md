Berkeley The focus of this research is the preparation of phenylenes employing
methodology in which transition metals are used to assemble highly energetic
alkyne precursors which are then oligomerized to produce phenylenes with linear,
angular, C3-symmetric, circular, bent and zigzag topologies. Structurally
significant discoveries have included benzene rings `devoid of aromaticity` and
the observation of strong curvature. Access to spherical and planar hydrocarbons
as well as materials such as carbon nets and graphitic `onions` is potentially
available through this approach. With this renewal award, the Synthetic Organic
Program is supporting the research of Dr. K. Peter C. Vollhardt of the
Department of Chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley. Professor
Vollhardt will focus his work on preparing a class of novel benzenoid
hydrocarbons known as phenylenes. The phenylenes contain structures in which
fused cyclobutadienes alternate with benzene rings to afford systems that have
potential as organic molecular magnetic and/or conducting materials, and serve
as precursors to a plethora of other novel classes of highly energetic compounds
with novel topologies.
