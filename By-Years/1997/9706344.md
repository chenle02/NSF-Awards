9706344 Bogue The PI proposes a pilot paleomagnetic investigation of a volcanic
sequence that was erupted during a polarity reversal of the geomagnetic field
15.2 million years ago. The study area is a 200m thick section of basaltic-
andesitic lava flows exposed in the Sheep Creek Range, Nevada. In the pilot
study the PI will determine the completeness of the record in this newly-
discovered transition zone and whether paleointensities can be determined from
the lavas. Scientific questions to be addressed include whether the directional
change was complex or simple during the polarity reversal, what was the field
strength after the reversal, and whether the field strength was steady or
variable during intervals when the apparent pole position was stationary. The
answers to these questions will address hotly debated issues related to the
nature of the transitional geomagnetic field. ***
