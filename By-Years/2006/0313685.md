This project consists of a series of workshops to be held during 2003 and early
2004, culminating in an " Invention Assembly" to be held in Washington D.C. in
2004. The workshops and the Assembly will comprise gatherings of inventors and
intellectual leaders in fields including education, history, economics
psychology, engineering, social and physical sciences including cognitive
science, law and medicine, plus other invited guests. The proposed workshops and
Assembly have two basic goals. They aim, through a scholarly, interdisciplinary
approach to:

1) shed new light on invention, and on the special kind of creativity involved
in inventing, and in doing so to place special emphasis on implications for
education of young people. 2) develop specific findings and recommendations of
value to policy makers in their efforts to encourage inventiveness in young
people, and to enhance the climate for invention and the value of inventions to
society.
