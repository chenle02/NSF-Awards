Mathematical models have become important to the routine functioning of
commerce and government. Models help with planning, evaluating, managing and
operating systems of all types. With the spread of personal computers, more
models will be used by .. and developed by .. more people. Yet, even as society
becomes more dependent on models, we have not given enough attention to the
process of model formulation, either in practice or in education. Model
formulation is the first step in the modeling process: moving from a vague sense
of "problem" to a formal representation that can be manipulated to yield
solutions. Improved, systematic methods of model formulation are important to
the development of "modeling science" that will improve the efficiency and
effectiveness of modeling efforts. The objectives of this research are to: (1)
Describe the model formulation process as practiced by acknowledged experts; (2)
Develop ways to judge the success of model formulation; (3) Suggest improved
procedures for model formulation. This research will be exploratory, and should
pave the way for experimentally verifiable propositions about effective model
formulation. It should also lead to improved techniques and materials for
educating modelers
