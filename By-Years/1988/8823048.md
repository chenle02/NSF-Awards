This award will provide continuing support for a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates Site at Augustana College. This project will support
undergraduate participation in a focused research program which integrates the
research activities of eight investigators, five from Augustana College, one
from St. Olaf College, one from The Nature Conservancy and one from Black Hills
State. The projects are integrated at the scientific level because of the common
interests in prairie ecology and paleoecology and because aspects of each
project benefit from the applications of the stable isotopes of C and N to the
research methodology. This project will provide a coherent group and a unique
methodology to approach paleoecological reconstructions in a geographic area of
rich ecological resources. Ten students will study field and laboratory problems
with a common focus. They will be expected to gain some mastery of the
theoretical basis for their study as well as the experimental design and
ultimate interpretation. Weekly seminars and workshops will review each
project's theoretical basis and research design; enhance the student's library,
laboratory and data handling research skills; and broaden their understanding of
the related projects. The ten-week summer program will be followed by an
academic year REU Symposium in which each student will present the interpreted
results and conclusions and help develop the hypotheses and research designs for
the on-going projects.
