This research project consists of experiments that are designed to study the
ability of exogenous opioids to regulate the stimulated release of an endogenous
opioid, methionine-enkephalin (enkephalin). Recently, it has been demonstrated
that exogenous opioids regulate the evoked release while higher concentrations
inhibit release. The major question to be examined is whether the ability of low
doses of opioid to enhance the stimulated release of enkephalin is due to the
activation of a biochemical pathway that is different from the pathway that
mediates opioid inhibition of enkephalin release. The identification of factors
that determine the relative responsiveness to the excitatory and inhibitory
effects of opioids will be investigated. Results from these experiments might be
of importance in understanding the physiological mechanisms that underline
opiate tolerance and dependence.
