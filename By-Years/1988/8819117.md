Dr. Kafatos proposes to continue an analysis of cis-regulatory elements of the
moth chorion promoters, and to characterize the trans factors by biochemical
fractionation, molecular cloning, and functional analysis with in vitro
transcription assays. Specific objectives are as follows: 1) Use a reporter lacZ
gene to determine in detail elements that are necessary for follicle specific
regulation of moth chorion genes transferred into the Drosophila genome. 2)
Biochemically fractionate, purify and characterize putative trans-factors from
Drosophila and silkmoths. 3) Study the relative affinities of these factors for
chorion genes that differ in temporal programming. 4)Molecular cloning of trans-
factor sequences. 5) Development of an in vitro transcription system, to assay
and confirm the nature of purified or cloned factors. 6) Use of the factor
clones to study chorion regulation, e.g. affinities and changes in concentration
of the factors during choriogenesis, and their distribution in other tissues and
developmental stages. %%% The chorion proteins and used to form the eggshell of
the moth and fly. Their synthesis represents an excellent system in which to
study the developmentally regulated expression of a complex, multigene family.
