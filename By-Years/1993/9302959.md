9302959 Shin In this project in the Physical Chemistry program of the Chemistry
Division Prof. Seung Koo Shin of the University of California at Santa Barbara
will pursue an experimental program of research on the photoinitiated reactions
of ion-molecule complexes in the gas phase. The work will include investigations
on the vibrational predissociation of certain reaction intermediates,
spectroscopic studies of charge- transfer-to-solvent transitions, orbital
orientations in ion-molecule reactions, and ab initio quantum mechanical and
dynamics calculations. %%% Detailed, molecular-level studies on molecular
reactions in the gas phase stand at the forefront of contemporary physical
chemistry. Among the goals of such investigations is an examination of how the
rotational states of a reaction complex are affected by specific excited
vibrational modes. Since many reactions involve the interactions between ions
and neutral molecules, reaction intermediates of ion-molecule complexes are of
primary interest in the present investigation. The results of this work will
contribute to a better understanding of solution reactivity and photochemistry.
