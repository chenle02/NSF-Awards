Elastic and inelastic helium scattering from alkali-metal overlayers on metal
substrates will be used as a means of obtaining additional information on their
structures and dynamics, and on the effects of defects on their structures and
phase transitions. Results will be used to test current theory and should lead
to better understanding of adsorbate/substrate and adsorbate/adsorbate
interactions. %%% Adsorption phenomena are of great fundamental scientific
interest, but are also extremely important technologically e.g. in catalysis;
extraction, separation and purification; adhesion; synthesis and processing.
