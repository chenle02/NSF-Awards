A "2+3" (B.S./M.A) dual degree program leading to a Masters of Arts with
Teaching Certification for grades 6-12 for is being instituted for STEM majors.
Two year scholarships for the fourth and fifth years are being awarded for the
cost of attendance with a maximum annual award of $20,000. A minimum of eighteen
scholars are receiving two-year scholarships over the five year project period.
The IDEA (Instructional Development and Educational Assessment) Institute offers
several programs aimed at early identification of potential teachers among STEM
majors in the freshmen and sophomore years. These include 35 three-week
internships for undergraduates to teach in summer science camps, opportunities
to collaborate with teachers in public schools on small scale instructional
projects in high needs schools, and opportunities to serve as peer instructors
and group leaders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the junior year, students are
admitted via early admission into the MAT program and are dual enrolled as
undergraduates and graduate students. Monthly meetings and planning sessions are
held to assist with preparation for the Noyce program and additional teaching
experience is gained. In the fourth year the students complete the STEM degree
requirements, enroll in initial education courses and undertake a teaching
practicum with a master teacher. Student teaching, primarily in Detroit Public
Schools, along with additional coursework, occurs in the final year.
