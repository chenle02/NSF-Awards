This project will take techniques for identifying finite-time approximations to
invariant manifolds in simple dynamical systems, further develop these so that
they can be applied to complex, time-dependent fluid flows containing many
coherent structures, and then use the improved techniques to examine transport
in flows near strongly eddying oceanic fronts. A particular goal is to quantify
the role of non-local transport events in the stirring produced by coherent
structures and to examine the relation between Lagrangian dispersion statistics
and the degree of hyperbolicity of the flow field. The project will extend two-
dimensional lobe dynamics to quasi-three-dimensional flows. The oceanic flows to
be studied are high-resolution, general circulation model representations of the
Loop Current system in the Gulf of Mexico and of the Gulf Stream in the North
Atlantic.
