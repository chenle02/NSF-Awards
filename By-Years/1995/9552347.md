Through this project, methods of scientific investigation are being taught in an
investigatory laboratory setting. Students, working in teams, are designing
methods for determining sources of variability in data resulting from
measurements using balances, spectrophotometers, and dissolved oxygen probes.
Each research team also identifies and delineates a specific problem whose
investigation is tractable with available instruments and consistent with
students' skills. The teams identify possible solutions to the problem, select
one or more solutions for testing, devise an empirical test using available
instruments, do the experiments, analyze the data, and draw appropriate
conclusions. The projects are being presented both in written and oral formats
to all members of the class. The intended outcomes from this laboratory are (1)
improved skills in critical thinking and problem solving, (2) better
understanding and appreciation of science, (3) improved communication and
teamwork skills, (4) understanding simple statistical methods, (5) enhanced
skill in obtaining electronically accessed data, and (6) enhanced attitude
toward science.
