0225489&lt;br/&gt;Smela&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs will develop integrated
microstructures and circuitry for single cell&lt;br/&gt;capture and
characterization. Each of these "clinics" will consist of a&lt;br/&gt;cell-sized
cavity, or microvial, and a lid. The lid can be opened and&lt;br/&gt;closed by
hinges constructed from polypyrrole microactuators which link&lt;br/&gt;rigid
plates to the substrate. These clinics will be fabricated
on&lt;br/&gt;conventional bulk silicon as well as on ultra-thin silicon-on-
sapphire&lt;br/&gt;(SOS) substrates. Integration of the microstructures with
CMOS&lt;br/&gt;electronics allows integrating sensors, detection, and
stimulation&lt;br/&gt;circuitry together, while SOS provides a transparent
substrate which&lt;br/&gt;allows optical measurements of cell activity within
the chamber. Sensing&lt;br/&gt;modalities will be tailored for specific
applications and include:&lt;br/&gt;impedance measurements, extracellular
recording and stimulation of&lt;br/&gt;electrically active cells, optical
measurements, and current or voltage&lt;br/&gt;clamp measurements using
microfabricated needles within the chamber. &lt;br/&gt;The potential
applications are numerous, spanning a spectrum from
detailed&lt;br/&gt;physiological studies of specific mechanisms to whole cell
studies of&lt;br/&gt;ecology or developmental biology to collecting concentrated
cell&lt;br/&gt;secretions to statistical studies of assayed cell
properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
