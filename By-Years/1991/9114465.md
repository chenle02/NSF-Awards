In this project, scientists from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI)
will assist scientists from the Instituto Espanol de Oceanografia, of Madrid,
Spain, in carrying out a hydrographic section along approximately 24|N in the
Atlantic from Spain to the Bahamas aboard the Spanish vessel R/V Cornide. This
section has been occupied twice before, in 1957 and 1981, with intriguing and
unexplained changes observed in deep water properties. A repeat at this time
will address fundamental issues in the relationship of these changes to climate
change. The WHOI effort will assist the Spanish in ensuring high quality data
which will contribute to the WOCE Hydrographic Program.
