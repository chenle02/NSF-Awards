9400633 Reinhold This program will address the growing interest in carbohydrate
function into one administrative mechanism to address the needs of structure.
The collaborating groups have defined functional roles for carbohydrate samples
that fall into four research areas: (1) plant oligosaccharides involved in
nitrogen fixation and signal transduction; (2 microbial cell attachment and/or
cell activation: (3) carbohydrate and protein anchors: glycolipids and GPI-
anchors; and, (4) N-and O-linked glycoproteins. This Group project consolidates
cross-disciplinary problems in carbohydrate structure and involves personnel
with analytical expertise and dedicated instrumentation for a comprehensive
approach to function. %%% Contemporary biology is placing greater attention on
factors that relate to the interplay of cells with their environment. Symbiotic
nitrogen fixation, plant defense mechanisms, immune surveillance, angiogenesis,
cellular differentiation and adhesion are events associated with multi-cellular
systems. Here, cell-cell interactions, the integrated development and
differentiation so characteristic of living tissues, is manifested within an
extracellular matrix which depends on membranes, tissue surfaces and the ordered
transport of signals by and through these barriers. Close examination of this
complex cellular milieu reveals that they are resplendent with a vast array of
glycosylated molecules. The need to know the detailed structural features of
these molecules is compelling. An understanding of compound class or component
composition has little meaning when one is trying to unravel the biochemistry of
cellular events or to mimic, stimulate or retard these processes. This
glycosylation is fundamental to the proper function of multi-cellular organisms
and consistent with physiological demands for greater biological specificity.
