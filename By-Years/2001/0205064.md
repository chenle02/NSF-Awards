This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
Program, is a fundamental computational study of the chemisorption of small
molecules on transition metal surfaces. Using state of the art Density
Functional Theory, Professor Rahman and her coworkers in the Department of
Physics at Kansas State University, are systematically exploring the adsorption
of carbon monoxide on stepped and kinked nickel and palladium surfaces. The
dependence of adsorbate binding energy, substrate surface relaxations,
electronic charge transfer and the nature of the adsorbate-substrate bond on the
local geometry and coordination obtained from these calculations is being
explored. Model interaction potentials developed from these calculations
facilitate large scale simulations of catalysis and thin film growth processes.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using state of the art computational tools, Professor
Rahman and her colleagues are examining the fundamental aspects of electronic
structure in the adsorption of small molecules on transition metal surfaces. The
detailed understanding obtained from these studies is useful in the design of
catalytic systems and for developing our knowledge of surface reaction processes
in several technologically important areas. &lt;br/&gt;
