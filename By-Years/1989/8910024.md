Dr Petersen has received a research planning grant to refine and validate a new
technique which promises to be useful for measuring the activity of individual
neurons involved in the control of behavior and pituitary function. Using the in
situ hybridization technique, she will be able to determine basic mechanisms by
which gonadal steroid hormones can affect anatomically diverse populations of
peptidergic neurons in the brain. Specifically, Dr. Peterson will examine the
activity of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH). Rising plasma estrogen
concentrations from maturing ovarian follicles trigger an increase in LHRH which
is released into the pituitary portal circulation. The rise in LHRH is critical
for release of pituitary hormones and subsequently, ovulation. Using this state-
of-the-art technique, Dr. Peterson will identify estrogen- sensitive neuronal
systems which activate LHRH neurons. This information can be used to help
understand how neurons making the same product can control different brain
functions involved in reproduction and other hormone-regulated physiological
functions.
