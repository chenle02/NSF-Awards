1his project, in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry
Program, will involve the synthesis and characterization of new iron thiolate
complexes that incorporate N-H to S hydrogen bonds, which are designed to serve
as models for iron-sulfur proteins. The objective of the study is to determine
the effect of such hydrogen bonds on the redox potential of the iron thiolate
complexes. The results are expected to provide significant insight into the way
in which the redox potentials are controlled in the biological molecules.
Characterization of the thiolate complexes will involve electrochemistry (cyclic
voltammetry), infrared and Raman scattering spectroscopies, and x-ray
crystallography. %%% Proteins that contain iron-sulfur clusters are involved in
a variety of electron transfer processes that occur in biological systems. The
precise driving force (redox potential) for these clusters varies in subtle ways
that are not yet understood. It has been hypothesized that hydrogen bonding to
other portions of the protein is responsible for "tuning" of the redox
potential. The objective of this research is to design and synthesize models for
the iron-sulfur clusters that will allow for a systematic test of this
hypothesis.
