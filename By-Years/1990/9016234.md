This award will support collaborative research between Drs. I.M. Navon and
James O'Brien, Florida State University, and two French researchers: Professor
F.X. LeDimet, Department of Mathematics, Blaise-Pascal University, Clermont-
Ferrand, and Professor Olivier Talagrand, Laboratory for Dynamic Meteoro- logy,
Ecole Normale Superieure, Paris. The objective of the project is to investigate
optimal control variational methods for data assimilation in meteorology and
oceanography with the aim of improving accuracy and predictability of
atmospheric and oceanic models. In global forecasting models, errors arise in
the numerical forecast mainly due to errors in the initial conditions and
deficiencies in the dynamics and physics of the models. Potential improvements
in numerical weather prediction (NWP) in the near future are expected to occur
as a result of either better physical parameterizations or from data improvement
in the accuracy of global observing systems. The use of adjoint models as an
application of the theory of optimal control for data assimilation has seen a
vigorous development in the last few years. The US and French investigators in
past collaboration have developed the adjoint of the NMC spectral model. In this
project, they will focus on related theoretical questions in the area of
optimization of algorithms, efficiency and scaling of complex problems. In
addition, they will study the inclusion in the adjoint NWP of variational data
assimilation of physical atmospheric processors, such as radiation and moisture
ther- modynamics. This project will benefit from the complementary expertise of
the investigators in optimal control theory and meteorology. The results of this
research will be important for enhancing the medium-range numerical weather
forecasting model's predictability and for taking advantage of various satellite
data which will shortly become available.
