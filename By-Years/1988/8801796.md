Our overall aim is to study photochemical mechanisms and to develop new
photochemical mechanistic methodology. Among the specific problems to be
investigated are the following: (1) A study of some allene rearrangements which
appear parallel to ( ) ketone counterparts ( ), (2) a search for the mirror
image process, where a ( ) excited is involved, (3) completion of the synthesis
and study of bugatriyne, a bicyclic Mobius type of molecule with three
acetylenic bridges, (4) synthesis and study of the hexa-yne relative of
bugatriyne, (5) use of chiral quenchers to determine whether species along the
reaction coordinate are subject to energy transfer, (6) continuation of our
efforts on solid state photochemistry and means of controlling the solid state
medium, (7) investigation of hypersurfaces for many of the reactions we have
studied, including a comparison of the theoretical methods, (8) continuing our
energy transfer studies using the rod-like molecules we have synthesized to
ascertain if we really do have sigma exciton transfer, (9) utilization of bond-
oriented basis set orbitals in SCF_CI calculations to give results meaningful to
organic chemical studies, (10) testing of our ( ) treatment to our quantum
mechanical results to assess energy localization and diffusion during
photochemical reaction, (11) exploration of the "Mechanism C" triplet
rearrangement of vinylcyclopropenes to determine regioselectivity and to uncover
the mechanisms of the diradical ring expansions, (12) determination of the
mechanism of rearrangement of the acylcyclopropenes as well as imine and thione
relatives, (13) investigation of the generality and sources of "Exchange
Integral Control" of reaction multiplicity, (14) development of new
photochemical concepts.
