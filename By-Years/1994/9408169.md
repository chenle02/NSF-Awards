Decomposition of woody litter is a major process contributing to biogeochemical
cycling and productivity in forested ecosystems. Because woody litter can amount
to 22% of above biomass, it represents a substantial source of nutrients for
plant uptake and carbon dioxide for release to the atmosphere. However, factors
affecting decomposition and rate of carbon dioxide and nutrient release from
logs remain poorly known. Saprotroph colonization patterns and biodiversity, as
affected by moisture content, have been ascribed and important role in the
decomposition process. The importance of these factors has not been evaluated
experimentally. Our objective is to evaluate the influence of log moisture
content and Saprotroph community development on log decomposition and
mineralization rates. We will test hypothesis that (1) initial rates of
decomposition processes are determined by the depth of penetration by insects
and establishment of decay vs. non-decay fungi, (2) decomposition rate is a
function of moisture content of logs, and (3) decomposition rate is positively
related to the diversity of the saprotroph community. We expect decomposition
and mineralization rates to increase incrementally from uncolonized logs to logs
penetrated by insect tunnels, to insect tunnels colonized by decay and/or non-
decay fungi. These hypotheses will be tested by comparing changes in wood
density and carbon/nutrient losses due to fragmentation, respiration, and
leaching in Douglas-fir logs with manipulated moisture content and manipulated
initial saprotroph colonization (phloem borers vs. sapwood borers, non-decay
fungi vs. decay fungi). Manipulation of saprotroph establishment in decomposing
logs will indicate the functional importance of biodiversity to this ecosystem
process.
