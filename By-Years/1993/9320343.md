9320343 Buckland Animal cell bioprocessing is currently one of the most
important areas of research in biomedical engineering and biotechnology. Until
recently, this was one of the least explored areas of bioprocessing. Recent
advances in the biological and medical sciences have opened many new
opportunities and challenges for cell culture based manufacturing. The emerging
area of tissue engineering is at a particular exciting stage of development. In
view of the recent rapid expansion of research and development in cell
culturing, a conference entirely devoted to Cell Culture Engineering is timely.
This conference will contribute to the elucidation of the engineering and
scientific principles of animal cell bioprocessing.
