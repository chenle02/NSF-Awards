AST 0307340&lt;br/&gt;PI: John Laird&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION: Bowling Green State
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. John Laird, in collaboration with
Bruce Carney of UNC, Chapel Hill, will carry out a suite of projects that are
aimed at developing a better understanding of the stellar populations in our
galaxy. They will pursue research activities in four broad areas: 1) following
up on their recent observations that suggest that the surprisingly high fraction
of field red horizontal branch and red giant branch stars that rotate may be
linked to planet accretion, 2) the exploration of the mass-luminosity
relationship for binary stars to constrain the stellar helium abundance, 3) a
study of metal-poor subgiant stars to refine metallicities and determine ages,
and 4) a study of local G dwarfs to investigate the chemical and dynamical
evolution of the thin and thick disk populations in the solar neighborhood, and
their full metallicity distribution functions, from which follow-up studies will
provide details on the element-to-iron ratios as a function of
[Fe/H].&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduate and graduate students will be
involved in the research. The research activities and results will be integrated
into K-16 science education through a masters program for in-service physical
science teachers that emphasizes modeling research-based teaching strategies,
and explicitly includes an astronomy component and a collaboration in northwest
Ohio of 7-12 educators, colleges, and community and business partners to enhance
recruiting, preparation, and support of 7-12 math and science teachers.
