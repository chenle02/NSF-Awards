This proposal requests support for the continued collection and analysis of
multi-instrument data at the Longyearbyen, Svalbard Observatory. Instrumented
with an all-sky camera, a meridian scanning photometer, riometer, induction and
fluxgate magnetometers, this site is well suited for studies of the cusp and
delineation of high latitude magnetospheric boundaries. The Longyearbyen
observatory is unique in the northern hemisphere in lying on the dark side of
the terminator at noon during northern winter. The sky is dark enough to allow
optical observation from late October to early February. The site has been
operated successfully for more than a decade. Studies of the multi instrument
data helps provide a context for interpretation unavailable for single
instrument measurements. While the magnetometers can be used to identify the
station location with regard to the major high-latitude current systems, the
optical instruments identify emissions associated with the various regions near
the cusp. As yet, it is not clear what processes the emissions and associated
geomagnetic pulsations represent; they may map boundaries or show the processes
confined by magnetospheric boundaries. The larger question is the goal of this
proposal. During this winter season, this campaign will allow us to study large
scale features of the cusp region and their development in time. Associated with
impulsive events at the magnetopause, arcs and waves are detected which require
study before a positive identification can be made. When combined with satellite
data, the data suite is sufficient to begin the process of identifying
ionospheric signatures of auroral forms associated the the cusp.
