This award is for participation in the Plains Elevated Convection at Night
(PECAN) field campaign. PECAN will take place in the central United States in
the summer of 2015. The focus of the project is on overnight thunderstorm
complexes that regularly occur in the Great Plains area. A variety of
observational systems will be put in place for the field experiment including
multiple aircraft, mobile radars, and ground-based systems that can profile the
wind and particles in the lower atmosphere. This project will provide funding
for researchers to take part in the deployment of the NOAA P-3 research
aircraft. The P-3 will have a variety of sensors with cloud particle probes and
airborne radar as key measurements. The researchers will help collect, quality
control, and analyze the data in order to study the key questions surrounding
nocturnal elevated convection. The main impact from this research will be better
forecasts of overnight storms, which often come with severe winds and flooding
rains. The project will also help train the future generation of scientists by
involving multiple graduate students in the research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
steering committee for the PECAN campaign has identified four main research
topics to be addressed: 1) Nocturnal convection initiation and early evolution
of mesoscale convective clusters; 2) Bore and other wave-like disturbances; 3)
Dynamics and microphysics of nocturnal mesoscale convective systems; 4)
Prediction of nocturnal convection initiation and evolution. This research will
focus on the third topic. In-situ cloud microphysical data, ground based and
airborne radar data, and the results of numerical modeling simulations will be
used to test the main hypothesis; microphysical cooling processes in developing
and mature stratiform regions of mesoscale convective systems force downdraft
circulations that create bore and mesoscale gravity wave features on the stable
nocturnal boundary layer that in turn focuses, organizes and maintains future
convective activity.
