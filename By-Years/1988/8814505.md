This project will convene a workshop of international experts to review the
state-of-the-art for structural response, measurements and the use of related
sensors. The subjects to be discussed are: o measurement requirements for
assessing structural performance, integrity, remaining life, and structures
under construction. o state-of-the-art in sensor technology and new directions o
micro computer interface systems and real time operating systems o data handling
analysis and interpretation.
