This proposal is concerned with problems of theoretical and computational
linear algebra. Five topics of continuing research are proposed. Three of the
topics are involved with synchronous and asynchronous parallel iterative methods
for numerical solution of linear systems of equations. The remaining two topics
are involved with matrix theory and linear algebra. In particular, they are 1)
an analytic approach to nonnegative bases for the generalized eigenspace of
nonnegative matrix and 2) the determination of reachability sets for nonnegative
orthant of a linear dynamic system approximated by finite differences.
