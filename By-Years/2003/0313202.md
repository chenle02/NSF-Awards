This project explores the benefits of adaptation in developing e-learning
environments for middle-school mathematics. Two complementary forms of
adaptation will be studied - macro and micro. Macroadaptation uses incoming
student information to recommend differences in the way in which content is
presented - things such as student inductive reasoning capabilities or various
physical disabilities are examples of macroadaptation conditions.
Microadaptation bases decisions on student behavior during the learning process.
The project will look at 8th grade algebra and the study of patterns -
arithmetic and geometric sequences. The project will culminate in a controlled
trial testing tutor adaptation against no tutor adaptation.
