This proposal seeks funds to develop a 3D Reconstruction Center in the School of
Science and the School of Medicine at Indiana University-Purdue University at
Indianapolis. This facility will serve three primary functions: 1) support and
extend several on- going research projects in the Department of Biology and
Anatomy, 2) provide the computer tools through which interaction among faculty
will be enhanced, and 3) allow the researchers in Indianapolis to participate in
the developing and testing of 3D reconstruction software with their colleagues
at the University of Washington in Seattle. Many investigations in the life
sciences would benefit from the ability to create three dimensional models of
their objects of study. These models are necessary for the understanding of the
interrelationships among the parts which comprise the whole. The mathematics of
applied geometry are well-known, but are computational intensive. The latest
generation of microcomputers have become powerful enough to handle such
computational problems. Our group is seeking the computer hardware, software,
and necessary peripherals to record images of serial sections, enter those
images into the computer, process the 2 dimensional images into 3 dimensional
models that can be manipulated, dissected, explored and copied onto paper and
slides. The benefits of funding this project are in an increase in productivity
of a wide variety of investigations, enhanced understanding by other
investigators through better presentation of research findings and cooperation
in development of new algorithms to provides more powerful software for the life
sciences.
