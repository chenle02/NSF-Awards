0229657&lt;br/&gt;Shen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a five-year
proposal submitted by Dr. Hung Tao Shen, Clarkson University, to support
continual funding for the REU site on Marine Science and Engineering, in
collaboration with Ocean University of Qingdao and Dalian University of
Technology in China. The East Asia and Pacific Program first funded this REU
site program in China in 2000. This program has been well received by student
participants. Many participants indicated that this program has contributed to
their selection of marine science or engineering as a
career.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an important part of activities to
encourage American Workforce and Research and Education (AWARE) Experience in
East Asia. This program has enabled U.S. students to gain research experience
and interest in China, and developed their capabilities to participate in
international scientific and engineering activities. This program also enable
the Chinese participants, including mentors, graduate students, and
undergraduates, to gain the experience of working with future U.S. scientists
and engineers. The results of this program can enhance our mutual understanding
of research environments and educational systems, and improve science teaching
and learning in the U.S. and China. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
