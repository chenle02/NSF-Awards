This project will bring more contemporary physics into the college introductory
physics curricula by improving the laboratory instruction in modern physics.
Recent developments by commercial companies have provided functional units of
modern physics equipment for undergraduate instructional purposes. These units
are multi-purpose in design so several correlated, but distinct principles of
contemporary physics may be experimentally investigated. The major functional
units to be purchased will supplement modern physics instrumentation presently
on hand in the department. Experiments will be organized around the physics of
the electron, and will include: 1. Physics of Electron System: (The systematic
study of the electron: "e/m", the Hertz critical potentials: "e" energy levels,
electron diffraction: dual nature of electron, Planck's "Quantum of Action"
principle.) 2. Electron-Spin Resonance System: (Magnetic moment of electron due
to its spin; electron resonance; Lande' factor.) The intent is to provide pre-
engineering students with an education comparable to that received by students
in engineering schools they transfer to. The college will match the award with
an equal amount of funds.
