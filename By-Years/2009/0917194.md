This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;Increasingly, computation and storage are moving
into a planetary cloud accessible across ever-widening Internet pipes.
Unfortunately, asynchrony, failures, and heterogeneity make it difficult to
harness available computing power and storage, with inherent tradeoffs in
performance, data consistency, and availability. The goal of this research is to
raise the level of abstraction for building planetary-scale services, in
particular to: i) make fault tolerant and high-performance storage a baseline
abstraction for a variety of services, and ii) simplify the process of building
extensible and distributed data structures that match the requirements of a
range of services.&lt;br/&gt;Taken together, this project has the potential to
effect a qualitative shift in our ability to deploy next-generation high-
performance and highly available network services. First, application developers
will be able to leverage fault tolerant, locality-aware data storage as a given
for their distributed applications. Second, the research will deliver primitives
to ease the problem of deploying new distributed data structures. We will
provide the abstractions to manage distribution, replications, and faults in
these environments.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this project will include
leveraging our infrastructure to conduct studies of large-scale service
architectures, first in advanced graduate courses and later in undergraduate
courses, and a public release of the replication and extensible data structure
software underlying our work for research and educational purposes.&lt;br/&gt;
