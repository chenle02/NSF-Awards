This award will support the participation of ten undergraduate biology students
each year, the majority of whom are expected to be African-American, in the
Research Experiences for Undergraduates program offered by the Mt. Desert Island
biologicalLaboratory in Salsbury Cove, Maine. This program, will allow each
student to spend eight weeks working at the bench, paired with a senior
scientist leading a research team working on timely questions involving marine
physiology. Using sharks, skates, flounder and other sea animals, students will
explore questions at the mechanistic level concerning reproduction,
osmoregulation, acid base balance and ion transport. Orientation lectures on
basic concepts of marine physiology and molecular biology during the first week
will be supplemented by weekly evening lectures on these subjects designed to
encourage discussion by the students. Undergraduates will attend three weekly
laboratory-wide science seminars on topics related to marine physiology. They
will participate in a campus-wide ethics course taught by expert lecturers and
by group discussions of cases illustrating the ethical issues with which
scientists are confronted. Four noontime discussions led by knowledgeable
ethicists and involving REU students and their mentors will address subjects
such as the use of animals and humans as research subjects, ethics of genetics
research and environmental ethics. The research experience will be completed by
each student giving a talk to the laboratory community on his/her results and
writing a research paper for publication in the laboratory Bulletin. This award
will foster the continued education and training of individuals who will be part
of the next generation of basic researchers in marine physiology. It will also
help to inform young citizens about ethical questions in science and aspects of
management and decision making in environmental issues.
