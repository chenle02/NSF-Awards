&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AST-0307417&lt;br/&gt;Bershady&lt;br/&gt;The PI will
determine independently the mass distributions of the disk and halo components
of nearby, face-on spiral galaxies through direct, kinematic measurements. Such
determinations are central to testing galaxy formation models. The actual
observations are Ha and stellar velocity fields and velocity dispersions out to
several disk scale lengths. Face-on systems favorably project the vertical
component of the velocity ellipsoid, which is directly related to the mass of a
disk of a given scale-height. Stellar scale-heights are well estimated by
linking detailed kinematic and photometric properties of edge-on and face-on
samples. Recent developments in large-aperture, integral-field instrumentation
by the P.I. now make possible the required medium resolution spectroscopy, and
give the best opportunity to date to measure disk mass and total mass
independently. These detailed studies of nearby galaxies provide a springboard
for the later observation and interpretation of high redshift systems using 10m
and future 30m-class telescopes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research program
includes graduate and undergraduate training in astronomical research,
observation, data analysis and especially instrumentation, public lectures,
infrastructure improvements for the WIYN 3.5m telescope, and international
collaboration with South African and German researchers.&lt;br/&gt;
