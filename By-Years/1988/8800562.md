This interagency agreement provides for the use of the facilities at the
Division of Computer Research and Technology, NIH. We will use the Statistical
Analysis System to aid in the analysis of several databases for internal
projects requested by the Executive Office of the President, the Congress, the
National Science Board, and the Office of the Director, NSF. The mainframe
computer system at NIH will be used by PRA to: - develop and store large
archival databases; - manipulate the large files to obtain databases tailored to
specific analysis requirements; and - download these analysis databases to the
PRA computer system. Access is obtained through remote hookup using the PRA
system.
