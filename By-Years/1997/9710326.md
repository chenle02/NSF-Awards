The PI is developing a complete kinetic description of ionospheric plasma
outflows from the collision-dominated region to the collisionless magnetospheric
plasma, providing continuous self-consistent coupling processes between the
different components of ionospheric plasmas along open and closed geomagnetic
field lines. This continued research, important for defining and understanding
plasma physics manifested in phenomena of the coupled ionosphere-magnetosphere
system, helps to develop a complete picture of near-Earth space.
