This project provided the chemistry curriculum at the institution with the
powerful and modern analytical techniques of gas chromatography and mass
spectrometry combined in a single instrument. The instrument was integrated into
the laboratory program at all levels, thereby benefitting approximately 200
students each year. The instrument is used for demonstration purposes in
freshman chemistry; in other courses, integrating these analytical techniques
into the curriculum is serving the following goals: providing practical
experience in obtaining and interpreting mass spectral data; demonstrating the
physical principles of GC/MS; hands-on experience with modern, computer-
controlled instrumentation; and improving the scientific capabilities of
undergraduate research projects. Some experiments that can accomplish the above
goals involve the identification of unknowns, analysis of complex mixtures of
reactions, and the characterization of synthesized compounds in inorganic and
organic chemistry. The institution contributed to this project in an amount
equal to the NSF funds.
