McCartney 9711875 As part of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE)
Indian Ocean Expedition, the PI was lead scientist on the first two hydrographic
cruises in the southeastern part of the basin. These hydrographic surveys
covered two nearly meridional lines between western Australia and Antarctica,
crossing the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Preliminary analysis has revealed a
number of features not previously observed. Support will be used to carry out an
analysis of these features, leading to a complete quantitative circulation
description, including the abyssal, mid-depth, and thermocline/upper water
column strata, and including comparison of these 1994-5 data to older
hydrography to link observed subtropical thermocline, SubAntarctic Mode Water
(SAMW) and Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) water mass changes to high
latitude source changes.
