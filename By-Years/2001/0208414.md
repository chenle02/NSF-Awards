This study will combine solar images derived from SOHO/LASCO and EIT and in-situ
solar wind observations of interplanetary shocks with magnetohydrodynamic
simulations of the global characteristics of the shock. From this synthesis one
may derive information on the shock source location with respect to the Earth,
the size of the coronal mass ejection, the shock compression parameters and
characteristics of the magnetized plasma flow at its in situ observation at 1
AU. This information will be used to identify the effect on the level of solar
energetic particles at shock passage at 1 AU. As a result of this analysis, it
should thus be possible to develop a better forecast capability for radiation
levels at Earth than what is currently available through the NOAA space weather
service.
