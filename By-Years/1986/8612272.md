An exploratory effort is underway to define the capabilities for vision-based
robot control in real-time using one of the new parallel vision machines, the
PIPE computer. This will involve new challenges, notably the need to detect and
track moving objects as part of the control process. This will require extending
the capabilities of the vision-processing system and integration with a robot
arm to be controlled. The study should reveal potential problems that will need
to be addressed in working later toward real-time, vision-based adaptive control
of robots. Until this preliminary exploration is done, it would be difficult to
produce a meaningful proposal for the more major long-term research effort.
