Groups are basic objects in mathematics - expressing symmetries
of&lt;br/&gt;various objects. The groups themselves can be described by
generators&lt;br/&gt;and relations - so called "presentations of groups". Given
a group, one&lt;br/&gt;may want to understand its "representation" i.e. the way
to present&lt;br/&gt;the group as a group of matrices over the field of complex
numbers.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will focus on quantitative questions of
both&lt;br/&gt;aspects: How eÂ±ciently can a group be presented? How many
genera-&lt;br/&gt;tors and relations are needed and what is their length? The
motivation&lt;br/&gt;for these questions comes from computational group theory:
an efficient&lt;br/&gt;presentation is important for efficient
computation.&lt;br/&gt;The quantitative aspects of representation theory deal
with questions&lt;br/&gt;of the form: What is the rate of growth of the number
of representations&lt;br/&gt;as a function of the dimension? It is an
elaboration of the theory of&lt;br/&gt;subgroup growth which deals with
permutational representations.&lt;br/&gt;Usually presentations and
representations are very much disjoint in&lt;br/&gt;their studies. One of the
interesting features of the proposed research&lt;br/&gt;is a connection between
the two. If successful, it can shed new light on&lt;br/&gt;the representation
theory of the automorphism group of the free group&lt;br/&gt;and of the mapping
class groups.
