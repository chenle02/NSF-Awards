9400974 Jiang The research entails connectedness properties of Julia sets in
complex dynamical systems. A local connectedness property already established
for certain cases is proposed to be established in a more general context. This
research is in the mainstream of ideas of modern dynamical systems. Work of this
type has applications to fractals and chaos. Since this area has become
increasingly visual and more accessible to other scientific fields, there is
potential educational value. ***
