Computation of transition rates between different protein conformations has
important applications in protein engineering and structure-based drug design.
However, conventional molecular dynamics and transition state theory methods are
unable to cope with the extremely high dimensionality of most practically
important problems, even large-scale parallel computing. To significantly
improve the efficiency of these computations, the PIs are developing a new class
of methods that utilizes hierarchical coarse-grained analysis of protein
potential energy landscapes. In preliminary tests of low-dimensional (1-12)
model systems they have shown that this method can improve computational
efficiency by two orders-of magnitude. They will extend this approach first to
the computational study of conformational transitions of peptides, and
subsequently to proteins. Multiple-level parallelization will be an important
component of the algorithmic developments required for these extensions.
Training will be collaboratively guided by two members of the Cornell Theory
Center who together can provide instruction both in parallel computing and
compuational biophysics.
