This project is establishing an undergraduate scientific visualization
laboratory at the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse. Visualization technology is
changing the way in which science is performed by providing new ways to
apprehend structure in science. For exactly these reasons, visualization
technology can have a profound impact on the way undergraduate students study
science. The laboratory being established consists of three-dimensional graphics
workstations and a compatible video projector. Software to support applications
of scientific visualization is being obtained through a combination of local
development, using student programmers, and commercial sources. The project
members are beginning development of applications in Quantum Chemistry, X-Ray
Diffraction, Protein Conformation and Function, Numerical Solutions of
Differential Equations, Orbital Mechanics, and Neural Networks. Providing
undergraduate students with access to visualization technology will have a deep
and lasting effect on their understanding of science and their motivation to
pursue further study.
