Programmable Graph Architectures For High Level Transformations
of&lt;br/&gt;Multimedia
Applications&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this research
we will investigate transformational algorithms, architecture, and design of
programmable graph architectures, to map high-level representations of
multimedia operations directly into hardware. We expect that this spatial
mapping will substantially increase the computational density of processor
chips, especially for those computations that make extensive use of matrix
operations. The computations on these programmable graph architectures will rely
on transforms between matrix groups and Cayley graphs rather than traditional
arithmetic and logic operations used by conventional microprocessors. In
particular, we plan to: (i) establish an instruction set for programmable graph
architectures that is computationally efficient for multimedia applications;
(ii) provide efficient algorithms to transform these instructions to graph
routing problems in Cayley graphs; and (iii) examine the optimization issues
pertaining to the design parameters of Cayley graphs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We
expect this investigation to lead to prototypes of next generation multimedia
machine architectures that are likely to be significantly different from the
conventional fine-grained microarchitectures of today. The design and
development of efficient multimedia processor architectures is important due to
the increasing role of multimedia in everyday applications.&lt;br/&gt;
