The goal of this collaborative project is to improve the current measurement of
cosmological quantities, in particular the Hubble constant and the Dark Energy
component, using time delay measurements from strong gravitational lenses acting
upon quasars. This includes analysis of already taken data, as well as the
anticipated discovery of approximately 50 new lenses. Gravitational time delays
are not only independent of other methods but are also a very cost effective
probe, requiring just a few hours on an 8-10m telescope for modeling the lens,
and subsequent monitoring on 1m class telescopes.

Broader impacts of the work include training of graduate students and
postdoctoral researchers. At the K-12 level, Dr. Treu collaborates with the
Santa Barbara Museum of Natural history (SBMNH) and Las Cumbres Observatories
GlobalTelescope Network to organize public lectures, and establish an astronomy
curriculum at the UC-operated Sedgwick Natural Reserve. Similarly, Dr. Fassnacht
has developed a month-long course for high-school students on the Davis campus
as part of the UC COSMOS program.
