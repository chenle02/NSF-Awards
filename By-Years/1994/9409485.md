Project Summary Lummerzheim/ATM-9409485 This project will develop a model that
can self-consistently explain the formation of auroral rays. Rays frequently
sprout above auroral arcs, extending upwards from the arc at regularly spaced
intervals. The PIs will develop a model that attributes the generation of rays
to collisions of locally accelerated electrons with the neutral gas. The model
will contain a parallel electric field resulting from a tearing mode
instability, the relevant ionospheric chemistry, and particle transport in a
self-consistent formulation. Predictions will be made about the dynamics,
brightness, spatial distribution, and temporal evolution of rays that can be
tested by observations.
