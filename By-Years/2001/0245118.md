This award supports research into the thermal and mechanical noise of optical
materials and coatings considered for use by the next generation of the Laser
Interferometric Gravitational wave Observatory (Advanced LIGO). The test masses
for Advanced LIGO are to be made from either sapphire or fused silica. Sapphire
is mechanically superior under most criteria but suffers from increased loss at
low frequencies and, at present, unacceptably high optical absorption. Fused
silica has low absorption and has a mechanical loss that, for suitably prepared
samples, is below the Advanced LIGO design limits. However, this low mechanical
loss has never been seen in large samples. The PI in collaboration with other
LIGO scientists will study loss mechanisms in fused silica in an effort to make
large, low loss optics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LIGO and Advanced LIGO are designed
to search for gravitational waves whose direct detection would open a new window
on some of the universe's most violent events such as black hole collisions and
supernova explosions. This research forms part of the critical path to the
development of Advanced LIGO. Undergraduates will participate in this research.
