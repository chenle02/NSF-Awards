Abstract Narrative Professor Harrington will conduct a mail survey of U.S.
companies engaged in the manufacture of semiconductor components. Survey data on
products, markets, production facilities, and workforce characteristics will be
integrated with data from other sources on local labor markets and on the
semiconductor industry generally. The goal of the research is to relate internal
firm activities and business strategies to the locational behavior and regional
impacts of those firms. This research will bridge a gap between work that
focuses on the spatial division of labor within narrowly-defined industries and
studies of local economies dominated by externally-owned establishments. It will
produce information on the enterprise-specific effects of industrial location
and change. In addition to deepening our general understanding of the operations
of local labor markets, Professor Harrington's research will improve the ability
of economic development planners to forecast the impacts of specific industrial
location decisions.
