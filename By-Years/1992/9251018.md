The consortium is purchasing a panoramic solid state optical detector (a
Photometrics CCD and auxiliary hardware and software) to install on the 24 inch
telescope at the Williston Observatory of Mount Holyoke College. The telescope
will be used by students from the Five College Astronomy Department and this
upgrade is the next phase of a department-wide effort to provide undergraduate
students with hands-on training with modern instrumentation. It will provide
training for students in the operation, calibration, and use of CCDs for
astronomical imaging and spectroscopy. The Five College Astronomy Department
will interface the camera to the telescope and spectrograph, provide a
technician for operation and maintenance, develop laboratories for freshman
through senior level classes, and involve students in a variety of independent
research projects.
