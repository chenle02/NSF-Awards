This project has the goal of improving the introductory physics laboratory
courses taken by scientists and engineers. The physics department is replacing
the computer-based data- acquisition and analysis equipment used in these
courses so that students learn to use general purpose computer data- acquisition
hardware, general purpose data-acquisition software, data analysis software
based on a spreadsheet, and report preparation software as part of a first
semester general physics laboratory course. Having acquired the ability to use
these and other essential laboratory tools, students use these general purpose
tools and work more independently in the second semester laboratory course. This
two semester laboratory course sequence builds on student knowledge of computer
hardware and software; it also prepares students for upper division laboratory
courses and for research participation. The major software package used is
LabVIEW, a graphic based language which allows students to easily program the
computer interface to deal with each experimental problem.NSF grant funds are
being matched with funds from non-federal sources.
