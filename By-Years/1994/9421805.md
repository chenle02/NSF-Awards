This will be one of the very first ecological studies to examine the role of
primates in the regeneration of fragmented forests. Data collected in this study
in central Belize on the ecological effects of the howler monkey will be used to
test hypotheses concerning the relationship between the diet and activity
patterns of these monkeys and seed dispersal and establishment and understory
structure. The project will also result in the training of a new scientific
professional
