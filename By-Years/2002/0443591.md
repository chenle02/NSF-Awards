This Small Grant for Exploratory Research will take advantage of opportunities
arising from an earlier grant from the Digital Govnernment program (9983468) and
has two objectives: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Quickly, while government program
managers who partnered on the earlier award are still in place, develop backend
systems that allow data sharing among different agencies and the front-end
interface system that will be visible to the citizens and businesses of the
State of New Jersey. This effort will lead to technology transfer of the
prototype system to the State of New Jersey. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Conduct a
transnational comparison evaluation study of similar human-centered systems for
government on-line services in European Union countries. This effort will
provide critical knowledge for developing US/EU digital government research
collaborations and might lead to technology sharing among several countries. The
study will concentrate on developing a methodology for comparative analysis and
surveying of the European case literature, and will help establish common
discussion areas between different projects and programs that aim to achieve the
similar objectives.
