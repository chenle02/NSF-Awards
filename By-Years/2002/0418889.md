The award from the Chemistry Division supports an Undergraduate Research Centers
(URC) planning grant. The PI is Preetha Ram. The co-PIs are John H. Hall of
Morehouse College, Lilia C. Harvey of Agnes Scott College, Rigoberto Hernandez
of Georgia Institute of Technology and Dennis C. Liotta of Emory University. The
initiative will also involve partners from Clark Atlanta University, Georgia
Perimeter College, Georgia State University and Spelman College. The overall aim
of the partnership, AURA (Atlanta Undergraduate Research Alliance), is to
explore mechanisms to expand the reach of undergraduate research to include
students who under present curricula, culture and infrastructure would not
participate in significant undergraduate research experiences. It will identify
infrastructure, communications and resources required to create an URC, identify
the cultural and institutional barriers to undergraduate research and provide a
foundation to bring reform and enrichment of curricula through undergraduate
research experiences. AURA will develop, investigate and test the feasibility of
models that can expand the reach of undergraduate research and be shared with a
wider audience. The planning grant will implement a pilot project to introduce
first year students to research techniques, provide students at smaller colleges
with greater access to interdisciplinary research, and build research
collaborations that will maximize research opportunities and accomplishments
that include mechanisms for sharing research instrumentation and facilities, and
development of cyber-infrastructure to facilitate inter-institutional
undergraduate research communities. The partners will explore mechanisms to
expand AURA to other institutions.
