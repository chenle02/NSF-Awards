This research program studies the materials science and physics of the growth of
very high-quality gallium arenide/aluminum gallium arsenide heterojunction thin-
film structures using the molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) technique. The first
objective of the research is to optimize the MBE growth of high-quality,
selectively-doped interfaces and heterostructure thin films with minimal
imperfections. Such structures will make accessible a new regime in
semiconductor physics where new phenomena will result from electron-electron
interactions as well as one- electron physics in the very long mean-free-path
limit. Studies of these phenomena through quantum transport measurements are the
second objective of the research.
