9500727 Avignone The Institute for Theoretical and Experimental Physics in
Moscow (ITEP) recently joined Phase-II of the International Germanium Experiment
(IGEX). Their contribution of 9kg of isotopically enriched germanium (86% 76Ge
valued at about 15 M$) is being used in detectors to search for neutrinoless
double beta decay (physics beyond the standard model). IGEX Phase-II involves
the University of South Carolina,k Columbia the Institute for Nuclear Research
Moscow, Battelle Pacific Northwest Laboratory, and the Universities of Minnesota
and Zaragoza (Spain). Thus far, 3 small detectors about (0.7 kg) and two large
detectors (2.1kg) have been fabricated. They are now operating in the Carfranc
tunnel in Spain. Another large detector is in preparation. For a meaningful
collaboration, the ITEP participants must be involved in all phases of the
experiment at Carfranc. This request is for support for three 3-months working
visits for 3 ITEP collaborators per year. Very difficult conditions in Russia
make IGEX the major scientific activity for about 10 Russian Physicists. This
experiment would have been financially impossible without the generous
contributions of INR and ITEP. ***
