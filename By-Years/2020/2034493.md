The Academic Data Science Alliance (ADSA) was created to enable the broad
dissemination of new approaches and best practices in data science to colleges
and universities nationwide. ADSAâ€™s goals are to provide community resources and
events for academic data scientists at any level to share research advances and
educational approaches. ADSA also provides a collaboration space for university
leadership to share their challenges and success stories around programs for
data science. ADSA supports a peer network of early career academic data
scientists to forge collaborations and implement novel training approaches on
their campuses. This project supports the ADSA Annual Meeting and the Data
Science Leadership Summit. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ADSA Annual Meeting
provides an opportunity for academic researchers at any level (graduate
students, postdocs, staff researchers and faculty) to collectively address
common issues in data science research, education and training, program
administration, and advocacy for data scientist career paths in higher
education. The Data Science Leadership Summit convenes heads of current and
nascent data science programs, and faculty interested in creating new
initiatives on their campuses: to form an academic community for data science;
to share best practices where they face similar challenges and opportunities;
and to take collective responsibility in preparing next-generation data
scientists to contribute in the best interests of society. The ADSA Career
Development Network provides a peer-network for early career academic data
scientists to support each other in their professional development. Outcomes
from these meetings are provided online for public
consideration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
