9550123 Fridley The State of Utah is in the process of reviewing its secondary
core science curriculum. They have determined that about one-third of the major
objectives within the 9th grade curriculum are related to global changes in the
oceans or atmosphere. Thus, as they say a "planning grant will provide Utah with
an opportunity to assure that global change education remains prominent within
the statewide ninth grade science curriculum; that teachers have exemplary
lesson plans with local and statewide resources to help teach global change;
that formal and informal community resources focused on global change are
coordinated with the work of teachers and administrators in global change
education; and that plans can be made to secure future sources of revenue to
continue global change education training and coordination." A steering
committee made up of teachers and science coordinators will develop a five year
plan and establish a resource database. The impact of the program will be
statewide, especially at the ninth grade level. Planning activities include a
variety of meetings that will move the plan forward from concept to curriculum
plans, by increasing the networks of interested teachers and administrators,
developing a database including lesson plans produced by others about global
change education. These will be evaluated for potential use in Utah. No-cost
sharing information is provided.
