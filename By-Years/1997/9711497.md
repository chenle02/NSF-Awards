Developing numerical integrated-assessment models to understand and develop
policies to reduce the impacts of global climate change is a major research
priority for the social and natural sciences. This research will continue work
by the principal investigator to improve integrated assessment models by
developing a new version of the Dynamic Integrated Model of Climate and the
Economy (the DICE model). The DICE model is a globally aggregated model
integrating a general-equilibrium model of the global economy with a climate
system including emissions, concentrations, climate change, impacts, and
efficient policy. This research will focus on two specific areas. First, the
research will update the underlying data and components to reflect developments
in the natural and social sciences since the model was developed. Second, the
new version of the DICE model (tentatively called the `NEWDICE` model) will
incorporate three new methodological approaches: using a production function to
represent the emissions-output tradeoff, incorporation of fossil fuel supplies
to reflect the finite nature of the carbon base, and an attempt to incorporate
an innovation possibility function to reflect the induced character of
technological change.
