9417091 Jeffries This award supports a two-year cooperative research project led
by Dr. Stuart Jeffries of the Bartol Research Institute and Professor Yoji Osaki
of the University of Tokyo. The collaborators will study the composition and
dynamics of the Sun s interior and atmosphere through measurement of its
acoustic oscillations (helioseismology.) The collaboration is a natural
combination of expertise: the U.S. team has obtained some of the highest
quality, imaged, helioseismic data currently available whereas the Japanese
researchers are theoreticians in solar oscillations. By combining these
expertises, the two groups can achieve a deeper understanding and more rapid
progress than can either group alone. Therefore, this proposal fulfills the
objectives of the Program in its exchange and transfer of scientific knowledge
through an international collaboration. ***
