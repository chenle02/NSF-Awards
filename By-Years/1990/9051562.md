All existing chemical engineering laboratories are deficient in the provision of
visualization experiments. Students have to conduct an experiment in the
laboratory and then perform calculations before a clear understanding of the
experiment is obtained. Much of the opportunity for learning in the laboratory
is thus lost. This project will considerably improve the learning process by the
design and implementation reaction kinetics and mass transfer. Each experiment
involves the use of color changes obtained by the illumination or chemical
reaction of dyes. The color change allows the student to watch the experiment
(e.g., as the reaction advances) and the change can be measure by using either a
spectrophotometer, interferometer or thermal imaging systems. This change is
directly proportional to the extent of the reaction and quantitative results are
readily obtained. The result can be taken manually or with data acquisition
systems. Experiments in liquid Extraction, control and kinetics in plug flow and
continuous stirred tank reactors, visualization of flow around tubes, bends and
fittings, heat exchangers and the temperature profiles in a glass distillation
column are conducted. Each experiment employs the latest advances in flowmeters,
pressures transducers and other instrumentation.
