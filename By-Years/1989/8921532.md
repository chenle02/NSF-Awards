Memory is a concept that is invoked to account for a complex set of behavioral
phenomena. This research will provide important information on the relationship
between specific neural substrates and the behavioral components of a memory.
This proposal is particularly worthwhile because it attempts to integrate much
of what is known different psychological processes and theories and their
underlying neurological bases.
