This two-year award provides support for US-France cooperative research aimed
at understanding how to control super and molecular level structures of liquid
crystalline polymers and liquid crystalline block copolymer materials. The
project involves the research groups of Edwin L. Thomas at Massachusetts
Institute of Technology and Jean- Claude Wittman and Bernard Lotz at the
Institut Charles Sadron in Strasbourg, France. The investigators will
characterize and process these materials. Thin films of polymer will be
processed to undergo microphase separation and liquid crystal formation on
highly oriented polytetrafluoroethylene substrates and under an applied electric
or magnetic field. The US research group brings to this collaboration expertise
in applied advanced electron microscopic techniques. This is complemented by
French expertise in crystal physics and orientational processing. The project
will advance understanding of substrate and field processing of liquid
crystalline polymeric materials and their optical applications.
