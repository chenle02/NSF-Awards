Following the Water: H2O in Subducting Slabs and Mantle
Wedges&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0208456&lt;br/&gt;PI: Holloway&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;H2O
(water) greatly influences many processes in the Earth. It is the most important
factor in determining if a volcanic eruption will be explosive or not. The
presence of small amounts of water in the minerals making up the Earth's mantle
can weaken normally rigid minerals allowing the mantle to flow at geologically
high velocities.&lt;br/&gt;In this project, we will conduct experiments at high
temperatures and pressures to determine which hydrous minerals, if any, can be
present in subducting oceanic crust, and at what depths those minerals
dehydrate. Such dehydration ultimately results in the formation of water-rich
magmas that often erupt very explosively.&lt;br/&gt;We also will do experiments
to determine how much water can dissolve in the crystal structure of the common
minerals (olivine, pyroxene, garnet) in the Earth's upper mantle that do not
contain specific structural sites for H2O. The presence of even small amounts of
water in such minerals is important because the minerals are so abundant in the
Earth's mantle that the aggregate water contained in them may equal one or more
times the total volume contained in the world's oceans. Additionally, the effect
of dissolved water in those minerals causes drastic changes in their strength
(or viscosity) and the velocity of seismic waves travelling through the mantle.
&lt;br/&gt;We will use a variety of modern very high-pressure devices and
advanced techniques for chemical analysis to complete the objectives of this
project. &lt;br/&gt;
