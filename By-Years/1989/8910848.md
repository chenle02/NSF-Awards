This research is based on the Larch family of specification languages, which
support a two-tiered definitional approach to specification. Each specification
has components written in two languages: one designed for a specific programming
language and another common to all programming languages. The former are called
Larch interface languages, and the latter the Larch Shared Language. Prior work
has concentrated on the Shared Language. The new work shifts attention to
interface languages; providing precise semantics for these languages, using them
to write substantial interface specifications, determining what checking should
be applied to these specifications, and developing tools for performing these
checks.
