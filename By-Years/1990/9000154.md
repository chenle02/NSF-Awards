Laboratory studies often shed light on oceanic processes. This PI has conducted
a number of layered model experiments and has used the results to interpret
ocean dynamics. This project is to construct a facility to perform continuously
stratified fluid experiments under the influence of flow contractions. An
obvious example of such a process is the flow through the Straits of Gibaraltar.
