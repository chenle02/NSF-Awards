The research entails the geometric aspects of Lie group theory to fundamental
problems in quantum field theory and other branches of mathematical physics. One
particular component of the research applies to the structure of the recently
discovered Carbon-60 molecule (Fulerene). Such investigations will have
potential applications to materials theory and molecular chemistry.
