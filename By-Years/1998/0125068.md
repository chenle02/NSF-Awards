The proposal plans to connect DePaul to Abilene via the MREN GigaPoP. The
connection would allow the School of Computer Science, Telecommunications and
Information Systems to fully participate in Internet2 research projects. These
projects have specialized needs including access to specialized network
facilities, access to high bandwiths, access to collaborators on the high-speed
national network.
