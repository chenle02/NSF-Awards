Banach space theory is a basic tool of mathematical analysis that has been of
importance since its inception at the turn of the century. It has increasingly
more significant rapport with, and important applications to, various areas of
modern analysis and probability theory. World centers of excellence in this area
are in Israel, Paris, Warsaw, Ohio, and Texas. Professor Lewis is an expert in
the internal structure theory and geometry of Banach spaces. He has been one of
the important contributors to the computation of parameters of finite
dimensional spaces, and his work has influenced substantially the development of
Banach space theory. Professor Lewis will continue his investigations into the
geometry of Banach spaces through a study of the numerical characteristics of
the spaces and the applications to qualitative properties of spaces and
operators. He will consider relative and absolute projection constants, exact
values of projection parameters, and invertibility of linear maps.
