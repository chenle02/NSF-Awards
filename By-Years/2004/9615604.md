AST-9615604 Daniel Boice An intensive international observing campaign is
focussing on comet Hale-Bopp as it reaches perihelion in April, 1997. Using
existing observations and those anticipated from the campaign, this research
team will construct a global model of Hale-Bopp using an existing suite of
computer codes. The goal is to use this global model to make predictions of the
comet's behavior to aid in the collection of additional data and to help
understand its physico-chemical nature, in particular the mixing ratios of
volatiles relative to water to ascertain the icy composition of the nucleus.
