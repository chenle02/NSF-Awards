This research involves the study of a new class of energy efficient
optimization-based algorithms for localization in wireless sensor networks
(WSNs) that can be used when conventional localization techniques such as GPS
are not available (e.g. when WSN users are indoors). Such a system operates
using only comparative distance measurements (as opposed to exact distance
measurements) which precludes the need for strict clock synchronization among
devices and enables heterogeneous cross-platform WSNs. Computation is
implemented using the distributed capacity of the WSNs. The performance and
energy efficiency of the algorithms are validated theoretically and by a
combination of simulation and experimentation on an Android test bed. This
research has diverse application areas such as health monitoring (location-aware
patient care), security (first responders), and consumer electronics (location
awareness in indoor malls).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research involves
investigation into a new approach to localization in sensor networks where exact
distance measurements are not required ? sensors need only comparative and
ordinal distance measurements. This approach eliminates the need for strict
clock synchronization between devices, or exact knowledge of operating
conditions and environmental constants. It also eliminates the need for
specialized hardware or external devices, making it possible to explore
localization-based WSN applications on mobile phones and tablets in cross-
platform environments. The research methodology involves the application of
convex optimization to solve a Euclidean distance embedding problem. While such
an approach has been used in areas such as image denoising and pattern
recognition, it has never been proposed for localization in a WSN. Specific
research topics include using optimization-based sensor localization, and
parameter and function estimation via distributed computation. A testbed of
Android devices is used to validate results.
