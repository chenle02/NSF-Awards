This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project consists of emergency
conservation and analysis of several Early Holocene organic tools from the
Gerstle River site, in central Alaska. Excavation in 2008 recovered three
organic points in well-stratified contexts, with what appear to be slots for
microblade insets. These finds are directly associated with Component 3 at the
site, dating to ~10,100 cal BP. The points are worked: some exhibit hafting
elements and may also contain embedded lithics (some silt has yet to be
removed). The organic artifacts are have been recovered from intermittently
frozen soils and are drying out, necessitating immediate stabilization efforts
as well as long-term conservation. The remains are currently stable, provided
they do not undergo handling, which limits analyses that can be performed. Once
conserved, they will undergo X-ray analysis to help describe the morphology and
to identify any small lithics that might remain embedded in the slots. Residue-
analysis, lithic analysis, and technological (manufacturing techniques) analyses
will be performed once the artifacts are conserved.
