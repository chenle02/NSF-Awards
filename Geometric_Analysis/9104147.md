Professor Johnson will study questions of rigidity and the existence of certain
anomalous behaviors in the class of unimodal maps with a negative Schwarzian
derivative and a nondegenerate critical point. He will work on the question of
whether if two maps in this class are conjugate then they are quasi-
symmetrically conjugate and whether von Neumann's type III can occur in this
class. He will also study topological and measure theoretic dependence on
parameter values. Professor Johnson's project concerns a very elementary
dynamical system where, surprisingly, there is still much that is unknown. He
will study a function on the unit interval of the real line into itself and its
iterations as a model of more complicated dynamical systems. His main interest
is in classifying these functions. Here two are considered in the same class
when a stretching and shrinking of parts of the interval (keeping the length
constant) brings one map to the other. His research will add to our knowledge
about this elementary but important dynamical system.
