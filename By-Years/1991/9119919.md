Prokaryotic, chlorophyll b containing picoplankton are very abundant in the
north Pacific and Atlantic oceans. These organisms have been hypothesized to be
descendants of the free-living organisms that are ancestors of the chloroplast
of the higher plants (green algae, charaophytes, mosses, and vascular plants).
However, the PIs have detected an unusual chlorophyll molecule that does not
correspond to the chlorophylls of modern chloroplasts of the higher plants. The
PIs propose to collect, isolate, culture, and analyze these organisms for the
purposes of completing a phylogenetic analysis. Phylogeny will be determined
using 16s rRNA genes and compare them with prokaryotic and eukaryotic taxa using
parsimony analysis.
