9317096 Johnson This project will examine and reprocess recently acquired
seismic profile data, released from Industrial sources, for the northern Coast
Ranges section of northern California. The data will be used to test two
currently prevailing models - one involving Late Cretaceous to Paleocene
extensional unroofing of the Franciscan blueschist complex, and the other
involving unroofing of the complex in a compressional stress field - by
providing a link between surface structural geometry and that at depth. The
results will have wide applicability to forearc regions of other major orogenic
regions. ***
