Electrochemiluminescence as a tool for microscopy at the
nanoscale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A team of University of California--Irvine
engineers, led by Professor&lt;br/&gt;James Brody and Professor Peter Burke,
will construct a prototype of a&lt;br/&gt;new nanoscale microscope. This
microscope will combine two very&lt;br/&gt;different technologies; one developed
to manufacture&lt;br/&gt;microprocessors and the other to analyze
blood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pilot nanoscale microscope will measure the
motion of tiny&lt;br/&gt;micro-spheres in water. An electronic signal applied to
a series of&lt;br/&gt;electrodes will cause a chemical tag attached to the
micro-spheres to&lt;br/&gt;emit red light. This red light will be correlated
with the applied&lt;br/&gt;electronic signal to sense the motion of the micro-
spheres.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project leverages the considerable research
and development&lt;br/&gt;investment by industry to develop a revolutionary
method for&lt;br/&gt;nano-scale imaging. This imaging method will allow one to
see some&lt;br/&gt;objects as they have never seen before. Furthermore, finer
and finer&lt;br/&gt;detail will be observable as industry is able to produce
more powerful&lt;br/&gt;microprocessors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
