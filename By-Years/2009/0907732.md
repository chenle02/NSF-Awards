The Wisconsin Atomic Transition Probability (WATP) program on Fe-group ions will
be continued under this award. The primary objective of this work is to produce
a tightly defined Fe-group elemental abundance pattern in low metallicity (old)
stars. This Fe-group abundance pattern will provide a powerful constraint on
models of supernovae and will improve understanding of the Galactic chemical
evolution.

The Broader Impact of the WATP program of quantitative spectroscopy will extend
to fields such as lighting research and fusion plasma physics. The program will
continue to pay special attention to recruiting and retaining students from
underrepresented groups in astronomy, astrophysics, and physics. Outreach
activities will include presentations to elementary school students.
