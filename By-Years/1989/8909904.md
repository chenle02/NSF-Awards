ABSTRACT NARRATIVE Description: This proposal supports the collaboration of Dr.
Rex F. Pratt of Wesleyan University and Dr. Jubrail F. Rahil, Dean, Faculty of
Science, Bethlehem University. The proposed research is to study the chemistry
of the interactions of betalactam antibiotics with two groups of bacterial
enzymes. There appears good reason to believe the two groups are evolutionarily
related. A portion of the research will be to determine those similarities. The
goal of this project is to explore the ability of class A betalactamse to
catalyse the common reactions of the two enzymes. The knowledge gained in this
research will be compared with other classes of betalatamse in their reactions
to betalactam antibiotics. Scope: This proposal will bring a recently U.S.
trained (1982) PhD., who is now a Dean of Faculty of Science of a Middle East
university, to participate in nearly a year of important research in the
laboratory of a well regarded U.S. bio-organic chemist. The research will
broaden Dr. Rahil's experience in enzymology in a more medicinal and
pharmaceutical direction. His work in this project should bolster his own
research upon his return to Bethlehem University as well as increase his value
as teacher and his capabilities in performing community service in his homeland.
This proposal does meet the objectives of the Science in Developing Countries
Program of advancing the international exchange of scientific knowledge and does
contribute to the enhancement of science in a developing country.
