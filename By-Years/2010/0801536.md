TITLE: Astroparticle Detection

ABSTRACT

Observations of galaxies, superclusters, distant supernovae and the cosmic
microwave background radiation tell us that about 85% of the matter in the
universe is not made of ordinary particles, but exists in some dark form.
Deciphering the nature of this dark matter is of fundamental importance to
cosmology, astrophysics, and high-energy particle physics. A leading hypothesis
is that it is comprised of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, that
were produced moments after the Big Bang. If WIMPs are the dark matter, then
their presence in our Milky Way may be detectable via scattering from atomic
nuclei in a terrestrial detector.

This proposal requests continued base-program support to work on the Cryogenic
Dark Matter Search (CDMS) experiment which, in conjunction with the initial
funding of the SuperCDMS project grant, will allow for (a) the completion of the
CDMS-II experiment, which is fully constructed and acquiring science data at the
Soudan Mine, (b) the testing and underground operation in the CDMS-II
infrastructure at Soudan of two new ?SuperTowers,? each comprised of six next-
generation detectors, and (c) a modest effort of long-range R&D to develop and
test new hardware and detectors for possible followup experiments.

This program will have broader impact than the WIMP search results. The
technical development will push the envelope of phonon-mediated detectors, which
have increasing applications in astrophysics, from optical astronomy to x-rays
and cosmic microwave backgrounds studies, as well as other branches of physics
such as quantum computing. In addition, the SuperCDMS collaboration will
continue its support of public outreach program at Soudan, which hosts thousands
of visitors each year for tours of the mine and laboratory.
