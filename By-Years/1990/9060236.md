In response to the need for improved engineered materials for advanced elevated
temperature applications, the researchers plan to apply the extensive composite
processing experience, knowledge base, and understanding acquired in several
ceramic and composite development programs to improving the state-of-the-art in
chemical vapor infiltration (CVI) processing. Specifically, the researchers
intend to combine the forced-flow thermal gradient and pulse techniques of
infiltration, directly resulting in higher quality, more economical silicon
carbide (SiC) composites for use in heat exchangers and heat engines. The
approach has the potential to solve the recurring difficulty of microporosity
between fibers due to inadequate infiltration, eliminate the substantial
permeability occurring in current state-of-the-art materials, and improve the
economics of composite processing via vastly reduced processing times.
