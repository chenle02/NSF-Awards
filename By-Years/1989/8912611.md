A protein sequenator will be purchased to support a variety of research
activities including; immunochemistry of the surface antigens of bovine T
lymphocytes; the molecular basis of seed dormancy; mechanisms of sporozoite
penetration; and biochemical characterization of the trans-acting factors
involved in the translational regulation of mammalian ribosomal proteins.
