Extensive transport measurements are proposed on oriented, doped films of
"YBCO". A unique and important feature is the measurement of, in addition to
other more conventional parameters, the "electrical Bernoulli coefficient" which
identifies the sign of the sc charge carriers. The goal is to develop a complete
picture of electronic transport and thereby enhance their understanding of the
phenomenon of oxide superconductivity.
