Funding for this project will support the participation of senior speakers,
junior faculty and graduate students from the United States in the Marrakesh
International Conference and Workshop on Mathematical Biology. The themes of
this conference and workshop include cellular dynamics, mathematical
epidemiology, mathematical modeling of cancer, and mathematical ecology. This
meeting will explore new directions for the area of mathematical biology that
will have significant influence in years to come and will be of particular
benefit for the young participants in this conference. The workshop will provide
an agenda for future collaborations between US and African scientists. It will
expose junior and senior U.S. scientists and students to opportunities for
collaboration with African researchers in developing and applying the tools of
multi-scale modeling to questions arising from the tremendous health problems
caused by such diseases as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, as well as drug-
resistant tuberculosis.

This award is co-funded by the Division of Mathematical Sciences and the Office
of International Science and Engineering.
