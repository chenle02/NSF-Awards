This project is utilizing infrared thermographic imaging as a key tool in
teaching concepts of thermodynamics to majors and non-majors in physics,
chemistry, and biology courses. Equipment purchased with grant funds is capable
of resolving temperature differences of 0.1 centigrade degrees in the range from
-20 C to 280 C. Thermographic imaging is enabling students to visualize energy
relationships and to understand the laws of thermo-dynamics, thermal properties
of matter, and energy transfer in living things. While useful in a variety of
courses, the equipment is central to a new course "Foundations of Physics and
Chemistry" which is a prerequisite to General Chemistry and General Physics
courses at Catawba College.NSF grant funds are being matched by funds from non-
Federal sources.
