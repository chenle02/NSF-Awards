Development which minimizes the impact on natural resources is critical to the
economic future of Oregon and Southwest Washington. The region now finds itself
at a critical crossroads facing challenges of managing population growth in a
way that preserves the environment and maintains the beauty and high quality of
life that is central to that of the Pacific Northwest values and economy.
Technical workers are needed for the growing workforce in sustainability which
encompasses alternative energy technicians, landscape and natural resource
managers, building design, construction and manufacturing technicians to meet
the regions demands of a sustainability workforce. Portland Community College
and many partner institutions and businesses have developed a Sustainability
Training for Technical Educators project.

The project helps ensure that the participating educators understand how
sustainability relates to their STEM fields and how to integrate the science of
sustainability through issues, case studies and green alternatives in their
course laboratories and practices.

Industry standards and workplace competencies relating to sustainability are
taught across the curriculum in courses within the science, technology,
engineering and mathematics disciplines. The three main focus area for the
project center around; 1) A Summer Sustainability Institute for high school and
college level faculty; 2) An industry internship program for faculty and; 3) The
development of a community of faculty, industry and business representatives
working together to move the region Green.
