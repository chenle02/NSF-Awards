ABSTRACT

Proposal #: 308087 Title: Toward True 3D Object Recognition PI: Ponce, Jean U
of Ill Urbana-Champaign

This proposal addresses the problem of recognizing three-dimensional (3D)
objects in photographs and image sequences. It revisits viewpoint invariants as
a local representation of shape and appearance. The key insight is that,
although smooth surfaces are almost never planar in the large, and thus do not
(in general) admit global invariants, they are always planar in the small---that
is, sufficiently small surface patches can always be thought of as being
comprised of coplanar points---and thus can be represented locally by planar
invariants. This is the basis for a new, unified approach to object recognition
where object models consist of a collection of small (planar) patches, their
invariants, and a description of their 3D spatial relationship. Specifically,
the local invariants used in this proposal are the affine-invariant descriptions
of the image brightness pattern in the neighborhood of interest points recently
developed by Lindeberg and Garding and by Mikolajczyk and Schmid. These affine-
invariant patches provide a normalized representation of the local object
appearance, invariant under viewpoint and illumination changes, that can be used
as a local measure of image, part, or object similarity. The spatial
relationship between local invariants is used to represent the global object
structure and drive the recognition process. The proposed approach is applied to
four fundamental instances of the 3D object recognition problem: (1) modeling
rigid 3D objects from a small set of unregistered pictures and recognizing them
in cluttered photographs taken from unconstrained viewpoints; (2) representing
and recognizing non-uniform texture patterns under non-rigid transformations;
(3) modeling and recognizing articulated objects in image sequences, with
applications to the identification of shots that depict the same scene (shot
matching) in video clips; and (4) learning and recognizing part-based
descriptions of object classes in photographs and video clips.

Intellectual Merit: The main scientific contributions of the proposed project
will be (a) a unified framework for 3D object recognition that combines the
advantages of geometric and appearance-based approaches to recognition; (b)
fundamental advances in object recognition technology in the four target
domains, including the wide open problem of category-level recognition; (c)
effective algorithms for a number of practical applications, including shot
matching in video analysis. Large, representative datasets will be gathered for
each of the problems addressed in the project. They will be used to
systematically evaluate the algorithms developed in its course, and be made
available to the computer vision community at large on the World Wide Web.

Broader Impacts: With the ever expanding array of imagery sources, some form of
automatic object recognition technology must eventually be an integral part of
every information system. However, today's recognition systems are still largely
unable to handle the extraordinarily wide range of appearances assumed by common
objects in typical images, and fundamental advances are needed before 3D object
recognition fulfills its potential as a critical enabling technology in domains
such as surveillance and security, image retrieval and data mining, and video
analysis and annotation. The research conducted in this project will be a
stepping stone in that direction.
