Most male and female primates, including human ancestors, show substantial
differences (dimorphism) in the anatomy of the skull. The recognition of
dimorphism is important for identifying species in the fossil record.
Additionally, because dimorphism is strongly associated with variation in social
behavior in living primates, it is used commonly to support claims about the
social behavior of extinct species, especially human ancestors and their closest
relatives. However, there is currently very little information documenting
cranial dimorphism among living primates, and whether such dimorphism can be
used to reconstruct the social behavior of extinct species. This study will
gather data on a carefully selected set of living primates to document the
magnitude and pattern of dimorphism in living primates and humans, and evaluate
whether variation in samples of closely related fossils can be attributed to
dimorphism, as opposed to variation that occurs between species. The study will
also evaluate whether craniofacial dimorphism can be used to infer aspects of
their social behavior. This study will provide a strong data base for evaluating
the diversity of species in the human lineage, and for reconstructing the
changes in behavior that occurred in the evolution of humans and their closest
relatives.
