The primary objective of this ROW Research Planning grant will be use of a pilot
project to demonstrate the feasibility of a new approach, the application of
simple immunochemical tools to the study, not simply of the structural
characteristics, but of the relationship between protein structure and function
in beef heart cytochrome c oxidase. The pilot project will study the
relationship between, on the one hand, major conformational shifts in oxidase
protein the P.I. has previously observed using rabbit subunit-specific IgG, and
on the other hand, "open" and "closed" states of the oxidase reported by others
to influence the accessibility of the enzyme's oxygen binding site to ligands
such as cyanide. Two directions of influence will be examined: The effect of
antibody binding in the kinetics of cyanide- inhibition of the oxidase, and the
effect of bound cyanide on the affinity of the antibodies for the oxidase. In
addition to establishing the effectiveness of polyclonal IgG as a research tool
to explore the functional role of oxidase protein, it is anticipated that the
planning activities will enable the initiation of the Principal Investigator's
independent research career by establishment of a research laboratory and
independent publication. This research will clarify the relationship between the
structure and function of an important protein.
