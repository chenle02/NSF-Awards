Convincing field demonstrations of interspecific competition are rare, despite
frequent appeals by theorists for well-designed field experiments. Even when
interspecific competition is clear, the relative importance of behavioral
interference and competitive exploitation of resources remain in dispute. The
recent colonization of southern Florida by the brown anole Anolis sagrei and the
simultaneous decline of populations of the native green anole Anolis
carolinensis suggest severe competition between these forms. This will be tested
as follows: Large enclosures will be constructed in the field and stocked with
populations of one or both of these species. Populations will be censused
monthly over a period of two years in order to collect data on growth and
reproduction. Competition will be unequivocally demonstrated if the equilibrium
populations of one or both species are significantly lower in two-species
enclosures than they are in one-species enclosures. If competition is found, it
will be possible by examination of the demographic, reproductive, and growth
data to identify the age/sex classes upon which competition most heavily falls,
and thus deduce its mechanism.
