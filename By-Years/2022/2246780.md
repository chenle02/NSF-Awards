Dynamical evolutions in complex high-dimensional energy landscapes are
ubiquitous in modern science. Prototypical examples include protein folding,
evolutionary dynamics, out-of-equilibrium thermodynamics, and training of neural
networks. This project will investigate these dynamical evolutions by analyzing
Markov chains arising from spin systems in statistical physics. These models are
both central to modern probability theory and have implications for other
fields, including theoretical computer science, high-dimensional statistics, and
machine learning. The project also includes broadening participation efforts at
Northwestern University and mathematical education outreach to local K-12
schools and correctional institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is
focused on Markov chain evolutions in three important settings: (1) spin systems
(e.g., the Ising and Potts models) on lattices, (2) random surfaces and
interfaces between thermodynamically stable phases, and (3) disordered mean-
field models (e.g., spin glasses) and loss functions in high dimensions. These
diverse set of dynamical processes are expected to exhibit a wide range of
overlapping mathematical and physical phenomena. We study them with an eye
towards understanding the mechanisms dictating convergence times to equilibrium,
especially the roles played by varying the boundary conditions, initializations,
and restrictions to the state space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
