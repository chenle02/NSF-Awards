Rothstein 9613363 A mesoscale ocean data assimilation will be developed for the
Coupled Ocean Atmosphere Response Experiment (COARE) of the Tropical Ocean
Global Atmosphere (TOGA) program to produce a dynamically consistent atlas of
oceanic fields to be made available to all COARE Investigators and then use this
atlas to investigate upper ocean physical processes in warm pool of the western
tropical Pacific Ocean. In particular, the importance of salinity advection
within the thermocline and the influence of the three-dimensional circulation on
mixed layer evolution will be assessed. Finally, the evolution of energetic sub-
mesoscale eddies during equatorial jet spin-down will studied.
