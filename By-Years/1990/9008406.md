The importance of deep convection in the tropics to the global circulation has
been recognized for some time. In 1986 a pilot experiment termed the Equatorial
Mesoscale Experiment (EMEX) was held off the northern coast of Australia to
obtain measurements of the redistribution in the vertical of heat and moisture
by deep convection. The Principal Investigator was a participant in EMEX and he
will continue his analysis of the rich EMEX data set. His main objective will be
to use in situ and remote sensing data (especially airborne Doppler and
conventional radar) to determine the vertical profile of vertical velocity and
heating of the large scale environment associated with oceanic cloud clusters.
The results of this research will increase fundamental understanding of tropical
clouds clusters and may lead to improved parameterizations in numerical models.
