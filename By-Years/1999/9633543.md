9633543 Little The Federal Facilities Council (formerly the Federal
Construction Council) is a cooperative association of federal agencies having
interests and responsibilities related to building science and construction.
established in 1953 on the recommendation of a committee of the National
research Council, the Federal Facilities Council (FFC) serves as a unique forum
in which the sponsoring agencies meet regularly among themselves and with other
organizations in the design and construction, maintenance, management,
operation, and evaluation of federal facilities. Tangible products of the FFC
include symposia, which usually are held at the National Academy of Sciences,
and reports. Through the years, the FFC has conducted or sponsored more than 150
formal studies and investigations dealing with virtually every aspect of the
design, construction, and operation of facilities. By helping the agencies solve
problems and improve the design of federal facilities, the FFC has saved
taxpayers untold millions of dollars.
