9504535 Cecil A hypersurface in Euclidean n-space is said to be isoparametric if
it has constant principal curvatures; it can be shown that such a hypersurface
must be a plane, a sphere or a spherical cylinder. Isoparametric hypersurfaces
in the unit n-sphere, however, are a rich source of interesting examples; its
complete classification is still lacking. Dupin hypersurfaces generalize
isoparametric hypersurfaces in that the principal curvatures are assumed to be
constant only along certain directions. The proposed research will attempt to
classify Dupin hypersurfaces with 4 or 6 distinct principal curvatures. Cartan
showed that such a hypersurface can have 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6 distinct principal
curvatures; when there are 1 or 2 distinct principal curvatures the
classification problem iq routine, and the case of 3 distinct principal
curvatures was recently done by the proposer and G. Jensen. Isoparametric and
Dupin hypersurfaces form a particularly beautiful subarea of classical
differential geometry; these surfaces are highly symmetric and nontrivial at the
same time.
