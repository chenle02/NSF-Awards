This one-year project seeks to address the high failure rate of high school
students, especially minority students, in algebra. Twenty-five teachers of
middle school mathematics in the Baton Rouge area will participate in a six-week
summer workshop that includes instruction in the subject matter of algebra and
its applications, as well as an examination of the role of algebra in the
curriculum and of appropriate methods of teaching algebra in the middle school.
During the academic year, project staff will visit the participants' classrooms
and join them in offering workshops for other teachers. The evaluation will
assess changes in the participants' knowledge of algebra and pedagogy in the
failure rate of their students. The University and the school districts are
contributing as cost-sharing an amount equal to 13% of the NSF award.
