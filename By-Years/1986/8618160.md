This grant is to provide partial funding for The Eighth International
Conference on Textures of Materials. to be held at Santa Fe, New Mexico,
September 20.25, 1987. The scientific topics to be presented and discussed
include the following: development of textures during annealing, textures which
result from phase transformations, anisotropy of physical and mechanical
properties, textures in ceramics, polymers, geological materials, and thin
films, theoretical and experimental methods to study textures in materials. The
conference will provide a forum for the leading scientists in the world to
present the results of their research, and for these scientists to discuss the
latest results worldwide. The progress in the state.of.the.art in topics of the
conference will thereby be focused and advanced by this open exchange of ideas
and results. The topic for discussion have implications for processing of
metals, advanced ceramics and electronic and magnetic materials. These materials
and their processing impact virtually every technological in the U. S. economy
in some measure.
