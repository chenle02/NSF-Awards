Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As an emerging technology, the use of fiber
reinforced polymer (FRP) materials in the civil infrastructure has seen a rapid
growth. Despite the abundance of research activity and the growing number of
demonstration and commercial applications, many issues involved in the use of
FRP materials in infrastructure remain to be addressed. In some cases, the
dearth of understanding and/or design guidance represents a significant
limitation to the broader implementation of FRP materials in infrastructure
applications.&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this proposed Workshop is to bring
together industry, practitioner and academic experts to help to identify and
prioritize research areas and issues requiring further attention in order to
improve our understanding of the behavior of FRP materials and FRP structural
and repair systems.&lt;br/&gt;The primary deliverable of this proposed Workshop
will be the identification of critical research needs affecting the
implementation of FRP composites in concrete construction applications and the
development of a consensus on the priority of these needs. Having developed such
a consensus, a unified research approach addressing this research needs and
matching research needs with appropriate funding agencies/opportunities can be
established.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts resulting from this effort is not
only the identification of critical needs, but also the development of
consensus-based unified approach to future research needs. This broader impact
is anticipated to aid the funding agencies to identify priorities of research in
the area of FRP.&lt;br/&gt;
