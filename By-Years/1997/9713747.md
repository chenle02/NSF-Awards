This university-industry collaboration research project seeks to understand the
subsurface damage resulting from ultra-fine finishing processes in the
manufacture of wide band-gap semiconductor substrates. This understanding will
aid in identifying the processing conditions that can overcome subsurface damage
problems in producing these substrates. Substrates of II-VI semiconductor
materials including ZnSe, CdS and ZnO will be prepared by a variety of surface
processing methods including ultra-precision machining and polishing. The
resulting subsurface lattice disorder will be assessed with the use of ion beam
channeling, cathodoluminescent, and scanning capacitance microscopy. Subsequent
to surface characterization, epitaxial films will be grown on the substrates by
molecular beam epitaxy, and will be used to do performance testing. The project
will be conducted in collaboration with Eagle-Picher Research Laboratory, Los
Alamos National Laboratory, and the National Institute of Standards and
Technology. The project can lead to a fundamental understanding of subsurface
damage in the ultra-fine finishing of semiconductor substrates, with significant
practical benefits in the production of LEDs and lasers among others. A major
strength of the project is the existence of strong partnerships with industry
and government laboratories.
