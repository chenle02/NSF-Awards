9704579 Garg Factors affecting the electric field induced modulated phase in a
nematic liquid crystal will be systematically probed by: (I) studying the
modulated phase at different applied electric field frequencies; (2) determining
electric and magnetic field values of stability for the different wave vectors;
(3) detecting flow directions in the system; (4) measuring electrical
conductivities of the samples as a function of frequencies; (5) exploring cell
geometries to understand the influence of boundary conditions at the electrodes
and the electric field configuration on the homogenious Freedericksz and
periodic transitions. A more accurate theoretical model will be developed to
describe the modulated phase. %%% The study of reorientational phenomena under
applied electric fields in a confined geometry and the dependence of modulation
between phases as a function of field frequency are important physical phenomena
that determine the overall properties of new liquid crystal systems that are
playing an increasingly important role in applications areas that include, for
example, new materials for infrared and microwave liquid crystal modulators, and
fast-switching liquid crystal displays. ***
