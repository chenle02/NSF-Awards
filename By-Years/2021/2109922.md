Data needs to be organized systematically and rigorously. Data about consumer
products goes into one table, and data about micro-organisms goes into a
different table. This makes it easier for humans and computers to store the
data, to retrieve and query it, and to update it. But today one often finds
large amounts of noisy, inconsistent, incomplete data, which are impossible to
organize rigorously. The sheer volume of this data makes it very valuable, yet
it is of limited utility without proper organization. This project develops
methods for organizing noisy, inconsistent, incomplete data, and develops
techniques for storing, querying, and updating such data. Its findings will
inform organizations on how to organize and use large amounts of noisy
data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops a technique for approximate
schema discovery for noisy data, for normalizing the data according to this
schema, and for improving query processing. The input consists of a single,
large relation, which may be noisy, inconsistent, incomplete, and the system
discovers automatically a few candidate schemas that can represent the data with
minimal loss and with high utility for downstream tasks. Each schema is
associated with an information-theoretic score, which represents the amount of
information that may be lost when we represent the data according to that
schema. Then, the project researches new approaches for querying the data stored
in an approximate schema, by either recording explicitly the number of "spurious
tuples" generated by the schema, or by using probabilities to quantify the
degree of confidence in the query's answer. The techniques explored in this
project combine information theory with graph algorithms and with query
optimization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
