ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal No.: 0302909&lt;br/&gt;Title: Wireless
Communications Model Program Development&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Brookdale
Community College&lt;br/&gt;PI: Qaissaunee,
Michael&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brookdale Community College, working as a regional
partner under the direction of the National Center for Telecommunications
Technologies (NCTT), is modifying an existing Electronics Engineering Technology
AAS degree to include wireless communications and creating model AAS degree and
certificate programs in wireless communications articulated from high school
through community college and to the university level. The new programs with
multiple entry and exit points will prepare technicians for the wireless
communications industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project components include
curriculum development and adaptation and program development, professional
development for high school and community college faculty, and development of
2+2+2 articulation in wireless communications. As an NCTT regional partner, the
project staff is working to implement similar programs throughout the region and
generally contribute to program development and improvement at collaborating
institutions. In addition, this ATE project serves as the focal point for
regional dissemination and training to regional business and industry, through
the development of materials and faculty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides NCTT,
strategic partnerships for this project include the National Workforce Center
for Emerging Technologies (NWCET), The New Jersey Center for Advanced
Technological Education (NJCATE) and the Global Wireless Education Consortium
(GWEC). Other project partnerships have been established with post-secondary
institutions, area technical high schools, and regional
industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
