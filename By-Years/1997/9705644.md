9705644 Perkins The goals of this project are to improve pre-earthquake housing
mitigation programs, provide additional data useful for emergency planning and
disaster response, and accelerate residential rebuilding efforts in future
earthquakes. Several principal tasks will be carried out related to mitigation
and response and recovery including: (a) evaluating the effectiveness of pre-
earthquake housing damage mitigation programs already in existence, (b)
examining the various factors motivating housing owners to retrofit, (c)
modeling the expected demands for post- earthquake emergency assistance, and (d)
examining the relative time periods involved for the repair or replacement of
uninhabitable units. The effort will include workshops, issuing reports and
articles, as well as posting summary information on the organization's Internet
site.
