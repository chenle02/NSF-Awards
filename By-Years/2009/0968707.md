The research objective of this project is to develop efficient regression
algorithms for fitting models that are to be used to guide subsequent decisions.
Linear regression algorithms will be designed for static models that support
repeated decisions as well as for linear time series models that support dynamic
decisions. Logistic regression algorithms will be designed to accommodate use of
discrete choice data. The algorithms will take as input decision objectives in
addition to data and a model specification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful,
new algorithms resulting from this research project will enhance, relative to
more standard regression algorithms, the quality of decisions made using
regression models when selected features do not perfectly capture relationships
present in systems that generate data.
