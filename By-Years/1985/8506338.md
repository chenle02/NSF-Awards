Until recently, there was no technique to adequately validate many nonlinear
models of a device/system in CAD. This method represents the device's
nonlinearity as a finite Volterra series and uses a multi-tone test signal to
measure the Volterra kernels. In contrast to previous work, no assumptions are
made about the kernel's form; thus, measurements are useful for complex systems
where no simple model is obvious. Currently, the technique is applied to low-
frequency devices (acoustic tranducers and audio signal processors) with subtle
nonlinearities. Signal generation/acquisition and processing equipment have
restricted the characterization of the high/very high frequency devices commonly
used in CAD, VLSI, and communications circuits. The proposed equipment would
permit the study of models for devices operating up to 1 GHz and models which
incorporate stronger nonlinearities. A system is specified that is composed of
LeCroy Research Corp. high speed CAMAC modules for very high speed waveform
input (1 GHz aggregate sample rate, 8-bit word) and output; and a Masscomp real-
time UNIX Computation System for control of the CAMAC crate (via IEEE-488
interface), lower speed high resolution studies (imHz 12-bit word), computation,
and kernal display.
