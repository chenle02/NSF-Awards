Dr. Richard J. Lagow of the Chemistry Department at the University of Texas at
Austin is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program
for continued research on the synthesis, structure, and bonding of polylithium
organic compounds. In these species, two or more lithium atoms are attached to
the same, adjacent, or nearly adjacent carbon atoms. Two of the novel compounds
that will be attempted to be prepared are tetralithioethylene and
perlithioadamantane. Thermal rearrangement synthesis will continue to be used
for substituted dilithiomethanes and lithium-halogen exchange techniques will
also be explored. Formation of silicon, germanium, and oxygen compunds
containing lithium as a substituent will be attempted. Four-center, two-electron
bonding has been proposed to rationalize the structures thus far observed so
attempts will be made to apply that model in new compounds. Noble gas matrix
isolation, mass spectrometry, and crystallographic techniques will be used to
characterize the products. %%% The polylithium compounds proposed for synthesis
and characterization are unusual and highly reactive molecules. They may find
utility as new materials or in new types of solid or liquid batteries, but their
immediate usefulness will likely be in expanding methods available for synthesis
of other organic and organometallic compounds.
