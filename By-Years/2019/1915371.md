Artificial Intelligence (AI) and data science technologies are increasingly
being used in making consequential decisions such as determining whether someone
is hired, promoted, offered a loan, or provided housing. Many of these systems
however were developed and some deployed without a careful assessment of their
societal impact. For example, AI systems have been shown to exhibit gender and
racial biases in making hiring and sentencing decisions. Yet, many data science
students and practitioners are still unaware of the prevalence and seriousness
of these issues. Equipping them with the knowledge to understand the
implications of algorithm design decisions as well as tools that they can use to
mitigate the biases in these systems is the key to ensure that the data-driven
decision making systems they build are fair and trustworthy. This serves the
national interest by furthering NSF's mission to promote the progress of
science, and to advance the national health, prosperity and welfare.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This two day workshop brings together prominent educators,
researchers and thought leaders from academia, industry and government together
to explore ideas on the best strategies to develop data science ethics
curricula. During the workshop, participants explore ideas on the best
strategies to develop data science ethics curricula that are guided by
pedagogical principles, informed by the needs of communities, aligned with core
social values and laws, and shaped by the latest evidence and solutions from the
fairness, accountability and transparency in AI research. The key outcomes of
the workshop include a recommendation for incorporating ethics in data science
pedagogy that contains guidelines on designing both standalone data science
ethics courses as well as ethics modules that can be embedded in existing data
science courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
