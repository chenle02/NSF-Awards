RESEARCH INITIATION AWARD: THE NEUTROPHIL MODEL FOR GROWTH FACTOR SIGNALLING
ABSTRACT Understanding mechanisms of surface receptor signal generation, signal
transduction via intracellular messengers, and coupling of intracellular
messengers to cell functional responses is an area of intensive experimental
research. The central goal of the proposed research is to incorporate current
knowledge of the above processes for a mammalian cell sensory system, the
polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN), into structured mathematical models of
receptor-mediated cell responses. This research will improve understanding of
the interrelationships of biochemical and biophysical events in stimulus-
response coupling which are often investigated individually but seldom
considered collectively.
