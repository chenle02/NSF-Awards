When we run our fingers across a finely textured surface, small, complex
vibrations are elicited in the skin, and specialized receptors embedded in the
skin allow us to sense these vibrations. Different surfaces elicit different
vibrations, and it is on the basis of these differences that we are able to
discriminate silk from, say, satin. The ability to extract meaningful
information from skin vibrations implies neural mechanisms that have yet to be
discovered. This project investigates the mechanisms by which information about
surface texture is extracted from texture-elicited vibrations. To this end, the
Principal Investigator records (using a laser Doppler vibrometer) the skin
vibrations elicited by everyday textured surfaces and examines the information
conveyed. He then records the responses evoked by various textured surfaces in
the nerve of Rhesus macaques and has human participants perform discrimination
experiments using these same textures. Exploiting the well-documented homology
between human and Rhesus sensory systems, he uses a variety of computational and
machine learning techniques to reveal which aspects of the neural response
account for our ability to distinguish between textures. Ultimately, the
processing of skin oscillations constitutes a distinct and poorly understood
mode of somatosensory processing. Indeed, while analogies have been drawn
between visual and tactile processing of shape and motion, this second
processing mode draws strong analogies with the auditory system. In both
systems, stimulus information is extracted from spectrally complex oscillations
(of the ear drum or the skin for audition and touch, respectively). In addition
to their important scientific implications, results from this project will
inform the development of sensorized upper-limb neuroprostheses and of virtual
haptics displays. Finally, the project comprises an important educational and
outreach component, with a strong emphasis on undergraduate education,
recruitment of under-represented groups, and outreach to the general public.
