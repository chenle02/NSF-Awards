This award provides support for the 2022 Summer Geometry Initiative (SGI), a
six-week summer workshop bringing a broad pool of students into geometry
processing and related research disciplines. A cohort of roughly 30 SGI Fellows
will complete a week of intensive training in geometry processing research
practices, followed by five weeks of collaboration with top researchers in the
field, guest lectures, guidance on graduate admissions, and interaction with one
another; an additional group of students is invited to participate in only the
initial tutorial week. Designed to broaden access to geometry processing
research experiences, the program targets Fellows drawn from a diverse set of
backgrounds, geographic locations, and institutions, with a focus on students
otherwise unlikely to have access to this cutting-edge discipline. Fellows
receive stipends to alleviate the opportunity cost of participating in the
workshop.

The SGI 2022 offering aims to develop SGI as a supporter of the geometry
processing community and as a model program for computational and mathematical
disciplines seeking to broaden the diversity of future generations of
researchers. Beyond community-building, SGI Fellows will tackle real-world
research problems affecting applications like digital manufacturing, virtual
reality, physical simulation, architecture, and autonomous driving using tools
drawn from mathematical disciplines including differential geometry, partial
differential equations, optimal transport, numerical analysis, and optimization.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
