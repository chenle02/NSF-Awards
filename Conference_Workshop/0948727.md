The Mississippi State University Department of Mathematics and Statistics will
host the 44th Annual Spring Topology and Dynamical Systems Conference from
Thursday March 18 through Saturday March 20, 2010. Planned are four parallel
sessions in continuum theory, dynamical systems, general and set theoretic
topology, and geometric group theory/geometric topology, and also 6 plenary
talks and 12 semiplenary talks over the course of 3 days. Topology and dynamics
can be framed as the mathematics used for measuring and describing the notions
of `shape' and `time evolution' in practically any context and on any scale. For
example this can range from nanotechnology to the size and shape of the
universe. Combining these ideas, if we begin with a simple shape and a simple
process ( for example consider a taffy pulling machine), both describing and
predicting the future output can become complicated. Theoretical tools from
topology and dynamics are indispensable for understanding such processes and
systems, and it is to such theories that the conference is devoted.
