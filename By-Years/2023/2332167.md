The Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Undergraduate Program (HBCU-
UP) provides support to strengthen STEM undergraduate education and research at
HBCUs. This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) expresses the
need for innovative research activity in integrated chip design, fabrication,
and validation at Florida A&M University (FAMU). The project focuses on the
development of fully integrated GaN front end chips covering a wide spectrum.
This work will be accomplished via investigation of a novel transversal filter
type circuit topology to boost the efficiency of power amplification. The
establishment of this research effort will further enhance the research capacity
at FAMU in direct response to the CHIPS and Science Act.

The goal of this project is to develop a novel transversal filter type broadband
distributed power amplifier, a wideband radio frequency switch, a low noise
amplifier, a fully integrated solution, and novel packaging and set up of an
experimental validation test bench for the proposed chip. Additionally, the
project seeks to 1) develop a course for integrated chip design, fabrication,
and validation, 2) develop a summer research program for undergraduate students,
and 3) share the developed course materials with other HBCUs promoting the
research activities in semiconductor, chip design, and experiment validation.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
