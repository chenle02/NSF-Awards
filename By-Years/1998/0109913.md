&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will
develop compact, all-solid-state, pulsed drivers coupled with solid-state
protection circuitry for powering laser diodes/diode arrays and increasing their
reliability and lifetime. New high-current semiconductor switch technology will
be coupled with proprietary new diode protection circuits featuring fault-mode
detection and high-speed current limiting to extend laser diode lifetime
tenfold. This leads directly to a tenfold reduction in annual laser operating
cost. Recent breakthroughs in high power semiconductor technology, namely the
&lt;br/&gt;Gate Commutated Thyristor (GCT) switch, also offer significant
improvement in speed, power, and compact size over existing commercial devices.
Phase II will develop advanced, compact pulsed power modules based on these
technologies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GCT technology, coupled with a proprietary
fast protection circuitry, offers a significant decrease in diode laser system
size and weight and a tenfold decrease in laser cost-of-ownership made possible
by increased diode lifetime. New commercial applications for the diode-pumped
solid-state lasers are expected to include powering diodes for optical
telecommunications and ultraviolet and X-ray point sources for Next Generation
Lithography in the semiconductor industry, as well as in laser cutting and
welding. Medical uses for this new fault-protected, solid-state driver
technology will include oncology and gene therapy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
