With partial support from the National Science Foundation, the Institute for
Mathematical Behavioral Sciences at the University of California, Irvine will
purchase a Digital Equipment Corporation AlphaServer 2100 4/275. The RISC chip
in this server runs at 275 MHz and the operating system is the Open Software
Foundation version of Unix, OSF. The server has 256 Mbytes of main memory with
8.3 Gbytes of disc space. This equipment will supplement and significantly
upgrade the group's current system and will permit a broader range of analyses
of large data sets. The Institute for Mathematical Behavioral Sciences is a
multidisciplinary research center that draws its faculty from the Departments of
Anthropology, Cognitive Sciences, Economics, Mathematics, Philosophy and
Sociology and from the Graduate School of Management. The experience and
expertise of the faculty cover much of the spectrum of formal and computational
approaches to behavioral science. The equipment provided will further research
in several areas that include cognitive sciences, economics, social networks and
anthropology, and visual perception. This project has a strong educational
component and the equipment will help graduate students in the Institute's M.A.
and Ph.D. programs and graduate students in other Departments in the School of
Social Sciences. The equipment will help with computer-aided learning for
undergraduates in anthropology, economics and cognitive sciences.
