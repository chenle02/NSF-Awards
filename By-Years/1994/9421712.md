9421712 Chave This award provides partial funding in support of a workshop on
the technical feasibility of establishing seafloor geomagnetic observatories to
be held at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. The workshop will convene a
small group of U.S. and international experts in geomagnetic field observation
in order to focus on measuring the geomagnetic field variations with ocean
bottom instrumentation, power supply to ocean bottom observatories, and methods
of data retrieval. The participants are committed to writing a report describing
the technical options and their cost estimates. ***
