A jet impinging on a rigid surface will be studied with the aim of alleviating
resonance effects which can occur in this situation. Both subsonic and
supersonic conditions will be investigated experimentally. The focus is to be on
co-axial circular jets, in the belief that this configuration is highly likely
to provide reduction in adverse pressure fluctuations. Such reductions have been
observed in free co-axial jets, and their ground impingement has not been
previously explored. Application is to VSTOL aircraft, particularly to
supersonic operation.
