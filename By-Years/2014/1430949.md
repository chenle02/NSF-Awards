ACM Sensys conference is the leading international conference on wireless sensor
networks and systems. It invites research contributions addressing the
challenges in the area of wireless sensor systems, algorithms, and applications.
The conference features a high-quality technical program, with an acceptance
rate of around 10% out of around 250 submissions. It has a single-track session,
which offers significant opportunities for individual and small groups that
foster technical and social interactions among a diverse set of participants.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will help increase the representation and
participation of United States-based students at the conference by providing 25
or more travel grants limited to a maximum of $750 each. By creating new
opportunities for graduate students, especially those from under-represented
groups, to attend a high-quality conference, this award will benefit the
students by giving them an opportunity to interact with world-class researchers,
inspire them to try new research directions, providing mentoring opportunities,
as well as the chance to seek out internships and post-doctoral positions which
will help the students advance in their research career.
