The goal of this research is to understand the behavior of solutions of
nonlinear partial differential equations by using asymptotic methods of singular
perturbation type. Two kinds of problems will be investigated: the slow crossing
of a separatrix due to a weak dissipative perturbation and the development of a
method of averaging for slowly varying waves influenced by weak perturbations.
Such equations arise in a host of areas where the behavior of nonlinear waves is
the primary physical process. Many phenomena in nature involve the action of
weakly nonlinear waves. Examples include the motion of the tides as well as the
daily bodily rhythms of waking and sleeping. Such complex systems can be
approximated sometimes by systems of partial differential equations that contain
one or more small parameters. In this research the principal investigator will
use the smallness of these parameters to construct approximate solutions of the
equations by replacing the complicated equations with simpler ones. The simpler
equations still retain the essential physics of the complicated ones, but they
are much easier to study.
