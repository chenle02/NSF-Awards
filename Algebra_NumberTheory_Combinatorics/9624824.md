Flach 9624824 This award provides funding for a project in Arithmetic Algebraic
Geometry. The project centers around the conjectures about special values of
L-functions attached to varieties over number fields. More specifically, the
investigator will work on the Tamagawa number conjecture for the adjoint of a
modular form, and on the study of Galois module theoretic invariants whose
definition is motivated by the conjectures on special values of L-functions.
This project falls into the general area of Arithmetic Algebraic Geometry -a
subject that blends two of the oldest areas of mathematics: Number Theory and
Geometry. This combination has proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently
solved problems that withstood generations. Among its many consequences are new
error correcting codes. Such codes are essential for both modern computers (hard
disks) and compact disks.
