The Program recommends funding in the amount of
$126,412.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Department of Interior, National Business
Center, Aviation Management Division, through a memorandum of understanding with
the National Science Foundation, Office of Polar Programs, provides support for
aviation-related activities in support of United States Antarctic Program (USAP)
activities in Antarctica and the Arctic. The Department of Interior administers
two primary contracts for the NSF: a contract with Petroleum Helicopters Inc. of
Lafayette, LA for helicopter services at McMurdo Station, Antarctica, and a
second with Kenn Borek Air of Calgary, Canada for light, fixed-wing aviation
support in Antarctica and various regions in the
Arctic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Department of Interior also provides other
aviation-related services for the NSF to include accident investigation
management (in coordination with the National Transportation Safety Board) and
other on-demand aviation program oversight
functions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the 2003-2004 field season in Antarctic
the NSF supported a remote geology camp and an aeromagnetic survey of a portion
of the Transantarctic Mountains between the Beardmore Glacier and Moody Nunataks
region. Support of these remote helicopter activities required additional pilots
and maintenance personnel above and beyond the normal level provided through the
PHI contract. This award provides the additional funding required to support the
remote geology projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second element of this award
is funding to provide for on-call twin otter services in the Arctic during the
2004 summer campaign for two NSF-funded research projects.&lt;br/&gt;
