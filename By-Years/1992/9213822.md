9213822 Defanti This is the third year funding of a three year continuation
award. Virtual reality includes 3D display of views which track the user's
perspective viewpoint in real time. Two major existing modes are head-mounted
displays (HMD) and boom-mounted displays. This work is on an alternative
environment: a room ("CAVE") constructed from 7'x7' screens on which graphics
are projected. This work will add engineering enhancements to improve the
performance and sonic feedback of this room. Quantitative assessment of the
benefits of this type of display for a number of tasks will be done.
Collaborative effort will take place with discipline scientists working on grand
challenge problems in computational science.
