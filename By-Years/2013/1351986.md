Superconductivity in Lithium-rich compounds &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non technical
abstract: Superconductors, which have zero electrical resistivity and perfect
diamagnetism, hold great promise for applications in energy storage,
transmission, medical applications and transportation. Unfortunately, the
operating temperature of all currently known superconductors is too low for
large scale applications. Light materials have been considered to be promising
for exhibiting superconducting properties at high temperature. This research
focuses on finding new superconducting systems made of ultra light materials
with a focus on understanding the non-classical lattice dynamics which are
considerable in light elements. We will specifically focus on materials rich in
lithium (the lightest metal and superconducting element) and search for new
lithium-rich high temperature superconducting systems utilizing extreme
conditions of pressure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical abstract: Lithium is the
lightest metal and superconducting element. The emergence of exotic quantum
states in a compressed light metallic system has been entertained theoretically
for metallic phases of hydrogen. Metallic hydrogen is predicted to have a liquid
ground state, and may exhibit a two component superfluid and superconducting
phase. The difficulty of compressing hydrogen to densities sufficient for
metallization, however, has prevented experimental proof of these effects. As an
alternative route to studying the evolution of lattice quantum effects in a
dense light metallic system, this study will investigate the structural and
electronic properties of lithium which is isovalent to hydrogen under pressure.
Due to its light mass, Li's lattice is highly dynamic, providing a large phonon
spectrum for electron-phonon coupling. By chemical modification, it may be
possible to synthesize a Li rich compound in which a high superconducting
transition temperature is achieved through electronic enhancement. The
motivation of this research is to systematically study superconductivity in
ultra-light lithium-based compounds by using high pressure techniques. Studying
the superconducting phase diagram of Li-rich compounds will provide insight into
finding ways which enhance the superconductivity by chemical modification.
