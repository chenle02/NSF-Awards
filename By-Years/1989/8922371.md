This award supports Professor Peter Ney, University of Wisconsin, Madison, for
collaborative research in mathematics with Professor Esa Nummelin of the
Department of Mathematics, University of Helsinki, Finland. The basis of their
cooperation is the joining of complementary skills, knowledge and techniques in
mathematical analysis. They have collaborated very productively for several
years in areas such as Markov Additive Processes, large deviation theory, and
regeneration techniques for stochastic processes. The objective of their current
research is to develop regeneration structures for a class of processes called
"chains with infinite memory." These are useful as models in areas such as
population growth and statistical physics. The existence of a regeneration
structure for a stochastic process is important because it makes accessible a
variety of limit laws for the process; for example, suitably formulated versions
of laws of large numbers, central limit theorems and large deviation theorems.
