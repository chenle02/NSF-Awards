9408912 The focus of this research will be to develop methods using the
1,4-conjugate addition chemistry of alpha-aminoalkylcuprates to prepare useful
synthetic intermediates in ways that are both diastereoselective and
enantioselective. The methodology will be showcased in the synthesis of nine
representative alkaloids. %%% With this renewal award, the Synthetic Organic
Program is supporting the research of Dr. R. Karl Dieter of the Department of
Chemistry at Clemson University. Professor Dieter will focus his work on
developing a new organometallic reagents known as an alpha-aminoalkylcuprates.
The reagents will then be used for the synthesis of representative natural
products from the class of compounds referred to as alkaloids.
