This research project is on the nonlinear fourth order evolutionary Cahn-
Hilliard equation. The main concern will be the appropriate numerical method for
accurate approximate solutions of this equation for both one and two spatial
dimensions. The possibility of metastable solutions will be analysed. The Cahn
Hilliard equation models among other phenomena the phase separation in binary
alloys. The results of the research project will find applications in this and
other related physical problems.
