Abstract

Award: DMS-0408993 Principal Investigator: Richard B. Melrose and Victor
Guillemin

The principal investigators propose to study a variety of basic questions
relating analysis, differential geometry and topology and especially concerned
with the appearance of singular phenomena. In various collaborations, they plan
to study the solvability properties of elliptic differential and
pseudodifferential operators on manifolds with singularities and to calculate
the topological obstructions, particularly through K-theory, to invertibility.
Jointly, and in other collaborations, they also intend to continue the study of
the propagation of waves, typically in the form of singular fronts, on manifolds
with singularities and the relationship between these two problems. Projects in
Kaehler and symplectic geometry emphasize moment maps for groups acting on these
spaces and constructions such as cutting, gluing, and reduction by groups of
symmetries.

One of the features of several of these projects is the expression of analytic
objects on a global scale through the differential topology of the underlying
space. For example, many geometric spaces carry versions of the equation
describing wave motion, and aspects of the shapes of the spaces are recorded in
the decay and scattering properties of waves on them. This work tends to bring
together various strands of research in mathematics and physics, in particular
quantization theory and symplectic geometry, the study of spaces on which
Hamiltonian mechanics can be defined.
