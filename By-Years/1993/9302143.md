Detailed studies of the dynamics of small-scale oceanic mixing events were
pursued using a high resolution, three-dimensional numerical model. The goal of
this study is to improve parameterizations of ocean mixing by better
understanding the processes taking place under various conditions such as
breaking internal gravity waves, Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities and decaying
turbulence.
