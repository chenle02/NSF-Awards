R.L. Cohen plans to pursue several projects involving algebraic topological
questions arising in gauge theory. One project, joint work with J.D.S. Jones,
involves finding an explicit relationship between representations of braid
groups and families of elliptic operators coupled to SU(2) monopoles. Another
project is to pursue joint work with Jones and G. Segal on Morse theory. Given a
Morse function on a compact manifold, they have described an explicit simplicial
space decomposition of the manifold using classifying space theory. They plan to
investigate the applicability and implications of these techniques to various
infinite dimensional settings; for example, the Chern-Simons functional and the
Yang-Mills functional. Milgram plans to study the geometry of moduli spaces of
holomorphic bundles, concentrating on SU(2)-instantons over S4 regarded as
equivalence classes of based holomorphic bundles on CP1 x CP1. He also expects
to continue his study of the geometry and homology of sporadic groups and
exceptional Lie groups. Finally, he hopes to work with R. Penner on the
relations between moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces and representations of
symmetric groups. Mrowka plans to pursue three projects. The first is to prove
there are 4-manifolds homotopic to a K3 surface which do not admit any complex
structures. The second is to study the effect on the Donaldson polynomial of the
existence of embedded S2's or T2's. Finally, with K. Walker, he hopes to study
gauge- theoretic generalizations of the Casson invariant. The connections
between geometry and physics involved in this work are striking. They work both
ways. While much of the motivation for studying four-dimensional manifolds, Lie
groups, and group representations may once have come from the hope of
calculating things of interest to physicists, in recent years notions inspired
by quantum physics have given rise repeatedly to constructions of new
topological invariants that answered questions the topologists could not answer
before.
