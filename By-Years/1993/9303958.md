This award will support the development of mineral standards for the
calibration of analyses for the light elements of hydrogen, lithium, beryllium,
boron, and fluorine in geological materials. Accurate determination of the
chemical content of geological materials is critical to understanding their
origin and potential uses. The light elements listed above have traditionally
proven difficult to analyze directly and accurately. With the development of
modern analytical techniques such as mass spectrometry, secondary ion mass
spectrometry, particle-induced gamma-ray emission spectrometry, neutron
activation analysis, ion chromatography, and the electron microprobe these
elements can be analyzed directly with the help of well-calibrated comparison
standards. Selection of mineral standards, their analysis, and dissemination of
the results will be handled by the Principal investigator and colleagues.
