9811921 Lukas Under this grant, PIs will continue the Hawaiian Ocean Time Series
(HOTS) for an additional three years. HOTS provides a time history of physical
and chemical properties at a single location northeast of the island of Oahu in
Hawaii. Research focus will be on observing and understanding climate-related
processes in the North Pacific Subtropical gyre, and a particular emphasis in
this work will be to attempt to demonstrate the value of maintaining HOTS into
the future in support of major climaterelated programs. Data from HOTS
contributes support to two Global Change programs, WOCE (World Ocean Circulation
Experiment), and JGOFS (Joint Global Ocean Flux Study).
