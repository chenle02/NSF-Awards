ABSTRACT P.I. Andrew Hill/ Xingbin Chen SBR-9316717 This project involves an
application of a high-level engineering method, Finite Element Method, to an
investigation of the biomechanical and material properties of the chewing system
in humans and apes. This system is extremely complex, yet this non-destructive
technique has all the potential to shed light on the mechanical adaptations of
the mandible, and also the factors that may have shaped its morphological
changes during the course of our recent evolution. The graduate student is
already very well trained in both engineering and anthropology, and will become
a leading researcher in this area as a result of this support. The work may well
have clinical implications in dentistry at some future date. ***
