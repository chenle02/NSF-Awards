This REU site proposal will train ten students in research methods and theory of
Primate Social Ecology on Totogochillo Island, Lake Catemaco, Mexico. During the
summer, students will take a 30 day course in which they will conduct directed
and individual research projects on the free-ranging colony of stumptail
macaques (Macaca arctoides). One hour lectures will be given every evening on
topics to help students design their projects, collect data, analyze those data,
and interpret their results within a scientific framework. Initial statistical
analyses of the data, a preliminary paper and an oral report will be completed
at the end of the course. During the following academic year, students will take
independent study courses at their college or university in which they will
analyze and write up the results of their research with the senior faculty
member. The students will submit a paper describing the results of their project
to a refereed scientific journal.
