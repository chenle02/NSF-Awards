The Principal Investigators are planning to organize the conference at MIT
during the weekend of April 12-13, 2008. The talks will range over a wide
variety of subjects in Analysis, Algebraic Geometry and Combinatorics, Topology,
Applied Mathematics, and theoretical computer science and three of these talks
will be accessible to the general public. The seven colloquia will be
accompanied by two panels discussing the lives of women in mathematics at
different stages of their careers. The PIs hope to attract junior
(undergraduate/graduate/postdocs) women and minorities. The PIs hope to reach a
worldwide audience and to establish a permanent presence of the conference by
setting up a web presentation around videos of the event.

The PIs' vision is to center the meeting around horizontal and vertical
interactions, encouraged by talks and ample time for informal gatherings. They
believe that this is the best way to attract young women into mathematics and to
nurture those already in the field through mentoring and networking. They also
believe that role models are of vital importance for successful scientific
careers.
