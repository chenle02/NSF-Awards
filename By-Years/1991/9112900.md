This proposal for doctoral dissertation research examines the technology and
social organization of Greenlandic whaling, the interpenetration of cash and
subsistence sectors in local economies, and the impact of dynamic whaling
regulatory regimes on Greenlandic hunters. The International Whaling
Commission's reduction of minke whale harvests has had a considerable impact on
Greenlandic communities. The Greenlandic situation is typical of the conflicts
between Inuit communities, and other subsistence- based societies in the Arctic,
and the interests of environmental protection organizations and development
concerns. Although critics have challenged the validity of traditional Inuit
whaling and emphasized the emergence of internal markets, the Greenlanders argue
for the cultural and socioeconomic significance of whaling and its
sustainability. The present research seeks to understand the articulation and
contradiction between Inuit and Euroamerican perspectives about the use of
natural resources and sustainable development in the circumpolar north. The
project draws upon theoretical and methodological approaches derived from
political economics and natural resources anthropology.
