The University of Texas (UT)is establishing a molecular graphics teaching
laboratory for students in Organic Chemistry and Medicinal Chemistry. The
laboratory provides students with an enhanced understanding of how 3-dimensional
molecular structure affects the intrinsic properties and bioactivities of
chemical compounds. Computer-graphic display and manipulation of molecular
structures is useful in predicting drug efficacy and suggesting the synthesis of
new compounds as potentially useful drugs or agrochemicals.
