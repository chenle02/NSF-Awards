9701411 Chinburg This project concerns research on arithmetic geometry. The
primary goal of this research is to study the Galois structure of de Rham
cohomology and motives. Concerning de Rham cohomology, Professor Chinburg will
continue the program developed in two papers in the Annals of Mathematics to
establish the connection between equivariant de Rham Euler characteristics and
root numbers. Applications to the theory of modular forms will also be
considered. Concerning motives, Professor Chinburg will use higher dimensional
class field theory to develop a comprehensive theory of motivic Galois structure
invariants. He will also consider the relation between variants of the Main
Conjecture of Iwasawa theory and the Galois structure of K-groups. A second goal
of this project is to complete earlier work by Professor Chinburg concerning on
capacity theory, Arakelov theory and hyperbolic geometry. This work has
suggested new research projects concerning discriminants and the Lovasz
conjecture in combinatorics. Professor Chinburg's previous research concerning
the relation between Mahler measures and regulators in K-theory will be
reexamined in the light of recent work by C. Deninger concerning Mahler measures
and periods of mixed motives. This project falls into the general area of
arithmetic geometry - a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of
mathematics: number theory and geometry. This combination has proved
extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems that withstood
generations. Among its many consequences are new error correcting codes. Such
codes are essential for both modern computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
