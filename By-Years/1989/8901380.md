In this study the action and interaction of hormones on lipid (fat) metabolism,
particularly lipid metabolism in liver will be investigated. The liver is an
important organ in animal metabolism, however, little information exists
concerning its role as a fat store. Fish (chinook salmon, rainbow trout), which
have a unique ability to store lipid in their liver, are the model for these
studies. Initial investigations will focus on the actions of various pancreatic
hormones (insulin, glucagon and somatostatin) in the whole animal. The metabolic
action of a particular hormone as well as the interaction of that hormone with
other hormones will be examined. The relationship between aspects of lipid
metabolism and alteration in carbohydrate metabolism as well as the biochemical
processes operating within the liver cell will be examined to determine the
mechanisms by which pancreatic hormones influence lipid metabolism.
