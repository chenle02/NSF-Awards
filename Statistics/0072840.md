This project focuses on three research areas related to complex data. The first
research area is on high dimensional graphics, data analysis and related topics.
The second research area is on mixture models and bump hunting problems. The
third area is on models and inferential procedures for data with biases. Several
variants of likelihood, semi-parametric and iterative procedures are sought for
modeling and making inferences about the data.

We live in the information age. Information often hides in data sets with
different appearances. Mining and modeling (massive) data sets include the
discovery of patterns, subcomponents, bumps, or special events, and development
of models that explain the data and predict the future. This research is aimed
at providing solutions to some interesting problems arising from the data which
are either high dimension, or complicated, or with a sampling bias. Theories,
methods, and efficient computing algorithms are explored for extracting useful
information from the complex data. Application areas include astronomy,
neurosciences, quality control, and some (other) observational studies.
