9315941 Graham A joint Stanford-Mongolia team will: 1) study Mongolia's Mesozoic
tectonics through comprehensive basin analysis studies; and 2) investigate
Mesozoic climate as recorded in extensive accumulations of nonmarine Mesozoic
strata, comparing results with published global climatic models of Mesozoic
Asia.
