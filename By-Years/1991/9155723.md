By capitalizing on many of the same advances developed by astronomers for the
present generation of powerful research telescopes, we have created a low-cost,
computer- driven, automated imaging telescope. This MicroObservatory is a
marvelous tool for original nighttime observations, as well as for daytime use.
This proposal requests support to develop a network of these portable
instruments which will allow students to contribute to current research in
astronomy. To test this idea we will organize a group of research astronomers
and active semi-professional amateurs to oversee observational programs for
which the MicroObservatory is particularly suited; train teachers in its use;
and implement a system whereby students can collect data, use Internet to
transmit it to a central research database, and share in the analysis of data
collected from many sites.
