Fock and Goncharov have defined coordinates for representations of surface
groups into a Lie group. For linear groups, these coordinates have been
generalized by the PI and his collaborators to representations of 3-manifold
groups. The coordinates allow for exact computations of representations and
efficient computation of invariants such as volume and Chern-Simons invariant.
The proposal will study the properties of these coordinates, maintain and
develop databases of computations, study applications in quantum topology, and
generalize to other Lie groups and higher dimensional manifolds.

When solving a problem it is very important to express it in the right
coordinates. A problem can be completely intractable in one set of coordinates
while having an elegant solution in another. The PI and his collaborators have
defined special coordinates for representations of 3-manifold groups, which are
important objects for studying 3-dimensional spaces. These coordinates allow for
computations that were previously intractable, and the computations have
revealed new and interesting phenomena. The proposal will study the properties
of these coordinates, generalize in many directions, maintain and develop
databases of computations, and study applications in quantum topology and
mathematical physics.
