This award is to organize a workshop entitled "Scaling New Heights" to be held
at the Pittsburgh Supercomputer Center on May 20 and 21, 2002. The NSF PACI
leading-edge centers (NCSA, PSC, SDSC) together with the Center for
Computational Sciences (ORNL) and NERSC, will jointly organize the workshop
which will examine issues involved in scaling applications to thousands of
processors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this workshop is to examine
practical mechanisms for scaling these applications to closely coupled high-end
distributed memory architectures. &lt;br/&gt;
