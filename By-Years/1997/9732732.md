ABSTRACT OPP-9713999, 9732732 SCHIMEL, WELKER, PING UNIV. CALIFORNIA, UNIV.
WYOMING, UNIV. ALASKA This project is designed to develop a sufficient
understanding of winter carbon dynamics in arctic soils to model effectively the
spatial dynamics of winter carbon dioxide fluxes, and how they will vary with
altered climate. The work will involve field measurements of carbon dioxide
fluxes and environmental factors likely to control them coupled to modeling and
mechanistic studies. The project has four main objectives: 1) to quantify the
magnitude and timing of winter carbon dioxide fluxes across a range of arctic
tundra types; 2) to determine how winter respiration is controlled by the
physical regime of the soils; 3) to evaluate how organic matter composition
control winter carbon cycling; and 4) to develop simple models of winter
microbial activity. These objectives will link the soil thermal and unfrozen
water regimes to microbial activity and substrate use. The overarching goal is
to develop the simplest possible models that can be driven by broad scale
parameters while retaining necessary mechanistic information to provide reliable
estimates of carbon dynamics.
