"Maricopa Mathematics Mentoring and Renewal," a four-year project of Maricopa
Community College District (AZ) in collaboration with the Chandler School
District, the Tempe Elementary School District, Tempe High School District,
Chandler Gilbert Community College, and Arizona State University is designed to
address the issues of continual need for new mathematics teachers due to both
teacher turnover and continuous growth in population. Funded under the Teacher
Enhancement guidelines for Teacher Retention and Renewal, the project focuses on
preparing 81 teachers of grades 5-12 to serve as mentors/coaches to novice
teachers. n additional 119 teachers participate in professional development
activities and implement standards-based units while being mentored and coached
by the mentor teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All project teachers participate in
professional development activities designed to enhance both mathematical
content and pedagogical practice. In addition, mentor teachers develop their
skills in coaching and leading collegial support groups. Participating 5th - 8th
grade teachers implement a minimum of two standards-based mathematics units. In
the last two years, each middle school becomes a site for a collegial support
group. Teachers from feeder elementary schools and cluster high schools are a
part of the middle school based support group. Both mentor and novice teachers
participate in content courses delivered through Arizona State University. A
summer school practicum employs a mentoring/coaching model that engages teams of
participants in planning lessons based on standards-based instructional
strategies. The teaching is followed by reflection, re-planning, and re-teaching
by another team member. &lt;br/&gt;
