9318215 Krueger Humans and other animals use the peptide hormone ACTH to adapt
to stress. ACTH is released by the pituitary gland and travels in the blood to
the adrenal glands, where it binds to receptors on the adrenal cell surface.
This binding stimulates steroid hormone (cortisol) production by the adrenal
cells. Cortisol helps the body cope with stress. The focus of this project is to
determine how the different parts of the ACTH molecule bind to and stimulate the
receptor on the surface of the adrenal cell. Peptides are composed of amino
acids, and the contribution of the side chains of the individual amino acid
residues will be measured. This will be accomplished by comparing the receptor
binding and stimulation properties of the normal ACTH peptide with a series of
synthetic ACTH peptides that have only a single hydrogen atom substituted for
the normal, larger side chain at a specific amino acid site. By comparing the
properties of the normal and synthetic peptides, the contribution of each
specific amino acid side chain to receptor binding and activation will be
determined. The information obtained will provide an accurate and detailed
molecular model hormone-receptor interaction. ***
