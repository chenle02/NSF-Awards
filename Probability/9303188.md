Finding the exact solution to a number of fundamental optimization problems
(such as Bin Packing, Travelling Salesperson Problem, Vehicle Routing Problems)
is very likely to be intractable. One method of gaining an understanding of
these problems is to study them as stochastic models. It is then possible to
estimate the average behavior of the optimal solution and develop procedures
that will produce solutions that, on average, are close to the optimal. The past
research of the investigator has demonstrated the relevance and the power of
various methods of this approach. The main objective of this research is to make
further methodological progress in the understanding of these stochastic models.
In an overwhelming number of practical situations, one is faced with the problem
of choosing, among a usually astronomical number of possible configurations, the
one with the lowest cost (=optimal). Even in very simple cases, this is
intractable. Since these problems must nonetheless be dealt with, getting a
deeper understanding of them is a goal of considerable importance. One way to
gain insight is to study these problems under random input. Past research has
demonstrated the relevance to that study of sophisticated tools from various
branches of mathematics. The main objective of the present proposal is to make
further methodological progress through the study of a number of concrete
questions that crystalize the limits of today's techniques.
