Across all sciences, researchers hope to use algorithms and machine learning to
derive reliable insights from data, but often research findings turn out to be
false or hard to replicate. Indeed, assessing the validity of insights suggested
by data is presently a difficult and error-prone task. Even in industry, where
machine learning has fueled dramatic advances, more principled ways of
benchmarking and improving the performance of a machine learning system would
make a major difference. What often work best in practice are poorly understood
heuristics, leading to much guesswork with varying results. This inscrutable
behavior of machine learning also has repercussions on society at large as more
and more people struggle with the implications of algorithmic decisions in their
daily lives. Fairness, interpretability, and transparency have become major
talking points as algorithms increasingly aid or replace human
judgment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI aims to build guiding theory alongside
scalable algorithms that make the practice of machine learning more reliable,
transparent, and aligned with societal values. Focusing on algorithmic stability
as a unifying technical framework, this proposal targets several foundational
challenges including the design of a robust methodology to address the
reliability crisis in data science, a working theory for why and when large
artificial neural networks train and generalize well, and a universal framework
to reason about generalization in unsupervised learning as is presently lacking.
A particular emphasis is on application domains of societal impact. The PI has
long been invested in topics such as privacy, fairness, accountability and
transparency in machine learning not only through academic publications, but
also through workshops, mentorship, teaching, and interdisciplinary engagements.
