The propsed research is devoted to various questions of deformation quantization
of smooth manifolds. Recently, Kontsevich classified all such quantizations.
This classification is a consequence of a general formality theorem about Lie
the algebra of Hochschild cochains. An analog of this theorem is proposed. This
analog, and its various generalizations, are theorems about Hochschild and
cyclic complexes. Among the consequences of the proposed general formality
theorems are: definition of an A^ class of a general Poisson manifold; general
equivariant index theorems; classification of deformations with trace. Another,
related line of research studies the links between deformation quantization of
complex manifolds with holomorphic symplectic structures and Rozansky-Witten
invariants of 3-manifolds.

There are two related motives for studying quantization. One come from quantum
mechanics. The other motive from differential equations. The proposed research
will be devoted to the applications of methods of Kontsevich and Tamarkin
combined with deformation methods to the theory noncommutative differential
geometry, to obtain new geometrical and topological invariants.
