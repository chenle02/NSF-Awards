We propose to continue our theoretical and experimental research studying
Quantal Response Equilibria (QRE), a statistical model of equilibrium behavior
in games. The key feature of the equilibrium is that individuals do not always
play best responses to the strategies of their opponents, but play better
strategies with higher probability than worse strategies. Here we propose to
apply QRE to three different areas of application: auctions, voting, and
information aggregation. Several different series of experiments are planned,
including large-scale experiments (100+ subjects) to test theoretical
predictions about information aggregation and strategic voting in large groups.
On the theoretical side, we propose to extend the model to dynamic settings to
incorporate learning and repeated play, and to generalize the error structure to
allow for correlation across moves. There is also a computational part of the
proposal. Specifically, we plan to extend our current algorithms for computing
QRE in several ways, to allow more efficient computation of equilibria in
certain kinds of larger games and to allow for estimation in models with more
general error structures.
