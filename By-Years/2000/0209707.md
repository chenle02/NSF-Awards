Professor Joseph Wang of New Mexico State University is supported by the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program to study nanoparticle-biopolymer
assemblies for use as sensors. In particular, DNA hybridization events will be
detected electrically on gold nanoparticles, with eventual applications in
biodiagnostics and biodetection. New assays that couple multiple amplification
pathways and an effective magnetic separation will allow for increased
selectivity and sensitivity in the sensors. A new electrochemical coding
technology will be developed for the simultaneous detection of multiple DNA
targets. These projects will be combined on microfluidic device platforms.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ability to miniaturize complex chemical functions to
achieve lab-on-a-chip is a goal of nanotechnology. In addition, this work can be
related to biowarfare detection and thus has implications for national security.
