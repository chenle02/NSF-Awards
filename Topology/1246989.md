This grants provides support for a number of new training activities hosted by
the Department of Mathematics of the University of Utah. There will be 5 courses
on Modern Mathematics addressed to undergraduate students: 2 of them will be
two-week long summer courses, the other 3 will be semester long classes offered
during the Fall semester. Undergraduate students will also have the opportunity
to work on independent research projects during the Spring semester. At the
graduate level, there will be 3 advanced summer mini-courses, each 2 weeks long,
with speakers coming from around the country and abroad. Other activities
include various types of seminars. There will be vertical integration in these
activities among faculty, postdocs and students. Activities will cover the span
of the 5 academic years during the funding period, plus a total of 10 summer
weeks. The grant will support directly 6 undergraduate students in one-semester
long independent research projects, 25 eleven-month graduate student stipends,
and 9 postdoctoral fellows to be partially supported by the grant with the
remaining support coming from the department. The grant will also provide
support for about 50 undergraduates and 60 graduate students during the summers
schools, and cover tuition for the semester-long courses in Modern Mathematics
for 30 undergraduate students. This research training is designed to provide
students and postdocs a high level of mathematical training. The faculty in the
Algebraic Geometry and Topology groups at the University of Utah has a prominent
research record, and the grant will support bringing the graduate and
postdoctoral program to the same level. The grant will also strengthen the
already close connections between the two groups. The various activities,
especially the summer mini-courses, will serve to attract talented students to
come to Utah, either as graduate students or as postdoctoral associates. This
program will impact young mathematical scientists at the undergraduate,
graduate, and postdoctoral levels, and will provide an environment which will
stimulate collaboration across levels and across fields. The program will have a
deep impact also in the training of our senior graduate students and postdocs
into becoming effective, motivated teachers and mentors. As they grow into
mature mathematicians, this will have a long-lasting effect well beyond our
local environment and the duration of the grant.
