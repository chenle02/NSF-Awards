The growth of continents at their margins is an important process encompassing
a variety of poorly understood mechanisms. Although well-studied, there remain
major unresolved questions about the tectonic evolution of the Sierra Nevada in
California that resulted in accretion of arc material and various terranes to
the North American continent. Prior work has outlined a number of alternatives
for aspects of the Mesozoic activity in this area including the cause and timing
of metamorphism and igneous intrusion. This project is a collaborative,
integrated study of deformation and metamorphism in the central part the
Foothills Terrane, a key are containing a number of through-going faults
separating significantly different assemblages of rock. Results are expected to
resolve differences in conclusions drawn for the Foothills Terrane to the north
and south and to provide the basis for an integrated model for the construction
and deformation of arcs in this tectonic setting.
