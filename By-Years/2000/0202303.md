The Earth's magnetosphere exhibits a variety of behaviors that appear to
represent distinct states of the magnetosphere. An alternative theory, however,
is that these apparently disparate states are simply manifestations of a unified
response of the magnetosphere to the solar wind driver. This work will clarify
the situation by examining the relationship between magnetic substorms and
magnetic storms and the relationship between magnetic substorms and steady
magnetospheric convection (SMC). This project will examine these relationships
primarily from a data analysis point of view, using data from global auroral
imagers (Viking, Polar, and IMAGE satellites), neutral atom imagery (Polar and
IMAGE), energetic particle measurements from the Los Alamos geosynchronous
satellites and grand-based auroral and magnetic data.
