Abstract 547 Pitts Microfabrication of Advanced Radiation Detectors The project
will develop and produce ionizing radiation detectors using modern
microfabrication techniques. The scientific motivation of this project is the
production of silicon semiconductor detectors and micro-strip gas counters for
nuclear physics experiments at the Indiana University Cyclotron Facility (IUCF),
"Cooler" light ion storage ring, and the MIT-Bates South Hall Ring. The
microfabrication aspects of this project will include the application of
advanced micromachining and electrostatic bonding techniques to the design of
radiation sensors. These techniques will be developed with the assistance of the
Center for Microelectronic Sensors and Microstructures at the University of
Cincinnati. The design and testing of these detectors will be carried out in
collaboration with the IUCF Wire Chamber group. The educational goal of this
project is to train our students in the techniques of these rapidly evolving
fields. Support for four students is requested as an integral part of this
proposal. Participation in this project will give our students a new path to
industry and graduate school. The project is driven by the need to improve two
types of ionizing radiation detectors, the silicon semiconductor detector and
the micro-strip gas counter. Large area silicon microstrip detectors have
excellent position, timing, and energy resolution. These detectors suffer from a
sensitivity to radiation damage, however, and are very expensive in customized
versions. Local fabrication will allow the customization of these detectors to a
much wider range of experiments and applications, and do so on a more cost
effective basis. The second type of detector to be developed is the micro-strip
gas counter (MSGC). First described in 1988, the MSGC is a miniaturized multi-
wire proportional chamber (MWPC) with the wires of the MWPC replaced by metal
traces on an insulating substrate. Micromachini ng techniques such as
preferential etching of crystallographic planes will be utilized to further
develop these detectors and electrostatic bonding techniques will be applied to
their mechanical packaging. The latter feature will result in hermetically
sealed MWGCs compatible with operation inside the ultra high vacuum chamber of a
storage ring.
