Nonsmooth optimization problems involve objectives or constraints which are not
differentiable everywhere. The term structured nonsmooth optimization means that
the specific nonsmooth nature of the problem is known. One especially
interesting class repeatedly arises in many applications: problems involving
eigenvalues of matrices. The project primarily focuses on various aspects of
eigenvalue optimization, including semidefinite programming, quasiconvex
eigenvalue optimization, and non-Lipschitz eigenvalue optimization. The goal is
fourfold: the development of fast, robust numerical algorithms; analysis of
theoretical questions concerning optimality conditions and algorithm
convergence; development of software which can be used by the general scientific
community; and application to the solution of important interesting problems
which arise in practice.
