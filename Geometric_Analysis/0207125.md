DMS-0207125 Peter Perry and Carolyn Gordon

This award provides partial support for active research mathematicians with
limited means of support to attend and participate in the Conference on Inverse
Spectral geometry to be held at the University of Kentucky, June 20-28, 2002.
The conference will consist of two parts. The first (June 20-22) is a series of
special lectures by Steven Zelditch (Johns Hopkins University), Richard Beals
(Yale University), Peter Perry (University of Kentucky), and Tanya Christiansen
(University of Missouri) covering inverse spectral problems, scattering theory,
and analysis on the Heisenberg group. The second is a workshop on inverse
spectral geometry (June 24-28) with three morning lectures and one afternoon
lecture to allow maximum time for discussion and collaboration. Conference
themes are:

(1) Scattering theory for the Heisenberg group and Two-Step Nilpotent Lie
Groups (2) Direct and inverse scattering problems for the Laplacian on exterior
domains and non-compact Riemannian manifolds (3) Geometric invariants which are
(are not) spectral invariants on compact Riemannian manifolds (4) Geometry of
the Hodge Laplacian on p-forms on compact Riemannian manifolds
