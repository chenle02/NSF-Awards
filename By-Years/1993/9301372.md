9301372 Lamb This grant will support a new FASEB Summer Research Conference on
Signal Transduction in Plants to be held at Copper Mountain, Colorado, August
1-6, 1993. The contributed talks and discussion sessions will highlight recent
progress in signal transduction mechanisms in plants, and will bring together
scientists approaching this key topic from genetic, molecular, biochemical and
cellular physiology approaches. Specific sessions include: (1) Perception and
transduction of light signals, (2,3) Stress signaling (two sessions), (4)
Hormonal signaling, (5) Pattern signaling, (6) Cell:cell communication, (7)
Protein kinase systems, (8) Signaling the cell cycle, (9) Novel signal systems
and experimental approaches. The conference will be attended by 150 scientists
chosen to represent a cross-section of those interested in the subject. The
focus on signal transduction in plants in the context of a FASEB Summer Research
conference format will provide a unique forum for sustained, focused, in-depth
discussions of emerging topics that are critical to our understanding of the
underlying mechanisms controlling plant growth, development and environmental
responses. This conference will bring together scientists approaching plant
signal transduction from different, complementary, conceptual and technical
approaches and hence generate an interdisciplinary synthesis in this fast moving
topic. It is anticipated that this conference will be the first in a biennial
series focusing on Signal Transduction in plants, alternating with the
established Plant Genetics/Gene Expression FASEB Conference. %%% This conference
