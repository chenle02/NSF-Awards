The investigator develops mesh-free particle methods for nonlinear partial
differential equations, with particular reference to problems that admit
nonsmooth (discontinuous) solutions and to problems that involve highly
disparate scales. A major focus is developing procedures to recover an
approximate solution from the particle distribution that adapt to varying
smoothness of the solution. Other aims are to develop hybrid finite-volume-
particle methods and improve the accuracy and efficiency of particle methods.
The methods are applied to several illustrative problems: zero diffusion-
dispersion limits for conservation laws, the Euler-Poincare equations, models of
multiphase and multifluid flows, pollutant transport problems with discontinuous
coefficients, simulation of chemotactic bacteria aggregation, snd stochastic
initial value problems.

Solving partial differential equations numerically is an important and
efficient tool for the quantitative and qualitative study of many phenomena in
different applied areas that otherwise could not have been studied at all. The
investigator develops numerical methods that offer some advantages over other
techniques for computing solutions of partial differential equations,
particularly for problems with complicated geometries or moving boundaries, and
applies the methods to a number of illustrative examples.
