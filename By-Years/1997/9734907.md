ABSTRACT

Basic research is performed on the dependence of the composition,
microstructure, topography, and nano-mechanical properties of ultra-thin carbon
overcoats on plasma deposition conditions and the nano-tribological properties
of these films. The processing parameters studied, based on a factorial design
of experiments approach, are the RF power, chamber pressure, substrate bias
voltage, and deposition rate. Correlations developed in this research lead to
the identification of optimum film processing parameters and provide insight
into micro-scale tribophenomena. The results help to enhance the technological
basis for the design of anti-friction, wear-resistant interfaces of leading-edge
technologies such as high-density magnetic recording.
