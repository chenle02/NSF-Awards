Across the animal kingdom, males and females exhibit differences in behavior.
Recently, it has become clear that the chromosomal sex of the brain itself (XX
or XY) is an important factor in modulating its development and function. Yet
very little is known about the process by which genes "tune" the properties of
neural circuits to influence behavior. This project focuses on sex differences
in the function of the nervous system of a simple invertebrate, the nematode
roundworm C. elegans. These tiny worms (each is about the size of a speck of
dust) come in two sexes, hermaphrodites (which in C. elegans are slightly
modified females) and males. In both sexes, the structure of the nervous system
is simple and very well characterized: hermaphrodites have exactly 302 neurons,
while males have 383. Of these, both sexes share a so-called "core" set of 294
neurons that control behaviors exhibited by both sexes, including locomotion
(movement). Though both sexes move with a characteristic wave-shaped crawl along
a moist surface, our laboratory has found that males and hermaphrodites do so
differently: males move more quickly and the bends of their bodies are sharper
than those of hermaphrodites. This project will use a genetic approach to
understand exactly how the function of locomotor circuitry differs between the
sex. This project will identify the specific components of this circuitry that
are modulated by sex, and to discover how sex chromosomes bring about
differences in these components. These results will contribute to a better
understanding of the ways in which genes and environment can act in the nervous
system to influence its function. In addition, this project will provide
intensive research training in advanced neuroscience and genetics for three
graduate students and four undergraduates at the University of Rochester.
