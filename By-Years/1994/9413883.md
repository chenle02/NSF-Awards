CTS-9413883 Density functional theories will be used to develop an understanding
of the structure and energetics of the solid-fluid interface. The effects of a
variety of intermolecular interaction potentials on the interfacial properties
and crystallization dynamics will be investigated. The study may provide some
insight into the nucleation and growth of crystals in binary mixtures. The
results are expected to be important scientifically and also useful in improving
separation processes based on solidification.
