This proposal will create a computerized bibliography of early printing in Latin
America. The Center for &lt;br/&gt;Bibliographical Studies at the University of
California, Riverside, will create the file in cooperation with&lt;br/&gt;major
Latin American libraries, in particular the National Library of Mexico. This
file will be of&lt;br/&gt;assistance to scholars in literature, printing, and
languages. Experiments will investigate the means of&lt;br/&gt;assuring quality
control, searchability, and other new computer techniques for dealing with such
catalog&lt;br/&gt;files.&lt;br/&gt;
