This award will support student travel to the 2016 31st International Conference
on Logic in Computer Science (LICS) which focuses on theoretical and practical
topics in computer science that relate to logic. The conference will be held in
New York City, New York on July 5-8th 2016. Supporting student travel to attend
professional conferences and workshops is a very important mission of the NSF.
This award provides travel grants that will allow highly talented PhD students
to attend LICS, which will give them the opportunity to attend technical talks,
and interact with established experts in the field. The broader significance and
importance includes fostering the next generation of researchers in this
research area, as well as providing international experiences to build a
globally-aware workforce. The organizers will give priority to students from
under-represented groups and from small universities.
