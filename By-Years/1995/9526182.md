EEC-9526182 Datye This award funds a collaborative research effort between the
Industry University Cooperative Research Center at the University of New Mexico
on Microengineered Ceramics and the Industry University Cooperative Research
Center at Lehigh University on Polymer Interfaces. The overall objective of this
collaborative research is to gain a better understanding of the interfaces
between particulates (ceramics at New Mexico and rubber at Lehigh) and epoxy
polymers in order to control the thermal conductivity and fracture toughness of
the resulting composite materials. The University of New Mexico Center is
investigating boron nitride particulate surfaces, and the Lehigh University
Center is investigating the effects of epoxy polymer chemistry and rubber
surface characteristics on the interface between the boron nitride and rubber
particulates and the epoxy resins. The two centers are cooperating in the
processing and characterization of both the particulates and the composites that
are produced. The physical and thermal properties of the composites are also
being evaluated.
