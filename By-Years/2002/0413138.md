This project is a multidisciplinary effort of computer scientist,
mathematicians, and engineers at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) and
University of Pennsylvania (U Penn). The focus of the research will be on the
development of new planning techniques for tasks that cannot be performed
successfully without intermittent contacts. Such tasks are referred to as
manipulation tasks. Manipulations tasks, particularly those in which the effects
of dynamics influence the system performance and outcome, are exceedingly
important in robotics. The ability of a robot to perform such tasks completely
changes its character from passive observer to active participant capable of
performing useful work, whether it be assisting a first- responder on the scene
of a building collapse or assembling parts in micro-scale
devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;This research
requires the simultaneous development of new algorithms and mathematical models
for analyzing and predicting the motion of multibody systems with frictional,
compliant, intermittent contacts. These developments are being done with
attention paid to practical engineering concerns (verified by experiments) that
drive the form of mathematical models, and in turn, the algorithms and
mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The results of this
project are directly applicable to a large class of problems in locomotion and
manipulation that is central to ongoing research on humanoid robots, and on
fixturing and assembly in manufacturing settings. On the educational front, the
research team is developing a new graduate-level course on Manipulation Planning
Analysis, across UPenn and RPI, that will be co-taught by the co-PIs.&lt;br/&gt;
