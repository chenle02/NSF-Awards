Daggett Surveying Inc. will use a controlled archaeological context to develop
remote sensing techniques. Using a commercially available thermographic scanner
they will image the variations in ground surface temperature differences caused
by differential evaporation rates of vadose water. Variation, they believe is
affected by subsurface disturbances such as soil compaction and buried
structures that comprise an archaeological site. They will scan in the middle to
far-infrared wavelengths in the range from 2 to 14 micrometers. In addition to
real-time display, data will be captured on diskette for computer analysis,
enhancement and interpretation. In this first stage the team will work at a
known archaeological site which will then be excavated after thermographic
scanning. Thus ground truth will be obtained. This technique is important
because it will allow archaeologists both to locate sites more efficiently and
to plan excavation in a more effective manner. Location of archaeological sites
is necessary for mitigation work related to highway, pipeline and other
construction.
