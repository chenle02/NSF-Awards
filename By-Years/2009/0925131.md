This SBIR Phase II project is to develop thin film tandem solar cells,
comprising of nanocrystalline silicon and silicon carbon (nc-Si and nc-Si:C)
absorber materials, with a conversion efficiency of ~20%. The phase I project
successfully developed one of the key components, i.e. intrinsic nc-Si:C with a
band gap, Eg, of ~ 1.5 eV and with good opto-electronic properties. This key
material will be used initially in phase II to fabricate cells in a single
junction configuration with an efficiency goal of ~10%. Previously, developed
"device quality" nc-Si materials, with Eg ~1.1eV, were used to produce solar
cells with efficiency ~8%. Integrating the two devices in a tandem junction
configuration is forecast to yield efficiencies of ~18%. Further improvement in
the tandem junction device efficiency,to ~20%, may be achieved via the use of
buffer layers at the p/i or i/n interfaces and by increasing the grain size
which would boost the open circuit voltage, Voc.

Higher efficiency thin film tandem solar cells will be critical to achieving the
low costs necessary to achieve widespread adoption of photovoltaic energy
generating systems.
