Given the underrepresentation of Native students, professionals, and faculty in
the field of computer science (CS), American Indian Science and Engineering
Society (AISES) believes now is a critical time to focus on strengthening CS
research infrastructure of Native-serving institutions to move the needle on
broadening participation. To this end, AISES will develop and host the Convening
on Computer Science Research Infrastructure for Native-Serving Institutions,
gathering faculty from a diverse set of Native-serving institutions to
understand the issues they face, securing funding, and engaging students in CS
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
