The Tennessee State Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (TLSAMP)
project is comprised of 10 Institutions enrolling 3800 URM students. This is a
Phase III LSAMP Alliance Proposal. The goal of TLSAMP is to significantly
increase the quality and quantity of baccalaureate degrees awarded to
underrepresented science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)
students who continue to graduate programs over the next five-year period.
Sharing a long-term commitment to work together, TLSAMP will play a substantial
role in increasing the production of underrepresented STEM professionals to meet
the needs of government, industry, and academia. The partners share a strong
commitment to increasing access and opportunities for underrepresented minority
students through the following objectives: (1)Improve the recruitment of
underrepresented students into STEM majors at TLSAMP universities, especially
those students transferring from community colleges (2)Improve the retention and
persistence of underrepresented STEM majors across the Alliance (3)Increase the
number of underrepresented undergraduate STEM majors who enter graduate
programs.
