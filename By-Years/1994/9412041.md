This grant will provide funds for the purchase of a modern FT-IR spectrometer
system for the Chemical Engineering Department at North Carolina State
University. The equipment will support a variety of projects in polymer science
and engineering including characterization of gas-polymer interaction in novel,
highly selective polymeric membrane materials and the effect of copolymer
sequencing distribution on barrier properties of thermotropic liquid crystalline
polymers. The research projects associated with this equipment award should help
to improve the application of polymers in the industrial and commercial
separation of gases and for other purposes.
