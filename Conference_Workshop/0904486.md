This award will support the participation of graduate students and postdocs in
the "Twelfth Riviere-Fabes Symposium on Analysis and PDE" that will be held at
the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities from April 17 to April 19, 2009.

This annual conference celebrates the mathematical legacy of Nestor M. Riviere
and Eugene B. Fabes by focusing on recent developments in analysis, especially
in the field of partial differential equations. The 2009 program will feature
two principal speakers (Ermanno Lanconelli and Cedric Villani), each of whom
will give a two-hour lecture, and a number of one-hour talks delivered primarily
by mathematicians in the early stages of their careers (e.g., Ioan Bejenaru,
Hongjie Dong, Thierry Gallay, Alexis Vasseur). The program allows ample time for
informal discussion among the participants.
