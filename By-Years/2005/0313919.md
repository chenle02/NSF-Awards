This project includes two mathematics mini-courses to be part of an enhanced
group of mathematics activities at the 2003 Conference of the Society for
Advancement of Chicano and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS) to be held on
October 2-5, 2003 in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Each mini-course will consist
of&lt;br/&gt;six one-hour lectures by two instructors: an established
mathematician with an excellent record of research, mentoring and teaching, and
a junior mathematician who has demonstrated exceptional mentoring ability while
carrying out an outstanding research and teaching program. The mini-course
topics will be&lt;br/&gt;"Coding Theory" and "Explorations in Mathematical
Biology."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of each mini-course is to expose a
large number of minority students (advanced undergraduates and graduate
students)to a topic in applied or pure mathematics with particular emphasis on
diverse approaches to problems, and connections to other areas of mathematics or
other disciplines. The mini-courses are expected to reach a point when open
problems that have the potential to grow into graduate research projects can be
stated in context. This is designed to encourage students to continue on to
graduate school and boost their confidence by making them realize that, even at
this stage, they are able to understand&lt;br/&gt;the nature of motivating
questions.
