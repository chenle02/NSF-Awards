A redshift survey of galaxies will enable astronomers to infer the physical
structure of our Universe out to large distances. The redshift of the light from
galaxies depends on the distance to the galaxy. A new galaxy redshift survey of
unprecedented size will be carried out. The galaxy sample will be selected
photo-electrically using the scanning Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) camera at the
Las Campanas 1-meter telescope in Chile. Redshifts for 20,000 galaxies will be
obtained using multiple-object spectroscopy at the wide-field Cassegrain focus
of the Las Campanas 2.5-meter telescope. The median galaxy redshift will be
18,000 kilometers per seconds. The survey will sample 800 square degrees
distributed over an area of one steradian of the sky. The large volume of the
survey will reveal features in the galaxy distribution at the largest
practicable scales. The high sampling density of the survey will reveal in
detail the nature of clusters and voids in the galaxy distribution within our
Universe.
