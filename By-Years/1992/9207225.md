An award to the Theoretical and Astrophysical Relativity group of the
University of Utah is being made to enable them to continue their fundamental
studies in the quantum theory of gravity, the nature and role of time, the
electrodynamical behavior of black holes in active galactic nuclei, and sources
of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays.
