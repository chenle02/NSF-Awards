Current Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology is considerably better
than that of five years ago, but it is still not at a level of accuracy needed
for widespread practical applications. If OCR systems are to be a useful
alternative to skilled human typists, the error rates of the machine must be
reduced by one to two orders of magnitude. This project applies new approaches
to the problem. The problem is here approached by modeling the various steps in
the character recognition process and then developing analytical techniques for
each step. The project will continue research on extracting features directly
from gray scale images (as compared with the usual method involving binarization
of the images before recognition). The research will also address construction
of character prototypes and development of flexible graph matching algorithms
taking into account both typeface specifications and the characteristics of
distortions and noise encountered in the printing process.
