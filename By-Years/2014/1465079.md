With this award, the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms B Program is
supporting Professor Joseph M. O'Connor at the University of California-San
Diego to examine the interaction of metals with readily available
polyunsaturated organic compounds in order to understand the relationship
between metal-coordination mode and chemical reactivity. These investigations
afford opportunities for the development of new methods for the environmentally
benign construction of molecules with useful properties of interest to the
chemical and pharmaceutical industry. Professor O'Connor will integrate the
research and educational components of this project in order to promote
education in the STEM fields by providing interdisciplinary research
opportunities for college and graduate students. The proposed chemistry is
expected to advance fundamental understanding of organometallic, organic, and
inorganic processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this research, a combination of
synthetic, structural, computational and mechanistic studies will be applied to
the development of new cycloaromatization reactions based on the metal-triggered
reactions of acyclic tri(pi) conjugated molecules, including dienynes, trienes,
and heteroatom-containing analogues. A key component of this research is the
synthesis and study of hexahapto coordination of tri(pi) molecules to transition
metals. These new reactions may have broad application in organic synthesis by
providing alternatives to thermal pericyclic reactions.
