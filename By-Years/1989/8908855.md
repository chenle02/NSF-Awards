Phosphorus is important in the control of primary production in aquatic
ecosystems. The extent to which sediments recycle phosphine to overlying waters
is critical to system function. Earlier research indicates that the oxygen
content of water is a primary controlling variable in phosphorus release from
sediments. This project will evaluate the role of phosphine gas (PH.3) in the
phosphorus cycle of aquatic ecosystems. The investigator is well qualified.
Institutional support and environment are excellent. The research could have
significant implications for wetland management.
