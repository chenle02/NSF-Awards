This research addresses the topic of robot path planning. In this project,
direct methods for planning high speed motions of realistic industrial robots
are developed. A recently developed geometric approach to the dynamic
performance of multi-body systems is used. It transforms the complex motion
planning problem into a simple geometric task while taking into consideration
robot dynamics, actuator constraints, and obstacles in an efficient manner. The
method's implied computational efficiency makes on- line computation of close to
optimal motions possible. If successful, this research will be a step in
improving the productivity and utility of robotic systems. It may allow
optimizing automated assembly processes and the operation of flexible automated
cells.
