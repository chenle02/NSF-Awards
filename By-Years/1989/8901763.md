This research concerns the solution of certain undetermined coefficient
problems in parabolic and elliptic partial differential equations where the
unknown coefficients depend only on the dependent variables. The problems are
related to the determination of laws or relationships governing physical
systems, and the mathematical formulation is most often in the form of an
elliptic or parabolic equation. The research is in the general area of Applied
Mathematics and concerns the solutions of partial differential equations which
arise in physical settings. In addition to the solutions of partial differential
equations, the research will involve the study of inverse problems which have
applications to the recovery of birth and death rates and initial distributions
in age- dependent population models.
