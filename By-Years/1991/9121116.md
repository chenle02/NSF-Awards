3-D Electromagnetic Particle Simulation on the Solar Wind Energy Transfer into
the Magnetosphere Recently developed particle code techniques and faster
computers have made possible have made possible 3-D and fully have made possible
3-D and fully electromagnetic simulations. These new techniques will be applied
to the global interaction of the solar wind with the Earth's magnetosphere to
investigate energy transport through the bowshock and magnetopause and on into
the magnetosphere. Evolution and configuration of the magnetopause is handled
through dynamic particle-field pressure balance. Applicable plasma instabilities
will be studied using the code, thus complementing analytical theories of the
magnetopause. Resulting nonlinear phenomena, namely heating and diffusion of
particle due to excited waves, will be compared with relevant observations. The
new 3-D electromagnetic (E-M) code is already operational and preliminary
results show how the magnetopause is created. Energetic solar particles enter
the forward magnetic cusps and descend into the auroral zones. The bunching of
plasma due to kinetic instabilities is seen at the magnetopause near the
equatorial plane. Heating of both ions and electrons is observed and dawn-dusk
asymmetry is also seen. The same code is capable of simulating the effects of
changes in various solar wind conditions such as: wind density and velocity,
electron and ion temperatures, cross- field flow component of the flow, and
interplanetary (IMF) strength and orientation. A variety of diagnostics is ready
to apply to code results, including novel 3-D graphics techniques, monitoring of
excited waves by tranform methods and the measuring of diffusion rates.
