9418767 Mathur This Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) is
being funded as a multi-site research Center. Purdue University and the
University of Florida is adding the University of Oregon (including Oregon State
University, the Oregon Graduate Institute of Science &amp; Technology and
Portland State University) as research sites in the I/UCRC for Software
Engineering (SERC). Seven companies will join SERC inconjunction with the
University of Oregon becoming an additional research site in the Center. The
Center's research agenda will be increased by research projects on "Time
Insensitive Binary to Binary Translation; "Entropy-Based Measure of Software
Complexity and Its Application to Software Testing", "Visual Programming
Languages", "Human Computer Interaction", and "Software Engineering Tools for
the Construction of Network Applications." The researchers of involved with the
Center are qualified to perform the research projects. The Center has been
coordinated with Dr. Bruce Barnes, Program Director of the Computer Computation
Research Program at NSF. The U.S. Department of Army has provided funding to
augment the Centers ongoing research program and to obtain a membership in the
Center. The Program Manager recommends the Purdue University be awarded $50,000
for the first year of a five year continuing award. An additional $35,437 is
recommended for one year with funds provided by Purdue University. Near the end
of each 12-month period, the Program Manager and/or the Division Director of the
Engineering Education Centers Division will review the progress of the Center on
a number of renewal criteria, including the following: 1) the extent to which
the industry/university interaction is developing; 2) the extent to which the
support base is developing; and 3) the extent to which a robust research program
is developing. If the review is satisfactory, the Program Manager will
recommends support for the next period of this co ntinuing award.
