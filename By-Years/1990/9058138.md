Dr. Full plans to continue studying animal energetics. He wants to determine
whether or not the cost of locomotion is indirectly proportional to body size,
if cost is independent of the number system. He wants to unravel the underlying
biomedical/biochemical basis by looking at a diverse group of animals including
ants, crabs, millipedes, lizards, birds, and mammals. Dr. Full is the first to
employ miniature force plate to analyze forces involved in movement patterns of
tiny insects. He will develop other force plates to be applied in analyses of
other animals. This research will aid in the development of general theory of
animal design and movement in general.
