The decay of the free neutron is the simplest nuclear beta decay.
The&lt;br/&gt;parameters that describe the decay of the free neutron, especially
the&lt;br/&gt;neutron lifetime, provide essential inputs to all investigations
that&lt;br/&gt;involve the weak interaction. A precise value for the neutron
lifetime&lt;br/&gt;is required for several internal consistency tests of the
Standard&lt;br/&gt;Model. The neutron lifetime is also an essential parameter in
the&lt;br/&gt;theory of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). At present, the
uncertainty&lt;br/&gt;in the neutron lifetime currently provides the largest
contribution to&lt;br/&gt;the uncertainty in the value of the helium to hydrogen
ratio predicted&lt;br/&gt;by BBN theory. Intercomparison between the neutron
lifetime, the&lt;br/&gt;observed cosmic light element abundances and the known
number of light&lt;br/&gt;neutrino species provides a critical consistency check
for BBN theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This experiment will measure the neutron
lifetime using magnetically&lt;br/&gt;trapped ultracold neutrons (UCN). A
magnetic trap is ``filled'' by&lt;br/&gt;scattering a beam of low-energy
neutrons from superfluid helium. Some&lt;br/&gt;neutrons lose enough energy to
become trapped, with the remainder&lt;br/&gt;leaving the trapping region. The
beam is then turned off and the rate&lt;br/&gt;of neutron decay, and thus their
lifetime, is measured as these trapped&lt;br/&gt;neutrons undergo beta-decay.
This technique should allow the&lt;br/&gt;researchers to substantial improve the
precision that the neutron beta&lt;br/&gt;decay lifetime is known. Using the
method of magnetic trapping, it&lt;br/&gt;should be possible to improve the
accuracy of the neutron lifetime by a&lt;br/&gt;factor of between 2 and 50 using
existing and next-generation neutron&lt;br/&gt;sources.&lt;br/&gt;
