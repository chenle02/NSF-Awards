9319196 Aronson The central objective of the proposed work is to delineate the
occurrence and stability of Charge Density Waves (CDWs) in the layered rare
earth polychalcogenides. This approach combines a synthetic solid-state
chemistry component with physical measurements of crystal structure, electrical
transport, and magnetic susceptibility and theoretical analyses of observed and
predicted structural distortions in the CDW phase. By varying temperature,
pressure, composition, and stoichiometry, the overall electron count and
covalency in this nearly isostructural family of compounds can be controlled in
a continuous manner, accessing the complete range of CDW stability. Of central
interest is the identification and description of compounds in which the CDW is
marginally stable, for here the underlying forces responsible for the CDW
instability are most readily identified and ultimately can be used to predict
new classes of CDW materials. ***
