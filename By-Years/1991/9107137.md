Professors Larson and Smith will conduct research in several areas of operator
algebras. Professor Larson will work on problems related to similarity theory
for nests, quasitriangularity considerations within von Neumann algebras,
reflexivity properties of operator algebras, and to mappings between algebras of
operators. Professor Smith will focus on the theory of tensor products of
operator algebras, complete boundedness for C*-algebras, cohomology theory, and
the structure of derivations and automorphisms of non-selfadjoint algebras.
Aspects of each of the investigator's work will contribute to a joint study of
nuclearity in triangular operator algebras. This research project concerns
families of Hilbert space operators called algebras. A Hilbert space operator
can be thought of as an infinite matrix of complex numbers. Such objects are
important in almost every branch of pure and applied mathematics. Putting
together aggregates of these operators with common qualities to form an algebra
is a major theme in mathematics.
