The objective of this research program is to investigate new approaches to the
problem of modeling and tracking of a large class of time-varying signals. The
class of signals under consideration includes signals relatively concentrated in
time-frequency, signals with slowly varying amplitude and frequency, and some
signals with rapid variation in spectral content. Both parametric and
nonparametric approaches are being developed. Parsimonious models incorporating
parameters that reflect non-stationary that are specific to the class of signals
under consideration also being considered. Those models will provide an accurate
and efficient parametrization of signals in these classes. Algorithms are being
developed in this project for efficient estimation of the model parameters from
noisy observations of the signal. A nonparametric approach utilizing new time-
frequency representations based on determination of optimal signal-dependent
kernels is also being developed to overcome several problems which have plagued
current time-frequency methods.
