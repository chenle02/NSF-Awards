9408623 Jim Chen This project addresses both modelling and experimentation to
investigate a modified single roll caster using the concept of "Intelligent
Processing of Materials". Such a study will also lead to the advancement of
similar technology, melt spinning, which is known as a rapid solidification
process (RSP). The materials produced by RSP possess refined and homogeneous
microstructures and much improved physical, magnetic, and mechanical properties.
Building on prior work of simulating hot rolling process, this project on single
roll casting of thin strips has the process potential to reduce the energy
consumption and manufacturing cost by more than 50% as compared with the
conventional steel making where several process steps are involved including
casting, rolling and heat treating. The study will include the development of
(1) macro-scale modeling for predicting the melt flow and solidification
phenomena as well as predicting the ribbon geometry, (2) experimental
investigation of interface heat transfer and solidification behavior, and (3)
model validation and process optimization. Primary metals processing technology
has been moving towards direct casting of thinner and thinner cross sections.
Initially, the process step between ingot casting and hot rolling was eliminated
by the development of direct, one step, continuous slab casting. The next step
of eliminating slab casting followed by rolling by a single step, continuous
strip casting remains a technical challenge, particularly for higher melting
metals such as steel. Successful completion of this project has the potential to
revolutionize the way thin strips of metals are manufactured at substantially
reduced cost with a low capital investment.
