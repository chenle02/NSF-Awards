This NYI award will support the research of a promising and accomplished young
investigator. His research will include a study of relativistic field theory
models of hadronic systems at finite density and temperature, using approaches
based both on quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and on quantum hadrodynamics (QHD),
which are relativistic field theories with hadronic degrees of freedom. A major
goal is to develop connections between QCD and the nuclear phenomenology
associated with QHD, by applying QCD sum rule methods.
