9301264 Rosenberg This is a project to continue a program of observations and
data analysis based on data obtained by an imaging riometer at Sondre
Stromfjord, Greenland. The riometer will be operated and maintained with support
from the Danish Meteorological Institute. The main objective of this one year
study is to substantiate previous results pertaining to the riometer absorption
produced by drifting patches of enhanced F region ionization. If the riometer is
sensitive enough to detect the presence of these patches, then its usefulness in
studies of ionization processes in the upper atmosphere can be exploited in
future investigations. ***
