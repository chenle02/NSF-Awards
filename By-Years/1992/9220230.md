9220230 Kempf The purchase of a laser, scanning, confocal microscope is
proposed with a 50% cost-share by Auburn University. The microscope will be
utilized for research concerned with vitellogenesis and endocytosis,
neurodevelopment, receptor-ligand binding, the role of compartmentalization of
kinase and substrate during nervous system differentiation, physiological
function of Na/K ATPase and carbonic anhydrace in water balance, neural network
modeling, hypervelocity micrometeoroid impacts, tissue cyst formation by
parasites, high temperature radiator technology, and the hormonal control of
reproductive organ differentiation. This research will use a variety of
techniques including 3-dimensional reconstruction, topographic imaging, analysis
of metabolic function via the use of vital fluorescent dyes, and analysis of
calcium distribution and flux. The microscope will serve the needs of many
faculty at Auburn University whose research programs require the unique
capabilities of this instrument. This includes a number of investigators whose
research efforts are hampered by having to travel a considerable distance to
University of Georgia, Athens to gain the use of such a microscope. The proposed
instrumentation will be housed in the Auburn University Cell Science Center
where it will be readily available for use by the PIs submitting this proposal,
as well as by other faculty and students. Investigators that have need of a
confocal microscope are from a number of different departments and represent
diverse disciplines including Protozoology, Developmental Biology, Cell Biology,
Physiology, Molecular Biology, Parasitology, and Electrical Engineering
