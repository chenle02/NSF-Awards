This award to Professors Jiri Janata and Miroslawa Josowicz of the Georgia
Institute of Technology is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
Program in the Chemistry Division. Polyanaline and the closely related
poly(phenylene sulfidephenyleneamine) are to be modified with non-aqeuous acids
and/or metal clusters in an effort to finely adjust the electronic work
functions of these electrically conducting polymers. In this way, gas sensors
made from these polymers are to have greater sensitivity and selectivity to
specific gas molecules. A donacity scale of interactions is proposed to
correlate gas/polymer interactions with the polymer work function, with the goal
of more predictable sensor performance. In addition, sensor fabrication methods
are to be explored with a electrochemical molecular imprinting technique.

Chemical sensing arrays can be prepared from a matrix of electrically conducting
polymers. However, sensitivity, selectivity, robustness, and compatibility with
solid-state fabrication processes remain as unresolved issues. In this work,
fundamental methods for tuning the selectivity of a polymer matrix will be
explored along with a new strategy for fabrication.
