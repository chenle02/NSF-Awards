This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to develop custom
signal processing algorithms and embedded software for arrays of tiny neural
probes that are currently being manufactured for simultaneously recording the
activity of multiple neurons. Most of the effort expended to date on neural
probes has focused on the formidable challenges of manufacturing the hardware
elements of the probes. One crucial element for making neural communications via
probes technically and commercially viable has received little attention.
Advanced signal processing technologies needed to condition, recover and
transmit the signals from neurons, and to deliver transmitted neural stimulus to
muscle tissue has received little attention. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
aims to develop algorithms and embedded software that will render neural probes
more reliable and practical. Neural probes so equipped can reliably capture,
condition, filter, transmit and receive neural signals, and restore the needed
high degree of repeatability and consistency to their operation. This, in turn,
will accelerate the deployment of the probes, greatly enhancing the value of the
substantial investment in neural probes to date. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
