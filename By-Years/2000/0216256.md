AST-0216256&lt;br/&gt;Skrutskie, Michael F.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
will equip the University of Virginia's Fan mountain observatory with a state-
of-the-art infrared imager. Graduate and undergraduate students will design and
build the instrument, which is based on a 1024x1024 HgCdTe Rockwell Science
Center "HAWAII" array to provide sensitivity to 2.5 micrometers wavelength. In
addition to broad and narrow-band imaging capabioity the camera design includes
a low resolution (R~300) grism-based spectrographic mode. The completed system
will be used for several scientific applications, including 1.variability
studies of young stellar objects, 2. Spectral classification studies of brown
dwarfs, parallax/proper motion measurements of brown dwarfs, 3. Classification
and variability studies of asymptotic giant branch stars, and 4 rotational
mineralogy studies of asteriods and near-earth objects.
