This is a proposal to develop new and improved techniques that might be of
special use in analyzing time-varying biological signals. The approach is to
design appropriate kernels to be used in time-frequency representation of
signals, a representation that is a generalization of the classical Fourier
transform. The new method is expected to provide an improved description of
signals whose characteristics vary with time. The proposed research will
investigate the use of these techniques for the analysis of biomedical signals:
EEG in epileptic patients, joint sounds in patients with joint problems, and
evoked potentials in phobic patients. The research, if successful, will result
in a set of new analytic techniques for characterizing signals, and the
demonstration of the usefulness of these techniques for diagnostic purposes.
