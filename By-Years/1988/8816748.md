This award to the University of Georgia will provide one-half of the funds
needed to acquire an electron microprobe instrument. The instrument will be
housed and operated in the University's Department of Geology and will be
available for use by qualified scientists on campus and from other institutions
in the region. The University of Georgia is committed to matching the NSF
contribution for this equipment. The electron microprobe is an analytical
instrument capable of accurate chemical analysis of a very small volume of solid
material and has proven extremely valuable for the analysis of rock, mineral and
synthetic materials. The equipment at Georgia will be used in a number of
research projects in petrology, geochemistry, mineralogy, economic geology, and
archeogeology for which microanalysis is needed.
