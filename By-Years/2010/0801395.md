Abstract&lt;br/&gt;ECCS-0801395&lt;br/&gt;Y. Deng, University of South Carolina
Research Fdn&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective: The objective of the proposal is to
fundamentally understand plasma wave oscillations in III-nitride materials and
field-effect transistors and to develop integrable and tunable deep-
submicron/nanoscale III-nitride plasma wave terahertz detectors. Fundamental
understanding and exploitation of plasma wave oscillations in III-nitride
materials and transistors holds a great promise to revolutionize terahertz
electronics and advance the knowledge of mesoscopic and nanoscopic physics in
III-nitrides. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The objective will be
accomplished through four primary tasks: (1) development of theories and models
for plasma wave oscillations in III-nitride materials; (2) characterization of
plasma wave oscillations in III-nitride materials and validation of
corresponding theories and models by experimental data; (3) development of
detection theory for deep-submicron/nanoscale III-nitride plasma wave terahertz
detectors; and (4) design, fabrication, and test of deep-submicron/nanoscale
III-nitride plasma wave terahertz detectors and validation of the detection
theory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The research will provide new
insights and advance the knowledge on III-nitride device physics and material
properties. The proposed terahertz detectors have a wide range of potential
applications, including wireless communication for above 60 GHz, medical
imaging, cancer diagnosis, far-infrared spectrum analysis, chemical-compound and
biological-agent identification, etc. The principle investigator will integrate
the research project with educational activities by: (1) outreach to students
from local high schools, K-8 and the community through a hands-on exhibit at the
South Carolina State Museum annually; (2) involvement of undergraduates,
graduates, women, and minorities in the research program; (3) improvement of two
undergraduate courses and two graduate courses; and (4) development of a new
graduate course. &lt;br/&gt;
