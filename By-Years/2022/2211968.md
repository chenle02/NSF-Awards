The field of program synthesis aims to create tools that can automatically
create a program from a specification of desired behavior. Synthesis holds the
promise of easing the burden on programmers (e.g., by finding solutions to
tricky special cases automatically), and allowing non-programmers to create
programs merely by indicating the outcome that they want the program to produce.
Unfortunately, current synthesis tools do not scale up to large-scale
programming problems, a situation that threatens to doom this promising
technology to being a niche field. This project's novelties are ways to exploit
compositionality in program synthesis in a way that allows one to create bigger
programs out of smaller ones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project builds on a
recent framework called SemGuS (Semantics-Guided Synthesis), which offers a
foothold on the expressibility and scalability problems of program synthesis. In
principle, the framework can support the synthesis of software in layers, where
implementation choices in one layer are hidden from other layers (and thus
consistent with modular software design with information hiding). The goal of
the project is to capitalize on the opportunity that SemGuS offers for extending
synthesis to much larger systems than was possible heretofore. The work will
lead to more scalable and general synthesis algorithms, with potential benefits
to synthesis applications that are already in widespread use. Further
development of the SemGuS framework has the potential to make synthesis more
usable and programmable, and thereby allow users to carry out synthesis tasks
without prior knowledge of existing synthesis tools. Most importantly,
compositional synthesis will allow synthesis to scale to larger applications
with more practical relevance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
