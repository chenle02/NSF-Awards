NCS-0347661 CAREER: Efficient Cryptographic Protocols for Secure and Private
Cryptographic Transactions PI: Anna Lysyanskaya

A typical computer user performs a multitude of electronic transactions each
day: reading e-mail, managing bank accounts, making on-line purchases, to name a
few. Each of them must be secure: they should be carried out by authorized users
only, and the information entered must be authentic. On the other hand, each
transaction should be private: personal information or account balances should
not become available without a user's explicit consent. Since data aggregation
is simple to do, it is highly desirable to limit the information transmitted in
each transaction to a bare minimum without compromising its authenticity.

Cryptographic schemes that make this possible are the intended direct outcome of
this research. This project investigates the security requirements of the basic
protocols that a system for secure and private electronic transactions would
comprise and develops efficient and provably secure digital signature schemes
and other primitives that lend themselves to the design of such protocols. The
chief method for achieving these results is to build upon existing highly
theoretical foundations using practical buiding blocks.

Since this project develops provable guarantees that personal information will
not be abused, its broader impact is in protecting the privacy of computer
users.
