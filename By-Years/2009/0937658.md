This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). This project will initiate work on the development of
methods for two unprecedented reactions: (1) in situ Grignard formation and use
in cross-coupling reactions in water, and (2) formation of unstabilized ylides
for Wittig-like olefinations, also in water. These will take advantage of
micellar catalysis, where the reactive species to be generated either on the
surface of the metal, or within a micelle, are protected from their aqueous
surroundings by the hydrophobic interior of these nanoparticles. For these
studies, many variables will need to be screened, including the nature of the
amphiphile that is to supply a dry reaction medium, in
water.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular
Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor Bruce H. Lipshutz of
the Department of Chemistry at the University of California, Santa Barbara.
Professor Bruce Lipshutz's research efforts revolve around the development of
new synthetic methods for the formation of C-C, C-H, C-O, and C-N bonds. Such
chemistry will contribute to environmentally benign methods for chemical
synthesis, as these new processes will be developed in the absence of organic
solvents. Successful development of the methodology will have an impact on
synthesis in the pharmaceutical, fine chemicals, and agricultural industries.
