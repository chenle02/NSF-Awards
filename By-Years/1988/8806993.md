The world's most productive speckle interferometer will be upgraded using an
improved computer system and a new imaging detector, which will replace an
existing but deteriorating intensified Charge-Coupled Device detector. This
speckle interferometer, operating from Kitt Peak's 4-meter Telescope and
Perkin's 72-inch Telescope, has been used in a long-term program of astrometric
measurements of binary stars. The speckle photometry program is a major new
effort to accurately determine the colors and magnitudes of the individual
components of binary systems having separations as small as 0.035 arcseconds.
