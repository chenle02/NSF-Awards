The development of complex software systems is a costly endeavor. If prototypes
can be rapidly constructed to test the functionality and performance of these
systems as the developers gain more knowledge about their requirements, then
complex systems can evolve from a series of prototyping efforts. This project
uses a model evolution approach to prototyping by treating (i) each prototype
systems as an executable abstract model of the target system and (ii) the
prototyping process as a series of model evolution supported by a knowledge-base
management systems (KBMS). The project will develop an extensible object-
oriented knowledge model, a multi-paradigm computation model based on nested
transactions, and a reflective, wide-spectrum, and multi-paradigm knowledge base
programming language (KBPL) called K which will serve as the common prototyping
language in a KBMS-supported evolutionary prototyping system.
