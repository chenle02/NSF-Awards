This project will survey the metazoan parasitesand their elasmobranch hosts from
the Sea of Cortez, Mexico. The fishes (and putatively, the parasites) are highly
endemic and are threatened by severe overharvesting by commercial fishing. Aside
from collecting whole specimens, the survey will sample tissues of hosts and
parasites for future molecular analysis. Collections will be deposited in
Mexico's Guaymas Marine Station; other in-country collaborators include
scientists and students at the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, the
Mexican government, and native Mexican fisherman. Aside from documenting the
composition and geographic distribution of the elasmobranch fishes and their
metazoan parasites, the survey will contribute to the conservation and
sustainable commercial use of these fishes in the Sea of Cortez. %%% This four-
year biodiversity project will survey, for the first time, the elasmobranch
fishes (sharks, skates and rays) inhabiting the Sea of Cortez, along with their
internal metazoan parasites. Because of their relative isolation, many of the
elasmobranch fishes and their parasites in the Sea of Cortez will be new to
science. However, knowledge of both the fishes and the parasites is threatened
because the elasmobranch fishes are in danger of being wiped out by
overharvesting. The survey will also sample tissues of hosts and parasites for
future molecular analysis. Aside from documenting the composition and geographic
distribution of the elasmobranch fishes and their metazoan parasites, the survey
will contribute to the conservation and sustainable commercial use of these
fishes in the Sea of Cortez.
