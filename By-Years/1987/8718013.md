This Research in Primarily Undergraduate Institutions (PUI) project is in the
general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the subfield of
bioelectrochemistry. The goal of this innovative program is to characterize the
electrochemical behavior of transition metal complexes that experience a large
change in molecular structure during electron transfer. Experimental results
from this research will be used to test current theories of electron transfer
reactions and to understand examples of unusual redox behavior associated with
structural change. Rates and mechanisms of electrode reactions will be
investigated using dynamic voltammetric techniques, low temperature
electrochemistry, and microelectrodes. X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS)
spectroelectrochemistry will be used to determine changes in metal-ligand bond
distances that occur as a result of electron transfer. Compounds to be
investigated include oxomolybdenum (VI) complexes, axially substituted iron
porphyrins and cobalt macrocycles, metal-metal bonded dimers of molybdenum and
tungsten, and the iron-molybdenum cofactor extracted from nitrogenase enzyme.
The results of these investigations should contribute significantly to our
understanding of metalloenzyme-catalyzed electron transfer reactions and have
relevance to both biotechnological and in vivo processes.
