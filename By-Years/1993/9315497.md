9315497 Bashein This is a planning project to develop methods to improve the
prediction of the time required to perform elective surgical operations. The
goal is to change the present system which is based on outright guesses or
historical averages of times to perform similar procedures. Hypotheses to be
tested are: that a predictive model based on historical data and the surgeon's
time estimate will predict more accurately than either of the factors alone;
even with little historical data or surgeon experience for a particular
operation it will be possible to improve the surgeon's time estimate; and, a
useful measure of the level of precision associated with a predicted operating
time can also be made from the surgeon's estimate of the variability of his/her
time estimate and the available historical data. This planning project is to
delineate the longer-term goals to develop an improved method for scheduling
elective operations and to evaluate the method in actual practice, preferably at
more than one institution. ***
