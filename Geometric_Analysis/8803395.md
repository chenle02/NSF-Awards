Jean Taylor will continue her work on surfaces of minimum energy. She will
focus her attention on minimizing energy functionals which do not possess
directional uniformity, this is known as anisotropism. The techniques to be used
come from a branch of the calculus of variations, geometric measure theory,
which is having an ever increasing impact on many areas of geometric analysis.
This work has applications in materials research and some joint projects with
John Cahn, a metallurgist, will be continued. One of her main objectives will be
to understand the geometric consequences of minimization of crystal- type
anisotropic surface energies. In a slightly different direction she will try to
develop and employ combinatorial techniques of area minimization. These latter
techniques become appropriate in the polyhedral situations which frequently
arise. The energy functionals have an integral representation inwhich the
integrand, known as the free energy, is defined on the unit sphere. The free
energy in turn gives rise to the Wulff shape, which is the obect of most of
Taylor's studies. She will study several new types of singularities in these
surfaces and some new rules for orientations in heterogeneous nucleation, which
have been predicted in some of her earlier work with Cahn. Some of this will
involve allowing edge energies in the integral being minimized. Other
investigations will study the evolution of the minimizing surfaces as the energy
function is allowed to vary.
