The project involves the implemention of an integrated or common laboratory to
be used by engineering students in their introductory mathematics, physics, and
engineering courses. The proposed laboratory is part of a novel curriculum
revision experiment which is being funded separately as part of the NSF
sponsored SUCCEED program. The planned curriculum revisions address critical
issues in the restructuring of the undergraduate engineering curriculum and a
new experimental model for undergraduate engineering education is developed. In
particular, a new model for integrating mathematics, physics, and introductory
engineering at the critical freshman year is being implemented. The project
seeks to develop an early exposure to engineering and an emphasis on the common
knowledge base from mathematics, physics, and the engineering method at the
freshman year. Innovative features of the integrated teaching approach include:
(1) a flexible hours per week distribution concept between mathematics, physics,
and engineering, (2) implementation of "just-in-time" learning concepts between
the three subject areas and, (3) a common computer- oriented laboratory for the
three subject areas.
