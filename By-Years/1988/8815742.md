The Organic Synthesis Program is supporting the work of Prof. Anthony Barrett of
Northwestern University. Prof. Barrett is studying how metals connected to
carbon, organometallic compounds, can provide unique methods for preparing
structurally complex molecules. The project will study the details of how these
organometallic compounds react, and the limitations of their use. Special
attention will focus on methods for making chemical ring compounds. Ring-
containing compounds are common to Nature, and one of the important missions of
organic chemists is to find new ways to build, in the laboratory, the kinds of
compounds that can be found in Nature. The application of cationic ironÄ±II!
vinylidene reagents to the construction of a diversity of heterocyclic and
carbocyclic molecules will be investigated. The reactions will be focused on
novel cyclization approaches to heterocyclic and carbocyclic rings. The research
will explore the fundamental questions of the mode of reactivity of the
organometallic reagents. As the scope of the newly-developing technology becomes
known, the methods will be applied to designing efficient routes to molecular
skeletons of interest to synthetic organic chemists.
