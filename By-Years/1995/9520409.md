9520409 Sen This project will involve petrographic, electron probe, and ion
probe work an a suite of spinal Iherzolite and plagioclase Iherzolite xenoliths
from the Pali vent on Oahu, Hawaii. These rocks represent a wider depth range of
the lithosphere that lost its mid-ocean ridge basalt melts some 90 million years
ago. Thus a 90 million year old residual melting column will be reconstructed.
The goals of this research are to (a) decipher vertical elemental variations in
the oceanic lighosphere beneath Oahu, (b) compare this information with those
obtained from abyssal peridotites, (c) test existing melting models of
lithosphere information and (d) obtain new insights on mid-ocean ridge basalt
melting. ***
