9353586 McPartland, MacIver, Jordan This is a secondary analysis of the National
Educational Longitudinal Study of eight grad students beginning in 1988 that
seeks to analyze forms of grouping and staffing that affect the access to math
and science learning opportunities. The project would make use of existing data
from NELS:88 follow-up of 8th grade students to the 12th grade to examine
changes in selection of courses and opportunities by minorities and women to
better develop models of the changes in science and math subjects in the schools
they attend. The project is expected to provide new knowledge of how practical
alternatives to tracking can increase female and minority participation in mate
and science careers. ***
