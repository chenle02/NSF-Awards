This work will pursue basic theoretical research on atomic and nuclear many-
body problems using intensive computational techniques. The topics include
calculating the effect of final state interactions on the scattering response of
liquid helium drops with extensions to nuclei and using Monte Carlo methods to
calculate collective excitations of nuclei and helium drops. This work will
advance the state-of- the-art in our ability to predict the properties of
complicated many-body systems.
