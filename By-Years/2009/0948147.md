This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This engineering
education award to the Syracuse University will develop an innovative model of
attracting veterans to engineering study, predicting how many will be likely to
study engineering and customizing the degree program to their needs. The results
will be presented on the web, at technical conferences and published in
professional journals, and the tools developed will be available through the
projects website. The project is expected to assist veterans' transition to
civilian life and to enhance the number of students who complete engineering
degrees and are ready to fill engineering jobs or start new high tech
businesses.
