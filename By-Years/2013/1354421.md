Arthropods represent the largest animal biomass on earth, including an enormous
number of species that cause serious agricultural losses. Arthropods also vector
important diseases of plants and animals. Arthropod populations are regulated by
many viral diseases. In most interactions between insects and viruses, the virus
enters the insect by the oral route and must move across the cells of the gut in
order to access the blood and other tissues. Although critical in the virus-
insect interaction, little is known about the mechanisms mediating viral
trafficking through insect midgut cells. In this project, the investigators will
examine the mechanisms of polarized viral transit through the epithelial cells
of the insect midgut. This project aims to identify and characterize insect
midgut proteins that mediate this process, and the viral protein signals that
direct the process. The project will use an innovative experimental design that
leverages the power of a Drosophila genetic system, combined with mutagenesis
and analysis of model virus envelope proteins, baculovirus GP64 and VSV G. An
understanding of the viral signals and the interacting midgut cell proteins and
pathways that regulate or restrict virus trafficking through midgut cells can be
used to both enhance infection by beneficial viruses (such as those used for
biocontrol of insects), and to inhibit viral transmission in insect vectors of
plant and animal diseases. Thus, the project should have impacts across a wide
variety of virus-insect interactions and with applications in diverse areas such
as agricultural crop protection, forestry, and animal and human health. The
project includes active participation of a postdoctoral trainee and
undergraduate students, and will also engage the public through open-house
presentations to local elementary school children, and through presentations to
high school teachers and their students.
