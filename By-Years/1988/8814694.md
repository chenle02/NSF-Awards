This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfields of semiconductor electro- chemistry and photochemistry.
Mechanistic aspects of interfacial electron transfer at the semiconductor-
electrolyte interface will be investigated experimentally in order to test
current theories of junction behavior. In addition, chemical control of
electron-hole recombination sites will be investigated. The reactivity of the
electrically important surface trapping sites at etched silicon and gallium
arsenide surfaces will be studied by investigating the chemistry and resultant
physical properties of semiconductor surfaces in reactions with substitution-
labile transition metal complexes. Spectroscopic studies of the semiconductor-
complex interaction will be performed to elucidate the metal oxidation state,
coordination shell, and electronic properties of the modified surface.
Photoelectrochemical passivation of silicon surfaces will be studied. Electron
transfer kinetics under high injection conditions in crystalline and amorphous
silicon will be also be investigated. Experiments with carefully prepared
semiconductor surfaces will be performed in order to deduce relations between
the surface concentration of majority carriers and the rate of interfacial
electron transfer. Chemical information regarding electrically important surface
sites will be obtained. These results will provide information basic to the
understanding of the processing of semiconductors for electronic devices and
solar energy conversion.
