Endocytosis plays a fundamental role in a number of processes, including
nutrient uptake, growth factor action, antigen presentation and maintenance of
plasma membrane composition. Somatic cell genetics has been successfully used to
analyze protions of the complex endocytic system. In order to stimulate T
lymphocytes, most protein antigens must be cleaved into peptide domains and
expressed on the surface of an antigen-presenting cell in association with the
products of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). To provide information
about the specific enzymes involved in antigen presentation, mutants of an
antigen-presenting cell line which are defective in cathepsin B, an
endoprotease, will be isolated by flow sorting. The ability of these mutants to
present antigen to T cells will be determined. The putative mutants will be
useful in exploring the mechanism of antigen presentation, in reconstituting
endocytic processing in vitro, and in analyzing the pathways by which hydrolytic
enzymes are delivered to endocytic compartments. Internalization of materials
from the extracellular environment (endocytosis) is a fundamental cellular
function. Among the important physiological processes that depend upon
endocytosis is the processing and presentation of immunogenic foreign substances
(antigens) by certain cell types (antigen-presenting cells) to other cells of
the immune system. The proposed research will enhance our understanding of how
foreign antigens are processed in antigen presenting cells. This knowledge will
be important not only from the point of view of the immune response, but also
because it will provide further insight into the fate of extracellular materials
taken into cells by endocytosis.
