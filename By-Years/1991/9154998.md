The University of New Hampshire will initiate a three-week, residential Young
Scholars project in Marine Science, Mathematics and Computer Science which will
provide enrichment activities for 25 precollege students entering grade 10. This
summer program consists of course work and field trips which will integrate
marine science, mathematics and computer science. The Great Bay Estuary and the
Isle of Shoals will be the sites of field trips on which participants will
perform a variety of measurements to contrast and compare fresh water, salt
marsh, mud flat and rocky coast environments. The measurements by each student
will be intercompared and also compared to baseline data. Participants will be
taught the computer and mathematical tools necessary to take and analyze data
and to make valid interpretations. The investigation will be motivated by
ecological problems in the area. Students will live part of the time with
faculty in mathematics and science. There will be four one-day workshops during
the academic year, one of which will be a one-day mini-experience for 75
students who were not chosen for the summer program.
