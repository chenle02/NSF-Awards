Fertilized eggs become multicellular through a series of rapid, synchronous
cell divisions, or cleavages, that serve to populate the egg's volume with
zygotic nuclei, clonally segregate the egg' s developmental potential, and
reduce daughter cells' volume to that of somatic cells. In animal cells,
cleavage furrowing is generally recognized to be a microfilament-dependent
process. Recently, however, Dr. Danilchik discovered a novel microtubule-
containing array in the early cleavage furrows in eggs of the frog Xenopus
laevis. This structure consists of numerous thick, short bundles of radially
arranged, acetylated microtubules that emanate from the vicinity of the
contractile ring of all cleavage furrows until the midblastula stage. Dr.
Danilchik hypothesizes that the microtubule array functions to recruit membrane
vesicles to the site of new membrane formation at the furrow's leading edge.
Since all receptor-mediated, cell-cell interactions depend on the composition of
the membranes deposited between cells, it is clear that the directed membrane
deposition and ingression have potentially significant roles in events of early
development, such as specification of the primary tissue layers. The specific
aims of this proposal are: 1) to examine in further detail the composition of
the FMA via confocal immunocytochemistry, to determine whether the FMA arises as
a de novo MT structure; 2) to learn the polarity of MTs in the FMA and the
midzone; 3) to test whether vesicle movements in the vicinity of the new'
cleavage membrane depend on an intact FMA; and 4) to test the role of known MT
motor proteins in new membrane delivery.
