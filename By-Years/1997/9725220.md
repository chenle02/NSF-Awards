9725220 Polak This is a collaborative research project between Elijah Polak and
his student, Ismail S. Khalil Bustany, at the University of California,
Berkeley, and Liqun Qi and Robert Wormseley and their students, Zenxin Wei from
China and Quoc- Thong Le-Gia from Vietnam, at the University of New South Wales,
Sydney, Australia, aimed at developing efficient superlinearly converging
algorithms for the solution of minimax problems in engineering design. A large
number of engineering design problems, such as design of wind and seismic
resistant structures, electronic circuit centering, and robot motion planning,
can be cast in the form of minimax problems. Because of their considerable
economic importance, the construction of efficient algorithms is an important
problem. This U.S.-Australia collaboration brings together the expertise in
engineering optimization, semi- finite optimization, and local algorithm
globalization available at Berkeley, with the expertise in the construction of
superlinearly converging generalized Newton Type methods for nonsmooth
optimization and numerical analysis available in Sydney.
