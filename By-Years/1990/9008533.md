The goal of this project is to explore how reflected visible and infrared laser
light may be used to explore tissue structures below the skin surface. The study
will examine light reflections at multiple wavelengths and at multiple depths
using mathematical simulations, ex vivo biological samples, and human subjects.
If successful, this project will open up a new way of noninvasively examining
layered biological tissue structure, including blood and oxygen concentrations.
