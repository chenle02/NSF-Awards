9616390 Malloy The Benjamin Banneker Association, Inc. (BBA) seeks to organize
a leadership conference. This conference will enable the BBA to bring together
mathematics educators and mathematicians from all sections of the country to
identify issues and to generate solutions to meet the challenges associated with
the teaching and learning of African-American children. The main goal of this
project is to improve the mathematics education and achievement of African-
American students. Specific goals of the leadership conference are as follows:
1. to develop a cadre of people who are knowledgeable about the mathematics
learning and teaching of African-American children and research in these areas;
2. to inform participants of policies that affect the mathematics education of
African-American children; 3. to develop guidelines that will assist leaders who
will serve as catalysts for change in the mathematics learning of African-
American children; and 4. to inform organizations such as the National Science
Foundation about issues related to the mathematics education of African-American
children.
