A grant has been awarded to Dr. Annalisa Berta at San Diego State University to
support a collaborative project involving museum and university scientists in
the reconstruction of evolutionary relationships among fossil and living species
of baleen whales. Both anatomical and molecular data sets will be employed and
the results of separate and combined analyses of these data sets explored. This
study will add considerable new anatomical information from fossil baleen whales
(especially characters from the skull and jaws) examined in various museum
collections in the US, Europe, Australasia, and Japan. This framework will then
be used to interpret the development of the unique filter feeding
specializations of baleen whales, especially the evolutionary transition in
feeding from tooth-bearing fossil species to baleen-bearing modern species. Few
studies have investigated the interrelationships of baleen whales and the
results are conflicting. This study will place modern baleen whale diversity in
a historical context. Study of the past diversity of baleen whales in relation
to times of global climate change may suggest conservation strategies for
endangered modern species that may not have otherwise been considered. This
project will provide training for both undergraduate and graduate students.
Results of the study will be incorporated into exhibits about whale evolution
planned at the San Diego Museum of Natural History.
