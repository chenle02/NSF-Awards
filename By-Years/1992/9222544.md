These funds provide technical and administrative support of activities of the
Committee on Interagency Radiation Research and Policy Coordination (CIRRPC), a
subcommittee of the Committee on Life Sciences and Health, which is part of the
Federal Coordinating Council for Science, Engineering and Technology (FCCSET).
Sources of radiation (ionizing and nonionizing) affect all Americans, play a
significant role in many scientific and technological segments of American
society, and are ubiquitous in our natural environment. The Director of the
Office and Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), who is also the Chairman for
FCCSET signed the Charter creating the CIRRPC in 1984. CIRRPC complements the
radiation research and policy activities of the 18 federal member agencies. Each
agency contributes financial support to the operations of CIRRPC. %%% Current
activities of CIRRPC include review of the literature on the possible health
risks to humans from exposure to low-frequency electric and magnetic fields and
coordination of radiation risk assessments and the review of radiation
protection standards.
