This award provides support for a cooperative research project between
Professor Matthew Tirrell, Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials
Science, University of Minnesota and Professor Tadao Kotaka, Department of
Macro- molecular Science, Osaka University, Japan. The objectives of the project
are to investigate, both experimentally and theoretically, the morphology and
some aspects of the properties of model block polymers adsorbed and confined on
surfaces of substrates of various types. Block polymers confined in two-
dimensional regions, such as those adsorbed on surfaces of given substrates, are
in a special thermodynamic state different from that of a more familiar three-
dimensional bulk. Physico-chemical properties of such thin layers are very
important scientifically, in the sense that surfaces may alter thermodynamic
order-disorder transitions, as well as for practical applications such as
adhesion, surface modification and functionalization. The researchers will study
the relationships among surface morphology, molecular structure and surface
physico-chemical properties of block polymers confined on two-dimensional
structures, to clarify the factors controlling the surface morphology of the
block polymers, and to obtain information on how to attain well- controlled
surface morphology formation, modification and functionalization. The strengths
of the two research teams are very complementary, the Japanese team having a
great deal of experience in synthesis and characterization under conventional
means and the US team having almost unique expertise in characterization of
surfaces and materials in confined dimensions. These studies will hopefully
yield new ways of preparing films with specific morphologies and consequently,
novel properties, thus enhancing our ability to fabricate films with desired
characteristics for technological applications.
