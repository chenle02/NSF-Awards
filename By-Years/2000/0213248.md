The Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) project will investigate
interaction of the stratosphere and troposphere in context of the stratospheric
sudden warming phenomenon. Interest in the stratospheric circulation, including
sudden warming, has recently been rekindled by observational analysis that
suggests that a primary mode of tropospheric variability in polar latitudes -
the Northern Hemisphere Annular Mode - is influenced by the downward migration
of annular anomalies from the stratosphere. Variations in stratospheric polar
vortex have been linked to seasonal anomalies in the tropospheric zonal-mean
zonal winds and circulation patterns such as the Arctic Oscillation/North
Atlantic Oscillation. These patterns have profound impact on European and North
American climate and weather. Dr. Limpasuvan will conduct a dynamically oriented
objective analysis of the mechanisms coupling the troposphere and stratosphere,
including wave propagation. Diagnosis of heat and momentum fluxes associated
with sudden warming will also be undertaken. The project will advance the
understanding of mechanisms responsible for stratosphere's influence on surface
weather and climate. The project will involve undergraduate students at Coastal
Carolina University in an effort to integrate research into the school's science
education, and strengthen the institution's new Applied Physics program. It will
provide valuable and unique research experience to undergraduates in South
Carolina and the greater southeastern region.
