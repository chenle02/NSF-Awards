9614532 Frey The long-term goal of this research is to understand the origin and
evolution of the ~115 Ma record of volcanism related to the Kerguelen mantle
plume. The Kerguelen plume is particularly important because:1) it is long-
lived; 2) all aspects of plume-related volcanism are accessible for study; 3)
lavas have a distinctive geochemical signature that may reflect recycling of
crust into the deep mantle; and d) formation of the large igneous province
(Kerguelen Plateau) in the newly formed Indian Ocean may have enabled dispersal
of these plume geochemical characteristics into the Indian Ocean asthenosphere.
This proposal seeks to extend the current project to include the recent (&lt;40
Ma) volcanic history of this plume that is recorded in a thick sequence of flood
basalts which are the major volumetric unit of the Kerguelen archipelago. The
chemical composition (major and trace element abundances) and isotopic (He, Sr,
Nd, Pb, and Os) characteristics of these lavas will be determined to show how
the lava compositions have changed with time (both on a relative and absolute
basis with control by 40Ar-39Ar dating) and location in the archipelago.
