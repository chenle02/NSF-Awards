OISE-0427218 Hocken

This proposal is to secure support for a joint symposium between scientists and
researchers from the United States and the Peoples Republic of China in the area
of nanotechnology. The symposium is to be held in Beijing, China, May 17-19,
2004 and will include 15 to 18 participants from each country. It will consist
of overviews on various identified related topics along with significant
technical discussion. The major objective of the forum is to develop an agenda
for possible future collaborative research between the tow nations in this
field.

The intellectual merit lies in the exchange of scientific and technical
information, in this emerging, fast growing and ever-important field of
nanotechnology. The broader impact lies in future intellectual exchanges and the
promise of developing a mutually beneficial collaborative relationship between
these two major manufacturing countries.
