Facilities will be developed to enable undergraduate students to prepare
biological specimens for electron microscopy. The equipment includes an
ultramicrotome, critical point dryer, vacuum oven, sputter coater, and a fume
hood. The equipment will be utlized in two new courses: Ultrastructural Analysis
and Interpretation, a formal course in techniques and methods, and Electron
Microscope Research, an independent study course. The actual electron microscopy
will be done at the facility at the University of South Florida nearby. The
university will provide 50% matching funds.
