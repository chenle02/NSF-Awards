This project is to develop techniques to visualize the occlusion of primate
molar teeth. The movement of the jaws in mastication is a highly complex
phenomenon and one of considerable interest to anthropologists as the movements
are related to tooth shape and to diet. Since the primate fossil record is
largely composed of dental remains, understanding the relationship of tooth
shape, function and diet is a central one. Here a three-dimensional scanning
device will be used to digitize the surface morphology of occluding molars from
two species which differ in dietary preferences: Saimiri, a frugivorous-
insectivorous New World Monkey and Ateles, a frugivore. The researchers will
then attempt to use the digitized models to simulate phases in occlusion. A
museum series of teeth will then be examined to study the effects of wear on the
fit of teeth during occlusion. This information will assist in deciphering the
dietary adaptations of living and extinct primates.
