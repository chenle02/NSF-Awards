Magnetic field irregularities carried by the solar wind sweep charged particles
out of the solar system and cause the anti-correlation between cosmic ray fluxes
and the level of solar activity. Since electrons and nuclei have greatly
different charge/mass ratios, the relation of velocity and magnetic rigidity is
significantly different for these two particle species. If the heliospheric
magnetic field has long range order, the charge sign of cosmic ray particles can
affect their propagation. Recent observations show that a major failure of
current modulation models simultaneously reproducing electron and nucleon
modulation is related to reversals of the solar magnetic field, which occur
every eleven years. Charge dependence, then, should change when the solar field
reverses, but differently from that observed. The PIs will conduct a research
program extending measurements of charge dependence of cosmic ray solar
modulation with a series of balloon flights to determine the time dependence of
electron and positron fluxes over a broad energy range. This investigation will
determine the importance of large scale order of the heliospheric magnetic field
in determining trajectories of charged particles in the heliosphere.
