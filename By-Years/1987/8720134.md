This award provides funds for the purchase of a high-field NMR spectrometer and
computer equipment, and of an X-ray generator, area detector and associated
smaller items. The equipment will be shared by an group of outstanding
structural biologists at the University of California at Berkeley. Studies to be
performed by the group include experimental studies of the structure and
function of enzymes, of other proteins and of self-splicing and other RNAs. More
theoretical work aimed at prediction of protein structure will also be
undertaken. The development and application of 2-dimensional NMR spectroscopy
and X-ray crystallography to the study of the structure and function of
biological macromolecules like RNA and protein is currently one of the most
exiting areas of biological research. Although NMR instruments have been
available for many years, it is only within the last few years that high field
instruments with the requisite resolution and sensitivity for such studies have
been developed. Similarly, the development of X-ray area detectors and of high
speed computers has made the acquisition and interpretation of X-ray
crystallographic data a relatively routine procedure. Thus, equipment of the
type to be purchased with these funds now plays a vital role in the progress of
our understanding of macromolecular structure.
