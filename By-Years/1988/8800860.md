The purpose of this project is to study the magnetic properties of sediments
deposited under low to no oxygen conditions. The low oxygen conditions will be
studied in sedimentary cores from the Panama Basin and the anoxic conditions
studied in cores to be taken in summer 1988 in the Black Sea. The chemical
processes responsible for the formation of magnetic minerals will be studied and
the impact of changes in the chemistry during climatic changes in the two basins
will be addressed. The results from this project will provide a basic framework
for understanding the chemical remagnetization of sediments; something that has
frustrated previous attempts to use the magnetic properties of sub-oxic and
anoxic sediments in geological research.
