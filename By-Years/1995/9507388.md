9507388 Zera Life history traits, such as the age at which reproduction begins,
total egg production and duration of juvenile development differ dramatically
among species. Understanding how these differences evolve is an important part
in understanding modern patterns of biological diversity, yet we know very
little about the mechanisms that are responsible for variation in life
histories. This study will identify differences in endocrine mechanisms that
underlie the first stages of life history evolution. It will determine how
genetically based variation in key developmental and reproductive hormones cause
populations to differ il life history traits, using crickets as a model system.
The research will show whether differences in age of onset of reproduction
result from differences in timing and concentration of juvenile hormone levels,
or whether they result from genetically based differences in ovarian hormone
receptors. The results will reveal the role of genetic differences in juvenile
hormone or molting hormone systems in producing correlation between the duration
of juvenile development and the onset of adult reproduction. The research is a
synthesis of evolutionary genetics, insect endocrinology, and life history
evolution. It will identify for the first time the specific mechanisms that
underlie genetic differences in life history traits and correlations between
those traits. In the long term, it may lead to new approaches to managing insect
populations.
