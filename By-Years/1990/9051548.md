The Department of Atmospheric Science at the State University of New York at
Albany would like to improve the quality and breadth of its undergraduate
teaching and laboratory experience for both majors and non-majors through the
purchase of a next-generation Man-Computer-Interactive Data Access System
(McIDAS). With such a system users can effectively process and analyze digital
meteorological satellite images as well as more conventional meteorological
global surface and upper air observations for instructional, laboratory and
research purposes. McIDAS will fill two critical needs. First it can be used in
the classroom to expose nonscience majors to scientific ideas, concepts and
methods that can have impact on their daily lives, allowing them to become more
informed citizens about global weather, climate and environmental issues. Second
is the need to increase opportunities for undergraduate students majoring in
atmospheric science to be exposed to fundamental meteorological concepts and
quantitative approaches to problems through independent study, undergraduate
research projects, synoptic laboratory applications, classroom projects and
problem sets, as well as curriculum enrichment, by integrating McIDAS more
effectively into day-to-day classroom and laboratory teaching. The next
generation McIDAS addresses these critical Departmental needs because of the
local computer power and enhanced graphics capability built into the wideword
workstation. The quality of the undergraduate teaching and laboratory experience
would be improved considerably because for the first time instructors would be
able to process, analyze and archive global weather and climate cases of
interest for later instructional and research purposes. Additionally faculty
members and students wold be able to apply locally generated scientific software
packages on McIDAS to real time or archived datastreams as well as link into
other local or national computer systems for the processing and analysis of
additional data in support of special laboratory and research projects
