The Keys Marine Laboratory (KML) commenced academic research and education
programs in the 1980's through a public/private partnership between the Florida
Institute of Oceanography (FIO) and Sea World of Florida, Inc. Based on the
success of that partnership and recognizing the need for these programs and
facilities the State of Florida purchased the KML in 1990. With the closure of
other residential laboratory facilities in the region and the unprecedented
scientific and political attention on the mosaic of South Florida environments,
the KML has now assumed an even more critical support role. In the last five
years usage by research and education groups has increased steadily and is
beginning to exceed some of the capabilities of the current facilities.
Particularly urgent is the need for improved and expanded housing accommodations
for non-resident researchers. Lodging has been identified as one of the major
impediments to conducting research in the region. Laboratory and boat facilities
are equally important but at this point in time the KML can reasonably
accommodate these needs. This project will provide funding to construct the
first unit of a planned three-unit handicapped accessible housing facility which
will provide additional lodging space for two to four (2-4) researchers/unit.
This facility will help meet the need of regional, national, and international
scientists studying the continentally unique systems of South Florida, including
coral reefs.
