The research community has been calling for solutions to data discovery and to
more broadly capture the value of the work that is at the core of the
researcher's scholarly pursuit. The University of California Curation Center at
the California Digital Library will work with PLOS and DataONE to address what
metrics are needed to capture the activity surrounding research data in a valid
and credible way. This collaborative team will prototype a suite of metrics that
track and measure data use, "data-level metrics" (DLM), which will measure the
broad range of activity surrounding the reach and use of data as a research
output. The project will augment the existing scholarly cyberinfrastructure,
which currently is focused on journal articles, and introduce data as a valued
scholarly output into the framework. Data metrics will create incentives that
support data sharing and usage to increase the velocity of information
dissemination across a wide range of disciplines, once the impact of the
research is exposed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team will build a reference model
for data metrics based on automatic tracking based on in-depth field analyses of
data use and engagement practices. They will test mechanisms of automatic
tracking of data activity and explore ways in which the dynamic data harvested
can be delivered to drive data discovery as well as support reporting needs for
funders and institutions. DLM data will provide a clear and growing picture of
the activity around the dissemination and reach of research data. As this
activity is linked to other research entities and objects in the research
information ecosystem, an expansive portrait of the dynamics of data use and
reuse will emerge, which can inform the community's understanding of what impact
means for research data as a scholarly output. In the comprehensive ecosystem of
identifiable, trackable research data, these metrics tools will become essential
to data-rich science.
