9634331 Marshall This project is a contribution to the program, Methods and
Models of Integrated Assessments (MMIA), part of the Global Change Research
Program (GCRP). Pis will exploit observations of transient tracers,
Chlorofluorocarbons (CFC), and Helium/Tritium (He/Tr) in the ocean to
investigate key mechansims that control the rate at which the ocean transports
tracers into its interior, improve the parametric representationof those
mechanisms in the models used in climate research, and to assimilate tracer data
into a state-of-the-art ocean circulation model to obtain quantitative
information about the circulation of the ocean and the rates of gas exchange
with the atmosphere. ***
