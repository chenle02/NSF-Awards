This Engineering Research Equipment Award is for a Three- Component Fiber-Optics
Laser Doppler Anemometer and associated equipment. It will be used to explore
the hydroacoustic properties of the transitional regime in boundary layer flow
where the flow becomes turbulent. The research bears on noise generation in
pumps and fans, and the nature of acoustic influences on turbulence.
