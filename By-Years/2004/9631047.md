A team of collaborators from seven bioinformatics research organizations
proposes to enhance existing software tools to create a World Wide Web (WWW)
based expert taxonomic resource that will be immediately valuable for the
international virology community and will serve as a prototype for taxonomic
data resources in other biological disciplines. Expanding on previously funded
NSF project, the team will complete development of the software infrastructure
for providing real time access to the International Committee on the Taxonomy of
Viruses' database (ICTVdB). This taxonomic knowledge base will combine the
advantages of local, warehoused datafiles with the ability to establish dynamic
links to distributed forms of data and will provide for immediate updating of
the files. Enhancement and modification of the DELTA suite of programs, used for
taxonomic research and biodiversity studies, will permit data analysis and
identification of organisms via the WWW. Linking of ICTV data with other
biological datasets, e.g., genomic data, graphics, repository, and reference
data via HTML and the web will enable taxonomic comparisons based on genetic and
phenotypic data analysis. Use of the Web/Genera and Sybase software to enable
SQL queries and online data entry/updates over the Internet to a relational
database interoperating with DELTA will give taxonomists and other researchers
multiple access points and data management capabilities, depending on their
specific requirements. The proposed data resource will conform to prescribed
standards in data modeling, syntax and semantics, thus facilitating membership
in the emerging "federation" of biological database developers. It will also
serve as a utility to enhance modeling of complex biological systems.
