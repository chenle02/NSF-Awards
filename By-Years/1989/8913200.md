This Expedited Award for Novel Research is in support of a demonstration
experiment on the rapid and uniform electroplating of the inside surface of very
small holes. These holes occur on densely packed printed circuit boards, and the
necessary copper deposition has been either slow and uniform, or rapid and non-
uniform. The proposed system induces an appropriate flow of electrolyte through
the hole through a combination of pressure-driven flow and flow driven by a
helically fluted electrode spinning inside the hole. The study is an exploratory
assessment of this concept.
