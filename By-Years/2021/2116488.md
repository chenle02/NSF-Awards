Of all natural hazards, flooding exerts the greatest economic and social impacts
on the US population, and its impacts have increased over time. In response, the
US government is funding the voluntary acquisition of homes in floodplains
across the country, removing people and homes from the nation’s most flood-prone
areas. This project advances scientific understanding of managed retreat from
American floodplains, including their impacts on different types of communities.
Results provide decisionmakers, floodplain managers, and community leaders with
state-of-the-art knowledge needed to make flood adaption more socially and
administratively successful in the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
investigates tens of thousands of households nationwide who have exited, stayed,
and entered neighborhoods targeted by the federal government’s policy of managed
retreat. The project leverages novel sources of data to follow the residential
trajectories of participants and non-participants to and from neighborhoods
targeted for managed retreat over time. Sources will include individual-level
data on residential histories, address-level data on future flood risks, and
longitudinal household survey and interview data. The study also accounts for
the different types of communities in which households are embedded. Results
contribute to understanding of residential mobility as a form of flood
adaptation and how managed retreat unfolds differently for different populations
facing increasing flood risks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
