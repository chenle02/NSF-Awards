A central problem in ecology is to explain how the great numbers of rare tree
species found in tropical rainforests are maintained through time. Approximately
70% of these species occur at a density of less than 2 trees per hectare. Long-
term studies of species rarity and forest dynamics using a unique set of three
contrasting dipterocarp forests from northwest Borneo have been censused since
1965. Hypotheses which explain the maintenance of rare species are being tested
using these data combined with sapling and seedling surveys from 1986 to 1988
and detailed forest maps. One forest is subject to periodic catastrophic drought
during which canopy trees die while a second forest is heterogeneous in space
due to local landslips. Species richness is greatest in forest which is
intermediate in soil fertility and levels of disturbance. Because of these
differences among forests, there may not be one simple explanation for the great
species richness of these forests. These data are being analyzed jointly with
members of the Malaysian Forest Department concerned with practical matters of
forest management. The results are also relevant to conservation biologists
concerned with the maintenance of biological diversity.
