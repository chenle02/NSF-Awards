The scientific study of signed languages has provided insights into the human
capacity for language and differences between spoken and signed modalities.
Studies reveal that all human languages change over time—regardless of modality.
There is a large body of generalizations about spoken language change, which are
typically framed as relevant for human language generally. However, the vast
majority of the proposed general features of human language change were
developed without consideration of signed languages. In spoken language, the
sounds that combine to form words often change in regular and systematic ways
over time, and these regular sound changes form the empirical basis for language
families. Signed languages have units that combine to form signs, but no
research has been done to clarify whether regular sound change has a correlate
in signed languages, or if regular language change is unique to spoken
languages. This project will be the first to rigorously explore this question.
It will also provide research experience to several undergraduates and
professional development to a postdoctoral
associate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The three-year project will
investigate linguistic change and relationships among 13 signed languages. It
will develop a database of signs for 207 basic concepts in each language,
drawing on online and print dictionaries. Deaf native signers of the languages
will check the signs and provide missing entries. Each sign will be transcribed
to allow both manual and automated comparisons of the signs’ phonological units
across all languages. The dataset will then be evaluated using two
methodologies: the traditional Comparative Method (CM), and network-based and
Bayesian phylogenetic approaches. If the CM yields evidence of regular and
recurring correspondences, the researchers will identify cognates and
reconstruct earlier stages of the languages. Lack of such correspondences will
provide evidence that some aspect of signed languages either inhibits or
disguises the regular changes on which the CM depends. Quantitative phylogenetic
approaches are complementary to the CM because they do not depend on regular
change to assess patterns of similarity among
languages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
