9451342 Rahnamai This project initiates an integrated manufacturing and controls
laboratory. The laboratory will have a major impact on manufacturing and control
courses, and provide a means for developing an interdisciplinary senior
laboratory exercise. The objectives of the integrated laboratory are: (1) to
provide a laboratory environment where interdisciplinary experiments relating to
integrated manufacturing and control can be performed, (2) to provide an
opportunity for each of the engineering programs (electrical, industrial,
mechanical, and bio) to conduct independent experiments relating to
manufacturing and control, (3) to provide for the students necessary experience
in the interdisciplinary nature of engineering practice, and (4) to provide a
facility for the design, development, testing, and manufacture of plastic
products. The laboratory is centered around an extrusion system consisting of a
3/4 inch, bench top extruder, a water trough, and a belt puller. The system also
includes two additional extruder screws and dies to produce rods and strips. The
extruder process will be controlled using a fast DSP board with: (1) Cockpit
software which allows on-line interaction and modification of control algorithm
parameters running on the DSP board, (2) trace software which is used for data
acquisition and display of sensor signals and control variables; and (3) a C
code generator which is required for automatic implementation of the control
module generated using SIMULINK.
