An exploratory study on novel ways of modeling and studying the dynamics of
variable mass systems will be conducted. An attempt will be made to find a
mathematically sound and efficient methodology for characterizing such systems,
and novel methods of dynamical equation derivation that avoid unacceptably
drastic simplo=ifying assumptions. Finally, a cursory look will be taken at the
effects of structural flexibility of the solid phase on the dynamics of the
whole system.
