This award provides partial participant support for the workshop "Computational
Representation Theory in Number Theory" held July 27-31, 2015 at Oregon State
University in Corvallis, Oregon. This workshop will promote the generation and
dissemination of current research in computational number theory related to
representation theory. In particular, it will foster research collaboration
between senior and junior researchers. The workshop will also address the need
for access to recent computational data in these areas by disseminating results
through the L-functions and Modular Forms Database (LMFDB), located at
http://www.lmfdb.org/. This website serves the mathematical community by
providing data that is the result of rigorous computations of mathematical
objects of interest in the modern number theory community, as well as by playing
an educational role for students and researchers interested in number theory.

The theme of this workshop is the connection between types of representations,
particularly Galois representations, and other objects of interest in number
theory, including L-functions and elliptic curves, with a focus on computation.
The workshop includes lectures on Artin representations, integral
representations, mod p Galois representations, and l-adic representations. The
workshop is intended to advance research in computational representation theory,
particularly Galois representations and their applications to number theory.
This workshop will also foster collaboration between experts and junior
researchers in these areas. The workshop will be a hybrid of typical conference
and workshop formats. The mornings will be dedicated to invited research talks
and the afternoons will be dedicated to work in small groups. During the
afternoon sessions groups will work on research questions, generating
computational data, or presenting computational work to the public through the
L-functions and Modular Forms Database (LMFDB). More details can be found at
