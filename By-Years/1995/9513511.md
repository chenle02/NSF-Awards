9513511 Preuss Genetic approaches will be used to investigate further the
requirements for pollen recognition by the stigma. Suppressing mutations that
restore function to pop1(cer6-2) pollen, a mutant which has a defect in pollen
pistil interactions, have been identified and examining these suppressors will
likely identify key pollen components. In addition, novel genetic screens for
gene products required for pollen-stigma interactions will be done. These
screens will focus on genes expressed in the haploid pollen and make use of the
recently identified quartet mutations that cause pollen to be released in intact
tetrads. The specific aims are: 1. Examine suppressors that restore fertility to
cer6 pollen. Determine whether lipid and protein components have been restored
and whether the suppressing mutations map to genes other than cer6. 2. Perform a
screen for gametophytic mutations that disrupt pollen-stigma interactions by
using chemical mutagenesis of quartet seeds to screen for genes required for
pollen hydration and to use insertional mutagenesis to characterize genes
required for subsequent events in the reproductive process. %%% The focus of
this work is on genetic approaches that will identify Arabidopsis gene products
essential for the initial step in pollination-recognition of pollen by the
stigma cells. Because plants rely on insects and wind for pollination, they
encounter pollen grains from many different species. However, only pollen from
the appropriate species is permitted to grow through the pistil and deliver
sperm to the eggs. An improved understanding of the molecular basis for pollen
recognition would be a major advance. ***
