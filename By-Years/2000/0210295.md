With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) Program,
the Department of Chemistry at the City University of New York - City College
Campus will acquire a 500 MHz NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will enable
researchers to carry out studies on (i) studies of chemically modified
nucleosides and DNA; (ii) synthesis of unusual nucleosides and studies on DNA
containing them; (iii) synthesis of high energy-density N-nitramino and geminal
difluoramino solid propellants; (iv) studies of the structure and dynamics of
selected isolated protein fragments to learn about the unfolded state of
proteins; (v) novel pharmacophores against opportunistic infections related to
AIDS; (vi) studies of the S-layer protein of Lactobacillus brevis; and (vii)
synthesis of enediyne glycofuranosides.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is
used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential
to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR
studies will have an impact in a number of areas including synthetic chemistry,
pharmaceutical chemistry and biology.
