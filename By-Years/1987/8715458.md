Within the visual identification of clouds, active mixing takes place between
the cloudy air and the drier air of its environment. Recent observations of
stratocumulus entrainment provide evidence that dry air mostly enters from the
cloud top instead of from the lateral boundaries. At present, the entrainment
mechanism is not fully understood. The entrained volume, with the cooler and
drier air from above, dilutes the cloudy air, is negatively buoyant, and
therefore descends within the cloud. Based on field observations and laboratory
experiments, the entrained blob of air is envisioned to behave like a spherical
vortex, with strong updraft in the middle of the blob and slower rising or
descending air around the periphery. Under this grant, Profesor Telford will
examine the dynamics of a turbulent spherical vortex and implement it in a cloud
model. Since the entrainment processes may play a significant role in explaining
the finite life time of cumulus clouds and in predicting various cloud drop size
spectra observed around the world, Professor Telford's new theory, if
successfully tested, will be a major contribution to cloud modelling.
