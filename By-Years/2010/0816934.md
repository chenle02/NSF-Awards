&lt;br/&gt;This Small Grant for Exploratory Research investigates the origin and
evolution of the Gamburtsev subglacial mountains (GSM). These mountains are
considered the nucleation point for Antarctica's largest ice sheets; however,
being of indeterminate age, they may postdate ice sheet formation. As well,
their formation could reflect tectonic events during the breakup of Gondwana.
The project studies GSM-derived detrital zircon and apatite crystals from Prydz
Bay obtained by the Ocean Drilling Program. Analytical work includes triple-
dating thermochronometry by U/Pb, fission track, and (U/Th)/He methods. The
combined technique offers insight into both high and low temperature processes,
and is potentially sensitive to both the orogenic events and the subsequent
cooling and exhumation due to erosion. In terms of broader impacts, this project
supports research for a postdoctoral fellow and an &lt;br/&gt;
