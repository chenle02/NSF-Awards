The purpose of this research is to develop a mathematical model of double headed
crossbridge attachment in skeletal muscle fibers. In the model, a crossbridge is
treated as a double headed macromolecule with one actin and one nucleotide site
per head. The critical assumption is the hypothesis that once one of the heads
of a crossbridge is attached to one of the available actin sites, the attachment
of the second head will be restricted to a level of strain determined by the
attachment of the first head. The crossbridge structure, namely the connection
of both heads of a crossbridge to the same tail region, is assumed to impose
this constraint on the spatial configurations of cross bridge heads. The
research will be focused initially on equilibrium muscle behavior because the
crossbridge cycle is much simpler in this case than the corresponding cycle for
contracting muscle. The effects of nucleotide concentration and ionic strength
on double headed crossbridge attachment will be studied by comparing model
predictions with experimental data on, (1) the time course of force decay
following an imposed stretch, and (2) the variation of fiber stiffness as a
function of ionic strength. In the proposed scheme, a crossbridge head is more
likely to reattach to its previously strained position than to remain unattached
while the other head is attached, leading to a slow decay of force after stretch
as measured in experiments conducted under equilibrium conditions. The proposed
research should yield significant information on crossbridge structure, and lead
to better understanding of the origins of crossbridge stiffness which represents
an important component of the mechanics of muscle.
