In this project ("Mechanisms of Transition Metal- Catalyzed Reactions in
Hydrocarbons"), which is jointly supported by the Organic Dynamics Program of
the Chemistry Division and the Polymers Program of the Division of Materials
Research, Professor Robert H.Grubbs of the Chemistry Department at the
California Institute of Technology will study the mechanisms for polymer
synthesis with organometallic reagents. The project is designed to provide the
fundamental techniques and the mechanistic understanding that is required to
exploit new catalysts that have been uncovered over the past few years for
synthesizing macromolecular systems. This is project is fundamental and
multidisciplinary in its scope. The major topics being investigated deal
extensively with further elaboration of "ROMP" polymers and will include studies
on anionic initiation, macromer synthesis, tacticity control, photochemical
initiation, ruthenium chemistry in aqueous media, various titanium and zirconium
systems, and dual Schrock initiators.
