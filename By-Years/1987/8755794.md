A High School Honors Science Program will be conducted at Michigan State
University in the summer of 1988. This program has been held on the campus for
the past 29 summers. In 1988 it would consist of a 48- day program directed
toward high school juniors and sophomores of high ability. The objectives are to
provide these individuals with challenging scientific activities, provide
rewarding contacts with peers having similar abilities and interests, and
identify and nurture talent. It allows individuals to select a topic of interest
within experimental biology, biophysics, or plant science and to conduct
independent research under the supervision of a volunteer faculty advisor in
whose laboratory they work. In addition to lab work, students are taught how to
use library facilities, are required to keep a daily log of their activities and
prepare final oral and written reports. The students are housed in a university
residence hall under the supervision of experienced counselors.
