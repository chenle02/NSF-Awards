SBR-9617695 This award supports the provision of small travel grants to graduate
students from U.S. institutions to assist their attendance and participation in
the 1997 Annual Assembly of the University Consortium for Geographic Information
Science. Students to be so supported will be selected on the basis of a panel
review of their 2000-word abstracts of the presentations they plan to make at
the assembly. Grants will not be made to students based within 250 miles of the
assembly (to be held in Maine). The assembly has two components: the exchange of
research findings and progress among researchers and students (their
presentations are to be integrated within sessions), and the identification of
priorities for education (primarily college and graduate) in the
interdisciplinary field of geographic information science. This small award
fulfills two major goals of NSF: the development and dissemination of improved
tools for scientific analysis, and the integration of research and education.
