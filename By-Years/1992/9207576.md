Systematics is the scientific study of biodiversity and its historical patterns
and processes. A broad coalition of systematic biologists has organized to
undertake an initiative to document research trends and priorities within their
discipline. This initiative called Systematics Agenda 2000: Integrating
Biological Diversity and Societal Needs, takes as its unifying themes: (1) the
role of systematics in the study and preservation of biodiversity, (2) the
integrative role of systematics in comparative biology, and (3) the role and
importance of systematics in human affairs. Systematics Agenda 2000 is directed
by a Steering Committee and Advisory Board and consists of 27 Standing
Committees encompassing the breadth of systematic biology, including both basic
and applied research. This grant is to support the work of the Standing
Committees, to have a general meeting of Standing Committee co- chairs to
synthesize their findings, to support the work of the Steering
Committee/Advisory Board, and to support editorial and publication expenses.
Systematics Agenda 2000 will publish two documents that will synthesize
important research trends and priorities, identify infrastructural needs for
supporting systematic research, and document the role and importance of
systematics in human affairs.
