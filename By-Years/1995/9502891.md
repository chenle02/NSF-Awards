9502891 Hwu-Sadwick Rare earth-phosphide high speed, high temperature
optoelectronic devices and circuits will be studied. The growth of lattice-
matched REP/III-V heterosystems will be undertaken to lay the foundation
necessary to develop high speed and/or high temperature device concepts. Devices
to be studied include resonant tunneling diodes and transistors and metal-based
transistors. ***
