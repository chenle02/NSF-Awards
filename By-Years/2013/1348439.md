This award will help support student and postdoctoral attendance at the Annual
ACM/SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms Science (SODA) 2014, in Portland, OR
on January 5 to 7, 2014.  SODA is co-sponsored by the Association for Computing
Machinery (ACM) and the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) .
 SODA is the premier annual research conference in the field of discrete
algorithms and one of the three premier conferences in theoretical computer
science. SODA has been meeting annually since 1990 and in a typical year has
over 300 attendees.  It is co-located with two smaller workshops, ALENEX
(Meeting on Algorithm Engineering and Experimentation) and ANALCO (Meeting on
Analysis of Algorithms).  SODA is attended by researchers from all over the
world.  The field of algorithms is a vibrant one, with high participation rates
from young researchers, and many papers with student authors. For these student
authors and student attendees, the conference serves as a valuable educational
experience, both for the technical content of the talks and for the
opportunities for networking that it provides.
