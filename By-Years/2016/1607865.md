Non-technical: Optical isolators are optical analogs of electrical diodes: they
allow light to be transmitted in one direction but block light propagation in
the opposite direction. Isolators are essential components for photonic
integrated circuits to prevent harmful cross-talk between different parts of
circuits and stabilize circuit operation. However, current optical isolators are
bulky devices not compatible with integration on photonic chips. This program
aims to develop the device technologies based on novel magneto-optical oxide
materials to create optical isolators amenable to direct integration with
silicon photonic circuits. The isolator device developed through this program
will have an immediate impact in the fields of optical communications and
photonic signal processing. Besides data communication, it will also play a
pivotal role in emerging applications such as spintronics, magneto-optical
sensing, and magnetoplasmonics. The scientific research will be tightly
integrated with Massive Open Online Course development, high school,
undergraduate and graduate student training, as well as educational module
design for K-12 classrooms. Technical: Optical isolators, devices that allow
light transmission in only one direction, are critical components of photonic
integrated circuits, and exemplify a larger class of nonreciprocal optical
devices. Despite their critical importance, integration of optical isolators on-
chip has been a challenging task due to the large lattice constant and
coefficient of thermal expansion mismatch between magneto-optical oxides and
common semiconductor substrates. This program aims at filling the gap by
assuming a two-pronged approach involving both material engineering and device
innovation. The program will develop a nonreciprocal isolator/circulator device
using monolithically grown polycrystalline Cerium-doped Yttrium Iron Garnet as
the magneto-optical medium, and incorporate novel device designs to enhance
device performance. The research will lead to an isolator device simultaneously
achieving monolithic integration, passive device operation, large isolation
ratio, minimal insertion loss, and small footprint, as well as superior
operation bandwidth, thus resolving the standing challenge of on-chip optical
isolation.
