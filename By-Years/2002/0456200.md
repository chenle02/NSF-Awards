Superstring theory is the most promising candidate for the unification of the
Standard Model of elementary particles with General Relativity in a framework
consistent with Quantum Mechanics. The research program being proposed here
consists of three major themes: _first, superstring perturbation theory at two-
loops and beyond, with applications to string corrections to super-gravity,
finiteness, and anomalies; second, black holes in the AdS/CFT correspondence,
with emphasis on the bulk description of BPS microstates of the boundary theory;
third, time dependent string theory within the context of supergravity
solutions, open string tachyon condensation, and cosmological scenarios. A
number of additional research topics are also planned including numerical
simulations of the formulation of gravitational singularities in the context of
string theory. There is an interdisciplinary aspect involved with organizing
interdisciplinary workshops with mathematicians. Broader implications also
include the writing of a textbook for students.
