One of the greatest challenges facing earth scientists is to decipher the
nature and origin of Archean crust, believed to have formed during the greatest
crustal-forming episode. Some of the major questions regarding early crustal
genesis involve crustal thickness, horizontal vs vertical tectonic regimes and
evolution (i.e., underplating), crustal accretion and the nature of the Moho.
COCORP data from Minnesota and its reanalysis have provided important new
information on the subsurface structure of the Archean. This project involves a
series of seismic reflection experiments designed to answer some of the
fundamental questions raised about Archean crustal evolution and the nature of
the Moho. These experiments are based on an innovative recording program
involving multiple sources p- and s-wave recording and 200-400 receivers in the
spirit of PASSCAL and using PASSCAL as well as the principal investigators own
recording systems.
