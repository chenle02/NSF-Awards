9315369 Terasawa This award supports the participation of 13 U.S. scientists in
a U.S.-Japan Seminar on Cellular and Molecular Action of Steroid Hormones in the
Brain, to be held in April 1994 in Honolulu, Hawaii. The co-organizers of the
seminar are Professor Ei Terasawa, Wisconsin Regional Primate Research Center,
University of Wisconsin-Madison, and Professor Seiichiro Kawashima, Institute of
Zoology, University of Tokyo. In addition to the scientists from the United
States and Japan, there will also be participants from Canada and France. The
research topic is very important and timely. The focus of the meeting is on
recent progress in understanding the mechanism of action of gonadal steroids.
Gonadal steroids influence neuronal cell differentiation, migration, and
survival during the prenatal and perinatal period and therefore affect various
brain functions, including cognitive function in later life. Gonadal steroids
are also essential for maintenance of reproductive function and reproductive
behavior. The seminar participants represent a broad range of expertise using a
number of model systems and approaches. There has been no recent meeting that
addresses this issue in neuroendocrinology. Thus, the seminar brings together a
diverse set of outstanding researchers to present an update on an exciting and
important area in neuroscience. ***
