The Fifty-seventh Midwest Graph Theory Conference will be held at Wright State
University in Dayton, Ohio from the 8th to 9th April 2016. The conference will
be on Friday and Saturday to make it easy for researchers to attend. The
conference will feature three plenary one-hour speakers and a number of
contributed talks, each of twenty minutes long.

This conference is part of a series of conferences devoted to graph theory and
its applications. Ever since Dr. Frank Harary hosted the first conference at the
University of Michigan in 1978, it has been held almost every year at different
institutions in the Midwest and nearby regions. Many world-leading experts in
graph theory have given principle talks in past conferences. About 60
participants are anticipated, with about 40 contributed talks in parallel
sessions. The conference will be publicized using distribution lists and on
related conference websites (a conference website is at
http://www.cs.bsu.edu/homepages/mighty/) featuring titles and abstracts of the
speakers.

The conference will feature current research in the area of graph theory and its
applications. Researchers will present their new results and there will be time
for open discussions to explore unsolved problem in the field. The confirmed
plenary speakers are Dr. Neil Robertson, Dr. Ping Zhang, from Western Michigan
University, and Dr. K.T. Arasu, a recent recipient of the Trustee's Award for
Faculty Excellence at Wright State University.
