Representation theory emerged over 100 years ago with the pioneering work of
Frobenius and Schur. A representation is a realization of an algebraic structure
(i.e., a group, Lie algebra, quantum group, or Lie superalgebra) by matrices.
Such realizations have been successfully applied to provide deep insights into
these complicated algebraic objects. Over the course of the last century,
representation theory has emerged as a central area of modern mathematics with
connections to combinatorics, algebraic geometry, topology, number theory, along
with applications to physics. More recent developments have included using the
representation theory of Lie groups to better understand signal processing and
the translation of the P versus NP problem in computer science via geometric
complexity theory into questions about decomposing representations for the
general linear group.

The PI will investigate the representation theory of algebraic groups, Lie
algebras, and Lie superalgebras via categorical and geometric methods. In recent
years, these algebro-geometric methods have played a predominant role in
understanding the relationships between representations in various algebraic
categories. Cohomological methods will be used to answer questions about the
characters and existence of filtrations for representations. Geometric
constructions and cohomology in triangulated categories will be employed to
analyze the behavior of the representations for the aforementioned algebraic
objects. The PI will also determine the relationship between a tensor
triangulated category and its underlying categorical spectrum.
