This project has been designed to significantly improve the quality of
technological education in Southwest Virginia by increasing the capability of
five community colleges to respond to industry- identified needs for advanced
manufacturing technology (AMT) education. The project activities will serve as a
model for rural appalachian colleges and will be coordinated through the
Southwest Virginia Advanced Manufacturing Center, formed through a consortium of
five community colleges. The project involves two components: 1) enhancement of
faculty skills and knowledge to teach the advanced technologies required by AMT
curricular courses via "back- to-practice" internships in industry and
attendance at seminars and workshops, and 2) initial development of common AMT
curricular courses by cross-disciplinary teams, comprised of faculty from the
five participating community colleges, representatives from regional business
and industry, and faculty from area high schools and senior institutions.
