Evergreen State College is establishing a connection to NSFNET via a 56,000 bits
per second line through the NorthWestNet mid-level network. The connection
enhances collaborations of campus researchers with colleagues in several fields
such as biology, psychology, computer science and music, and enables on-line
access to remote bibliography databases and supercomputers. This award funds
part of the costs for two years.
