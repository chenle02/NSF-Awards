Hyperbolic systems of conservation laws play fundamental roles in describing a
wide variety of physical phenomena, including compressible fluid flows,
magnetohydrodynamics, reacting flows, and multiphase flows, among others. The
study of shock wave theory is important because it not only provides a better
mathematical understanding of these complex phenomena, but also helps to design
more robust numerical schemes to solve the underlying physical problems. The
major difficulty associated with shock wave theory is the discontinuous feature
of the solution due to the nonlinear convection. For nonlinear systems
understanding the wave interactions are exceedingly hard. Although a great deal
of remarkable results on the existence, stability, uniqueness and asymptotic
behavior of the solution have been obtained, there are still many challenging
open questions for systems and multi-dimensional cases. The goal of the meeting
is to provide an opportunity for young researchers to learn systematically the
recent development in shock wave theory. The ultimate goal is to promote more
research activities, especially among colleagues in the southeast region, in
this direction. The substantial expository paper based on the lectures should
have significant influence for future development in this direction.
