The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) at Harvard
University is a highly multidisciplinary research Center with participants from
seven different schools and departments. The Center has a broad range of
research activities from soft materials to biological materials. The research of
the Harvard MRSEC is organized into three interdisciplinary research groups
(IRGs):&lt;br/&gt;IRG 1: Micromechanics to explore the fascinating and
technologically important mechanical behavior of systems where phenomena at very
short length scales impact the materials properties and mechanics at macroscopic
length scales.&lt;br/&gt;IRG 2: Droplet Templated Materials utilize microfluidic
devices, or devices that control the flow of fluids at micron length scales, to
produce new structures that are of use for delivery of drugs and other active
ingredients that must be protected from their environment prior to delivery.
&lt;br/&gt;IRG 3: Active Soft Materials addressing materials science required to
create soft robotics, which are machines that can adapt to new geometries while
still providing function. &lt;br/&gt;The MRSEC supports a vigorous program to
educate and inspire the public about materials science. The MRSEC offers novel
programs for high school teachers and research opportunities for undergraduates
from all over the US. A collaborative Partnerships in Research and Education in
Materials program with University of New Mexico attracts underrepresented
minority undergraduates to a Summer Program at Harvard. The rigorous scholarship
emblematic of the Harvard MRSEC ensures that the excellent students and
postdoctoral fellows in the Center will become leaders of the next generation of
scientists and engineers. &lt;br/&gt;The MRSEC has extensive collaboration with
industry, both with large, established companies and with start-up firms that
are inspired by the work of the Center. The MRSEC also collaborates with some
equipment manufacturers to build an enhanced shared experimental facility for
soft materials research.
