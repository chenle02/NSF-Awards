Project Abstract&lt;br/&gt;SES 0322431&lt;br/&gt;Elson Bihm, University of
Central Arkansas&lt;br/&gt;"Marian Breland Bailey and the History of Behavioral
Psychology"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The historical legacy of behavioral-psychology
pioneer Marian Breland Bailey will be organized, preserved, and transported to
the Archives of the History of American Psychology at the University of Akron.
Working with Historian David Baker, the project directors will collaborate in
cataloging and preparing for transport the psychology papers and artifacts of
Marian Breland Bailey and of her husbands Keller Breland and Robert Bailey.
Included will be the research records, business records, and artifacts of Animal
Behavior Enterprises and the IQ Zoo (e.g., exhibits, correspondence, training
manuals, props, film, and videotape). The availability of these materials will
help scholars and students understand the importance of her work in relation to
animal psychology and ethology, her role in establishing behavior analysis as a
science, her role in the early work of behaviorist B. F. Skinner, and her
contributions in explicating human operant behavior. &lt;br/&gt;To further
demonstrate her significance in the history of scientific psychology, the
project directors will establish an internet-accessible digital library of
photographs, video clips, scanned documents, and accompanying multi-media
information that will highlight her unique contributions, as well as the
contributions of her collaborators. The preservation of these holdings should
serve as a heuristic for future applied, theoretical, and historical research,
and will provide a model of the scientific approach to
behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
