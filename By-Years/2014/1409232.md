SES-1409232&lt;br/&gt;Anthony S. Chen&lt;br/&gt;Fiona C.
Chin&lt;br/&gt;Northwestern University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Economic inequality
in the U.S. has been rising for the past thirty years. Social science research
on the topic is developing rapidly, but there remains a paucity of research on
what wealthy Americans know and believe about economic inequality. The
stratification literature has examined the knowledge and beliefs of ordinary
Americans along these lines, but we need to understand more about what the
affluent know and think about economic inequality, as well as where their
beliefs come from. This study investigates these questions by employing a multi-
method approach. Using data from a representative survey of the wealthiest 1% of
Chicago-area residents and original in-depth interviews with economically
successful Americans from across the country, this study describes and explains
the stratification ideologies of wealthy Americans. Specifically, the study aims
to determine what the wealthy believe about the stratification order and their
own place in it; where those beliefs come from (i.e., why they believe what they
believe); what their preferences are for public and private interventions to
ameliorate inequality; and what their ideas imply for whether and how the trend
toward greater inequality may be addressed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Economic inequality is widely regarded as one of
the most important public policy issues of our time. The social science
community has only begun to illuminate the complex trends, causes, and
consequences of economic inequality. This study will contribute to this ongoing
endeavor by documenting and explaining the beliefs about inequality held by
wealthy Americans, a highly influential--but surprisingly understudied--segment
of the population. This study is an interdisciplinary project at the
intersection of Sociology and Political Science. Findings from this study will
be disseminated to both academic and non-academic audiences.
