The project of this awarded proposal is a conference, entitled "Ergodic Theory
and Related Fields Workshop". It will be held at the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill from March 17 to March 21, 2011. The workshop will focus
on a fundamental theme in ergodic theory: connections between ergodic theory and
number theory. Several of the topics covered are central and extremely active
areas of current research in ergodic theory; limit theorems for the Gauss map,
rigidity of group actions, the pointwise convergence of nonconventional ergodic
averages and the pointwise convergence of ergodic averages along subsequences of
integers).

The funds provided will support participants, especially women, graduate
students, postdocs and young faculty. Young researchers will be given ample
opportunities to speak and to participate in the conference activities and will
be exposed to the latest developments in the connections between number theory
and ergodic theory.
