Observations in the eastern tropical Pacific indicate that a new El
Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event is now underway. ENSO events that produce
stormy winters in Southern California can decimate adult kelp populations
through physical disturbance, and even relatively mild ENSO events can produce
extreme nutrient limitation that reduce the abundance and productivity of giant
kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera. The effects of ENSO on abundances and productivity
of the giant kelp are well documented, but its effect on genetic diversity and
population dynamics of giant kelp remains unknown. This project will initiate a
most timely investigation of the impact of the 1992 ENSO event on genetic
diversity of giant kelp populations in the Southern California Bight. The
approach will exploit DNA fingerprinting and restriction fragment length
polymorphism technologies to address the genetic structure and composition of
giant kelp populations prior to the ENSO event and during the post-ENSO
recovery. To evaluate the critical post-ENSO recovery period, this research
(having extreme urgency) must be initiated now before the onset of the 1992 ENSO
event that's predicted for this summer.
