10031 ILI - Instrumentation Project: Engineering Title: A Power Technology
Laboratory This project will develop and equipt an advanced laboratory for
instruction and research in the field of Powder Technology. Several experiments
will be developed with the new and upgraded instrumentation and will be
integrated into the new Chemical Engineering elective option of Powder
Technology, specifically into the "Unit Operations II" laboratory. The new and
the upgraded instrumentation will be state of the art equipment and will be used
for undergraduate and graduate instruction. Additionally, a piece of industrial
equipment will be used as a demonstration unit in Freshman Engineering classes
for all engineering students to show them the very different and peculiar
behavior of powders as compared to gases and liquids. It is expected that the
demonstration unit will convince and encourage students to pursue the powder
technology option (elective) in Chemical Engineering and to enter this new and
promising field of engineering.
