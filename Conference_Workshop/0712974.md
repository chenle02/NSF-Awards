The Department of Mathematical Sciences and the Center for Applied Mathematics
and Statistics at the New Jersey Institute of Technology will be organizing and
hosting a major conference on Frontiers in Applied and Computational
Mathematics, May 14-16, 2007. This conference is the fourth in a series of
conferences and for the first time it will include a significant component
devoted to undergraduate student research (Undergraduate Research Day, May 14).
The first two conferences (2004, 2005) brought together more than 400 applied
mathematicians working at the frontiers of mathematical biology, fluid
mechanics, nonlinear waves, high-performance scientific computing, and applied
statistics. The third conference (2006) focused on mathematical fluid dynamics
and its applications in engineering and biology, and brought together more than
100 mathematicians from around the world to interact and present the latest
advances in their respective fields.

The key theme of the 2007 Frontiers in Applied and Computational Mathematics
conference will be the mathematical modeling of difficult real-world problems in
mathematical biology and the health sciences with a significant component
comprising of the mathematics of fluids, linear and nonlinear waves, high-
performance scientific computing, and applied statistics. Among the impacted
technological areas are fiber-optic communication systems, ocean-wave dynamics,
and fluid flow in pipes. The conference will bring together renowned
mathematicians and scientists from the US and abroad to interact as they present
their latest research results to a large audience that also contains significant
numbers of undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior
faculty. The program of the conference will have 4 plenary speakers and 48
minisymposium speakers.
