This project will produce a published volume of the proceedings of the Fourth
National Black Graduate Student Conference. The conference, held at Howard
University, Washington, DC, in May 1992 emphasizes social science with the

Twenty First Century. The objectives of the conference are: - to provide the
opportunity for black graduate students to present and discuss their work with
future colleagues, - to enhance the possibilities of collaborative research
among black scholars, - to provide an opportunity for black graduate students to
learn from experienced faculty about conducting research, writing proposals,
preparing publications, and - to encourage black undergraduate students to
consider academia as a variable career option.
