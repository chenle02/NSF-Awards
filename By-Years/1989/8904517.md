Averaged over long distances DNA is a smooth rod-like molecule, but on a smaller
scale, the DNA helix can have bends or kinks in the molecule. The conformational
changes have two causes: (1) the nature of the base pairs and the interaction
with contiguous pairs; (2) DNA binding proteins which coil DNA or distort a few
base pairs. The segment of the chromosome surrounding cos, the recognition
signal for bacteriophage lambda DNA packaging, is bent due to its unsual base
sequence. In this same region are several binding sites for an E. coli protein,
Integration Host Factor (IHF), required for efficient DNA packaging. IHF
severely bends DNA at one of its binding sites. Experiments suggest that both
kinds of bends may be important for the biological function of cos. The
conformation of the DNA sequence around cos, how of the DNA sequence around cos,
how IHF binds and causes bending, and whether intrinsic bends in the DNA
sequence can modulate protein-DNA interactions will be examined in detail. The
experiments, on cloned, synthetic DNA fragments mimicking the natural variants
of IHF binding sites found near cos, include protein-DNA binding assays, gel
mobility measurements, and footprinting with agents sensitive to structural
changes in DNA. IHF is involved in many processes in E. coli, most notably
recombination/transporsition reactions, as well as the control of gene
expression, both transcriptionally and post- transcriptionally, the initiation
of DNA replication, and DNA packaging for bacteriophage lambda (Friedman, 1988).
It is not known how such a small protein, with no known enzymatic function, is
utilized in such a variety of molecular genetic process in the bacterial cell.
Because IHF is so widely utilized, its role might be a generalized function,
useful in many processes. Bending is a function which could be useful in many
processes to modulate protein binding in the region or to allow proteins bound
to relatively distant sites to be placed in closer proximity. Knowing how IHF
binds to DNA and how IHF bends DNA could be the key to all these areas.
