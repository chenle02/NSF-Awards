9304520 Moskowitz A major goal of this proposal is to study the influence of
crystal defects on magnetic behavior in magnetite and titanomagnetite. Crystal
defects can act as centers for the nucleation of new domain walls and aid
changes in magnetization, or they can pin existing domain walls and inhibit
changes in magnetization. Aside from some rudimentary details, there is a lack
of quantitative knowledge about wall-defect interactions. Specifically, defect
structures will be changed and manipulated in a controlled manner by bulk
plastic deformation, by single grain micro-indentation, and by thermal annealing
experiments. The main purpose of these experiments will be to determine how
coercivity and remanence varies with the degree of deformation and with recovery
through annealing and to assess critically recent theoretical micromagnetic
models for the thermal dependence of coercivity produced by specific types and
arrangements of defects. ***
