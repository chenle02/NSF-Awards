This research will focus on problems in two areas of martingales and their
applications. First, the project will be study of laws of the iterated logarithm
for harmonic functions and related questions. Second, the research will involve
analysis of the inequalities for martingale transforms and projections of
martingale transforms with applications to Riesz transforms and determination of
the best constant in an inequality for the Haar functions. This research is in
the general area of statistics and probability and consists of applying
probabilistic techniques to problems in analysis. The work involves finding
optimal or near optimal constants in a number of classical inequalities. Ten
years ago such problems would have appeared unsolvable. Today the situation has
changed completely and a number of important problems in several fields have
been shown to reduce to the determination of certain constants in analytic
inequalities.
