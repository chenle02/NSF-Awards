This action funds Amanda B. Young of Penn State University to conduct a research
project, entitled "A comparison of gymnosperm and angiosperm treeline
development," during the summer of 2012 at Shinshu University in
Matsumoto/Nagano Prefecture. The host scientist is Dr. Koichi Takahashi.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to contribute to understanding
of why some treelines are composed of angiosperms while others are dominated by
gymnosperms. Moreover, with increasing levels of carbon dioxide in the
atmosphere, projected increases in temperature, and changes in the quantity and
timing of precipitation, it is important to conduct this study to generate data
on key processes that can contribute to efforts to model ecosystem responses to
a changing climate.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
