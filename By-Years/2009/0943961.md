This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate
a novel technique for growing large-diameter, high-quality ZnO single crystals.
ZnO single crystal substrates are suitable for fabrication of epitaxial
structures for both GaN-based and ZnO-based devices, such as light emitters and
detectors, as well as for high power, high temperature and high frequency
devices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed growth technique has the potential
to produce large diameter, high quality ZnO bulk single crystal boules in an
efficient manner at a low cost. Commercialization of high-quality, low-cost ZnO
single crystal substrates may have a dramatic impact on the development and
commercialization of both GaN-based and ZnO-based devices for a variety of
applications.&lt;br/&gt;
