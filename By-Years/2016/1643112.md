The project STAMPS: Science, Technology and Math Preparation Scholarships is
serving the national interest by supporting academically talented and
financially needy students, including minority, women and first-generation
college students, in their efforts to complete their college degrees in the STEM
disciplines (Natural, Physical, Earth and Computer Sciences). The project is
providing financial, academic, mentoring and advising support to talented
students in the STEM disciplines to increase their retention rates and better
prepare students for science and technology-based careers or for advance study
in professional (e.g., medical, dental, pharmacy, graduate) schools. By doing
so, the project is increasing the pool of talented individuals for highly
skilled jobs or careers in science and technology. The project is also
developing best practices on how to support and train students for a skilled
workforce that is shared with other universities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;STAMPS
enrolls a diverse group of first year STEM students into a yearlong integrated
science course, designed to create a cohort, supported by faculty and peer
mentors and services. STAMPS students have opportunities for research,
interacting with STEM speakers, travel, and facilitated shadowing at the Joint
School for Nanoscience and Nanoengineering. The goals are to 1) matriculate and
then graduate STAMPS scholars into STEM careers or graduate school; 2) identify
and support a diverse community of STEM learners; 3) create a supportive and
self-sustaining environment for STAMPS scholars; and 4) discover what works and
why and share this knowledge to a broad audience.
