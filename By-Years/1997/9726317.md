This award supports Dr. Jan Prins, co-PI Siddhartha Chatterjee, and a graduate
student from the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill in a collaboration
with Stefan JÂªhnichen of the Department of Communications and Software
Engineering at the Technical University of Berlin. The collaboration will study
high-performance computing with the aim of integrating nested parallelism into
the High Performance Fortran (HPF) and Fortran 95 programming languages. (HPF is
a variant of Fortran 95 specifically targeted for programming high-performance
parallel computers in a way that does not depend on the computer architecture.)
The time is right to incorporate this new technology into Fortran so that
applications can take advantage of the capability without disrupting ongoing
development. Nested parallelism enables the expression of adaptive and sparse
solution techniques necessary to performing increasingly large and precise
scientific computations. The collaboration combines the complementary strengths
and facilities of the two research groups.
