9622200 Hearn A SPARC station 20 Multiprocessor Workstation with Solaris User
Environment and two 75 Mhz Processors will be acquired to support research in
the Center for Applied Optimization where a mix of applied and fundamental
projects are conducted. The research will focus on the major areas of applied
optimization and algorithm research. The particular projects to be focused upon
are: (1) decision modeling for water management, involving development of models
and algorithms for determining optimal alternative water supply strategies; (2)
bounded flow approach to congestion pricing using new nonlinear programming and
variational inequality methods to determine system optimal tolls for controlling
congestion in urban street networks; (3) computational algorithm development for
new lower bound heuristics and exact algorithms to solve classes of NP-hard
combinatorial optimization problems; and (4) molecular conformation and protein
folding algorithm development and implementation for global minimization of
nonconvex energy functions. The equipment will improve the research environment
of the important projects identified above. The equipment will make an already
productive center even more so. The improvements to the infrastructure should
lead to new discoveries or fundamental advances.
