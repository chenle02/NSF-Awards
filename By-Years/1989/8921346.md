In the past decade, discussions of the role of government policy have changed
rather dramatically. At one time, discussions of policy held out independent and
significant roles for both monetary and fiscal policy to influence both business
cycles and economic growth. In recent years, the role of government policy in
general and monetary policy in particular is seen as much more limited. Much of
the research on business cycles has been framed in the context of models where
business cycles occur as the result of technology shocks in models that are free
of distortions of any kind. Thus, the cause of the cycle is real in origin. A
separate but related strand of literature has examined the process of growth in
a new light, using new techniques, but abstracting from any concrete role for
government policy. The purpose of this project is to analyze the role of
government, ie. monetary and fiscal policy, in the context of a real business
cycle model. In particular, the effects of policy on the statistical properties
of aggregate time series and societal welfare are analyzed. This research is
important because it will provide a better understanding of the relative roles
of real and monetary factors in affecting economic fluctuations and long term
growth.
