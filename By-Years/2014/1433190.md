The proposal has several interconnected elements that revolve around extending
to a wider population existing efforts to improve science literacy in Native
Alaskan groups, while simultaneously developing a framework for assisting Polar
researchers to improve their communications skills. The twin tracks have a
common goal of generally improving science literacy.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another goal is to increase interaction between
researchers and the general public.
