This exploratory study under an SGER award will attempt to deposit beta-C3N4 on
metal substrates. The compound's existence has been predicted from theoretical
considerations which also indicate that it may be harder than diamond.
Deposition by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition techniques will be
attempted on the (0001) faces of single crystals of Hf and Zr, which closely
match the crystal structure of the compound and also have strong bonds with both
carbon and nitrogen. The resultant coatings will be characterized by
crystallographic, metallographic and tribological techniques.
