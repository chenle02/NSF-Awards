9710246 Avissar We propose to hold the Sixth International Conference on
Precipitation in Hawaii June 29-July 1, 1998. Following the tradition of the
previous five conference, this meeting aims at fostering interdisciplinary
interactions between atmosphere scientists,hydrologists, mathematicians and
statisticians. The central theme of the conference will be research issues
related to rainfall predictability at the different time and space scales. In
particular, emphasis will be placed on the following topics: (i) application of
modern observational techniques for precipitation estimation and prediction,
(ii) dynamically modeling of clouds and precipitation, and (iii) limits of
predictability.
