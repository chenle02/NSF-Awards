This project supports the establishment of a digital imaging instructional
laboratory. Surveys conducted on the printing industry suggest that the use of
digital imaging will increase dramatically in the next few years. At the recent
Graph Expo printing equipment and supply show held in Chicago, most of the major
manufacturers of printing equipment were demonstrating some form of computer to
film, computer to plate, or computer to press system. These systems replace most
of the labor-intensive film preparation work with the preparation of digital
images. Now, the computer operator can be the designer, typesetter, scanner
operator, film assembler, color separator, and platemaker, all in one computer
system. This means that the computer operator must become familiar with a broad
range of printing knowledge as it applies to digital images. Through this
project, students can experiment with scanning images, manipulate images with
digital special effect, and test output image quality based on varied input
resolutions. Traditional printing course content is still valid but must be
reframed in a computer environment. New lessons and supporting instructional
materials are being created for this model laboratory setting. It is important
to the university that students learn the methods and outcomes of inquiry in the
sciences and professions guided by faculty. The School of Technology's mission
is to provide state-of-the-art experiences and to maintain model laboratories
related to its instructional areas. Updating the digital imaging equipment in
the Graphic Communications laboratory helps the school and the university meet
their goals.
