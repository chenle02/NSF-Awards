Elucidating the mechanistic bases of natural variation in ecologically relevant
behavior is a fundamental component of many disciplines ranging from
neuroethology, behavioral ecology, evolutionary biology and behavioral genetics.
This proposal seeks to understand the genetic, physiological, and developmental
variation underlying chemical communication. In honey bees, social interactions
are modulated by pheromonal signaling. The queen produces a pheromone that
inhibits worker ovary development and attracts workers to lick, antennate, and
feed her. Previous work has demonstrated that there is significant variation in
pheromone response, however, very little research has focused on understanding
the molecular and physiological processes that might mediate responsiveness to
pheromones. Natural variation in responsiveness to queen pheromone is robust and
widespread, and is linked to global differences in gene expression patterns in
the brains of honey bee workers. Furthermore, this variation is associated with
genotypic, physiological and developmental differences. This proposal will
characterize the molecular mechanisms and pathways in worker honey bees that
produce natural variation in behavioral responses to queen pheromone by using a
combination of molecular and quantitative genetic approaches to expand our
understanding of these processes. This project will provide training in
quantitative genetics for a graduate student and several undergraduates. These
studies will improve understanding of the physiological, developmental,
molecular and genotypic factors that modulate chemical communication, with an
ultimate goal of understanding how different combinations of factors (genetic,
physiological, and environmental) influence life history traits.
