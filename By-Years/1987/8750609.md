The objective of this project is to increase the quality of laboratory science
education in psychology at Winona State University. The focus of the project is
on instruction in experimental design and research methods with applications in
the areas of learning, cognition and sensation and perception. The equipment
requested will provide for a state of the art experimental psychology
laboratory. The equipment includes a computer controlled operant conditioning
system with eight student lab stations. This equipment will permit students to
conduct experiments in a variety of basic learning processes. Also requested are
twelve personal computers which will provide the means for conducting a number
of experiments in perception, cognition and learning. The equipment will
facilitate instruction by giving students first hand experience with a variety
of experimental research methods in scientific psychology.
