This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). This CAREER Research award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic
and Organometallic Chemistry program supports work by Professor Paula Diaconescu
at the University of California, Los Angeles, to carry out fundamental/basic
studies on the activation and functionalization of inert molecules. The
scientific areas targeted are: (1) ring-opening and (2) functionalization of
aromatic heterocycles. The activation of C-N bonds in heterocycles is important
in the context of hydrodenitrogenation processes. The functionalization of
heterocycles is relevant to organic synthesis. To achieve these goals,
electrophilic metal centers supported by chelating ferrocene-based ligands are
designed in order to develop transformations under mild conditions.
Educationally, the present project is structured around using research as a tool
to teach students at all levels about some of the energy problems that are
confronting the environment and showing them how chemistry can be useful in
understanding and solving those problems. In an attempt to reach a wide group of
high school students, an effective strategy to update teachers on research
conducted towards solving energy problems is considered. To this end a series of
workshops on how to teach environmental issues in the high school classrooms is
proposed. In this way it prepares future scientists to work on problems
important to society.

Understanding the C-N bond breaking processes in the presence of transition
metals is significant in establishing heterogeneous mechanisms and assessing
whether mild conditions are viable for hydrodenitrogenation, one of the
processes that will contribute to alleviating some of the energy problems faced
by society.
