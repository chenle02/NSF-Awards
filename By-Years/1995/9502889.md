Parallel computers are difficult to program. Often, users have to specify the
parallel execution, i.e., to specify data distributions to different local
memory modules (as in High Performance Fortran), data communications between
processors, and processor synchronizations. The insufficient programming support
limits the applicability and further development of parallel systems. The
objectives of this research are (1) to search and find solutions (optimal or
feasible) for those fundamental problems in programming parallel systems such as
how to distribute/replicate input data to different local memories in the system
to minimize inter-processor communications, how to schedule and partition the
computations to minimize the overall running time, how many processors should be
used and how to choose the right message size for a message vector; (2) to
develop new techniques for data alignment, scheduling partitioning and
estimating the number of processors to be used for optimal execution of
algorithms with nested loops; and (3) to implement these techniques and add them
to some existing software tools such as PVM and MPI. Education: The education
plans are as follows: (1) Undergraduate computer architecture lab at Santa Clara
University has not been changed for six years and is obsolete. It is planned to
update the lab and syllabi and redesign the students' projects to include recent
advances in computer design, technology and debugging software to have students
more motivated and prepared when they graduate. (2) Develop new parallel
processing lab projects. One project is to have students run parallel programs
in PVM environment so students can see and think those fundamental problems in
parallel programming. (3) Be involved in mentoring women and underrepresented
undergraduates and graduate students. (4) Do research projects with several
senior undergraduate students, especially women engineering students to motivate
them to pursue graduate studies in computer engineering at SCU
