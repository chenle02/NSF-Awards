This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program will support a series of three
annual "Workshops on Reactive Intermediates". These workshops have the dual
purposes of (1) providing an effective forum for informal discussion by active
scientists of current research in topical areas of organic dynamics, and (2)
assisting the Program staff in identifying areas of research in organic dynamics
that should be incorporated into the Program's long-range planning. Each
workshop will bring together approximately 18 active scientists from around the
United States for discussions of current research in mechanisms of organic
chemical reactions, with a focus on unpublished results and an emphasis on
critical evaluation of research in progress. The informal discussion format is
intended to stimulate challenge and criticism, to facilitate the development of
collaborative approaches to shared research problems, and to prevent
unproductive duplicative efforts. The participants are drawn widely from the
community of physical, organic, and organometallic chemists studying the
chemistry of reactive intermediates, and a particular effort is made to
incorporate young investigators, women, and underrepresented minority scientists
into the mainstream of research activities in the area of organic dynamics. The
topics chosen for discussion are selected to complement, not compete with, other
established and more formal conferences.
