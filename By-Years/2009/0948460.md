Intellectual Merit Certain bacteria can colonize external, mucosal and
intracellular sites of eukaryotes. Colonization is promoted by proteins on the
outer surface of bacteria that mediate interactions with eukaryotic cells, solid
surfaces, or other bacteria. This project focuses on the agglutinins, a family
of outer membrane proteins expressed by a broad repertoire of Gram-negative
bacteria ranging from human intestinal colonizers to intracellular colonizers of
insects. Our laboratory has shown that the Heat Resistant Agglutinin 1 (Hra1) is
an accessory colonization factor in Escherichia coli strains with exceptional
colonization abilities. This project will examine interplay of this protein with
other surface factors, such as fimbriae, using cultured epithelial cells and the
nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans as model systems. The research will
additionally identify and validate colonization-associated motifs within Hra1
and related proteins from other intestinal colonizers. The investigations will
be extended to Wolbachia Surface Proteins (Wsps). Wsps are agglutinins
hypothesized to contribute to localization and interbacterial interactions of
bacteria that reside inside the cells of insects and nematodes. To get around
difficulties with culturing and manipulating Wolbachia, we propose to study the
Wsps by expressing them in E. coli and to apply the methods we are using to
examine E. coli surface proteins towards elucidating Wsp function. This work
will advance the understanding of interactions among bacteria as well between
bacteria and their eukaryotic hosts. Broader impact: Knowledge gained from this
project will increase understanding of specific molecular interactions that
allow bacteria to live on or in other organisms. The research will be conducted
at Haverford College, a small liberal arts institution and will largely be
performed by mentored undergraduate researchers. The PI teaches microbiology and
introductory genetics, stimulating interest in bacteriology in a number of
undergraduates and will offer 3-8 students each year, including women and other
groups underrepresented in the sciences, research opportunities associated with
the project. Additionally, approximately 30 students a year will be taught in
inquiry-based lab classes that test some hypotheses associated with the project.
As in the past, some students so trained will work with the PI in microbiology
workshops for K-12 students in the US or for students and Faculty in West
Africa.
