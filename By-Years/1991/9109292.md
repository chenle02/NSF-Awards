The goal of Dr. Clemens' research is to understand connections between the
brain and the spinal cord of nerve cells that are involved in the control of
reproductive behavior. Specific tracer substances will be used to define such
pathways at both the light and electron microscopic levels. The neurochemical
characteristics of the pathways and the effects of hormonal manipulations on the
nerve cells will also be studied. Knowledge about this neural system under
normal conditions is a prerequisite to understanding changes that can occur when
the system is dysfunctional such as may happen with aging. This research will
contribute to basic understanding of the role of the nervous system in
reproductive function.
