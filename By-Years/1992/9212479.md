A major upgrade of an existing Mossbauer spectrometer is performed. Electronics
are updated and a controlled atmosphere, variable-temperature cell with in situ
reaction capability is fabricated; the cell is designed to be placed between the
poles of a 5-inch electromagnet to provide a magnetic field up to 11 kilogauss.
It is thought that this is the most versatile Mossbauer facility in the U. S.
The equipment will be used for several studies in catalysis and coal chemistry
including studies of electronic, magnetic, and lattice properties of supported
metal clusters; active phases of cobalt and iron catalysts during hydrogenation
of carbon monoxide; surface and bulk characteristics of zeolites exchanged with
iron or cobalt, and their correlation with activity for decomposition of nitric
oxide; transformations of iron minerals during coal devolatilization, char
oxidation, and the deposition of mineral matter on boiler surfaces; and iron
compounds in fly ash.
