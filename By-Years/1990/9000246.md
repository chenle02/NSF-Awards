The University of Rhode Island will operate the R/V ENDEAVOR during 1990 as a
general oceanographic vessel in support of NSF-funded research projects. The R/V
ENDEAVOR is a 177' general research vessel constructed in 1977 and owned by the
National Science Foundation. URI operates the ENDEAVOR under a charter agreement
with NSF. The ship operates primarily in the North Atlantic. This vessel is part
of a fleet used by the National Science Foundation to support oceanographic
research projects. Most oceanographic research projects require highly
specialized equipment and extensive support from a ship's crew members. An
increasing number of research projects require equipment that must be
permanently installed on a ship and for which the ship must be specifically
designed. Such equipment also requires highly trained crew members for
maintenance and operation. These vessels do not operate in the same manner as
general cargo or fishing vessels, and therefore, NSF supports the operation of a
variety of vessels specifically dedicated to oceanographic research. These
vessels are operated by universities and research institutions around the
country.
