Orme 9622400 As an emerging technology, rapid prototyping is revolutionizing
every sector of industry, creating great opportunities to design and manufacture
products of superior quality with shorter lead-time and low costs. The research
project investigates a new method of solid freeform fabrication (SFF) of
functional metallic components which relies on the deposition of metal in the
molten state onto a substrate whose motion is guided with the direct coupling
from CAD information. This droplet-based SFF requires less machining steps than
both conventional manufacturing techniques such as casting and other SFF
technologies such as Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) and 3D printing. The
research project will focus on scientific issues necessary for the successful
development of a novel rapid prototyping technique. The proposed technique can
generate 10,000 to 40,000 droplets/second (for orifice diameters from 25 to 100
micron and a stream speed of 5 m/s) are injected into a controlled environment
chamber and are deposed onto a temperature controlled substrate where they
impinge and rapidly solidify. The research project has a balance between theory
and experiment, and will provide valuable findings for the rapid prototyping
industry.
