Lightly ionized medium to high-Z atoms have been little studied theoretically,
because they require the simultaneous inclusion of relativity and correlation.
For the latter, the presence of open d and/or f subshell electrons makes
obtaining accurate computational results quite challenging. These species, which
constitute over half the periodic table, are technologically important in
catalysis, advanced lighting sources, atomic clocks, nuclear waste, semi-
conductor defects, rare-earth magnets, high temperature superconductors,
hydrogen energy storage, plasma fusion devices, astrophysics, etc. The negative
ions are particularly challenging to both the theorist and experimenter. The
research will continue calculations on the aforementioned bound state systems
and extend the work to treat continuum properties such as photoionization and
the energies and widths of resonances.
