A Heating, Ventilating and Air-Conditioning Laboratory is being created as a
major addition to the laboratory facilities in Mechanical Engineering
Technology. The laboratory provides students access to modern data gathering
instrumentation equivalent to those used in the HVAC industry. Students use the
laboratory to study the performance of air-conditioning systems and to the field
of Testing, Adjusting and Balancing of environmental conditioning systems
serving modern buildings. This project is being matched by an amount equal to
the award.
