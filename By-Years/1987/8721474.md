This group of investigators in structural biology utilize the conventional
electron microscope and computer tomography in association with the high-voltage
electron microscope. The computer-based components of these projects rely on the
availability of raster graphics, large disk space, and memory. The funded
equipment of this grant consists of DEC and SUN computer hardware which will
provide high speed computing capability. The use of shared instrumentation is
appropriate because the bulk of existing software developed in-house has been
written with a view towards accommodating a wide range of applications, and
because a shared facility leads to the most efficient use of resources.
Visualization of the cell and its substructural components has been and
continues to be one of the important goals of modern biology. Electron
microscopy provides magnification powerful enough to image cellular organelles
and macromolecular complexes. The complex 3-dimensional reconstruction of serial
sections is performed by computer, providing a picture of these complexes.
Structures to be investigated by electron microscopy and high voltage electron
microscopy include ribosomes, membrane channels, components of the mitotic
apparatus, and cilia.
