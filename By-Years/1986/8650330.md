The goal of this project is to upgrade and expand the undergraduate chemistry
program at Carthage College in the area of infrared spectrophotometry. A Fourier
transform infrared spectrophotometer will be used by students in organic
chemistry, physical chemistry, instrumental analysis, inorganic chemistry, and
undergraduate research. Investigations include: delineating the effects of
various molecular substituents on characteristic group frequencies, quantitative
analysis of mixtures, structure elucidation and compound identification,
determination of vibrational and rotational constants, and determining effects
of intercalators on secondary structure of DNA using the FT-IR Circle Cell
accessory. Throughout, students will gain experience in computer-controlled
instrument operation and computer use of a spectral identification library.
