The NSF S-STEM program provides scholarships to talented and financially needy
students enabling them to enroll full time in a STEM discipline. Because the
S-STEM program provides limited support for dissemination and community
interaction, it has been difficult for schools administering S-STEM scholarships
to communicate and learn from each other. This project is bringing exemplary
S-STEM principal investigators together with new S-STEM principal investigators
and facilitating an exchange of lessons learned and best practices among
projects. The face-to-face meeting of PIs is critical to generate a thorough
exchange of ideas and the documentation of best practices that cannot be
captured in other forms of gatherings. The meeting results are being
disseminated nationally and therefore the meeting benefits not only the
attendees but also all current and near future proposers.
