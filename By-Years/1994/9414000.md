Utilizing funds from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program microscopy
instrumentation will be acquired to augment the ongoing interdisciplinary
research at Old Dominion University. The instrumentation includes a FT-Raman
spectrometer, a Ramanscope microscope, an Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
microscope, and an Atomic Force Microscope base and scan heads. The
instrumentation will shared between the Departments of Chemistry, Electrical
Engineering and Mechanical Engineering and will be utilized for research in the
following areas: Raman characterization of high-performance thermoset polymers;
vibrational studies of mixed metal oxide catalysts; synthesis and
characterization of thin diamond films; surface characterization of corrosion
and dealloying mechanisms; surface characterization of the initial stages of
porous silicon formation. Instrumentation in the microscopy area will be
acquired for studies of thermoset polymers, metal oxide catalysts, synthesis and
characterization of thin diamond films, the study of corrosion and dealloying
mechanisms, and studies of the initial stages of porous silicon formation.
