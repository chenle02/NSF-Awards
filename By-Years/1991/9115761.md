This project is concerned with two mathematical subdisciplines: model theory
and universal algebra. Until recently there were two distinct branches of model
theory: classification theory and model theoretic algebra. In the past decade,
the boundary between these two areas has become blurred. Algebraic techniques
have become a necessary ingredient in most of the exciting recent results in
model theory. In the last fifteen years universal algebra has acquired two
powerful new tools: commutator theory and tame congruence theory. These have
been used to settle a number of problems, including questions in decidability.
There are also several important intersections between model theory and
universal algebra. This project will support a special year in model theory and
universal algebra to be held at the University of Illinois at Chicago in
1991-92. The year will feature long term visits by internationally prominent
researchers and short term visits by leading experts in the fields.
