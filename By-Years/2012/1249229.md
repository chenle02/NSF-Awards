The fundamental research question posed by this project is how to provide an
integrated, flexible, and scalable storage repository for early design sketches.
Early design is characterized by informal, unstructured, and heavily
collaborative work processes involving multiple participants, multiple forms of
representational media, and a plethora of interactions between these. However,
there currently exist no storage mechanisms capable of supporting the full scope
of sketching for creative design. In practice, designers either resort to low-
tech physical artifacts such as pen, paper, and whiteboards that lack the
persistence of digital storage, or general purpose software such as e-mail or
shared file systems where the storage mechanisms are not well-integrated with
the creative process and also lack provenance, history, and versioning
information. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The contribution of this
project is to apply the concept of a Wiki to sketches. Wikis are collections of
freely editable web documents and have become popular due to their capacity for
drawing upon the crowd to create content. Wikis have also been shown to be
particularly useful in early design, but existing Wiki software makes
integrating visual representations burdensome. This research effort will be
focused on designing, building, and evaluating a sketch-based Wiki (skWiki) that
allows for combining vectorized sketches with text.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Unlike prototyping, manufacturing, or
even engineering, innovation cannot easily be outsourced and is now recognized
as the single most important ingredient in our economy. Consequently, there has
never been a clearer imperative to both create designs which will fundamentally
change the competitive landscape, and also to improve the innovative capacity of
designers, particularly those in engineering. To facilitate such synergistic
effects, the skWiki framework designed in this project will be made available as
Open Source. We will also use the tool for teaching engineering design.
