Abstract DBI 9750229 Kimberly L. Schulz This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral
Research Fellowship in Biosciences Related to the Environment for 1997. This
fellowship provides an opportunity for the Fellow to gain additional scientific
training beyond the doctoral degree and to pursue innovative and imaginative
into the fundamental mechanisms underlying the interactions between organisms
and their environment at the molecular, cellular, organismal, population,
community and/or ecosystem level in any area of biology supported by the
Directorate for Biological Sciences of the National Science Foundation. Each
fellowship supports a research and training plan to be carried out in a
sponsoring laboratory. The research and training plan for this fellowship is
entitled "Nutrient inputs to lakes as determinants of the dominate herbivorous
animals in aquatic grazer communities." Laboratory and field mesocosm
experiments on lake zooplankton communities are being conducted to determine how
herbivore communities are structured by nutrient loading, how well the
mechanisms of 3 major hypotheses predict zooplankton community composition, and
the feedbacks to the ecosystem of nutrient recycling by zooplankton communities
under differing loading conditions.
