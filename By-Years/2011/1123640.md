Caviteño is a severely endangered creole language spoken in Cavite City,
Philippines. The language, one of several Philippine Spanish creoles known
collectively as Chabacano, formed as a result of mixture between Spanish and
Tagalog during the colonial period. Chabacano is of particular interest because
Spanish creoles are rare worldwide, and it is the only type of Spanish creole
found in Asia. There has never been a phonetic study of the sound system, or
phonology, of any variety of Chabacano, and little is known about the speakers
of Caviteño or what its structure is like today. The goals of this study are to
describe the phonology of Caviteño, including dialectal variation and
comparisons to the phonology of its parent languages, using phonetic and
sociolinguistic methods. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Doctoral student Ms. Marivic
Lesho (Ohio State University), under the supervision of Dr. Donald Winford, will
conduct fieldwork in Cavite City recording word lists, read speech,
storytelling, interviews, and conversational speech in Caviteño. She will also
conduct ethnographic observation about attitudes toward the creole and its use
in various social domains. The linguistic data will be used to conduct phonetic
analysis and describe the sound patterns of the language, as well as to describe
any dialectal differences found in the creole. The ethnographic data will be
used to determine any social or historical factors that could have caused these
differences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is imperative that Caviteño be recorded
while there are still native speakers. The present study will fill a serious gap
in our knowledge of Chabacano phonology, which in turn will inform the
understanding of the nature of creole phonology in general. To raise awareness
of the language, Lesho will also make a portion of the recordings publicly
available to local institutions and on a website dedicated to Caviteño language,
history, and culture.
