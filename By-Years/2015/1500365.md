While multicore and many core and GPU processors increase computing speed, the
concurrent and parallel programs written for them are increasingly complex, hard
to verify, and difficult to test. So-called "concurrency bugs" are very hard to
find, because of the huge number of thread interleavings that need to be
examined to find the circumstances in which a bug might occur. Techniques for
finding bugs in sequential programs do not scale to concurrent programs,
especially for programs with data inputs and shared memory, which require more
rigor and exhaustive testing. The project will investigate an approach that
combines symbolic execution with a form of schedule exploration to find
efficient solutions. Scalability is pursued by seeking to parallelize the
execution on a cloud platform, which is a step toward a cloud service for
concurrent software testing. There is a dire need for tools capable of doing
scalable and efficient testing of concurrent programs, which will have a high
impact on software quality and correctness if implemented in a widely available
service. This EAGER grant will explore the feasibility of this high-risk,
potentially high-reward approach.
