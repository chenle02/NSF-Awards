The 17th IEEE International Symposium on High Performance Computer Architecture
(HPCA-17) will be held, along with four workshops and five tutorials, in San
Antonio, TX, February 12-16, 2011. HPCA is the premier forum for presenting the
latest research findings on computer architecture and computer design including
microarchitecture, cache and memory system design, parallel-, power-efficient-,
embedded- and reconfigurable computer architectures.

HPCA seeks to increase student participation in symposium and the field. The
proposed funding would support the travel of eligible US students to the
symposium. Recipients would be able to attend the main conference, workshops,
and tutorials. Travel grants will encourage the research interests and the
involvement of students in the field who are not well funded and those who are
just beginning their participation in the field or are interested in entering
it. A special effort will be made to reach out to women and under-represented
minorities.
