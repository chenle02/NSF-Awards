9724723 Lodge This is a planning visit award for Dr. David M. Lodge, of the
Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Notre Dame, to travel to
Kenya to meet with Dr. Kenneth M. Mavuti, of the Department of Zoology at the
University of Nairobi, and Dr. Gerald M. Mkoji, of the Biomedical Sciences
Research Centre at the Kenya Medical Research Institute. The purpose of the
visit is to develop a cooperative research activity to evaluate the impact of
the North American crayfish Procambarus clarkii on the biota of Kenya's
freshwater lakes and wetlands. This species of crayfish was introduced for
aquaculture, but is now being considered as a biological control agent for
freshwater snails that are vectors for schistosomiasis (a major cause of disease
in Africa). This study should add significant new knowledge about the impact an
exotic species of crayfish has had on the local ecosystems in the lakes and
wetlands of Kenya. Funding for this project is being provided jointly by the
Division of International Programs and the Division of Environmental Biology.
