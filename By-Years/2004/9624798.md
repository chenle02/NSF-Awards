9624798 Farmer The CAREER award treats ultra-thin oxides on silicon and ultra-
thin wafer bonding. The former is for the scaling of the CMOS technology in
silicon-based microelectronics, while ultra-thin wafer bonding is applicable to
Silicon on Insulator (SOI) technology. Ultra-thin oxides less than 3.4 nm and
nitrided oxides will be investigated during the program. The educational program
concentrates on a computer-assisted laboratory. ***
