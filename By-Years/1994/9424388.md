Abstract This award is for support for a one year project to analyze dust
samples from the GISP2 ice core to yield information on their possible
continental source areas. The investigators seek to analyze samples from several
climatic periods (pre-Holocene to present) representing both warm and cold
climate extremes. The mineralogy and isotopic composition of the dust will be
studied in order to aid in constraining models of paleo-atmospheric circulation
and dust transport. This study continues, for an additional year, work begun in
a pilot project (OPP-9321910) on the same project.
