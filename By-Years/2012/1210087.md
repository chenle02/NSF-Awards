This action funds HUI-YIING CHANG of Vanderbilt University to conduct a research
project, entitled "The Integrated Sachs-Wolfe Effect in the Viscous Dark Fluid
and the Inflection Point Quintessence Models of the Universe," during the summer
of 2012 at the Institute for the Physics and Mathematics of the Universe at The
University of Tokyo in Kashiwa, Japan. The host scientist is Dr. Shinji
Mukohyama.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is the disclosure of more
information about dark energy, possibly the greatest mystery in physics today.
There is also room for more discovery concerning the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe
Effect as well as the Viscous Dark Fluid and the Inflection Point Quintessence
Models of the Universe.

The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-
hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science,
science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
