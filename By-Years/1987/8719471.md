Dr. Tarek M. Khalil, Chairman of the Department of Industrial Engineering at
the University of Miami, has proposed to hold a workshop immediately after the
International Conference on Technology Management to distill and document the
main messages that will be presented there by an international panel of experts.
The workshop will produce a report synthesizing, critizing and summarizing the
major ideas and discussions that emerge from this conference.
