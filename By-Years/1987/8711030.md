This award will support analytical and numberical studies of eddy-environment
interactions. Past theoretical efforts have concentrated on the evolution of
isolated eddies on a beta plane. This study will examine: 1. The dynamics of
ventilating warm, rings; 2. The interactions of warm rings with western boundary
currents; 3. The interactions of rings and neighboring mesoscale phenomena; 4.
Warm ring interactions, with western meridional boundaries; and, 5. The
structure and dynamics of "thick" eddies. The overall objective is to apply the
novel dynamics being developed by the P.I.'s to clarify the dynamical links
between eddies and the large scale general circulation.
