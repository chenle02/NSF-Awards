The Tech Museum of Innovation will conduct at its facilities in San Jose, CA a
three-year project "Extending Science Education: Teaching With and About
Technology". Twenty middle school and twenty high school science teachers per
year from northern and southern California will work with industry experts and
museum staff to learn about latest innovations and developments, having access
to industry research and development facilities through summer workshop
activities including behind-the-scenes tours and hands-on labs at the Museum
that replicate industry applications useful in biology, computer science,
chemistry, physics, and mathematics taught at participants' schools. "Challenge
activities" based upon these real-world applications will be developed by each
of forty, four-person teams beginning in the two-week summer workshop for the
teacher-participant and then completed and implemented by a team formed by that
teacher with three other teachers of science. They are supported by a mid-year
teleconference of participants, project staff, and industry experts in addition
to at least one half-day coaching visit and "as- needed" consultation by project
staff and industry experts. Dissemination includes each of the 120 participants
receiving the publication of all 120 challenge activities as well as presenting
their projects in person at a spring fair open to all teachers and community
members. Cost sharing by the museum, school districts, and industry accounts for
88.7% of the NSF budget contribution.
