The use of equipment for automated protein sequencing and peptide synthesis has,
in the last few years, become crucial to the progress of research in many areas
of biological science. Determination of the amino acid sequence of a protein is
often a required initial step in the isolation and subsequent sequence analysis
of the gene, or DNA, that encodes the protein. Synthesis of peptides is often an
important step for modern analysis of functional and structural aspects of
proteins and of the regulation of genes. The funds provided by this award will
be used to purchase instruments that perform purification of proteins and
synthetic peptides, and the automated sequencing of proteins. The equipment will
be housed with existing and other new instrumentation in the Central Service
Laboratory, and will be devoted to providing service to approximately 50
researchers on the Oregon State campus. Researchers whose projects are discussed
in the proposal are active in animal, plant and bacterial virology,
neurobiology, cellular biochemistry, enzymology, or biophysics.
