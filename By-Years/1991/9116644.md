Novae explosions result from the sudden "burning" of fresh hydrogen dumped onto
a white dwarf by an orbiting companion. The composition of the nova ejecta is
dominated by heavy elements, reflecting the mass lost by the evolved white dwarf
star. One area in which nova observations has been lacking has been that of the
infrared. The Principal Investigator (PI) will conduct a three year study of
bright nova with a modern detector in the infrared using the Uni- versity of
Wyoming's 2.3-meter infrared telescope. These spectra will permit the study of
fine-structure "coronal" lines as the nova ejecta gas becomes rarefied and as
atoms of several intermediate-mass elements (Al, Ne, Si, Mg) selectively
condense onto dust grains. The PI's observations should provide direct evidence
of this process and provide an understanding of the chemical abundances of this
one important constituent of the dust grains in interstellar space.
