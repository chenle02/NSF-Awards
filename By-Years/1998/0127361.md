Mathematical Sciences (21) This project develops and creates a comprehensive
computer lab manual, which is designed for use in an undergraduate abstract
algebra class. The manual consists of a collection of group projects and student
exercises that help illuminate and illustrate abstract algebra concepts. In
addition, this manual includes exposition providing a context for the exercises
and coherence. Many of the computer projects are designed to lead the student to
specific conjectures about the structure of a group, ring, or field. The
exercises and projects also provide the students and instructor with a rich
source of examples. The computer is used to eliminate some of the need for
computation by hand and allow the students to investigate larger and more
elaborate examples. The manual engages students in an active learning
environment by providing group projects and interaction with technology. An
initial web site appeared in August of 2001. Current teaching resources, which
integrate technology into upper division mathematics courses, are relatively
limited. This manual provides such a resource for the area of abstract algebra.
