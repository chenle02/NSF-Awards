This project will address the development of a class of novel and very efficient
numerical methods for incompressible flows based on a reformulation of the
Navier-Stokes equations that has been proved well-posed and provides boundary
conditions for the viscous contribution to pressure in terms of vorticity
circulation. The main insight is that the total creation of boundary vorticity
can be computed exactly by a commutator between the Laplacian and
Helmholtzprojection operators. Moreover, this term is dominated by the viscosity
term, hence we can treat it explicitly to gain efficiency and stability. The
major advance is that the method can be formulated in standard continuous finite
element space, and there is no compatibility condition needed for the velocity
and pressure approximation spaces. Hence the standard fast solver can be applied
to Navier-Stokes equation directly.

Accurate, efficient simulations of 3D flows in complicated domain are still
major challeges for many scientific and engineering problems. The resolution of
the flows near physical boundaries is essential to the accurate prediction of
the body force such as the lift and drag, shedding of vortex and boundary layer
separation. The success of this project will have an important impact on many
branches of science and engineering. It will give more accurate predictions of
body force which will result in better energy efficiency for transportation
related applications. It will provide fast and reliable simulations for
scientific research and engineering application.
