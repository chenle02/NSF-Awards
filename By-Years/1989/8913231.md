Small aggregates of molecules often have properties unique and different from
their respective isolated molecules or bulk phase. The simplest aggregate is the
two molecule complex or dimer. Low concentrations of dimers are expected in the
atmosphere, but their numbers may be sufficient to influence certain atmospheric
chemical processes. Little is known about the properties of dimers containing
species of atmospheric relevance. The project will explore the hypothesis that
the photolysis of weakly bound molecular dimers may be an important source for
some atmospheric species. The study will use both conventional methods in which
quantum yields are measured for photolysis of gas mixtures at a variety of
partial pressures and temperatures and the method of supersonic jet expansion
with Fourier Transform spectroscopy and multiphoton ionization coupled with mass
spectrometric detection. This approach will obtain fundamental physical
parameters such as shifts in absorption spectra, absorption cross-sections,
dimer binding energies, and entropies of formation. The data obtained will be
directly applicable to computer models of atmospheric chemistry.
