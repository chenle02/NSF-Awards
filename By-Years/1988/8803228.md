John Smillie will carry out research into the dynamics of polynomial
diffeomorphisms. This research belongs to the study of chaos. Smillie will study
the Henon family of transformations. These are two dimensional diffeomorphisms
of importance because of the fractal nature of their invariant sets. Smillie
will study the topological, differential and measure theoretic invariants of
these maps. The questions will involve entropy, criteria for hyperbolicity,
invariant measures and Lyapunov exponents.
