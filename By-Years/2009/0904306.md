This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). In this RUI project funded by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic,
and Organometallic Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Keith Walters of
Northern Kentucky University will develop and assemble molecular building blocks
for supramolecular structures that exhibit charge transfer when irradiated with
light. The PI will design and synthesize linkers to assemble fullerenes,
conjugated polymers, and metal centers into various types of structures. The PI
will use spectroscopic methods to examine the photophysical properties of these
assemblies. The proposed systems should provide fundamental insights into charge
transfer processes in new structural motifs which, in turn, could impact
technologies such as solar cells and molecular electronics. The PI will
incorporate many aspects of this research into the chemistry curriculum at
Northern Kentucky University and will develop National Chemistry Week
presentations for the general public.
