The main objects of investigation of this project are weak Hopf algebras (also
called quantum groupoids in literature). These are group-like objects that
generalize both Hopf algebras and usual groupoids and that appear naturally in
the theory of semisimple tensor rigid (fusion) categories, conformal field
theory, symmetries of algebra extensions, and the quantum dynamical Yang-Baxter
equation. The investigator develops the general theory of weak Hopf algebras and
their representations and applies it to the study and classification of fusion
categories (every such a category is equaivalent to the representation category
of a semisimple weak Hopf algebra). One goal is to extend the results known for
the representation categories of ordinary semisimple Hopf algebras, such as
e.g., Larson-Radford theorems, Stefan's finiteness result (Ocneanu's rigidity),
and Class Equation to general semisimple tensor categories. Another goal is to
use weak Hopf algebra techniques to reveal the structure of modular categories
which are important because of their applications to physics and geometry. The
investigator also studies weak Hopf algebras arising from dynamical twists
(these twists give rise to solutions of the quantum dynamical Yang-Baxter
equation of Felder). The goal here is to get a conceptual explanation of new
intriguing phenomena related to dynamical twists, such as, e.g., non-minimizable
dynamical twists in group algebras and self-duality of dynamical quantum groups.

In this proposal the investigator studies problems of the theory of quantum
groups. The origins of this theory which was created in 1980s are the classical
theory of groups and quantum physics. The theory of groups is the classical
mathematical subject that describes in mathematical terms the phenomenon of
symmetry (e.g., groups describe the symmetry of molecular structure). Groups are
fundamental objects as they provide a universal language used in all areas of
mathematics. The quantum theory reveals the laws of physics that determine the
behavior of very small particles and interactions between them. This theory led
to many technological advances of the 20th century such as, e.g., development of
the nuclear physics. In order to give an adequate mathematical description of
the structure of quantum physical systems the theory of classical groups is not
sufficient, this is why the new theory of quantum groups was invented. Among
these new objects the notions of weak Hopf algebras and quantum groupoids are of
special interest, as they have recently seen many applications on both sides of
the mathematics-physics divide. The present proposal is devoted to the study and
classification of weak Hopf algebras and exploring their applications to various
areas of mathematics and physics.
