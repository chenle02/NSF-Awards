Plant defenses against herbivory can be divided into two types of traits. Some
traits influence the likelihood that herbivores will settle on and consume the
plant, and are called resistance. Other traits affect physiological adjustments
to mitigate the adverse effects of damage, and are called tolerance. The effects
of defense traits on plant fitness will not be static, but vary as herbivore
population densities wax and wane. Theoretically, selection on plant defense can
be analyzed as selection on reaction norms for the defensive components. To test
this theory experiments to determine, (1) How the contributions of resistance
and tolerance to plant fitness vary with herbivore density, and, (2) whether
there are trade-offs between resistance and tolerance that vary with herbivore
density are proposed. This investigation will use the native weed, goldenrod
(Solidago altissima). Genotypic replicates will be planted in plots where
herbivore population density or infestation levels are manipulated. The results
will reveal the sensitivity of selection on defense components to herbivore
population density. Insights gained in this study can help in designing
biological control programs for weeds, and breeding programs for crop resistance
to insects.
