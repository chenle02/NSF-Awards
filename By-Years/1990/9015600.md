The research, in the general area of Analytical and Surface Chemistry, focuses
on surface chemistry. The work promises to lead to an understanding of the
mechanisms by which the energy of a photon or electron is converted to
electronic excitation that leads to bond breaking whithin chemical species
attached to a metal surface. Such experiments improve our understanding of
surface chemistry which can lead to better catalysts and thus cheaper and better
chemical products. Metals such as platinum and silver will be used as substrates
and alkyl halides used as model systems for species attached to these
substrates. Photon-induced reactions among coadsorbed species (such as oxygen
and ethylene) will be examined, as will the effect of laser-induced desorption
of chemisorbed species on the metal surface.
