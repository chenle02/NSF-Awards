The Virginia Tech Summer Experience for Undergraduates in Mathematical Models
of Elastic Materials will concentrate on mathematical problems in material
science. A broad segment of Virginia Tech's mathematics faculty is involved in
research on this subject and that involvement has generated strong research ties
to other departments and to industry. The subject is ideal for introducing
undergraduates to mathematical research because it applies a wide range of
mathematical disciplines to a readily understandable physical setting.
Furthermore, it uses foundational undergraduate mathematical techniques in new
and challenging ways while pointing to more advanced techniques needed for a
deeper understanding. The program will introduce undergraduate students to the
mathematical fundamentals of materials science, expose them to a broad variety
of mathematical techniques and applications, and guide them in individual and
group projects. The following are key components of the program. 1. The program
will feature a broad mathematical approach that will expose students to
applications of partial differential equations, group theory, and scientific
computing. 2. The program will have a strong interdisciplinary component that
will expose the students to ideas and language of engineers, geologists, and
computer scientists. 3. The program will have a strong industrial component that
will expose students to the applications of mathematics in industry and
government labs. 4. The program will use its interdisciplinary nature to help
students focus on careers in mathematics and the sciences. 5. The program will
use distance learning via the internet and teleconferencing to build a team
environment among the undergraduate researchers and to help build the
foundational skills needed for success in the intensive six-week on-campus
session.
