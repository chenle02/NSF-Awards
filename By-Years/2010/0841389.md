This project creates and evaluates new visualization techniques of models from a
concept generator to stimulate the designer to generate concepts not originally
posed by designer or computer. This technology is expected to enable the
development of creative solutions to design problems that would otherwise go
undiscovered. The three challenges to achieving effective visualization for
enhancing creative design at the concept generation phase are: 1) how to cluster
the many concept variants returned from an automated concept generation
algorithm into a manageable set of representative concepts that spans the design
alternative space; 2) how to visually represent the option space to the designer
so that it enhances creativity; and 3) how to measure the impact of the
visualization schemes on designer creativity. This exploratory research, if
successful, offers the opportunity to transform how we design products and
systems and how we guide any designer to a creative new product.
