AST-0407343&lt;br/&gt;Dressler&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a very large-scale
study of the evolution of galaxies in the environs of clusters, in order to
understand the mechanisms by which galaxy evolution is affected by environment.
This program is extremely aggressive, in depth and breadth, and will provide
enough data of sufficiently high quality to answer important questions about
galaxy evolution. As a complement, sophisticated numerical models will identify
the particular environments hosting galaxies that will eventually end in various
parts of the formed cluster. Observing galaxies in the succession of loci at
different redshifts effectively simulates the impossible task of following the
evolution of an individual galaxy through cosmic time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
research will be communicated to a broad audience through public lectures,
magazine articles, and radio and television programs. The Carnegie Observatories
are also embarked on an ambitious program of educational outreach, particularly
focused on the disadvantaged minority population of its immediate community.
This includes a public lecture series, targeted to the entire community but with
associated events for local school children, work with the neighborhood
elementary school, and a summer school for minority high school students.
