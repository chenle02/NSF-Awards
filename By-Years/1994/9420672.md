9420672 Lee This award provides partial support for the acquisition of a
superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer (specifically a
Quantum Design MPMS-7). This inqtrument will greatly enhance the ongoing work of
several research groups probing the magnetic response of advanced materials and
novel solid-state structures at moderate to low temperatures. These research
projects focus on the thorough characterization of advanced metallic and non-
metallic materials which display both uncorrelated and ordered magnetic moments,
and on the development of magnetic order in small metallic clusters. It is
anticipated that in many cases of interest the total mass of the sample will be
very small, making necessary the unparalleled high sensitivity of a SQUID
magnetometer. %%% Regular use of the magnetometer will be divided among five
principal investigators: M. Lee, who will be the instrument manager, S. J. Poon,
B. Shivaram, L. Bloomfield all of the Physics Department, and R. N. Grimes of
the Chemistry Department. In addition, a number of incidental users of the
instrument from physics, chemistry, materials science, and electrical enineering
are anticipated, since no comparable facility exists on thc UVa. campus. ***
