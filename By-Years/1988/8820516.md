The mathematical foundations of programming semantics involves the application
of such areas as formal logic, abstract algebra, domain theory, lattice theory,
topology and category theory to formal modeling and reasoning about programs.
This award provides partial support for the fifth in a series of workshops on
this subject, with the goal of bringing together computer scientists and
mathematicians in this area. The previous workshops have been distinguished by
the breadth of interests of the participants and by the high-level of
interaction which has taken place between researchers representing the diverse
areas mentioned. The proposed workshop includes three types of formal
activities: (1) invited talks by six leading researchers, (2) shorter
presentations of refereed papers, and (3) seminars on research directions. In
addition, it is expected that the proceedings of the workshop will be published
as a volume in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science, as was the case with the
1st and 3rd workshops.
