This award supports cooperative research in applied mathematics to be conducted
by Tadeusz Balaban of Boston University and Ricardo Schor and Michael O'Carroll
of the physics department of the Federal University of Minas Gerais in Belo
Horizonte, Brazil. The problem is the ultraviolet stability of three-
dimensional spinor quantum electrodynamics and the application of
renormalization group methods to low temperature classical spin models, such as
the Heisenberg model. These researchers have been working on infrared properties
of small perturbation models of the free lattice electromagnetic field and a
renormalization group approach to spinor electrodynamics. In the first case they
have proved the infrared asymptotic freedom for these models and have recently
published the results. For the second problem, the two-dimensional model of
spinor electrodynamics is well known but the three- dimensional model is a much
more difficult problem. They have started work on the latter case using the
renormalization group approach. This award will support this new work in which
the ultraviolet stability will be investigated, first for two-dimensional
classical spin models and then, after modifications, for the three-dimensional
case thus extending a successful and productive preliminary collaboration.
