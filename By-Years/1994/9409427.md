9409427 Bennett This research examines multivariate decision tree induction as a
mathematical program solved in serial or parallel. Depending on the splitting
criterion or objective function minimized, the problem of constructing each
decision node in the tree is a linear, piecewise-quadratic, bilinear, or
multilinear program. Unlike previous perceptron-type and randomized algorithms,
the proposed mathematical programs exactly characterize an optimal solution of
the decision node problem. A new splitting criterion, subtree optimization, is
proposed. Subtree optimization differs from previous greedy decision tree
algorithms in that it explicitly considers all subsequent decisions when
constructing the current decision node. Subtree optimization can be used to
generate a globally optimal tree with a fixed topology. The goals of this work
are to create better decision tree algorithms, gain a better mathematical
understanding of the bias of splitting criteria, develop new mathematical
programming theory and techniques for solving these problems, and implement and
test these algorithms on serial and parallel computers.
