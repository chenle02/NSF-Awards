9503764 Loretz This award supports the collaboration of Dr. Christopher Loretz,
Department of Biological Sciences, the State University of New York at Buffalo
and Drs. Tetsuya Hirano and Yoshio Takei at the Ocean Research Institute of the
University of Tokyo. Project funding will enable Dr. Loretz to spend four months
in Japan, resident at the Ocean Research Institute, in order to study the
structure/activity and evolutionary relationships of a hormone family, the
natriuretic peptides. This proposal brings together research scientists from two
countries working in the area of fish endocrinology and physiology. The project
provides a unique opportunity to bring together the electrophysiological
expertise of Dr. Loretz with the biochemical and endocrinological expertise of
Drs. Hirano and Takei on the characterization of natriuretic peptides(s) from a
fish, the euryhaline goby Gillichthys mirabilis. The U. S. scientist will have
the opportunity to become familiar with research techniques, data, equipment,
and facilities at the Ocean Research Institute while contributing to the overall
research effort. Therefore, this proposal fulfills the objectives of the Program
in its exchange and transfer of scientific knowledge through an international
collaboration. ***
