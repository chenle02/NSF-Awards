The vast library of underway geophysical data stored at the National Geophysical
Data Center represents the collective investment by taxpayers and scientists
measured in decades and billions of dollars. It is vital that such data not only
be archived but be subject to rigorous quality assessment and corrections. The
PI will develop the necessary tools and procedures for both along-track and
across-track analysis of crossover errors. The PI will collaborate with the Data
Center and its users to ensure the procedures are broadly implemented. A global
database of gravity, magnetics and bathymetry crossover errors will be assembled
and web-based access to the database will be provided.&lt;br/&gt;
