The principal investigators will study high-grade metamorphic rocks in the
People's Republic of China in collaboration with scientists from the University
of California at Santa Barbara, the Academia Sinica of Peking University and the
Provincial Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources from Hubei and Anhui. The
objectives are to map several metamorphic belts in central China, to thoroughly
study the mineralogy of the high-pressure rocks there, to delineate mineral
parageneses and the pressure-temperature-time paths of the rocks, to establish
geologic ages for the several critical rock units, and to relate these to
igneous and tectonic features. The study will lead to a better understanding of
how continental crust was subducted to mantle depths, and later exhumed.
