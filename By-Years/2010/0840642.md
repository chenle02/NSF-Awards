The Quantitative Social Science Digital Library (QSSDL) Pathway provides a
portal to materials and modules that integrate quantitative analysis with the
teaching of the social sciences. QSSDL is a partnership of the Interuniversity
Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) and the Social Science Data
Analysis Network, both at the University of Michigan, and the American
Sociological Association, the American Political Science Association, and the
Association of American Geographers. Quantitative analysis has long played a key
role in social science research. Influential voices have been calling for ways
make data analysis a staple feature in a large variety of courses in the social
sciences, including introductory courses. This pathway is designed to help
instructors find high quality teaching materials and datasets for student
exercises and research. It is building on the rapid acceleration in the
availability of data, the creation of new educational tools, and growing
interest by instructors in making innovative use of digital resources for
instruction. The integration of this social science pathway into the portfolio
of NSDL Pathway projects adds a new resource to the existing networked
infrastructure of repositories and professional associations. Experts in the
Science Education Resource Center (SERC) at Carleton College are providing
pedagogical, assessment, and evaluation services. In particular, SERC is
conducting evaluations that include pre- and post-intervention assessments of
faculty use of QSSDL resources on ten selected campuses, and QSSDL teaching
materials are being linked to the "Pedagogy in Action" server at SERC. The QSSDL
Pathway helps individuals who create resources by providing archiving and
preservation services for those lacking adequate institutional support. This
project also builds on ICPSR's long and successful model of sustainability,
which is based on a diverse portfolio of memberships held by colleges and
universities, research grants, and contracts.
