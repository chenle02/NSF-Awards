This project is developing a comprehensive strategic plan for the design of a
regional Agriculture Education and Technology Center (AETC) to develop and
disseminate science, technology and pedagogical resources for secondary and
post-secondary educators. Current work with faculty in post-secondary
agriculture education programs throughout California is being leveraged for this
project. Programs in five neighboring states (Nevada, Arizona, Oregon, Idaho,
and Washington) are being explored to determine the geographic area that will
best be served by a regional agriculture center on the West Coast. The project
is: 1) Assessing the strengths and needs of community college and university
agriculture education programs in delivering pre-service and in-service
preparation for agriculture teachers within the region; 2) Developing plans for
core center activities that support agriculture programs and agriculture science
and technology instructors; and 3) Developing a research agenda for agriculture
graduate students to conduct in-depth studies of issues pertinent to agriculture
educators. Special attention is given to pedagogy and support for students,
including minorities, who have not typically pursued Agriculture Education as a
career. Finally, the essential community college link between high school and
university education is strengthened through the creation of a collaborative,
centralized regional center.
