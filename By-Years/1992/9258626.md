Funds are provided for a 5-year Young Investigator award to SARAH KRUSE, a
geophysicists whose central interest is in the mechanical properties of the
Earth's crust. Her present and future work concentrates upon fracture zones, the
large faults in the ocean's crust. She has found that the occurrence of high
heat flow from volcanism is associated with weakening of fracture zones and is
exploring data on the distribution of stress in order to determine whether the
volcanism causes the weakening, or whether pre-existing weak zones permit an
increase in the volcanism. Other work includes variations in morphology of some
Pacific fracture zones, modeling of continental deformation in the Colorado
plateau, and tectonics of the Adriatic Sea. In teaching she makes an active
effort to bring more understanding of physics to other sciences, and plans to
develop two field courses in geophysics. She also plans to have all senior
students participate in research projects as part of a required seminar course.
