With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program, Professor
Victoria Moore from Elon University and colleagues Karl Sienerth and Kathryn
Matera will acquire a multimode quad-monochromator plate reader
spectrophotometer. The proposal is aimed at enhancing research training and
education, especially in areas such as (a) peptide aggregates; (b) protein-
protein binding; (c) biochemical changes to mitochondria during apoptosis; and
(d) quantitative measurements of environmental and explosive
compounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide a multimode
spectrophotometer to make absorbance, fluorescence and luminescence measurements
on various samples. These are standard spectroscopy techniques used to assay
small volumes of solutions in chemistry and biochemistry. Reactions can be
followed and quantities of materials determined. This acquisition will provide a
basic instrument for current biochemistry and chemistry research by faculty and
undergraduate students. Students will be trained to use the most up-to-date
assays and technologies which they will encounter after graduation.
