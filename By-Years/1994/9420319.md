9420319 Feeny Most plant-feeding insects have specialized preferences, feeding
and laying their eggs on only a few plant species. They find their host plants
largely by smell or taste of chemical compounds produced by the plant. Different
plant species attacked by the same insect often share one or more kinds of
unusual chemical compounds, even when the host plants themselves are not closely
related to one another. This suggests that the ability of insects to add new
plant species to their diet is facilitated by the shared occurrence of compounds
that the insects use for cues. The goal of this research is to find out how
chemical similarities and differences among plants have influenced present-day
associations between different plant species and the insects that feed on them.
The swallowtail butterflies are used as a model system in this research since
their evolutionary relationships and larval host plants are especially well
known. The research will identify the mixtures of plant compounds used as egg-
laying stimulants by four insect species that differ greatly in the kinds of
plants they attack. The data will be used to test the hypotheses that plant
selection by insects is triggered by relatively fixed sensory responses to
particular compounds, and that movements to new host species are unlikely unless
those species produce the same compounds. The results will provide valuable
insights into the degree to which sensory responses by insects to plant
chemicals are conservative rather than labile over evolutionary time. Knowledge
of both the cues insects currently use to locate host plants and the frequency
with which insects abandon those cues to take advantage of new hosts has obvious
implications for the wise deployment of new crop varieties whose chemical
profiles have been or can be modified by genetic engineering.
