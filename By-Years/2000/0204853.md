Radiative feedback from massive stars is energetically fundamental to galaxy and
cosmic evolution, and it also provides essential emission-line diagnostics of
conditions both locally and in the distant universe. Our current limited
understanding of radiative feedback greatly hampers investigations of present-
day local processes as well as of galaxy formation and the early universe. Dr.
Sally Oey, at Lowell Observatory, will carry out a comprehensive investigation
of radiative feedback processes ranging from specific nebular ionization
conditions to large-scale, global ionization processes in galaxies and the
intergalactic medium. The goals are: 1) To understand specifically how ionizing
spectral types and chemical abundances affect nebular emission, and to calibrate
corresponding nebular line diagnostics; and 2) to understand global radiative
feedback processes in galaxies by investigating large-scale properties of
diffuse ionized gas, HII region populations, and implications for the escape of
ionizing photons from galaxies. ***
