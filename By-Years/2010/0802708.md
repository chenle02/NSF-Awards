This project will construct an empirical model of the diffuse aurora using data
from the DMSP satellites. By utilizing the DMSP data it is possible to clearly
differentiate the diffuse aurora and discrete aurora. This can be done in an
automated fashion, allowing the complete DMSP particle precipitation database to
be used. The DMSP data will also allow separate models of the southern and
northern hemispheres to be constructed and to examine the nature of the diffuse
aurora both under solar illumination and in darkness. The coupling function
developed under previous NSF support will be utilized as an optimal parameter
for describing the coupling between the solar wind interplanetary magnetic field
and the magnetosphere. An additional coupling function will estimate the viscous
coupling term that does not depend on the interplanetary magnetic field. The
resulting model is expected to account for better than 2/3 of the variance in
the data. Among the open scientific questions that this project will address is
the role of UV insolation on diffuse auroral particle precipitation. The
resulting models will be distributed to the public through a web site.
