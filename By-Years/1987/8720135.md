The question of nurture versus nature in the development of behavior, and the
mechanisms through which early experience influences neural development has been
a running theme while researchers have tried to understand human behavior. Dr.
Gregory Lnenicka is studying the degree to which the properties of nerve cell
interconnections are determined by experience during postnatal development. He
is studying this in an identified neuromuscular junction preparation. The
relative simplicity of this system allows the activity of the synapses to be
precisely altered for weeks, and subsequent changes in the synapses to be
directly measured. The extent to which electrical activity influences the
development of synapses will be explored using light and electron microscopy,
and intracellular recording. This research will also examine the mechanisms
involved in translating changes in electrical activity into changes in
morphology and physiology including: the role of protein synthesis; the
involvement of changes in ionic currents; and the location of the electrical
changes in the cell which are effective in triggering the response. This work is
important as Dr. Lnenicka attempts to unravel the intricate mechanisms
underlying the development of human behavior.
