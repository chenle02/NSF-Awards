Recent work has shown major similarities across a wide range of organisms in
the biochemical mechanisms for olfactory reception. The fruit fly, Drosophila,
provides an excellent model system for study because of its accessibility for
genetics, molecular analysis, behavior, and even some physiology. This project
combines these techniques to address the molecular basis for olfactory
sensitivity. Modern genetic technology and methodology is used to isolate
particular mutant strains of Drosophila that show particular olfactory
sensitivity or loss. These mutants allow identification of particular genes by
the pattern of proteins that are expressed. Genes that are expressed
specifically in olfactory tissue during development will be characterized, and
their expression or deletion correlated to specific kinds of olfactory behavior.
One of these genes apparently is expressed differently in males and females,
suggesting an important role in mate recognition or other important reproductive
behavior. Results will be important for understanding the mechanisms of
olfactory reception at the fundamental level of molecular genetics, and will
have a broader impact as well on sensory neuroscience and on genetics, with
potential applications including pest control.
