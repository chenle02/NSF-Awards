The Georgia Institute of Technology, in collaboration with Morehouse College and
the Georgia Computes! BPC Alliance, proposes the creation of the Tester to
Techie (TtT) program to engage low-income African American youth in computing.
The program will leverage teenage boys? love of video games to encourage their
participation in computing education and to introduce them to technical careers.
It will offer teens an apprenticeship as game testers, providing them with an
authentic experience beta testing games for real game companies. In addition, it
will provide them with a contextualized computing curriculum focused on games
and game testing. The program will introduce them to the game industry, not to
create future game testers, but to exploit their interest in video games, so
that they can look inside the black box of the games to see the power and
potential of computation.
