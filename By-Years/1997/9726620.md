This award supports Drs. Carol Haney, Dale Sayers, Dean Hesterberg and a
graduate student from the North Carolina State University in a collaboration
with Norbert Stoll of the Department of Automation Engineering at the University
of Rostock. The collaboration brings together the complementary capabilities of
the German and U.S. groups to develop methods for the extraction, preparation,
and analysis of soil and water samples containing arsenic. The samples will be
collected from a World War II chemical weapons manufacture site in the eastern
part of Germany. Preliminary indications are that the site has significant
contamination from both organic and inorganic arsenic compounds. The goals of
the research are a complete characterization of the arsenic-containing compounds
at the site, determination of the mechanisms by which organic arsenic compounds
are transformed into inorganic compounds in different locations and soil types,
and development of remediation techniques. Analytical methods to be used are gas
chromatography, high-pressure liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry, and x-ray
absorption spectroscopy.
