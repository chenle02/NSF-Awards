Microscopic, photosynthetic plankton are responsible for a significant portion
on the primary productivity in low nutrient ocean waters. However, these
ultraplankton which are present are poorly characterized. Algae cultured from
these populations may not be representative of the actual dominant organisms.
Attempts at describing the structure of deep-water communities by high
performance liquid chromatography, flow cytometry, and electron microscopy have
provided some important information, but suffer from quantitative and/or
qualitative problems. This project plans to develop a different method to
address the problem of identifying and quantifying photosynthetic ultraplankton
by ribosomal RNA-based oligonucleotide probes. Short strands of oligonucleotides
(radiolabelled or fluorescent) which hybridize to specific ribosomal-RNA
sequences will be synthesized. Because of the abundance of rRNA in cells, these
oligonucleotides can be used to probe mixed populations of whole cells. Probes
specific for certain orders of green algae (especially the Mamiellales, which
are known to be related to some small coccoid phytoplankton) will be produced
and tested with a number of coccoid and flagellate algae. These probes should
allow the enumeration of algae belonging to specific orders in field samples.
