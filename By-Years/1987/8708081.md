During the past few years, considerable national attention has focussed on
problems of ground water contamination. The purpose of this project is to study
of the methodologies available for simulating the transport and environmental
fate of contaminants in ground water. The study will be conducted by a committee
of approximately 10 experts. The report is envisioned to be a constructive
contribution to the literature, forming the blueprint for research and
development of future models. This is a multi-agency project. NSF participation
is to generate new knowledge in the area of contaminated ground water modelling.
