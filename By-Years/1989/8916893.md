Trace element and Rare Earth Element chemistry of hot spring fluids in mid-
ocean ridges depends upon two factors: 1) the composition of the host rock
through which these fluids flow; and 2) the chemical exchanges that occur
between the rocks and the fluids. However, for these elements to be useful in
gaining understanding of either rock composition or chemical alterations that
occur in sub-seafloor hydrothermal systems, much has yet to be learned about
mineral-fluid equilibria under in situ conditions. The Drs. Seyfried and Berndt
will conduct lab experiments that duplicate the temperature, pressure, mineral
and fluid conditions thought to exist within mid-ocean ridges. The goal is to
gain a quantitative understanding of the thermodynamic basis for the
distribution of trace elements and Rare Earth Elements between minerals and
hydrothermal fluids. Most of the work will be conducted at the Univ. of
Minnesota, but special techniques involving REE analysis is sub-contracted to
Dr. Klinkhammer who will do the work at MIT.
