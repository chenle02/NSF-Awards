9507061 Hoffman Multifrequency advanced paramagnetic resonance (amr)
spectroscopy will be used to characterize the catalytic centers of multi-
metallic enzymes as part of a multidisciplinary effort that involves
biochemists, molecular biologists, and microbiologists. This research, which
will utilize a unique capacity to employ CW and pulsed electron-nuclear double
resonance (endor)and electrol spin-echo envelope modulation (eseem) techniques
at both X and Q Bands, involves a number of protein systems, emphasizing three
areas: (I) Binuclear non-heme iron centers and amr of non-Kramers (NK) doublets
of integer-spin systems (nk-amr); (II) The nitrogenase MoFe protein; (III)
Enzymes from hyperthermophiles. %%% AMR methods provide detailed analytical,
structural, and electronic information about the catalytic sites of
metalloenzymes, and thus play a vital role in characterizing their mechanisms of
function. It is of course necessary to obtain this information because
metalloenzymes play key roles in biological processes. However, this effort is
acquiring increasing significance because of the growing importance of such
enzymes in industry and biotechnology (eg., nitrile hydratase, a nonheme Fe
enzyme is used to convert acrylonitrile to acrylamide), in agriculture
(nitrogenase is the enzyme that fixes nitrogen in nature), and in efforts at
bioremediation of toxic wastes (eg., oxygenases). ***
