9731073&lt;br/&gt;Relue&lt;br/&gt;The Department of Bioengineering at the
University of Toledo will purchase a flow cytofluorimetry system that will be
dedicated to support research in engineering. Flow cytometry is now a standard
technique in cellular engineering and the need for this equipment is both
immediate and long-term for support of the Department. The equipment will be
used for several projects, including in particular: the identification and
characterization of cells involved in neovascularization of bioartificial
organs, the quantification of genetic variations within a tumor cell population
treated with photodynamic therapy, the study of the control of gene expression
in bacteria, and the investigation of the effects of osmotic stress on antibody
production in hybridomas.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
