The PI requests funding for The Third International Conference on the Effects of
Noise on Aquatic Life will take place in Budapest, Hungary, August 11-16, 2013.
This meeting follows two successful meetings in Nyborg (2007) and Cork (2010),
both of which NSF provided partial support. The major goal of the conference
will be to define the current state of knowledge on the impact of underwater
noise and, in particular, explore the progress made in this field in the three
years since the second Conference. The third Conference will place strong
emphasis on recent research results, the sharing of ideas, discussion of
experimental approaches, and analysis of regulatory
issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting
should help shape future research and understanding of effects of noise on
aquatic life. Based on experience from the earlier meetings, the interactions
and networking that took place has resulted in new collaborations between
investigators, a broader understanding of the science that can be used in their
work by regulators, a better understanding of regulatory issues by scientists
and industry, and substantial cross-fertilization of experimental design and
approaches by investigators.
