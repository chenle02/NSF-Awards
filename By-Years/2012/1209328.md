This action funds Jessica Lundin of University of Washington to conduct a
research project, entitled "Improving Greenland ice-core chronologies," during
the summer of 2012 at University of Hokkaido in Hokkaido. The host scientist is
Professor Ralf Greve.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to improve the chronology of
the Greenland Ice-sheet Project (GISP2) ice core. An accurate chronology is
necessary to make accurate inferences about the past climate, including changes
in temperature, precipitation, and atmospheric composition.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
