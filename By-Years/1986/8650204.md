The Engineering and Technology Division will purchase single-board computers,
interface boards, and a development system for use in teaching digital signal
processing. The TMS 32010 Evaluation Module will be used in conjunction with the
Analog Interface Board to perform several experiments and projects in digital
filtering and spectral analysis. Finite and infinite impulse response filters
(low pass, high pass, band pass and band stop) as well as fast Fourier
transforms will be used. The senior project course will provide a medium for
many students to apply the techniques of digital signal processing, in
particular in the areas of communication and control, speech, and image
enhancement. Such a project will offer the senior students hands-on experiences
and a more comprehensive understanding of new technologies.
