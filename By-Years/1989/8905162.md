A program of experimental electromagnetic nuclear physics using intermediate
energy electrons and photons will be carried out using the MIT/Bates linac, the
Saskatchewan Accelerators Laboratory (SAL) cw linac/pulse stretcher ring, and
the BNL/LEGS monoenergetic and polarized high energy photon beam. The major
experiments include: (1) photopion reaction work aimed at studying the
properties of deltas in nuclei ?MIT and SAL!, (2) electron scattering from
correlated pairs in helium-3 ?MIT!, and (3) photodisintegration of helium-3
studying 2-body absorption mechanisms ?BNL/LEGS!. Design and development of
detectors for proposed experiments at CEBAF, SLAC/PEGASUS, and the MIT/Bates
upgrade project will carried out.
