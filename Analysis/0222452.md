ABSTRACT

PIs: Douglas Lind and Selim Tuncel Proposal: DMS-0222452 Institution: University
of Washington



This proposal requests funding for a Concentration Year in Dynamical Systems at
the University of Washington. A major focus of activity will be a collaborative
effort to solve the Furstenberg Conjecture, a central problem in dynamics.
Participants in the program will include a mix of long-term participants,
including regular faculty, visiting faculty, post-docs, and graduate students at
the University of Washington, and short-term visitors.

NSF funds will be used to support graduate student travel to conference and
workshops and six junior short terms visitors.
