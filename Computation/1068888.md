The investigator and his colleagues organize a workshop on Computational and
Analytical Mathematics that features the topics of Variational Analysis,
Optimization Algorithms, High Performance Computing, Number Theory, and
Experimental Mathematics, all of which are very active areas of mathematical
research. The objectives of this workshop are to chart promising research
directions in these areas, to survey the state-of-the-art of theory and
practice, to identify emerging problems driven by applications, and to discuss
new approaches for solving these problems. The blend of topics of the workshop
provides a unique opportunity for participants in these areas of research to
meet as a group, and the workshop solicits participants at all stages of their
careers --- from students to international leaders in their disciplines. The
workshop participants explore how new methodology from variational analysis has
surprising fundamental consequence in economics; in particular, concerning the
existence of stable solutions the theory of economics. Another topic explored at
the workshop is the use of variational methods in financial trading. The
participants also present the state of the art on using the computer to generate
and prove mathematical identities and formulas. This type of tool provides
scientists with a dynamic reference source for the sort mathematics often used
in scientific calculations and applications. The workshop participants also
study applications of optimization in image reconstruction which related to
medical imaging technology such as MRIs. Another intriguing topic of the
workshop is the exploration of the fractal distribution of brain synapses and
how fractals can be used to model real-world laboratory situations of this kind.
All presentations from the workshop are streamed live over the internet and
videos of those presentations are archived permanently at the conference
website.
