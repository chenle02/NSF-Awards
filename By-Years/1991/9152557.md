Colorimetry, central to the color-using industries, is taught at few
institutions, especially as it relates to textile coloration. Teaching requires
the use of a colorimetric system, and this project helps keep the teaching of
colorimetry current and expand it to a wider audience. It also allows the
integration of the department's computer-aided fabric design and manufacture
facility with the color measuring and producing technology. This allows the
demonstration of a complete production sequence from design to final fabric. In
addition, the complete colorimetric system affects a course, "Color", for non-
science majors in that it doubles the audience for this course, and makes the
teaching more effective.
