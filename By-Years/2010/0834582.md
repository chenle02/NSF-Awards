Abstract for Dr Alyssa Apsel&lt;br/&gt;An integrated low power radio transceiver
combined with a backend processor in a single networkable node enables
applications that are not possible with traditional sensor node platforms. If
such a node can be mass produced in a CMOS process without a costly external
crystal such that the network formed by a set of homogenous nodes is robust to
network changes or any node failing, then reliable ad-hoc networks may be formed
from sets of these nodes with group intelligence akin to a distributed machine.
This project focuses on the development and exploitation of a distributed
computing machine formed out of a network of integrated single chip microsystems
that combine both communication and computation functions with a total power
budget that is under 50Ã¬W. Low power performance, critical to long lifetimes is
achieved through duty cycling of the transceiver and establishment of a global
clock via natural phenomenon of pulse coupled oscillators (PCOs) as well as the
use of simple event driven computation. Although each node has limited computing
capability, the power of such a network will arise from aggregate capabilities
to perform distributed computing tasks. This project explores three issues; the
construction of the network from simple nodes, communication within the network,
and the computing potential for such a constrained platform. The final goal of
this work is to develop a complete network with computing models and primitives
capable of exploiting the network?s unique features.
