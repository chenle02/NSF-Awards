9312098 Glimm This award support three industrial postdoctoral researchers to
work both in a university research setting and in an industrial research
environment. The research that will occupy the postdoctoral scholars involves
the application of methods from high-performance computing and nonlinear,
combinatorial, algorithmic, statistical, and stochastic analyses to the
efficient design and manufacture of high-technology products. The award nurtures
an alliance between industrial users of technology and the university research
community. The goal is to assist industry in its search for cost-effective
access to vital technology and allow universities to determine and develop basic
research directions relevant to modern industrial processes. The research topics
include: (1) Industrial fabrication with advanced materials and processes, (2)
Geometric algorithms for robotics and manufacturing, (3)Computational geometry
for virtual reality, (4) Drug design, and (5) Education and outreach for
industrial mathematics. The award has substantial matching funds from industry.
