This proposal requests funding to help defray the expenses of participants in
the annual Spring Institute in Noncommutative Geometry and Operator Algebras
(NCGOA) to be held at the University of Muenster in Germany from May 14 to 19,
2018. Additional information about the institute can be found on the website

The conference will feature several mini-courses and research talks involving a
very active area in operator algebras, namely that of C*-algebras and dynamics.
Recent breakthroughs in noncommutative dimension theory have led to the solution
of several long-standing conjectures. Tremendous progress in understanding
C*-dynamical systems has been made as a result, and many exciting concepts have
been introduced in the theory of C*-algebras following ideas from von Neumann
algebra theory. The present school/conference aims at fostering interactions and
collaborations between these direction of operator algebras. The proposed
speakers are world leaders of their fields. It is expected the conference will
germinate new international based interactions between C*-algebras, dynamical
systems and von Neumann algebras.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
