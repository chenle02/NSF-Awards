This NSF award by the Chemical and Biological Separations program supports work
by Professor Yong Wang to apply nucleic acid aptamers to create a cell
separation method. Cell separation has played an essential role not only in
basic biological research, but in clinical diagnosis. Current methods for cell
separation are mostly dependent on antibody-mediated cell recognition. However,
antibodies or antibody-functionalized systems often exhibit limitations due to
their easiness of losing functions and difficulty of reversing antibody-cell
interactions. These shortcomings can significantly limit downstream cell
analysis and applications. Thus, there is a clear need to discover and engineer
alternative biomolecular ligands for cell separation applications. Because
nucleic acid aptamers are different from antibodies and have numerous merits
such as high affinity and specificity, great tolerance of harsh conditions, and
easy synthesis with a standard chemical procedure, we hypothesize that nucleic
acid aptamers can be used to develop a new method for cell separation. To test
this hypothesis, we will systematically investigate biomolecular interactions
between aptamers and cell receptors, understand intermolecular recognition in a
multicomponent system, and explore the aptamer-mediated cell capture and release
for cell separation.

The success of this research project will not only enable the development of a
novel, universal cell separation method, but also enrich the current knowledge
of biomolecular recognition and provide resourceful information for nucleic acid
research. In addition to these technological impacts, this program will make
impacts on human resource and education. First, this project will provide
students with an interdisciplinary environment to learn biomolecular
engineering, kinetic analysis, material development, and cell separation. The
students will be able not only to acquire hands-on research skills, but also to
learn analytical, communication, collaboration, and innovation skills. Second,
the PI will initiate a new outreach program by collaborating with local high
schools and continuously enroll K-12 students and teachers to the lab to learn
cutting-edge techniques. Third, the students' research findings will be widely
disseminated through publications in peer-refereed journals and presentations at
national/international conferences.
