The PI requests partial support for the Gulf of Mexico Oil Spill &amp; Ecosystem
Science Conference scheduled for January 21-23, 2013 in New Orleans, LA. This
will an open science conference driven by science community input. Topics and
speakers for plenary session presentation will be identified by the Conference
partners. Through plenary and breakout sessions covering themes ranging from
chemical and physical oceanography to ecosystem dynamics and impacts to
technology development and public health, the conference will provide a forum
for the research community in the Gulf of Mexico to share their latest
scientific results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Conference will engage and build a community
of researchers working on all aspects of Gulf of Mexico ecosystem science and
initiate dialogue with the users of that information. The Conference encourages
graduate student participation. The Conference will also involve the
participation of high school teachers from the Gulf region to expose them to
Gulf ecosystem science, to clarify the science for them, and, ultimately to help
advance development of learning opportunities around the science content of the
Conference. The conference organizers will engage the four regional Sea Grant
programs (FL, LA, MS-AL, TX) and the National Marine Educators Association to
conduct outreach to high school teachers affiliated with their local programs
and to recruit them for the conference.
