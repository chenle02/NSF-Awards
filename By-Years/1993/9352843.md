9352843 Phillips The Harvard Consortium Curriculum is being implemented
throughout the Calculus courses, from beginning through Multivariate, in the
context of a thorough revision of our first-year and remedial classes. This
involves adapting the Harvard curriculum to meet the needs of a diverse student
population, who fall into three categories: the 1600 students a year who take
the first term of the Precalculus/Calculus sequence, for whom the precalculus
end of the curriculum needs to be expanded; the 900 who take either the slow-
stream or the mainstream Calculus, who can use the curriculum essentially in its
present form, and a smaller number of well- prepared students, who took some
Calculus in high school, and would benefit from enrichment material to
supplement the more routine sections of the curriculum. Undergraduate majors
interested in secondary teaching are being recruited to participate in workshops
and seminars offered as part of the project and to gain teaching experience in
the revamped precalculus and calculus courses.
