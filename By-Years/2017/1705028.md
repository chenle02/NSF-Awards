For many problems, randomized algorithms offer significant speedups over known
algorithms that don't use randomness. However, randomization introduces
uncertainty in the outcome of the algorithm, as there will be a small
probability of error. The purpose of this project is to explore when uncertainty
can be eliminated without giving up on speed. The project integrates education
and outreach, including mentoring of students, public lectures and popular
science writing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs identify several families of
problems where randomized algorithms outperform the best known deterministic
ones, including: problems on dense graphs like finding an approximate clique in
a dense graph; algebraic problems like polynomial identity testing and
factorization; and problems that can be solved using Markov chains, like
approximately counting the number of perfect matchings in a bipartite graph. The
PIs wish to develop new techniques for derandomization that do not increase the
run-time substantially. The PIs also want to prove that, under widely believed
complexity assumptions, some randomized algorithms are impossible to derandomize
without a significant loss in speed.
