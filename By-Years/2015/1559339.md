The PIs will partner with the U.S. Department of Energy to hold two workshops
focused on illuminating gaps and opportunities for regulatory and planning
harmonization across North America. The initial focus will be on how harmonize
regulations and planning for electricity production and transmission across the
US borders with Mexico and Canada. One workshop will focus on US - Canadian
issues, and will be held in Boise, Idaho on the campus of Boise State
University. The second workshop will consider US - Mexico issues, and will be
held at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque. The PIs will also prepare
background materials to summarize the current state of regulation and planning
in Canada, Mexico, and the US in electricity production and transmission. The
workshops will provide a forum for developing the broader impacts for policy of
economics and environmental science. The overall goal is to reduce cost,
environmental damage, and risks to electric reliability.

The background papers will cover three to five specific areas where the US may
consider harmonizing regulation and planning across borders. This includes three
specific chosen topics: (a) the effects of air pollution and carbon dioxide
regulations; (b) technical regulations and planning processes; (c) whether and
how data sharing across borders will improve modeling and planning.
