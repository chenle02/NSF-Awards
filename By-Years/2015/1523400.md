WiSec is one of the leading international conferences on the security and
privacy of wireless communications and mobile networks. Every year, researchers
present novel ideas and fundamental advances in areas including location
privacy, anonymity, security of smartphones, jamming attacks and defenses, and
usable mobile security. WiSec serves to foster communication among researchers
and practitioners with a common interest in improving the security of wireless
networks and devices through scientific and technological innovation.

This award will support travel costs for graduate students to attend the WiSec
conference, to be held in New York City NY in June 2015, allowing them to
interact with experts in the field.
