This award provides support for the transfer of type and other strains of
methanogenic and syntrophic bacteria, and other fastidiously strict anaerobic
bacteria from the Oregon Collection of Methanogens (OCM) to the American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC), which operates one of the largest and most important
collections of bacteria in the US and elsewhere. Following the transfer, the
Oregon Collection of Methanogens will cease due to the imminent retirement of
the director, who is principal investigator of this award. The ATCC bacteriology
collection currently includes over 20000 strains, but contains few strains of
the types found in the Oregon collection. Such strains are unusually difficult
to culture, store and distribute. In addition to the OCM, only one collection,
the German national collection (Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und
Zellkulturen GmbH) presently includes substantial numbers of these microbes. The
intellectual value of the proposed activity is the preservation of strains and
of the standardized methods for the growth, storage and distribution of these
strictly anaerobic bacteria that have been employed by OCM. The broader impacts
of this project are the secure storage of stock cultures of methanogenic and
other anaerobic bacteria at ATCC, thereby facilitating the distribution of these
strains to laboratories in the United States and enhancing prospects for their
future availability.
