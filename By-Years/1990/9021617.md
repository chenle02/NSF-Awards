This ia a two-year collaborative research project between Dr. Frank Tabakin,
University of Pittsburgh, Dr. S. T. Lee, Argonne National Laboratory and
Professor Yang Shin Nan, Taiwan National University supported by the AIT-(US)
CCNAA- (Taiwan) Cooperative Science Program. This proposal plans to study
electroproduction of mesons and nucleon resonances. Dr. Tabakin has a three year
award from the Theoretical Physics Program on antinucleon-nucleon and
electroproduction reactions. The proposed research activity adds an internati-
onal dimension to his existing NSF award. This proposed study has two major
parts: the study of the mesonic dynamics in the outer region of a hadron and the
investigation of the quark dynamics of electromagnetic production of mesons and
nucleon resonances. This is an important field of theoretical physics. The
principal investigators are noted researchers in this field and can make a
significant progress in this field of study. This project is jointly supported
by the NSF and the Taiwan National Science Council.
