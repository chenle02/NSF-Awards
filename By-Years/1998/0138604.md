&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract: &lt;br/&gt;Savin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gordan
Savin is continuing his work on minimal representations, with applications to
and explicit constructions of some cases of Langlands functoriality which can
not be obtained by any other method. The subject of automorphic forms is a
crossroad of analysis, algebra, and number theory. It is a subject with roots in
indispensable mathematical theories such as Fourier Analysis which impact our
everyday lives in many ways. Telecommunications, data transmission, and modern
instruments of radiology would not be possible without Fourier Analysis.
&lt;br/&gt;A purpose of this research is to use tools of analysis (calculus) to
answer some questions in number theory, such as to get a better understanding of
zeroes of polynomials. Almost everybody knows how to solve a quadratic equation.
It is also possible, although it is less known, to find zeroes of any polynomial
of degree 3 or 4. A higher degree polynomial, in general, cannot be solved, but
can be studied using some special functions of complex variable (called modular
forms). This circle of ideas, which surprisingly relates mathematical theories
which at first glance do not appear related, is about 30 years old, and called
the Langlands Program, after Robert P. Langlands of the Institute of Advanced
Sciences in Princeton. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
