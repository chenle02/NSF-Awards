9353189 Olbrot The proposed research will investigate robust control for systems
with parametric uncertainty models. The research will consider that the
uncertain parameters belong to a known region of tolerances and will attack the
problem of how to reduce this region based on a knowledge of noisy measurements.
New algorithms will be developed for testing robustness which can handle the
reduced parameter uncertainty regions where nonlinear inequalities for the
parameters will be an essential difficulty. The determination of the reduced
region of parameter uncertainty will facilitate the use of known robust control
designs. The investigation will develop extensions of two specific design
methods for time-varying robust controllers, generalized hold functions and
switching dead beat controllers and include the continuum of uncertain
parameters and time delays. ***
