This laboratory improvement project funds the acquisition of CNC vertical
machining center with tool changing capability and metrology equipment to
enhance the Computer Numerical Control Laboratory to an Integrated Flexible
Machining Cell and Metrology Laboratory. New CNC 3-D part programming projects
and metrology laboratory experiments are being developed to expose mechanical
engineering students and engineering management students taking the course to
advanced technologies, programming, operation, simulation, accuracy assessment,
and control of flexible machining cell and the interrelation among them. The new
equipment consists of a 3-axis CNC vertical machining center, a pentium 60
computer and accessories, telescopic ball bar, and metrology interferometer
system for accuracy assessment of machine tools, CMMs, and machined workpiece.
