. This research project will first develop a new scalable algorithm for
clustering that can detect an unknown number of arbitrarily shaped clusters.
This approach will be based on a synchronization model of plus-coupled
oscillators. Next the project will build a CBIR (Content-Based Image Retrieval)
prototype using the clustering algorithm developed in this research. The career
development plan will include training students in CBIR as well as initiating a
research seminar series. The proposed research will also support undergraduate
design projects.
