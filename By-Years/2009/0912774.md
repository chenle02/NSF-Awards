This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I research project is aimed at
developing an innovative Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) based warehouse
management system utilizing a new patent-pending component that will help to
address fundamental shortcomings of present day Ultra-High Frequency (UHF) RFID
systems. When integrated with conventional UHF RFID systems for warehouse
management, this technology will bring value by enabling precise localization of
tagged pallets, localization of forklifts, prevention of cross dock pallet
reads, tracking of direction of pallet motion and improving the read rate or
read accuracy of pallet tags. The project objectives are directed towards
hardware prototyping, protocol implementation, software development and initial
pilot deployment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RFID is a rapidly emerging technology
with applications in diverse fields such as supply chain management, indoor
asset tracking, healthcare and manufacturing. This technology can enhance the
handling of material and supply chain operations and the operational efficiency
of various businesses processes including greater control over inventory, more
accurate production forecasting, and more timely order
fulfillment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American
Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).
