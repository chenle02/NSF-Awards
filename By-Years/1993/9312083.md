9312083 Shaw Opportunities to examine the evolution of contract terms or of
firms' choices of contractual structure have been rare. This research project
represents one such opportunity. For the first time, there exists a panel data
set on about 1000 individual franchisors for the period 1980 to 1991. This
project uses this unique data set first to reexamine the hypotheses that have
been tested on franchising based on cross-sectional data only. It will be shown
that the estimates obtained using these data only are biased because of omitted
variables and sample selection problems. Second, systematic evidence is
developed on the evolution of the terms of franchise contracts, and the choice
of contract mix, overtime or as the chain expands. This research is important
because it will not only shed new light on better understanding of this
important and growing form of business organization, but also on long term
contractual arrangements and on vertical integration relationships. ***
