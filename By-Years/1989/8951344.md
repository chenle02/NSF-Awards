Measurement of microwave circuits in the range 0.1 to 18 GHz requires, as a
minimum, a sweepable signal source and a scaler signal analyzer. A low-cost
microwave measurement station is developed using widely-available personal
computers and recent advances in broadband microwave measurement components.
Costs will also be reduced by using a signal sweeper to run four or more setups
simultaneously. The stations will not have the accuracy of commercially
available systems but will be well-suited to a teaching environment. An emphasis
will be placed on making the systems simple to allow students to better
understand the measurement process. The stations are interfaced directly to
personal computers so the students can compare their measurements with predicted
circuit designs. By making the software and hardware flexible enough to run with
most microwave sweepers and by using only off-the-shelf components, we plan to
develop a complete laboratory course that can be adopted in teaching programs
nationally.
