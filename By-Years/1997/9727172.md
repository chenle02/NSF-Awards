The focus of this research is the preparation of novel molecular architectures
as candidates for catalytic scaffolding. The basic design of the targeted
oligo(phenylene ethynylene)s involves attaching polar side groups to the
oligomer's non-polar hydrocarbon backbone. Secondary helical structure is then
realized from a conformation in which the oligomer folds back upon itself such
that the aromatic rings stack face-to-face along the helix axis. This approach
to the development of new catalysts benefits from the enormous molecular
diversity available through sequence modification, the full three-dimensional
definition of these spontaneously organized tubular compartments and the
intrinsic chirality of the helix. The proposed catalysts hold the promise of
being more robust that proteins and have the potential to catalyze a wide range
of organic reactions. The deracemization of alpha-chiral acids is an example.
With this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is
supporting the research of Dr. Jeffrey S. Moore of the Department of Chemistry
at the University of Illinois. Professor Moore will focus his work on the
molecular design, synthesis and study of oligo(phenylene ethynylene)s that fold
into helical conformations, thereby creating tubular cavities. These
solvophobically driven helical structures produce a shape that is reminiscent of
the most common active site domain observed in enzymes, the alpha/beta-barrel
motif. Thus, a long term goal of the research is to use this barrel-like
scaffolding as an architecture for catalyst discovery.
