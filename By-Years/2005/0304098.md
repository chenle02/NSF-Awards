Lyophobic Interfaces for Storing and Converting Mechanical
Energy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Systems that enable reversible transformation of
mechanical energy are of great importance to modern technology spanning the
areas from MEMS to car dampers. This work explores the idea of using short-range
adhesion interactions at lyophobic solid-liquid interfaces for storing and
converting mechanical energy. Forcing water into hydrophobic capillaries results
in the formation of an interface of high interfacial free energy and, if the
surface area is high enough, up to 50J can be stored by one gram of a porous
material. The first group of objectives is directed at understanding the
mechanisms of the reversible transformation of mechanical energy in excess
interfacial energy and the development of a thermodynamic model of this process.
Nanoporous solids with well-defined pore structure and surface chemistry (carbon
nanotubes, porous silicates and quartz capillaries hydrophobized by self-
assembled monolayers) are used as non-wettable materials. The second group of
objectives is related to the development of systems that are capable of creating
an excess interfacial energy and can perform mechanical work at the expense of
the surface chemical reactions (Chemical Battery of Mechanical Energy). Special
emphasis is directed at the development of chemisorption reactions that increase
interfacial surface tension of the system. In the education plan, this work
enhances the infrastructure of research and education at SHU by including
undergraduate and graduate students into the project and by incorporating the
latest developments of surface science and engineering into the teaching and
training programs in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry.&lt;br/&gt;
