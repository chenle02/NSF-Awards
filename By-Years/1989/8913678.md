This project investigates expert system software development environments for
problems that can only be solved with interdisciplinary knowledge. The research
is focussed on studying ways to combine existing systems to solve new problems.
The starting point for the research is the PI's previous work on expert systems
for papaya management, soil acidity, and nitrogen analysis that integrated
multiple domains of expertise into intelligent agricultural crop management
systems. The challenge of the project is to include such divers domains as
agricultural, chemical, financial and management aspects of the problem domains
of choice (papaya and nitrogen management systems). The work is expected to
increase knowledge about expert systems and also about ways to incorporate the
results of multi-disciplinary collaborations into system developments.
