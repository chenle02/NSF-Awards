Objective: The objective of this program is to expand the realm of silicon
photonics into the mid-infrared wavelength range. The common silicon-on-
insulator platform is not suited due to silica loss in the mid-infrared.
Sapphire is transparent in this wavelength range, thus all the proposed devices
will be fabricated on silicon-on-sapphire wafers. The expected outcomes are: (a)
Passive coherent beam-combiners pumped by quantum cascade lasers; (b) Active
coherent beam-combiners based on silicon Raman lasers; (c) Wavelength-tunable
version of the active beam-combiner; and (d) Parametric optical amplifiers and
continuum generation sources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merits: The
intellectual merit of this program is: (a) It will develop a novel mid-infrared
photonics platform; (b) Instead of mechanically duplicating the existing near-
infrared architectures, new photonic devices that carefully target the specific
needs of mid-infrared integrated photonics are envisioned; (c) The proposed
device architectures take into account the requirement of their monolithic
integration on the same silicon chip; and (d) Rather than trying to compete with
existing technologies on III-V compound semiconductors, silicon photonics will
be employed as a complementary technology to advance the field of mid-infrared
photonics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The broader impacts are
providing: (a) Photonics solutions with potential applications in environmental
and biochemical sensors, biomedical equipment, free-space communications and
homeland security and surveillance systems with direct impact on the daily life
of our society; (b) Interdisciplinary research context for Ph.D. students; (c)
Integrated outreach activities that span K-12 and college-level women and other
underrepresented minorities in collaboration with local educational
institutions.
