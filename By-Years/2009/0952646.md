The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project
is to predict the aggregation kinetics of monoclonal-type antibodies, and to
explore novel strategies to prolong antibody's shelf life. Antibody is important
for disease treatment and medical diagnosis. Aggregation is a critical concern
in antibody drug manufacturing, delivery, and storage. Because once aggregated,
the unfolded antibodies will fail to recognize or bind antigens, which will
reduce the drug efficacy and may cause harmful immune responses. To achieve the
goal, the proposed research approaches are to: (a) identify the role of mobility
of monoclonal antibodies in drug solutions, (b) predict the aggregation
kinetics, and (c) provide a computational tool that can facilitate the antibody
drug development. Models will be developed and validated against light
scattering, spectroscopy, and rheological
experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Availability of high quality, concentrated,
yet low cost antibody drug has great economical and societal impacts. If
successful, the project will enhance the antibody manufacturing and storage
processes, which can save billions in healthcare costs and make the life-saving
medicines broadly available especially in developing countries. The integrated
research and education project will provide interdisciplinary training on nano-
bio-mechanics for students in engineering and pharmaceutical science programs.
Innovated modeling courses will be developed. The scientific materials will be
demonstrated to high school teachers and K-12 students and will be made
available to public using podcasting technology. Advanced results will also be
disseminated in a scientific workshop.
