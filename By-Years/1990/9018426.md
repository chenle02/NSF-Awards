An active debate is centered on a substantial disagreement concerning the
importance of volume change in cleaved rock. The research integrates new methods
of geochemical mapping with strain maps to determine the non-volatile element
and volume changes in space cleavage in rocks. Major element compositional data
will be acquired by an XRF macroprobe designed specifically for the purpose. The
machine bridges the gap in analytical resolution between electron beam and whole
rock XRF methods. Major element data will be converted into volume loss
information by identifying insoluble elements and calculating volume
equivalents. Strain maps will be constructed using established techniques such
as pressure shadow incremental strains and center-to-center methods. Detailed
samples from the Delaware Water Gap area of PA and NJ will be used to examine
the variability of volume change within and between cleaved units of shale,
carbonate and quartzite. The results will resolve important outstanding
controversies concerning cleavage development in rocks.
