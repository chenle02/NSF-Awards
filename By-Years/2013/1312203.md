The goal of this proposal is to apply magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modeling tools
to the study of interacting close binary systems such as cataclysmic variables
(CVs), with the complementary goal of improving the understanding of magneto-
rotational instability in accretion disks. While observations of CVs have
provided a wealth of constraints on physical models of accretion, advanced MHD
models have yet to be applied to the study of the disks in these systems.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will compare results from the numerical
simulations of the disks around close binary star systems to observational data
in order to further constrain disk parameters such as physical disk size,
angular momentum transport, and global disk features (i.e. spiral shocks, hot
spots, etc.). The project will also contribute to scientific workforce
development through the involvement of undergraduate and graduate students. The
project will communicate results to the public through the development of
animations and visualizations of the close binary disk models made available via
the web.
