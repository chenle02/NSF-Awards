9353886 Morrell Atlanta Metropolitan College seeks to provide a five-week,
commuter, Young Scholars project in chemistry and mathematics for 32 students
entering grades 7 and 8. The project is designed to enhance the scientific and
mathematical awareness of under-served minority and female students. The
students will be involved in classroom discussions and lectures, and laboratory
and field activities stemming from an investigation into the chemistry of the
environment. The students will also investigate the concepts involved in
mathematical modeling.
