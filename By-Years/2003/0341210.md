Mathematics (12) Improving the Quality of and Access to Undergraduate Statistics
Education by using innovative web-based and multimedia materials is a proof-of-
concept project that demonstrates the effectiveness of a successful model used
in graduate statistics courses for undergraduate students. This project uses the
Emporium instructional model that replaces the traditional lecture/homework
format with a more flexible web-interface model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project develops the necessary materials for an Emporium course; assesses the
major obstacles using this instructional style; creates student study guides;
and conducts evaluations on the effectiveness for undergraduates. Products
created are a CD and web site, which are used for further testing of materials
and concepts developed in this project. This project changes the instructional
format from the traditional face-to-face classroom instruction, where students
have lectures in class and do problems at home; to the Emporium model where
students view course content at home; ask questions, work case studies, and
solve problems during lab and classroom sessions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project emphasizes the development of education materials that are essential in
the assessment OF diversity in students' abilities and learning
styles.&lt;br/&gt;
