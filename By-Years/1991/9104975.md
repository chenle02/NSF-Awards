A user mode research program will be carried out in pion physics at LAMPF and
PSI. Experiments will focus on new absorption mechanisms involved in pion
absorption, and on fundamental pion nucleon scattering, including spin degrees
of freedom. The latter work will shed light on the strange quark content in the
nucleon and also improve our understanding of the fundamental pion-nucleon
interaction. In addition, experiments will be designed for the CEBAF facility
relating to electro pion production and nuclear systems. A strong
instrumentation effort is involved in these latter activities.
