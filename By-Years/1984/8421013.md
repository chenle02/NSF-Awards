This work involves both theoretical and experimental studies of certain
phenomena in film casting. A procedure for manufacturing polymer films involves
extrusion of polymer melt through a narrow channel called a slit die and then
take-up by a cylinder called a chill roll (which quenches and solidifies it).
Take-up velocity at the chill roll is faster than extrusion velocity and the
molten film is thus stretched. Ideally, the final film produced is of uniform
thickness, but often some flow instability occurs and the product instead has
periodic sustained oscillations in film thickness, even though the extrusion
velocity and the take-up velocity are kept constant.
