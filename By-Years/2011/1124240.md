Automated (and human) tutors are limited in their ability to infer what is going
on in students' heads based on their observable behavior. The proposed work
addresses this limitation by investigating how EEG input from a commercially-
available device can be used as evidence about students' mental states. In
particular, the project focuses on adding EEG-enhanced feedback to Project
LISTEN's Reading Tutor, an intelligent tutoring system that helps children learn
to read. The project seeks to answer two questions: (1) How can we use EEG to
detect mental states that predict, indicate, or reflect student learning? (2)
How can we use such detection to improve student learning? Analysis to answer
these questions and to enhance the capabilities of the Reading Tutor draws on
existing tools to explore annotate, and mine EEG data logged by the Reading
Tutor. The research aims to tell us more about how to use EEG to identify mental
states that predict learning and to use machine learning to make an intelligent
tutoring system better, and it may also add to what is known about sources of
reading difficulties. Expected technological contributions of this work include
advances in relating EEG data to children's behavior, cognition, engagement, and
learning and advances in elucidating how intelligent tutors can robustly exploit
noisy EEG input to better assist learning. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
technological innovation in this project is particularly important for those
children who need extra help with sounding out, word recognition, and/or making
simple inferences needed for understanding.
