The objective of this project is to improve the security of a wide range of
network protocols that the Internet relies on. Unfortunately, the Internet has
been evolving at a rapid rate but its initial design did not take security into
consideration. In practice, this leads to a never-ending stream of network
attacks that are continuously being discovered. The defenders are forced into a
reactive position to these new and creative attacks, without having the
necessary tools to understand and anticipate them. The proposed project aims to
identify and analyze protocol flaws proactively and stay ahead of attackers. In
particular, the project will develop a set of innovative and timely techniques,
tools, and insights that will empower developers and researchers to analyze
network protocols, identify their weaknesses, and correct them early on. The
results will benefit all Internet users by providing a more secure network
environment overall. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the research is
motivated by the following observations. First, emerging threats such as side
channels have been largely overlooked in network protocols. Second, network
attacks are getting more sophisticated, with new threat models such as
cooperating local and remote attackers. Third, the network protocols and their
interactions with the environment are getting more complex, especially when
considering the prevalence of network middleboxes, host-based firewalls, and
censorship firewalls, etc. The research will develop a combination of program
analysis and network measurement techniques to systematically uncover
vulnerabilities in a variety of network protocols. The insights gained from the
project will enable better and more secure design and implementation of
protocols.
