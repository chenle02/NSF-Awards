This project will develop novel ways to teach cybersecurity topics. It is
challenging for computer science (CS) programs with limited faculty resources to
cover the breadth and depth of the discipline. The challenge increases as CS
curriculum guidelines places more emphasis on emerging areas such as
cybersecurity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For CS majors, the project will produce
cybersecurity modules for injection into existing courses. This approach
supports the CS curriculum guidelines as 63.5 of the 72.5 lecture hours in the
Information Assurance and Security knowledge area are distributed across other
knowledge areas. Each module will include learning assessments to track
students' progress in achieving the cybersecurity learning outcomes while the
project will use student portfolios for program-level assessment. A multi-
college event will be organized to provide additional hands-on learning
experience on cybersecurity topics.&lt;br/&gt;For non-majors, this project will
refine a cybersecurity course taught in an interdisciplinary manner to
humanities and sciences students. This course goes beyond the traditional
computer literacy course by covering topics valuable for making decisions about
cybersecurity issues that may arise in the future.
