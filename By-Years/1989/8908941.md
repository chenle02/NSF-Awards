Growing awareness of the accelerating pace of global environmental change has
heightened the need for effective means to monitor and analyze changes in
natural conditions throughout the world. Satellite imagery and other forms of
remote sensing have greatly increased the amount of raw data available for
tracing changes in natural conditions, but techniques for converting that data
in useful information necessary to evaluate changes in natural patterns and
processes have been slower to develop. This project will improve and refine
methods for measuring changes in many of the attributes of vegetation in arid
and semiarid regions. By evaluating the reflectance properties and locational
patterns of different types of vegetation, the investigator should be able to
develop standard rules that will enable remotely sensed images across larger
areas to be used to more accurately map vegetational patterns. By analyzing
images of the same area taken over time, changes in vegetational patterns can be
mapped and more direct analyses of the processes of vegetational change can be
undertaken. This project will be undertaken by the collaborator in collaboration
with ecologists at the Jornada Long-Term Ecological Reserve in New Mexico. This
research will be beneficial from both methodological and substantive
standpoints. The analysis of properties that more reliably identify vegetation
will be of value to all scholars studying vegetational patterns. By using this
information to improve and test models of ecosystem change, this research also
will benefit those seeking to increase understandings of the roles of a wide
range of factors in ecological change.
