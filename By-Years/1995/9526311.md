95-26311 A'Hearn As part of NSF-funded follow-up studies of the Comet Shoemaker-
Levy 9 impact on Jupiter in July 1994, Dr. A'Hearn will reduce and analyze
numerous data sets obtained of the event. The data sets include observations
with the Hubble Space Telescope, near-infrared imaging with the Infrared
Telescope Facility on Mauna Kea, HI, optical imaging from Cerro Tololo, South
America, and Kitt Peak, AZ, optical imaging and high-speed photometry from
Australian observatories, and several other observations. In reducing and
analyzing the data, particular attention will be paid to improving the signal-
to-noise ratio, since most data are severely limited by the sky background or by
scattered light. Furthermore, all data will be prepared for public archiving.
Scientific topics that will be paid attention to include flashes due to the
impacts, properties of the comet, and effects of the impact on Jovian clouds. **
