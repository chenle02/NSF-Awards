This award will support an NSF/CMBS regional conference to be held at West
Chester University of Pennsylvania in the summer of 2012 on the topic of
mathematics applied to social and behavioral problems. The principal speaker
will be Professor Donald Saari from the University of California at Irvine. This
award will support 30 participants at different stages of their careers.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After an introductory lecture, Professor Saari's
presentations will focus on the following topics: symmetries and paired
comparisons, impossibility theorems, symmetries and voting problems,
applications of symmetries to more general decision problems, dynamics of social
and behavioral systems, and topological structures applied to psychology. He
will conclude with a presentation on open problems.
