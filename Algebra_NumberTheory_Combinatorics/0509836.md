In June of 2005, Boston University will host a weeklong international conference
entitled "Open questions and recent developments in Iwasawa theory". Over five
days, the conference will cover a broad range of topics in Iwasawa theory with
an emphasis towards the main conjecture in its many guises and non-commutative
Iwasawa theory. Iwasawa theory has seen major advances in the last few years
(e.g. the Skinner-Urban proof of the cyclotomic main conjecture for modular
forms and the Coates, Fukaya, Kato, Sujatha and Venjakob proposal of a non-
abelian main conjecture) making it important to have experts come together to
discuss these results and make them more widely available to the mathematical
community. A key aspect of the conference will be an emphasis on the future
direction of Iwasawa theory. Indeed, each speaker will be asked to present open
questions and conjectures that they feel are important to the development of the
field.

Iwasawa theory is a subfield of number theory whose fundamental questions relate
algebraic information (e.g. solutions to polynomial equations) to analytic
information (e.g. values of functions arising from calculus). The merging of
these two disparate ideas is what makes Iwasawa theory such a mysterious and
powerful field. One can use Iwasawa theory to study the arithmetic of a variety
of geometric objects such as elliptic curves. Since the theory of elliptic
curves has applications to coding theory and cryptography, advances in Iwasawa
theory could lead to advances in these two subjects
