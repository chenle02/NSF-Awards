This U.S.-Poland Joint Cooperative Research project on "Nuclear Shapes in the
A=130 Region" is between a group of American researchers headed by Dr. David B.
Fossan of SUNY Stony Brook (including Dr. D.R. LaFosse; Dr. H. Schnare; Dr. P.
Vaska; Dr. M.P. Waring) and a group of Polish researchers from the Institute of
Theoretical Physics, Warsaw University and the Institute of Experimental
Physics, Warsaw University, headed by headed by Dr. T. Morek (including Dr. Ch.
Droste; Dr. L. Goettig; Dr. W. Karczmarczyk; Dr. T. Rzaca-Urban; Dr. J. Srebrny;
Dr. K. Starosta; Dr. S. Cwiok; Dr. J. Dobaczewski; Dr. W. Nazarewicz; Dr. S.G.
Rohozinski; Dr. Z. Szymani; Dr. T. Werner). This research on experimental and
theoretical investigations of nuclear structure for A=130 transitional nuclei is
proposed by physicists from SUNY Stony Brook and the University of Warsaw.
Electromagnetic transition probabilities and .-ray spectroscopy studies are to
be employed to examine the participation of shape degrees of freedom in the
structure of these nuclei. Collaborative experiments will be carried out using
heavy-ion beams from the Stony Brook superconducting LINAC along with the BGO-
suppressed Ge-detector array. Data analysis and theoretical interpretation will
be carried out on computers both in Stony Brook and Warsaw. This project in
physics fulfills the program objectives of advancing science by enabling leading
experts in the U.S. and Poland to combine complementary talents and pool
research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence. #//
