Whitney This award will provide supplementary support to enable Dr. Earl Whitney
of the University of Utah to conduct collaborative research with Dr. Ikuo Saito
for 12 months at the National Institute for Resources and Environment in
Tsukuba, Japan. Whitney and Saito will utilize Whitney's expertise in the
chemistry and structure of coal to develop models for the flow and production of
coalbed methane. Coalbed methane is a largely wasted fuel resource which
recently has become a significant contributor to the U.S. domestic natural gas
supply. In order to develop accurate simulations and assessments of this
resource, basic research is needed on the multicomponent desorption, diffusion,
and flow effects which largely determine the composition and production of
coalbed methane. The experimental opportunities as well as pre-existing data on
coalbed and gas properties of methane at Dr. Saito's laboratory will complement
Dr. Whitney's experience in modelling the physical processes of coal. Because of
its policy to increase energy efficiency and improve the utilization of wasted
energy, the Japanese government is encouraging the research of Dr. Saito so as
to develop a strong capability in fuel resources assessment.
