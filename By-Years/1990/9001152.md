This Engineering Research Equipment award will permit the purchase of various
computer equipment components. They will be utilized in an ongoing research
program involving numerical modeling in two- phase flow, turbulence, transport
in porous media, and rheology of concentrated suspensions. Several investigators
will share the equipment. The research areas impact various issues involving
flow and transport in mechanical and chemical engineering systems.
