The principal objective of the proposed research is to clarify the
thermochemistry of Ti-, Al-, and Fe3+ - substituted clinopyroxenes and
Ag2S-Cu2S-FeS-ZnS-As2S3-Sb2S3- S sulfosalts/sulfides by experimental,
theoretical, spectroscopic, and petrologic studies. Studies of the
sulfosalt/sulfide systems will involve evacuated silica tube experiments to
elucidate net transport and As-Sb and Ag-Cu exchange reactions. Studies of the
pyroxene system will utilize available pyroxene-liquid compositional data from
melting and crystallization experiments. The pyroxene study should have
significant impact on mainstream petrology as the development of a reliable
model for pyroxene thermochemistry is a prerequisite to quantitative modelling
of igneous processes such as crystallization and crystal fractionation. The
sulfosalt/sulfide thermochemical study is a longer-term effort that will find
application in understanding solid (sulfide) - liquid (groundwater, brine, ore-
forming fluid) interactions.
