This project introduces students to optoelectronics, a key technology for the
future. The new equipment is enhancing an optoelectronics laboratory, allowing
students to gain hands-on experience with modern equipment in this
interdisciplinary field. Learning to integrate knowledge from a variety of
fields is essential for effective participation in the present and future
engineering community. The equipment is being incorporated into a junior-level
Electronics class for Electrical Engineers, an elective Electrical Engineering
course, Optoelectronic Materials and Devices, and Exploring Engineering for
first-year engineering and interested non-engineering-students. The equipment
contributes a vital laboratory component to enhance student learning. Students
perform experiments with optoelectronic materials, devices, and systems. Having
students create their own optical measurement setups using available components
provides them with valuable experience in developing tools to solve problems.
Students explore the effects of different materials and temperature on device
performance. The Exploring Engineering students compare laser diodes and light-
emitting diodes (LEDs) in the visible and infrared regimes. The Electronics
students perform a more detailed characterization of these devices. The students
in the elective perform several experiments including materials characterization
and characterization of optical sources (gas lasers, laser diodes, and LEDs),
detectors, and modulators. A system-level experiment culminates the laboratory
experience. Since fiber optic communication is one of the most important
applications of optoelectronics, system laboratories involve fiber optics.
Coupling an optoelectronic device into an optical fiber introduces the students
to the complexity of integrating the devices they have studied into actual
systems. State-of-the-art data acquisition software, LabView, is being
integrated into the experiments.
