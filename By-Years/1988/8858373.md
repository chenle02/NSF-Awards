This research, part of the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, is designed
to develop predictive models for catalytic mechanisms and catalytic poisoning.
This research is supported by a Presidential Young Investigator (PYI) award.
Among the fundamental questions to be answered are: How many surface metal atoms
participate in the bonding of a single adsorbate molecule?, What are the
relative contributions of metal s bonding of a single adsorbed particle? and How
do the electronic structure anmd geometry of the metal-adsorbate complex vary
with metal cluster size and composition, and with coadsorption of other species?
The interaction of alkanes with size-selected metal clusters will be studied.
Coadsorption studies of carbon monoxide with hydrogen or nitric oxide will also
be studied. Techniques of time resolved laser spectroscopy will be used to
obtain the dynamics, energy levels and structures of intermediate species.
