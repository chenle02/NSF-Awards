Work to date on multilayer tunneling systems has resulted in the direct
observation of single-electron tunneling effects in ultra- small-capacitance
systems containing small (10-100 Angstrom diam.) metal particles. Measurements
have also been made of the perpendicular resistivity of thin films. Research
will be continued on the use of lithographic methods to permit better control of
the fabrication of ultra-small metal and semiconductor dots. More complex
structures can then be created, which may allow the observation of high-
frequency phenomena akin to the AC Josephson effects. The now-established
technique for measuring perpendicular resistivities will be applied to selected
multilayer systems, especially Fe-based systems with anomalous magnetotransport
properties.
