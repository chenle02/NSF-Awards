This research is to study the deep structure of the Cascadia subduction zone in
western central Oregon by means of converted teleseismic P waves, also known as
the receiver function method. The experiment will collect data across a 200 km
dense array of PASSCAL portable broad-band seismometers. With the array, the
experiment will be able to trace the evolution of the crust as it is being
absorbed into the mantle at depth. These results should help to understand the
tectonic nature of the subduction zone and its associated seismic hazard. This
research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
