This project will maintain and enhance the GLOBE teacher's guide in print, on
the Web and on CD-ROM. The teacher's guide is a nearly 1,000 page document
containing detailed instructions for setting up study sites, collecting data,
and implementing math and science learning in the classroom. In addition, two
teacher's enhancement guides will be developed for elementary and middle school
teachers who participate in the GLOBE program. One guide will help teachers
accomplish the Inquiry and Personal and Social components of the National
Science Education Standards, and the other will help teachers develop their
student's literacy and language arts through participation in GLOBE.
