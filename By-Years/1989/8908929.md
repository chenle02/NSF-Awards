This ROW Career Advancement Award will examine the regulation of three
interesting sporulation loci in Bacillus. These loci either produce or modify
new factors that allow changes in RNA polymerase specificity and transcription
of genes involved in the temporally and morphologically regulated sporulation
process. The investigator will explore the structure and function of these genes
by asking: 1) Are these pivotal genes found in two distantly-related spore-
forming species? 2) If so, how homologous are they? 3) Are the genes also
regulated similarly? 4) Do these genes direct transcription of similar genes?
Priority will be given to the genes that prove to be the most interesting during
the comparative studies. This research is important as sporulation in bacteria
is the simplest cell differention process known and is being used as a model
system to begin to understand the expression and regulation of genes involved in
temporal and morphological cell changes.
