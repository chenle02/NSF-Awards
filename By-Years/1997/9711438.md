This project will implement irregular applications on parallel computers by
embedding ideas of nested data parallelism into an object-oriented programming
language (Java), thus providing an architecture-independent programming system
for sparse and irregular applications. It will investigate the following
fundamental issues: linguistic mechanisms to express concurrency, compilation
techniques to enable parallel execution, and the enrichment of the nested data-
parallel model. Data parallelism expresses concurrency through operations over
the elements of a collection; nested data parallelism allows the elements of a
collection to themselves be collections, and extends the model to irregular
domains such as graphs and trees. Objects provide data abstraction,
encapsulation of state, inheritance, and communication. This project will
integrate nested data parallelism with Java using a combination of class
libraries, source-to-source preprocessing, and the concurrency mechanisms of
Java. This project will carry out the following activities. The claim of
expressiveness will be demonstrated by writing several irregular applications
(chosen from irregular mesh solvers, tree-structured n-body methods, particle-
in-cell codes, and direct and iterative sparse matrix computations) in Java
augmented with a "for each" construct. Compilation techniques will be developed
for nested data parallelism embedded in Java. This will explore the tradeoffs
between two techniques: the synchronous technique of flattening, and
anasynchronous approach involving preprocessing the nested parallelism into
standard Java, exploiting the built-in support for concurrency in the language.
The nested data-parallel model will be enhanced in ways such as adding new
collection types (e.g., graphs and trees) and providing compiled communication
operations (e.g., match and move).
