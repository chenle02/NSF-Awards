9316455 Wheeler PIs will investigate the paleoclimatic utility of Tertiary
fossil woods by focusing on wood assemblages from strata that have also yielded
leaf and/or fruit floras that have played an important role in the
interpretation of paleoclimatic change in the western U.S. (Eocene Clarno
Formation, Oregon; Miocene Vantage Forest, Wwashington State). Two approaches--
comparison with extant floras and evaluation of xylem physiognomy--will be used.
Work will help develop a methododolgy for using wood anatomy to infer
paleoclimates that is independent of other methods.
