The subject of symplectic topology was developed in order to answer qualitative
questions concerning classical mechanics, such as the existence and number of
periodic orbits in conservative dynamical systems. Since the inception of the
subject, results on rigidity, asserting various constraints on the dynamics,
have coexisted with results on flexibility, yielding constructions that at first
glance were counter-intuitive. While the most important developments of the last
three decades concern rigidity, several new instances of symplectic flexibility
have been discovered more recently. The goal of the current research project is
to further develop both flexible and rigid methods in a search of precise
description of the boundary between the two parts of symplectic topology.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main objectives of the project are: &lt;br/&gt;--
development of effective methods of construction of symplectic structures;
&lt;br/&gt;-- development of symplectic and contact pseudoisotopy theories, as
necessary steps in understanding topology of groups of symplectic and contact
transformations; &lt;br/&gt;-- systematic development of a piecewise linear
version of symplectic topology as a necessary step in the development of
topological Hamiltonian dynamics; and &lt;br/&gt;-- further development of
symplectic field theory. &lt;br/&gt;The work on the project is expected to
provide new methods for construction of symplectic structures on closed
manifolds and to develop new effective techniques for computing symplectic and
contact invariants of symplectic field theory.
