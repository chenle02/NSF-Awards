The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is a novel prosthesis
that addresses many health concerns addressed by the more than 600,000
individuals in the lower limb amputee population. The amputee population
exhibits many day-to-day challenges associated with mobility tasks such as
descending stairs, or even level ground walking. This projects seeks to develop
an ankle prosthesis that addresses many of these needs while maintaining a
small, quiet, and lightweight package. No other prosthesis on the commercial
market exhibits the same functionality as this device, and therefore, there
exists a gap in the market that can be filled by this
device.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on a novel ankle
prosthesis, utilizing a novel actuator. This novel actuator allows this device
to exhibit the following three mechanical functions: 1) high torque locking
under load; 2) high-power dissipation under load; and 3) low-power generation in
the absence of a load. These functions allow amputees to adapt to various
terrains, gain support during standing, perform stair descent like healthy
subjects as well as lift their toe during swing to avoid tripping. A prototype
device has been created, and is to be assessed on amputees to determine its
biomechanical benefit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
