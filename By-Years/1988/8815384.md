This award supports cooperative research in theoretical physics to be conducted
by David Cartwright, George Csanak and Robert Clark of Los Alamos National
Laboratory and Gilda Meneses and Luis Machado of Unicamp in Campinas, Brazil.
The topic is the study of inelastic electron scattering by atomic and diatomic
targets. They will extend first-order many-body theory and the distorted wave
approximation to the excitation of rare-gas and alkaline earth atoms by electron
impact. These calculations will be perfomed on open shell targets such as atomic
O, N, and F. In addition, the same techniques will be applied to calculations
for diatomic molecular targets. Finally, second-order many-body theory will be
used to treat both inelastic and elastic electron scattering by helium atoms.
These theoretical techniques have been developed over nine years and three
previous collaborations between LANL and Unicamp. This work will extend the
theoretical and computational capabilities of both groups to more compicated
processes of interest in plasma physics. A number of other scientists in both
laboratories will be involved in the work including several students. The past
cooperation has resulted in seven graduate degrees and fifteen papers at
international conferences.
