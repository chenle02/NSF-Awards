The objective of this research is to construct models and design algorithms to
(i) optimize the transportation and inventory costs of an agricultural supply
chain with small suppliers, perishable product, and a consolidation center, and
(ii) allocate the costs of consolidation to the suppliers in a way that
encourages participation and sustained cooperation. In particular, the
investigators will consider models with small suppliers of quickly perishable
agricultural products who would benefit from the economies of scale resulting
from consolidation. Models with successively higher levels of consolidation,
integration and complexity will be considered, starting with a system that only
allows direct shipping through a consolidation center, up to a system that
allows routing between the suppliers, the customers, and the consolidation
center. Exact methods as well as various heuristics will be developed that take
advantage of the natural decomposability of these models. In addition, the
investigators will study the associated cooperative game-theoretic problems for
these models, focusing on computing fair cost allocations with subsidies or
incentives if necessary. The investigators will work closely with the California
Cut Flower Commission, which represents California flower growers, in order to
develop novel consolidation schemes and cost allocation methods that are both
feasible and beneficial in practice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this
research will result in novel systems for transportation and inventory
consolidation in agricultural supply chains with many small suppliers that (i)
reduce the total transportation costs for all growers by exploiting economies of
scale and full truckload rates, (ii) are simple enough for efficient solution
and mostly decentralized control, and (iii) allow for fair cost allocation
schemes. In addition, solving these models for transportation and inventory
consolidation will require novel algorithmic approaches, combining techniques
from transportation science, discrete optimization, and cooperative game theory.
