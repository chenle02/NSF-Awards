9354549 Wigley The Global Change Instruction Program is creating and
disseminating a series of innovative teaching materials on global change science
and policy for undergraduate nonscience majors. There is a severe shortage of
materials on these topics for this audience. A series of freestanding modules is
designed to pique the interest of students who think science is difficult or
boring, to attract more into careers in research or science education, and to
help produce a more scientifically literate citizenry. Because global change is,
by definition, interdisciplinary, the modules also help instructors who are
often teaching in areas beyond their own expertise. The materials are being
written by specialists and are designed to be flexible enough for use not only
in global change courses but as a focus for teaching basic science concepts in
traditional, disciplinary science classes. In Phase 1 of the project, nine
modules were produced. In Phase 2, we are producing six more printed modules (to
fill gaps in the series that professors have identified as most critical);
adapting four supercomputer animations for classroom use with the modules; and
disseminating our products.
