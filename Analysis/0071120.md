Abstract Trout

This project is designed to investigate and deepen the relationship between the
operator algebraic E-theory of Alain Connes and Nigel Higson, the index theory
of elliptic differential operators on manifolds, and quantum physics. First, we
will investigate the correspondence between (positive) asymptotic morphisms
(which form the basic cycles in E-theory) and "asymptotic" projection-valued
measures. This will help to understand the fundamental use of E-theory groups as
receptacles for invariants of strict (physical) quantization schemes. This
should also give novel formulas for writing asymptotic morphisms as operator-
valued integrals, and for computing the pairing between K-homology and K-theory,
e.g., in computing the index of a Dirac type operator coupled to a gauge
connection. The second part deals with extending the work of Erik Guentner in
using E-theory groups to understand the relationship between elliptic
differential operators and strict quantization schemes, e.g., the relationship
between the (E-theory elements of) the Dolbeault operator on a Kahler manifold
and the Berezin-Toeplitz quantization on the associated Bergmann-Fock space. The
third part is a long-term project to develop an E-theoretic classification
method for strict quantization schemes that parallels the cohomological
classification in the formally algebraic (nonphysical) deformation quantization
of star products.

The purpose of this project is to more thoroughly investigate the relationship
between quantum physics and the operator algebraic E-theory of the Fields
medalist Alain Connes and Nigel Higson. This mathematical theory associates
classifying groups to pairs of operator algebras. Group elements are determined
by objects called asymptotic morphisms between the two operator algebras. The
relationship to quantum theory is as follows. Different types of structures are
used in quantum theory to model subatomic and atomic systems, for example, Dirac
operators coupled to a gauge field in quantum field theory, and operator-valued
measures in operational quantum physics and quantum computing, etc. Under
appropriate conditions, these structures have asymptotic morphisms associated to
them (between the algebras of the classical observables and quantum observables,
respectively). Hence, they define elements in an E-theory group. By fully
understanding this correspondence, we want to show that computing these E-theory
invariants provides a natural procedure for classifying, and defining
obstructions for, diverse types of quantum-mechanical systems.
