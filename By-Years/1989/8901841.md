The objectives of this research are direct measurement of the composition and
structure of the metastable and stable reaction products; to determine the
relative importance of oxygen, carbon, and silicon self-interstitials on the
stability of the reaction products; to improve the understanding of the
transformation mechanism. The methods of analysis are high spatial resolution
electron energy loss spectroscopy and high resolution electron microscopy.
