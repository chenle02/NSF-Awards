We propose the acquisition of a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) to address
broad research and education needs in advanced materials science at Texas Tech
University (TTU). Several of these projects are directly related to current
National Security issues. Numerous ongoing projects in the NTC will benefit from
the 1.0-nm high-resolution imaging capability of the requested facility. The
large, 200-mm wafer handling capability will help expand our numerous
interactions with the microelectronics and micro-electromechanical systems
(MEMS) industries. The SEM will also be used in&lt;br/&gt;cathodoluminescence
(CL) and electron-beam induced current (EBIC) modes, powerful structural probes
with which we have considerable experience. We will use the SEM as an e-beam
writer for lithographic patterning of sub-100 nm features. The digital imaging
and advanced data analysis capabilities of this instrument are important for
quantitative evaluation of inhomogeneous structures, a feature needed in a
number of current research projects. None of these capabilities are currently
available at TTU. A common feature of the projects will be used to image,
understand, and control the structure of materials at the micro- and nanometer
level. Given our ties with industry, it is essential for us to educate our
students on state-of-the-art instrumentation. The SEM will also be accessible to
projects outside of the participants list, including industrial partners. Our
TTU recruitment efforts target student groups rich in under-represented talent.
Our outside recruitment includes undergraduate and graduate research exchanges,
including graduate admission articulation agreements, with universities
throughout the State of Texas. These universities represent the evolving
demographics of Texas that we are charged to educate. We are engaged in outreach
to the local community in an effort to interest elementary, junior high, and
high school students in the fields of science and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;
