Recognizing that today's student learns better from interactive systems than
from textbooks and that introductory chemistry courses are generally viewed as
`student unfriendly,` the department plans to provide all students in the core
General Chemistry course access to computer-based interactive learning materials
directly in their primary study area. This project is an integral part of the
department's long-range plan to change the way General Chemistry is taught and
to bring the traditional `computer laboratory` directly into students' dormitory
rooms. The university is providing the necessary infrastructure, and this
department has experience with networks and with the graphical molecular
modeling necessary to drive this project. The objective is to provide
interactive software that students can access outside the classroom. Students
use molecular visualization as a means of understanding the three-dimensional
nature of chemical structures and envisioning the dynamic nature of chemical
reactions to complement their classroom and laboratory experience. Additionally,
this project offers a solution to the nationwide problem of obsolete computer
hardware and the high service demands placed upon chemistry faculty responsible
for dedicated computer laboratories.
