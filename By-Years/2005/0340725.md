&lt;br/&gt;This project is conducting an analysis of a large body of
ethnographic interview data that has been gathered in the course of three
evaluation studies of science education innovations of different types. This
includes over 1200 ethnographic interviews of faculty who were developing and
adapting educational innovations for science undergraduates, their colleagues
(including chair persons and administrators), teaching assistants, teaching
support staff, and undergraduates at 44 institutions. The research is extracting
and synthesizing from these data an understanding of the nature and sources of
resistance to educational innovation in higher education, and, more broadly, the
conditions that enable and inhibit classroom innovation and departmental change.
Exploration and comparison of themes within and across these subsets of
interview data are clarifying the issues raised by innovation in science
classrooms for faculty, students, administrators and others, and the work is
also uncovering how (singly and together) these issues encourage various types
of resistance, their consequences for innovators, and the degree to which each
issue is tractable. &lt;br/&gt;
