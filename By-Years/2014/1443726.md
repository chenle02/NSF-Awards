This proposal is to deploy a sodium lidar at McMurdo, Antarctica, in addition to
the previously installed Fe-Boltzmann lidar also funded by NSF. Like radars, the
LIDARs (LIght Detection And Ranging) are the devices that can examine various
properties of the upper atmosphere from a large distance and at various
altitudes. From a single location, these devices can scan the environments and
observe polar atmosphere and ionosphere at the 80-200 km altitude within a wide
sector covering thousands of square miles. They monitor an atmospheric chemical
composition, temperature and other features, analyze atmospheric gravity waves,
and measure vertical winds and interaction between plasma and neutral winds. The
lidars also can study features and irregularities of various layers of the
atmosphere, and monitor their dynamics.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Many scientists
are already using the data of the previously installed instrument, and the new
lidar will bring another kind of measurements of airglow with high temporal and
spatial resolution. Simultaneous monitoring of many atmospheric parameters
enriches our understanding of atmospheric dynamics in general and gravity waves,
mixing, and vertical transport in the studied region. By fully characterizing
vertical constituent transport in the mesopause region caused by gravity waves
and turbulence, as well as determining the differential ablation of Na and Fe,
will substantially reduce the large uncertainties in current estimates of cosmic
dust influx into the Earth's atmosphere. Accurate observation of these essential
parameters will provide important data sets of polar atmosphere conditions and
dynamics and allow obtaining new crucial information for many scientists and
many areas, including weather studies, atmospheric and ionospheric studies, and
others. This research effort will continue to develop the NSF-funded
instrumentation network to help addressing fundamental questions of the Geospace
research that have not yet thoroughly examined.
