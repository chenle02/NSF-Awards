9625143 Whitcomb This program of research pursues two complementary ideas toward
the synthesis of robots possessing exceptional yet flexible dynamical dexterity:
(I) precise physical models and (ii) adaptive learning. The first idea is to
incorporate precise physical models of the robot and its environment into a
robot's computer control system. By knowing the full physical dynamical model of
its limbs, a model-based robot controller can automatically compensate for the
nonlinear dynamical effects (e.g., inertial, Coriolis, friction, hydrodynamic,
and gravitational forces) acting on the robot during motion. The second idea is
for robots to quantitatively learn the parameters of their own physical
structure and their environment, and to adaptively compensate for changes in
these parameters. The result is superior speed, precision, and dexterity.
Theoretical problems in robot arm control (Section 1.3) are remarkably similar
to the problems of underwater vehicle position (Section 1.4) -- both industrial
robots and underwater vehicles are second-order Lagrangian systems exhibiting
highly structured nonlinear dynamics. These ideas are to be employed in these
two real-world problem domains: Nonlinear Adaptive "Learning" Control for
Industrial Robot Arms Nonlinear Model-Based Control of Underwater Robot Vehicles
