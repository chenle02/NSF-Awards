Professor Cynthia Zoski of Georgia State University and Dr. Peixin He of CH
Instruments are funded through a GOALI grant in the Analytical and Surface
Chemistry Program. The project is to develop microelectrode arrays as
multicomponent sensors for the study of complex samples. Each element of the
array consists of a cluster of parallel-connected nano- to micro-sized
electrodes. Each cluster can be individually addressed by a multichannel
potentiostat. The development of the arrays, including chemical modification of
the electrode surfaces and characterization, will be performed at the
University, and the instrumentation, circuitry and software will be developed in
collaboration with CH Instruments. Array characterization will be carried out,
in part, by the novel application of scanning electrochemical microscopy. Target
applications include bacterial detection and heavy metal screening.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is aimed at developing an instrument that is
capable of many applications, including chemical and biological sensing for
environmental and homeland security monitoring.&lt;br/&gt;
