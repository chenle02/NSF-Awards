Experiments on liquid helium3 will be extended. In the extreme conditions of
lmK temperature and 9T magnetic field, they shall study magnetically driven
superflow, wave propagation of the spin/entropy hybrid and spin-polarization by
means of a spin filter, all in the "Al phase". In addition, a) a systematic
study, using fourth-sound techniques, will be conducted on the effect of He4 on
the superfluidity of He3 confined in small pores; and b) they shall measure
velocity and attenuation of the pure entropy second-sound wave in superfluid He3
using an improved Peshkov transducer technique.
