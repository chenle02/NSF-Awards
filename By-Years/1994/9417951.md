9417951 Duncan This project is to participate in an international collaborative
investigation of the East Greenland portion of the North Atlantic Tertiary
Basalt Province. In this project particular emphasis will be placed on the flow-
by- flow stratigraphy of basalt flows using field mapping, compositional and
paleomagnetic methods, and radiometric ages. These data will be used to
constrain both the physical nature and the duration of this exceptionally large
volcanic event, to correlate discontinuous sections of East Greenland basalts,
and to relate the flow sequences to coastal dike swarms. Overall coordination
and logistics for field work are being supplied by the Danish Lithosphere
Center. We will participate in field mapping and sample collection, and will
contribute radiometric age determinations by the 40Ar-39Ar incremental heating
method, to define the timing and duration of volcanism, and in support of
constructing a composite volcanic stratigraphy. The timing and duration of
volcanism in this province will be used to assess "active" (plume heads) vs
"passive" (plume incubation) models of continental rifting in the presence of a
mantle plume.
