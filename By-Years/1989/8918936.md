Nonlinear polymeric films offer great promise for very fast opto- electronic
devices. While further research is needed to obtain still more efficient
nonlinear performance in robust, inexpensive materials, it is very important to
proceed with device research. In particular, it is crucial to investigate the
appropriateness of current materials for device applications. The best materials
now offer electro-optical coefficients comparable to the best inorganics.
Polymer thin films are attractive because they can be readily deposited on
semiconductors and metals to create novel device structures. Such applications
are beyond the capabilities of the standard inorganic materials. However, still
larger electro-optic coefficients will be needed to obtain useful effects in
such thin films. Thus, this proposal addresses the need for interferometric
structures which rely on multiple-pass optical structures to provide large
enhancement of the electro-optical coupling. If significant improvements in
molecules and film quality are not forthcoming, such multiple-pass devices may
be the only practical use in electronics of the organic and polymeric nonlinear
materials. If such improvements are obtained, interferometric devices will still
offer much larger sensitivity than single pass devices, providing enhanced
performance. A variety of multilayer film structures will be analyzed,
fabricated and tested. Particular attention will be paid to global optical
interconnects between integrated circuit processors and memory.
