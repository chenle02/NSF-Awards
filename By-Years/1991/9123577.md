Research on Anyons, Fractional Quantum Hall Effect (FQHE), and Localization -
The research under this grant will explore the more fundamental aspects of
strong correlation, exotic statistics, and the localization-delocalization
transition, primarily in physical situations where time-reversal-invarience
symmetry is broken, typically by a large external magnetic field. The proposed
problems include FQHE studies in unusual systems, tunneling of anyons, quantum
localization in pseudorandom potentials, edge effects in FQHE, Wigner
crystallization, and two-dimensional Wigner crystallization in strong magnetic
fields. Much of this work is inspired by ongoing experimental work in various
laboratories, and an emphasis on making close connection with present and future
experimental programs will be a priority.
