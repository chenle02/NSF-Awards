The goal of this project is to provide junior-level engineering students with
"hands-on" experience in modern instrumentation. A personal computer is used to
gather and reduce data and to present the results in testing the mechanical
properties of materials. The equipment purchased is used as instrumentation for
an older tensile testing machine and includes strain gage and LVDT/RVDT input-
output modules, central processing module, electronic extensometer and
troptometer with rotary position sensor, data logging and control computer
software, personal computer, printer, and plotter. The award is being matched by
an equal amount from the principal investigator's institution.
