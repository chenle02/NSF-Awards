This award supports Dr. Michael Resnick of the Cellular and Genetic Toxicology
Branch, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, for several short
visits over a three year period to collaborate in genetics research with
Professor Torsten Nilsson-Tillgren of the Institute of Genetics of the
University of Copenhagen, Denmark. They are studying whether chromosome
stability is related to the opportunity for homologous chromosomes to interact.
They are also interested in determining the consequences of DNA damage on
chromosome maintenance and segregation in chromosome pairs containing divergent
DNA sequences. Dr. Resnick's research has addressed the molecular and genetic
mechanisms of DNA repair, recombination and chromosome stability. He has
excellent facilities for experimentally inducing and measuring various types of
DNA damage. Dr. Nilsson-Tillgren has been pursuing the genetics of Saccharomyces
carlsbergensis through the transfer of chromosomes from Saccharomyces
cerevisiae. He has developed several yeast strains containing transplanted
chromosomes and genetic markers. He also has considerable expertise with gel
electrophoresis karyotyping in yeast and with examining chromosome differences
and possible translocations. The continued success of their research depends on
this unique combination of expertise, facilities and genetic material. Prior
work of these investigators has shown that homologous chromosomes in diploid
vegetative cells of the yeast S. cerevisae can undergo recombinational
interactions and that these interactions play an important role in chromosome
stability and segregation during normal mitotic processes. They propose to
continue to study the role of homology between a specific pair of homeologous
chromosomes in "protecting" chromosomes against DNA damage. The results of this
research will lead to a better understanding of chromosome mechanics in
eukaryotic cells. It will also provide a sensitive means for detecting a unique
category of DNA-damaging agents.
