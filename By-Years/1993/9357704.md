Constraints are ubiquitous in many application areas including operations
research (packing and scheduling), hardware design (circuit verification),
computational linguistics, computer graphics, and software engineering.
Constraint programming languages hold the promise of reducing the development
time of these applications significantly, while preserving a reasonable
efficiency. The purpose of this project to study the design, implementation, and
applications of constraint programming languages. Both applicative and object-
oriented languages are considered. Design issues focus on how best to support
established paradigms for the applications considered. Implementation research
considers the design of algorithms for constraint solving, entailment, and
generalization for a variety of constraint systems. It also investigates the
static analysis of constraint programming languages to reduce the performance
gap between procedural and constraint-based languages, leading to the
development of optimizing compilers for a variety of languages. Finally,
applications validate the technology and implementation developed in the project
and demonstrate the potential impact of the technology.
