This is research is on formal verification and logic synthesis of VLSI designs.
In the verification area, heuristics for verification of large, heterogeneous,
hierarchical designs, are being explored. These include: property specific
design reduction, use of symmetries, coverage directed simulation, and
hierarchical verification. In addition, methods to verify gate-level designs
containing blaak boxes, i.e. components whose functionality is arbitrary are
being developed. In the synthesis area, methodologies for hardware-software
codesign and core based design methodologies are being investigated. Appropriate
logics for specifying and modeling components which may contain abstract,
heterogeneous designs, embodying asynchrony and complex datatypes are being
developed. From these logics, the project is building a theory and practice for
formal analysis and synthesis of such designs.
