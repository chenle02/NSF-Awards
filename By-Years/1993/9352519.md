9352519 Gerritsen A new astronomy laboratory program is being established that
will be central to Brown's introductory astronomy courses. The laboratory will
include basic training in observational techniques, observation of a star
cluster (such as the Pleiades) to develop an H-R diagram from which distance can
be calculated, and independent photometric investigations of selected eclipsing
binary variable stars. The equipment will enable more sophisticated laboratory
exercises in the astronomy curriculum, allow students to pursue independent
investigations, and provide training for students to take advantage of the more
advanced opportunities for research with astronomers from other colleges in the
New England Consortium of Undergraduate Science Education (NECUSE). The
availability of this equipment will attract more students to the already popular
astronomy courses at Brown and will provide some of them who wish to do so the
necessary background to pursue advanced studies in astronomy. ***
