Khoshnevis 9634962 As an emerging technology, rapid prototyping is
revolutionizing every sector of industry, creating great opportunities to design
and manufacture products of superior quality with shorter lead-time and low
costs. Methods like selective photocuring, selective sintering, droplet
deposition on powder,and 3D printing have been explored by many researchers and
practitioners. The major technological constraints for using the rapid
prototyping technologies are poor surface finishing, limited size, and
dimensional shrinkage of parts. There is a strong need for fabricating large
parts, superior surface quality, and better mechanical properties. The proposed
research project will develop a Contour Crafting (CC) rapid prototyping system,
a new additive fabrication technology, which can produce extremely smooth
surface finishing. The Contour Crafting process uses computer control of
troweling motion of a forming mechanism to create smooth and accurate planar and
free-form surfaces. This is a hybrid method that combines an extrusion process
for forming the object surfaces and a filling process to build the object core.
The research project has a balance between theory and experiment, and will
provide valuable findings for the rapid prototyping industry.
