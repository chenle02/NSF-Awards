DMS-0106804&lt;br/&gt;Gunnar Carlsson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides
partial support for participants at a &lt;br/&gt;conference on Algebraic
Topological Methods in Computer Science &lt;br/&gt;to be held at Stanford
University, July 30 through August 3, 2001. There has been increasing interest
in the potential applications of algebraic topology in recent years. Topology
has now become a &lt;br/&gt;valuable tool in computational geometry, as well as
a method for studying various problems in algorithms and combinatorics. This
conference will cover several different themes, including topology &lt;br/&gt;in
computational geometry, topology and algorithms, topology in combinatorics, and
topology as an aid to visualization. The speakers include many of the leaders in
this area, including both mathematicians with an interesting in computational
questions as well as computer scientists who are applying algebraic topology in
various ways. We expect substantial participation from researchers in Silicon
Valley &lt;br/&gt;who ae working in this area. Further information, including
invited speakers, schedule of talks, and housing information, is available at
