Traditional teaching of math and science to non-majors through disciplinary
breadth courses does not address new realities. These courses lack connectivity
and fail to cover a broad scope of relevant scientific issues or to adequately
educate students, particularly the significant population of average students,
in the analytical and quantitative skills needed to function competently in a
technological world. These critical parts of general education should be totally
reformulated with courses specifically designed to provide basic but broad
scientific, technical and quantitative skills to a diverse student body. St.
Andrews, with a highly regarded interdisciplinary general education program and
a strong math/science program, has designed and is pilot testing the concepts of
a visionary two-course sequence that combines quantitative skills with
scientific and technological material of public interest selected from the
natural and social sciences. Pedagogy capitalizes on the enormous potential of
technology including networked computers and Internet. Math/science majors will
participate in the courses as student assistants/mentors. The goal is to have
the program institution-wide by Fall 1998. Pembroke State University will work
jointly with St. Andrews on the project. Over 500 students and 23 faculty will
be directly involved in the project (800+ students/yr beyond). Intensive and
objective assessment will measure student learning outcomes to compare with
results from traditional breadth courses. Such pervasive changes require
substantial faculty development to deliver the curricula effectively since
faculty are not prepared to each the multi-disciplines needed. NSF funding would
catalyze faculty training and reallocation necessary for institution-wide
reform. A private liberal arts and sciences college collaborating with a large
public university will provide a broad base for assessment and dissemination of
the program.
