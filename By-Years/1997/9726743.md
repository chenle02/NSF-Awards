This award supports one or two graduate students from Dr. John Yates's group at
the University of Pittsburgh to collaborate with Dieter Fick of the Department
of Physics at the Phillips University in Marburg. The collaboration will study
one of the most important aspects of surface chemistry having to do with the
determination of the kinetics of migration of adsorbed species across surfaces.
The model system to be studied is the diffusion of lithium atoms on ruthenium
single-crystal surfaces having periodic arrays of atomic steps. The goal is to
determine the role of surface steps and co-adsorbate interactions on the
activation barrier for lithium atom migration. The diffusion measurement will
take place in Germany using a novel NMR technique, which has shown superior
sensitivity to the phenomena under study.
