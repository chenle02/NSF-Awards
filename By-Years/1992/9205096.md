This collaborative investigation with G. Dunne of California State University
at Northridge will study structural and geochronological events on the eastern
side of the Sierra Nevada in east-central California. The research will address
the chronology of formation of the Sierran Arc during the Mesozoic and the
timing of major deformation episodes in the eastern Sierran thrust system. U/Pb
dating of zircons from selected volcanic and intrusive rocks in the region will
provide the time constraints. The results of this study will have broad
implication for the evaluation of continental margin magmatic arcs in this and
other tectonic settings.
