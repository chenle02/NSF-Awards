Professor William Steele is supported by a grant from The Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to perform computer simulations of many-body
dynamics in liquids. The proposed calculations are important as an aid to
understanding molecular motion in liquids and the effects of this motion on the
observed infrared, Raman, and depolarized light scattering spectra. Computer
simulations based on realistic intermolecular interaction potentials will be
employed to give representations of actual molecules, chosen so that
experimental data are available for comparison. Properties to be studied depend
on the translational and rotational motion of the molecules which composed the
liquids. These properties include: far and near infrared spectra; Raman and
depolarized light scattering spectra; thermal transport coefficients; and
nuclear spin dipole-dipole relaxation times. Theory indicates that these
phenomena involve two-, three-, and four-body dynamical contributions. Steele
proposes to study the relative magnitudes and timescales for each of these many-
body contributing factors. Molecules proposed for study range from simple
molecules such as carbon monoxide up to relatively complex ones such as ethyl
hexyl benzoate where there is competition between intramolecular reorientation
and whole-molecule motions.
