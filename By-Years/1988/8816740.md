Professor Karplus is supported by a grant from The Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program to use theoretical methods, including quantum and statistical
mechanics, supplemented by computer simulations, to study solvation and
properties of macromolecular systems of biological interest. Specific areas
which will be studied include: 1) Solvation thermodynamics of intermediate-sized
molecules, including polyenes, model peptides, and reactive systems. 2)
Properties of macromolecular systems, including an extension of the methodology
which employs simulated annealing for NMR and X-ray structure determination. 3)
Enzyme catalysis studies which incorporate quantum mechanical calculations,
molecular dynamics simulations, and free energy perturbation methods to
investigate detailed events in catalysis by enzymes. 4) Ion transfer through the
gramicidin channel using free energy perturbation methods and activated dynamics
simulations.
