This action funds Camerron M. Crowder of Oregon State University to conduct a
research project, entitled "A window in time: impacts of increased seawater
temperature on hormonal fluctuations in reproducing Taiwanese corals," during
the summer of 2012 at National Museum of Marine Biology and Aquarium in Checheng
Village of Pingtung County, Taiwan. The host scientist is Dr. Tung-Yung Fan.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to provide insight into the
initiation of reproduction in corals and to expand current understanding of the
impacts of increased seawater temperature on hormone fluctuations and
reproductive timing. Investigations include analysis of hormone fluctuations and
larval release in normal and increased seawater temperatures, making possible
estimates of coral reproduction resilience in the future.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
