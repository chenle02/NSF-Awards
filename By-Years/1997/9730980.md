9730980 PERONA This award provides funding for an Engineering Research Centers
(ERC) Program/Centers for Research Excellence in Science and Technology (CREST)
Program Partnership between the Center for Neuromorphic Systems Engineering at
California Institute of Technology and Tennessee State University CREST. This
partnership will involve the development of improved visual telepresence systems
through improved algorithms, control loops, user interfaces and the application
of these techniques to be teleoperated robots. The research collaboration
between the Caltech ERC and the Tennessee State CREST will involve topics that
will draw on the expertise of faculty at both institutions as well as involve
graduate students. This partnership based in research which is compatible to the
research goals of the participating Centers will build a long-term bridge
between the two centers that will link their faculty and graduate/undergraduate
students in research.
