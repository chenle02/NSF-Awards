The Culture Collection of Algae at the University of Texas insures that
important algal stocks with which research in the past and the present has been
concerned are preserved for future workers. The Collection serves as a center
from which stocks of algae of known quality can be obtained by investigators in
all disciplines without restriction as to their use. The Collection is the only
major, general purpose collection of algae in the United States. Cultures are
distributed to the scientific community in the United States and to many foreign
countries.
