Abstract:

This project will develop the geometrical theory of invariant manifolds and
foliations for semiflows in Banach space with emphasis on how this can be
applied to important areas of science. Of particular interest are how one may
establish the existence of these structures knowing that good approximations
exist in some sense. Applications which will be addressed include analysis of
lattice dynamical systems, the existence of modulated waves in fluid models, the
form and dynamics of vortices in superconducting materials, the form and
dynamics of material phase boundaries, including those with random perturbations
in the driving forces, and the development of good computational algorithms.

Since most physical systems are highly complex, it is usually impossible to
solve the equations which are proposed to describe and predict the relevant
physical phenomena. Even if it were possible to solve one of these equations,
the imprecision in measurement and our imperfect understanding of the actual
physical laws may call into question the meaning of the solutions. This project
will develop a theory whereby, under certain conditions, one can describe the
nature of solutions and guarantee that the physical system behaves according to
this description to a reasonable degree of accuracy. Special attention will be
given to equations describing phenomena in material science, including phase
transitions and superconductivity.
