Modern instrumental techniques including ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy,
infrared spectroscopy and gas chromatography are being used by the Chemistry
Department at Columbia College for the undergraduate instruction of students
majoring in the communications professions. The theme of science, technology,
and communications provides a focus for instruction in basic science which is
integrated with the students' communication specialties through the preparation
of videotapes or films on individual research projects. A project objective is
that students, in their future careers in communications, will be able to use
their scientific training to report more effectively to the public on matters of
science and technology.
