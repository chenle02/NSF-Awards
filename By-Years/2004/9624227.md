9624227 Symans This CAREER award is for establishing a Structural Dynamics and
Earthquake Engineering Research Laboratory (SDEER) to be used for both research
and educational purposes. The main objectives are to further the development of
passive, semi- active and hybrid seismic response control systems with an
emphasis on the viability of hybrid control systems; to expand the graduate
student research program in earthquake and wind engineering, and structural
control as well as exposing undergraduate students to these fields; and to
provide students in local public schools with the opportunity of working
together with natural hazards experts and of learning about recent advances in
these fields of research. ***
