9414227 Foley Multimedia courseware offers solutions to some of the problems in
the learning and teaching of computer science. Beginning students in computer
science are faced with learning abstract, invisible concepts without support for
learning the processes of computer science (e.g., programming). Intermediate and
advanced students typically learn through experiments (on advanced tools) and
lecture, but without the benefit of supportive learning environments (e.g.,
structure and explanation and connections from instances to general concepts).
Georgia Tech is developing courseware which (1) makes abstract, invisible
concepts visible through use of software visualization; (2) supports the
learning of process through software-realized scaffolding; and (3) integrates
existing tools with pedagogical structure through inter-application
communication facilities to create learning environments even out of advanced
research vehicles. The work involved focuses on three areas: the construction of
pedagogically sound tools to facilitate the authoring of such modules; the
creation of modules to use in computer science classrooms and to serve as
models; and thorough evaluation of both the authoring tools and student modules.
