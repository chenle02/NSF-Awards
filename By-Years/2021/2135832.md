The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve disease research and drug
discovery. Cryogenic Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM) is one of the most impactful
and vital tools of biological structure analysis today. The proposed project
improves the current methods to achieve better accuracy and productivity, with
faster user training.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project improves imaging
by cryo-EM. The images currently generated by cryo-EM are highly noisy and thus
requires extensive processing to build recognizable structures (proteins and
others). Single-particle cryo-EM is a method that produces images of individual
particles and can potentially analyze biological structures at the single-
molecule level. This project uses Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning
(AI/ML) techniques to mitigate the issues. AI/ML algorithms can automate the
workflow, facilitating quality data and the development of 3D
models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
