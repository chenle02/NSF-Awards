Available data indicate that the mechanism of the response of any soil
microstructure to loads has the same key components, and that different cyclic
response in different soils is obtained mainly because in each type of soil some
of the components are more dominant than the others. Consequently, cyclic
characteristics of different soils can be linked together and uniquely explained
via these microstructural mechanisms, making soil dynamics a more rigorous and
systematic discipline. At present, no such link is avialable, and cohesionless
and cohesive soils are studied separately using differnt cyclic characterization
of different soils and cyclic soil classification will be developed based on the
understanding of the behavior of soil microstructure.
