This Small Grant for Exploratory Research investigates the origin of the Queen
Maud Mountains, Antarctica, to understand the geodynamic processes that shaped
Gondwana. Ages of various rock units will be determined using LA-MC-ICPMS
analyses of zircons and 40Ar-39Ar analyses of hornblende. The project?s goal is
to time deformation , sedimentary unit deposition, magmatism, and regional
cooling. Results will be correlated with related rock units in Australia. By
constraining the length and time scales of processes, the outcomes will offer
insight into the geodynamic processes that caused deformation, such as slab
roll-back or extension. In addition, dating these sedimentary units may offer
insight into the Cambrian explosion of life, since the sediment flux caused by
erosion of these mountains is conjectured to have seeded the ocean with the
nutrients required for organisms to develop hard body parts. The broader impacts
include support for undergraduate research.
