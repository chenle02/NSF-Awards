In this planning effort, the American Geophysical Union (AGU) will lay the
foundations for developing the Unique Research Experiences for two-year College
faculty And Students (URECAS) program, which is intended to support Earth and
space science faculty at two-year colleges as they engage their undergraduate
students in research activities. AGU is convening a two-day workshop with 30
attendees to increase awareness about existing opportunities for summer research
experiences for undergraduates, identify best practices for engaging two-year
college students in research, and consider strategies for overcoming some of the
barriers to success. The ultimate goal of this effort is to establish a
distributed community of two-year college instructors engaged in geoscience
research and develop a strategic plan for new programs that help undergraduate
students successfully transition between two-year and four-year programs in the
geosciences. Many students who attend two-year colleges come from
underrepresented communities in STEM disciplines; as such, this project directly
supports the NSF and GEO Directorate goals of broadening participation in STEM
disciplines, in general, and in the geosciences, specifically.
