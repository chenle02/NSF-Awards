Bayamon Central University is a Catholic liberal arts institution in the
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico outside the city of San Juan. As a territory of the
US it is eligible for NSF grants. The institution currently serves approximately
2,800 students. The funds provided by the grant will be used to support the
acquisition of hardware and services required to provide Internet access to the
institution. The University of Puerto Rico will provide the Internet services
over a leased T1 line. The students and faculty of the Bayamon Central
University need the Internet connections to be able to access information
resources throughout the state, the nation and the world. The connection will
benefit the faculty, staff students of this institution as well as the community
in general. The award provides partial support of the project for two years.
