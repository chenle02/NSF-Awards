ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Proposal to Create an Online, Student Managed
Journal for Undergraduate Research in Marine and Aquatic
Sciences&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project launches an online, student-managed
and reviewed, research journal in the marine and aquatic sciences. The journal
is published online only, in order to be accessed by anyone, anytime, anywhere.
It encourages quality undergraduate research by providing a publishing forum
that is managed by a nationwide community of undergraduate learners mentored by
faculty and graduate students. Students experience the process of scientific
publishing from the viewpoints of all involved stakeholders, i.e., as authors,
peer reviewers, and editorial staff. Through its mission, the journal emphasizes
to the larger scientific and educational community the importance of research
experience in undergraduate learning. It also bridges research and learning, by
using a research activity to enhance learning. The students learn and master
communication, networking, and critical thinking skills. Graduate mentors
benefit through student mentorship experience and potentially developing into
pedagogically more aware geoscience education professionals.&lt;br/&gt;
