This project is devoted to blending and intertwining methods typically
attributable to either applied or theoretical aspect of modern Harmonic
Analysis, in an effort to solve several long-standing problems, develop
important cross-field techniques, and produce meaningful applications. One part
of the project deals with the behavior of certain approximation/interpolation
processes as their order tends to infinity, a recently developed variant of the
Poisson summation formula involving irregular samples, and the regularity
properties of solutions of certain boundary value problems. The other part
applies the Bellman function method to computing the operator norms of the
maximal function on Lebesgue spaces in non-martingale settings, the Riesz
transforms on the space BMO, and the generalized Beurling-Ahlfors transform on
differential forms; in addition, an extension of earlier sharp results for the
John-Nirenberg inequality is studied.

Among the practical areas that may be directly affected by the project are the
fields of image and signal processing, including applications to medical
tomography. The successful completion of this research should lead to improved
methods for accumulation, transmission, and representation of various types of
data. Studying the regularity properties of solutions of partial differential
equations (PDE) is a fundamental step on the way to using those PDE to describe
physical phenomena; such use is widespread and necessary in physics, chemistry,
biology, material science, etc. In turn, the computation of norms of important
operators, such as the Riesz transforms, allows one to estimate the size of
solutions of various PDE. The Bellman function method itself links such
computation to the existence of positive solutions to certain differential
equations. On the other hand, the theoretical synergy, which is at the heart of
the project, will result in the development of novel powerful techniques,
affecting applied as well as pure aspects of Fourier analysis. Another important
impact of this research is on education: the results, diverse and far-reaching,
will be presented in courses and seminars on different levels, from advanced
undergraduate to the doctoral.
