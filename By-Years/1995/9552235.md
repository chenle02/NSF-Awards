Through this project, assistance in the purchase of a scanning electron
microscope equipped with energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy capability and
featuring optional low vacuum (environmental) operation mode is funded. This
instrument forms the centerpiece in a multidepartmental Microscopy Facility
servicing students in all the natural sciences. Undergraduates are introduced to
SEM-EDS technology through specific experiments that are embedded into the
curriculum in a variety of revised and new course offerings. For some, specific
courses featuring applied instrumentation and tutorial instruction can lead to
year-long independent studies projects and roles as laboratory teaching
assistants, under the supervision of both faculty mentors and the project
director. Careful scheduling and supervision of instrument use enable students
majoring in any of the natural sciences to interact with others from different
disciplines and increase the sense of community that the university seeks to
foster. New, planned, and currently unforeseeable avenues of collegial student-
faculty research can develop from the remarkable experimental flexibility
permitted by operating in variable vacuum modes, thus making possible both real-
time observation of chemical reactions and comparison of fixed and unfixed
biological specimens and SEM observation of living tissues.
