Database services are an exploding concern in genomics, and are already a
critical bottleneck in proteomics. In order to interpret proteomics experiments,
in which measurements on hundreds or thousands of proteins are made using mass
spectrometers, it is not unusual for researchers to assemble a large farm of
computers to process the data produced by a single mass-spectrometer. The
research funded by this proposal will result in an extendable database
management system designed specifically to support complex inqueries on
biological data types, including the sequence and mass spectra data central to
proteomics. A central theme is (1) an focus tree-based storage structures to
make the similarity searches necessary to identify proteins through database
retrieval much faster and (2) the development of extensions to Structured Query
Language (SQL) to enable better use of protein identification algorithms. This
should lead to much faster bioinformatics algorithms, enabling rapid development
of complex bioinformatics databases just as SQL has enabled development of
effective programs for very large business systems.
