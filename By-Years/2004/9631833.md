9631833 de Lanerolle The term "myosin" describes a family of motor proteins that
are characterized by their ability to hydrolyze ATP when they bind actin. Myosin
II, the most familiar and best characterized member of this family, is a
filamentous protein that uses the energy released when ATP is hydrolyzed to move
filaments past each other, an essential step in muscle contraction and in
cytokinesis. In contrast to our understanding of the physiological properties of
myosin II, little is known about the other members of this superfamily, many of
which do not form filaments. Of these non-filamentous myosins, myosin I has been
studied most extensively. Myosin I was initially described in Acanthamoeba and
is now known to be widely distributed in mammalian cells. This protein has been
studied extensively at the molecular and biochemical levels, and there is an
abundance of information about the cellular distribution of myosin I. The
physiological role of this protein, particularly in mammalian cells, is less
well defined. In an effort the investigate the physiological role of myosin I in
mammalian cells, the protein was purified from bovine adrenal glands and a
polyclonal antibody was raised against it. While characterizing these
antibodies, it was observed that the affinity-purified antibodies to myosin I
stained the nucleus in interphase cells. In light of the recent demonstration by
others of actin-like proteins in the nucleus, this data prompted the hypothesis
that myosin I is involved in nuclear functions. However, before such a putative
role can be investigated, the protein in the nucleus which reacts with the
antibody must be unambiguously identified. Therefore, the goal of this research
is to purify sufficient protein to identify it by microsequencing it. ***
