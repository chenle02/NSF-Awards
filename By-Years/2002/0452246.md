Firsthand Learning, Inc., in partnership with the St. Louis Science Center, the
National Wildlife Federation, and eNature will implement "Science Firsthand," a
unique collaborative program that will enable young people to participate in
long-term scientific investigations in life,earth and physical sciences, as well
as technology. Youth ages 10-15 will partner with adult mentors to conduct
scientific investigations under the auspices of professional scientists.
Community-based organizations will identify youth to participate in the program,
while informal science institutions will provide laboratory space and needed
materials for investigations. Students will present their findings at a Young
Investigator's Conference held each fall. Deliverables for this project include
an implementation manual for community-based organizations, a professional
development seminar for community-based organizations and informal science
institutions, and the "Science Firsthand" website. This project will result in
the creation of 1,225 co-investigator teams in Buffalo, NY, St. Louis, MO,
Newark, NJ, Detroit, MI, and Seattle, WA. Secondary participants will be
supported online by eNature, resulting in an additional 3,000 team members.
