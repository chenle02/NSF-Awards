9413223 Lynch This award renews support of a joint training effort by 14 faculty
who are members of the Department of Biology and who belong to one of three
interdepartmental units (the Institutes of Molecular Biology, Neuroscience and
Marine Biology) or to the Ecology and Evolution Program. The theme of this RTG
is molecular evolutionary biology. The research and training are broadly focused
on experimental and theoretical study of genetic mechanisms, developmental
biology and population biology, all considered at the molecular level and all
approached from an evolutionary standpoint. The research programs of the faculty
involve a diverse set of organisms including bacterial viruses, fungi, higher
plants, drosophila, zebrafish, and other invertebrate and vertebrate animals.
Training activities involve students at the undergraduate, graduate and
postdoctoral levels. Undergraduates participate during both academic year and
the summer term, generally during their junior and senior years. Graduate
student participants are recruited from first year students in any of the
institutes or programs listed above. Postdoctoral fellows are recruited through
national advertising. Besides research, training include an RTG colloquium
featuring about 10 outside speakers each year, a journal club and a set of 4
courses in each of three areas: evolutionary, developmental and molecular
biology. Of the 12 courses, 5 were developed for the RTG. Graduate trainees are
required to take 5 courses, including at least one course in each area. All
trainees are required to participate in the journal club and colloquium. In
addition to these, a new program of 3 day-long mini-symposia per year will begin
in the renewal period. Each symposium will involve 3 - 5 outside speakers and be
preceded by a 3-4 week journal club focused on the topic of the symposium. ***
