The University of Kentucky is hosting a conference to bring together the
recipients of Presidential Awards for Excellence in Science, Mathematics, and
Engineering Mentoring (PAESMEM). As part of the conference format, they will
also include as participants those mentored by the PAESMEM awardees. The
conference has two main themes: (1) To continue the efforts to organize PAESMEM
recipients as a national resource for mentoring; and (2) To highlight success in
mentoring, especially that involving postdoctoral, graduate, undergraduate, or
high school student research.
