The research in this program consists of studies in coherent control using
specially crafted femtosecond laser pulses. One portion of the research focuses
on control within specially designed layered semiconductor materials. Quantum
mechanical charge oscillations in GaAs/GaA1As superlattice structures are
excited through shaped laser pulses, and growth and pulse conditions are sought
for which these excitations can be enhanced. The second part of the activity
focuses on the generation of tailored THz electromagnetic waveforms produced by
illuminating ultrafast photoconductive antennas with shaped femtosecond pulses.
