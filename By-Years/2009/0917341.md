This project proposes to inform computer users of the privacy that they receive
in practice. To do so, the project will record network and system measurements
of laptop and desktop computers as they are used. It will then analyze those
measurements to discover what personal information is exposed to whom and by
which applications. This will be done as real users undertake real tasks to
produce individual privacy assessments. The project will develop visual
representations to convey measured information exposure to users as answers to
specific privacy questions, e.g., "What does Starbucks know about me?" User
studies will be run to evaluate whether representations of measured information
exposure are an effective way to convey privacy risks and how they affect user
behavior.

This research is motivated by the fact that people who use personal computers
have little idea of how the applications they run spread their personal
information over the Internet. Users must simply assume that reputable
applications safeguard their privacy interests; they have no basis on which to
make informed privacy decisions. The research seeks to provide users with the
visibility that they lack. It will show them how their personal information is
actually spread by measuring application behavior and reporting the results with
simple representations. The intent is to provide non-technical users with a
powerful tool to help them balance their privacy needs with the available
applications. The long-term impact of this research is intended to encourage new
privacy-enhancing technologies by highlighting real-world privacy problems and
opportunities.
