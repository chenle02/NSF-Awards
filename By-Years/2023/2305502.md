The broader impact/commercial potential of this this Small Business Technology
Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is a novel, minimally invasive, surgical option
for reducing complications and improving outcomes for rhinitis patients. A
bioabsorbable, steroid-eluting suture and surgical implant procedure will be
developed to improve outcomes for 6 million patients suffering from rhinitis
under the care of otolaryngologists, or ear, nose and throat specialists. The
proposed suture system and surgical suite implant procedure enables a temporary
therapy that replaces the need for current chronic, daily, topical sprays and/or
long-term immunotherapy with a single in-office visit. The bioabsorbable, drug-
eluting platform also provides potential extensibility for eluting other
medications including antibiotic and antifungal therapies.

This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project aims to deliver a
prototype steroid-eluting dissolvable thread with an introducing surgical tool.
The project is comprised of several steps including the formulation of
dissolvable polymers, and prototyping using Hot Melt Extrusion (HME). This
effort will advance the platform design and development of optimized drug-
elution thread for use in the nasal cavity. The system will be designed using
the preferred steroid of mometasone furoate and characterized for drug elution
properties in a preclinical animal model.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
