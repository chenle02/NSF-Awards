9600611 Nowak This U.S.-Poland Workshop on Concrete Structures will be conducted
by Dr. Andrzej Nowak of the University of Michigan and Professor Michal Knauff
of the Politechnika Warszawska (Warsaw University of Technology). The objective
of the workshop is to review the current analytical methods and technology in
analysis, design, evaluation, repair and rehabilitation of concrete structures
used in Poland and identify the most suitable topics for joint research
projects. The major areas to be covered include: (1) development of load and
resistance models for reinforced concrete and prestressed concrete structures;
(2) advanced materials (high strength/high-performance concrete, composites,
fiber-reinforced concrete); (3) diagnostic procedures (tests, performance
monitors, nondestructive techniques, signal processing, integrated sensor
systems, microwave, acoustic and optical techniques); and (4) materials and
techniques for repair and rehabilitation of concrete structures (reinforced and
prestressed concrete, new composite materials). Accordingly the workshop will
attempt to review state of the art summary of main topics as viewed in each
country, identify the research needs, in particular topics for cooperative
projects; and derive some recommendations that reflect the needs in manpower,
technology transfer and education for the near future. This workshop in civil
engineering fulfills the program objectives of bringing together leading experts
in the U.S. and Poland to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in
areas of strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of equality,
reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit. ***
