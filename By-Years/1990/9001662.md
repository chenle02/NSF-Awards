Several critical issues are examined related to fatigue crack initiation and
microcrack growth. Included are the effects of subsurface environmental species
on fatigue; the role of surface reactivity on fatigue life; theoretical analysis
of the slip band spacing; and effects of material type. The significance of
subsurface incorporation of environmental species on fatigue is determined by
measuring fatigue crack initiation in selected gaseous environments (oxygen and
other selected gases). The correlation between slip band spacing and fatigue
life is examined to extend current theory on periodic slip band arrays and their
influence on crack initiation.
