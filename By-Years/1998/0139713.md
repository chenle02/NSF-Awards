The Investigator and his colleagues will study a number of &lt;br/&gt;problems
in complex algebraic geometry. First, they will &lt;br/&gt;explore some new
asymptotic invariants of linear series on &lt;br/&gt;a projective variety,
especially their variational behavior. &lt;br/&gt;While the geometry of linear
series is a very classical topic, &lt;br/&gt;new methods have the potential to
shed light on basic properties &lt;br/&gt;that have not up to now received much
attention. A second &lt;br/&gt;project involves the exploration of some new
invariants arising &lt;br/&gt;from multiplier ideals: these jumping numbers
generalize the &lt;br/&gt;much-studied log-canonical threshold of a divisor or
ideal, and &lt;br/&gt;they seem to encode quite interesting geometric and
algebraic &lt;br/&gt;information. Lazarsfeld also intends to use multiplier
ideals &lt;br/&gt;to study the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of reduced
projective &lt;br/&gt;varieties defined by equations of given
degree.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic focus of this project (so-called "linear
series on &lt;br/&gt;algebraic varieties") can be viewed as families of
functions &lt;br/&gt;constrained by geometric spaces. When the spaces have low
&lt;br/&gt;dimension such linear series have been used to find efficient
&lt;br/&gt;ways to encode data, for example on CD's. The Investigator and
&lt;br/&gt;his colleagues will study the new phenomena that arise when the
&lt;br/&gt;geometric spaces have higher dimension.
