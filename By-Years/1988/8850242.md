The University of Kentucky College of Engineering will conduct a two- week
residential summer program for twenty high school seniors to introduce them to
the engineering profession and to encourage them to pursue careers in
engineering fields. Participants will be selected from Kentucky residents on the
basis of an application to include a high school transcript, an essay, and one
letter of recommendation. Young women, minority, and handicapped students are
especially encouraged to apply. The program will consist of discussion sessions,
laboratory experiences, field trips, and lectures to thoroughly acquaint the
students with several different engineering disciplines, career opportunities,
required educational preparation, and ethical practices of the engineering
profession. Interdisciplinary programs in biomedical engineering and
pharmaceutical engineering will also be introduced to the participants. Staffing
will include faculty, staff, graduate students, and undergraduate students from
the College of Engineering. Follow-up activities will include returning to
campus for seminar presentations of student projects in late February, 1989;
community recognition for program participation; and continuous communication
between the students and the University.
