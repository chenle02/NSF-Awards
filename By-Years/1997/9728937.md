A new optical microscopy system that combines a laser confocal microscope system
coupled with a Brewster Angle Microscope will be developed and used to study
biomineralization, the critical biological process in the formation of sea
shells, bones, teeth and many other hard tissues. In this new microscope system
it will be possible to observe the interactions between the organic template and
the growing mineral phase during the process of crystal growth. Calcium
carbonate, which is used by most molluscs in marine waters to fabricate their
shells, will be the model inorganic phase with different organic thin film
templates. This new instrument should allow the study of real-time in situ
changes in both the growing crystal and the organic template. The approach
should have broad implications in biomaterialsdesigns, patterning, tissue
engineering as well as in the processing of bioceramic composites.
