Two groups of topics will be studied. The first group deals with approximation
algorithms. Since for many important problems exact solution cannot be
determined in reasonable time, one needs to provide as good solutions as
possible, given the available computational resources. The investigators will
concentrate on two paradigms: local search heuristics and relaxations of integer
linear programs. The design and analysis of heuristics for combinatorial
optimization problems is proposed. Problems of relevance to Numerical Analysis
and Circuit Design are emphasized. The second group deals with reliable
computations of neural networks. The goal of this research is to determine the
adequacy of neural networks as a computational abstraction of the brain. The
starting point of this study is the observation that the brain computes reliably
in spite of unreliable individual components. Existing methods for constructing
fault- tolerant bounded degree networks will be used in combination with new
techniques to handle unbounded fan-in processing elements.
