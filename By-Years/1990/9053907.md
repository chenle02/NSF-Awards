This model project is designed to improve access for disabled students by
dissemination of information among college teachers by intensive recruitment of
disabled students, by consultation, and by establishing a lending library of
adaptive technology and special science materials. The institution has an
excellent track record of faculty research on technology aids for the disabled
and an information dissemination regarding science education for the disabled.
The State Department of Public Instruction has a network of regional education
centers to promote support services to local schools. An additional network, in
place, is the Rural Education Institute at the University. The strengths of the
project are its innovation and its potential for dissemination and
replication.//
