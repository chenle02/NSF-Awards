Barufaldi 9729963 This proposal, sponsored by the University of Texas at Austin,
seeks funds to carry out a five-year project to enhance teachers of grades 6-8
in the content and pedagogy of Middle School physical science. The project first
works with the instructional teams (science professors, science education
professors, master teachers and science specialists), known as the Professional
Development Academy (PDA), and then with science teachers. Altogether, each
year, 96 PDA professionals will be involved in training and 400 teachers. The
state-wide delivery system will be through the 20 Texas Regional Collaboratives.
The enhancement program will include content acquisition, pedagogy enhancement,
alternative assessment strategies, technology and equity. Training workshops
will involve the best of currently available instructional materials and
teachers will be helped to integrate the new curriculum in their classroom by
PDA staff. The cost share is 67% of the NSF award.
