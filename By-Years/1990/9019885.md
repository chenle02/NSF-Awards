This proposal is to continue studying the morphology, dynamics, and temporal
variability of the tropical ionosphere and thermosphere, and to extend the
investigation to higher latitudes. Atmosphere Explorer satellite measurements of
airglow emission intensities, particle densities and temperatures will be
employed in conjunction with the NCAR TIGCM in order to improve the
understanding of the basic mechanisms which govern the behavior of the upper
atmosphere. The observational data will be compared with model predictions in an
investigation of solar tides and neutral winds in the thermosphere. A study of
the distribution of Mg+ ions should yield important new information on
ionospheric plasma transport processes. In addition, the AE data base will
provide the unique opportunity to develop global empirical and semi-empirical
models of the major thermospheric airglow emissions.
