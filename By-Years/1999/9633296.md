9633296 Sharp In recent years marine chemists have come to realize that
dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) may account
for a significant portion of the total organic carbon and nitrogen respectively
in the marine environment. Even before this was known, these scientists also
realized that identical seawater samples analyzed by different laboratories for
DOC and DON often, if not usually, yield disparate results. In four previous
years of NSF-sponsored research, the principal investigator established a
seawater standard reference material and an interlaboratory cross-comparison for
DOC. In this project, he will continue the very successful DOC seawater
standards program at a reduced level and establish a similar standardization and
intercalibration project for DON. This work is expected to help bring
substandard analytical practices in some laboratories into line so that global
DOC/DON datasets of high quality can be assembled for use in global-scale
studies of (for example) marine carbon and nitrogen cycling and ocean chemistry-
climate relationships.
