A. U.S.-China Workshop on the Yellow River at Zheng Zhou, P.R. of China will be
held during the fall of 1987. At this meeting the state-of-the-art on flooding,
erosion, and sediment transport science and technology will be examined, and a
research agenda for cooperative activities between the two countries will be
developed. A team of 10 U.S scientists, selected from the fields of hydraulics,
sediment transport, physical geography, atmospheric sciences, hydrology, and
others, will meet with Chinese researchers with similar specialists. The topics
for discussion will include: flood forecasting, transport and deposition of
hyperconcentrated sediments, accelerated erosion, and mitigation measures, among
others. Papers on these topics will be presented during the first part of the
workshop and will serve as a base for the discussion sessions. Proceedings will
be published which will include the prepared papers and the results of the
deliberations.
