This project will investigate analytically and experimentally the failure mode
of a tension member connection when the bolts are closely concentrated on the
end of the connecting members. Recent structural failures have indicated that
the conventional method of analysis and design does not always provide
sufficient safety. This project will investigate the behavior of the tension
member connection taking into account all possible variations of the parameters
involved, in order to arrive at the best analytical method to predict the
behavior of the bolted connection.
