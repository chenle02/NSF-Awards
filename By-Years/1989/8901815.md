This is work on optimization problems that arise in computational geometry and
related areas. Problems are being studied in four areas: covering and
approximation; minimum diameter spanning trees; via minimization; and, proximity
and visibility. These problems have applications in areas such as computer-aided
design, computer graphics, operations research, and robotics. The emphasis in
this project is on the design of efficient algorithms for the problems under
consideration.
