One central theme of this project focuses on nonlinear partial differential
equations representing the evolution of certain physical phenomena. An evolution
equation whose solutions are smoother than the initial data is said to have a
gain of regularity. An example of this occurs in the Schrodinger equation if the
initial data decay faster than any polynomial. Some success has also been
obtained in the nonlinear area, particularly in the case of the Korteweg-de
Vries equation. In this work, a general class of equations will be investigated
for gain in regularity. It will concentrate on equations in three space
dimensions and seek to prove that gain in regularity is governed by the sign of
the third derivative of the solution. Method of proof uses the technique of
nonlinear multipliers and a fundamental energy (integral) estimate which shows
the gain. Efforts will also be made in applying similar ideas to dispersive
equations such as nonlinear Schrodinger equations. A second line of
investigation concerns spectral and inverse spectral problems of the Laplace
operator or the Laplace operator plus a potential defined on compact Riemannian
manifolds. Three objectives of this work are to: (1) describe the distribution
of the eigenvalues, (2) identify the properties of a Riemannian metric or a
potential which are spectral invariants, and (3) determine the metrics or
potentials which can be isospectrally deformed in a mathematically significant
manner. Particular emphasis will be placed on measuring the pattern of gaps
between eigenvalues and the density properties of potentials with a finite
number of double eigenvalues.
