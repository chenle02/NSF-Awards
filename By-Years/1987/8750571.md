In this laboratory project, students will use an Activated Sludge Pilot Plant to
study the activated sludge process for treating non-hazardous and hazardous
wastes and the anaerobic decomposition of the sludge produced. The laboratory
will run concurrently with the lecture classes, thus clarifying the student's
understanding of the processes involved. Using teaching microscopes, the
students will observe waste water biota under various conditions of substrate
metabolism. They will be able to observe which kind of sludge works well on
given sewage feeds and settles well. Analysis with a gas chromatograph of the
off-gas produced during anaerobic digestion of the sludge will allow the student
to evaluate the kinetics and biological reactions involved in each treatment
operation.
