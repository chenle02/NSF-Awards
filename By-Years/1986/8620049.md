A conference serving as a workshop is being planned to set a specific agenda for
implementing a pattern of research, change, innovation, and progress in civil
engineering and construction that will last into the 21st century. The
conference is dedicated to examining the field of civil engineering, the
directions of future activity that should be explored, and the strategy for
implementing the objectives developed. The emphasis is on research and education
to better equip civil engineers to provide the leadership and innovation to meet
the needs of society in the remainder of the 20th century and for the 21st
century.
