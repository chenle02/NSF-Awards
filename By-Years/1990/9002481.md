This proposal is to make helium masurements on the World Ocean Circulation
Experiment (WOCE) cruises in the southeastern Pacific on longitudes 88 and 150
west. The helium data are useful as tracers of the deep ocean circulation,
particularly in regions near the east Pacific rise from which elemental helium
is known to emanate. These measurements, along with hydrographic and other
tracer measurements will form the basis for ocean circulation descriptions which
are the principal objectives of WOCE.
