This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) will assist the
Department of Chemistry at Columbia University to acquire a low resolution
triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. This equipment will enhance research in a
number of areas that include biomimetic chemistry, synthesis of natural
products, synthesis of helicene, elucidation of the interaction between
functional ligands and receptors, molecular recognition and artificial
receptors, and total synthesis of natural products. Mass spectrometry (MS) is a
technique used to probe intimate structural details and to obtain the molecular
compositions of a vast array of organic, bioorganic, and organometallic
molecules. The addition of the technique of electrospray extends the range of MS
to proteins and nucleic acid molecular weights far beyond any other technique.
The use of electrospray ionization in combination with high resolution provides
the latest techniques available in mass spectrometry. It affords the chemist one
of the most powerful tools available for the characterization of compounds. The
acquisition of this capability in mass spectrometry is essential for the
prosecution of frontier research in many fields of chemistry.
