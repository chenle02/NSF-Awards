The objective of this program is to design a computer algorithm and prototype
implementation to track aircraft in a sparse reporting environment. The
probability density function of the observed aircraft will be propagated between
arrivals of new target reports by means of the numerical solution of a partial
differential equation of evolution of a nonlinear stochastic differential
equation of aircraft motion. The resulting non-Gaussian density will be combined
with new reports using Bayesian methods to update estimates of aircraft
position. In order to perform the tracking function in realtime, the algorithm
will be designed to work in paralled computing environment. When implemented in
the multiprocessor environment, the algorithm will improve the performance of a
currently operational software system used for aircraft detection and tracking.
