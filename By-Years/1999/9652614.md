9652614 Wall The uncertainty regarding whether plants and ecosystems will
respond to elevated atmospheric CO2 when nutrients are lacking under field
conditions is one of the most important questions facing global change research.
To help resolve this quandary, two CO2 by soil nitrogen experiments are being
conducted on the wheat ecosystem in an open field using the free-air CO2
enrichment (FACE) approach. This proposal covers two important components of the
carbon cycle -- photosynthesis (source) and belowground biomass distribution
(sink) -- and thus will insure that all important physiological processes that
are explicitly influenced by atmospheric CO2 enrichment are incorporated within
an accurate comprehensive plant growth model responsive to elevated CO2 and
changing climate variables called ECOSYS. Besides validating ECOSYS with regard
to the interactions of CO2 and soil nitrogen supply, other important objectives
are to determine the interactive effects of elevated CO2 and limiting soil
nitrogen supply on (a) acclimation (down-regulation) of photosynthesis and (b)
root growth and plant-soil nutrient status. Measurements of individual leaf and
whole-canopy photosynthesis, respiration, and transpiration rates are being made
throughout the season to quantify the diurnal and temporal source of carbon into
the wheat ecosystem. Individual leaf photosynthesis will be integrated to whole-
plant and community level and compared with measurements of whole canopy CO2 and
H2O vapor fluxes. Similarly, soil cores are being taken at several crop growth
stages, frozen, and stored. Nitrogen and carbon content of the root tissue will
also be ascertained to determine if any atmospheric CO2 concentration influences
the C/N ratio.
