Title: Wireless sensor networks for traffic surveillance PI: Professor Pravin
Varaiya, University of California, Berkeley

Abstract: The proposal seeks to design, build and test low-cost wireless sensor
networks for vehicle detection in two applications: (1) freeway and urban
traffic measurement, and (2) 'smart' intersections to reduce collisions. The
network must measure vehicle presence, speed, and it must classify vehicles
(passenger cars, vans, buses, trucks). The technical challenges are to design:
(1) communication protocols that consume so little power that network nodes can
last several years with two AA batteries; (2) signal processing algorithms that
can estimate traffic characteristics with accuracies better than and latencies
lower than current technologies. Traffic surveillance systems provide the
information that is used to improve transportation system productivity through
more efficient operations (lower congestion, reduced accident rate) and better
information to travelers (reduced travel time). Highway congestion costs $70 and
accidents cost $200 billion annually. An extensive and reliable traffic
surveillance system can significantly reduce these costs. The proposed research
will also be useful in the design of sensor networks for applications in which
measurements are made periodically and must be delivered with very strict delay
guarantees.
