The aim of this research program is to explore the use of an intelligent system
to process elastic wave ultrasonic signals to obtain solutions to a large group
of source and materials characterization problems. Specifically to be studies
will be a novel neural-like intelligent processor for analyzing ultrasonic
signals in solids.
