This award will provide funds to purchase equipment to upgrade the undergraduate
biochemistry laboratory in the Biology Department at Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute. The equipment will greatly improve the advanced laboratory in
biochemistry, usually taken in the junior year. It will also allow establishment
of an introductory honors laboratory stressing biochemical methods to be taken
the previous year; with proper scheduling, much of the equipment can be used in
both courses. The upgraded biochemistry laboratory experience will improve
training, expose students to experimental science in a positive setting at a
time in which they are making key career decisions, and better prepare them for
other laboratory courses (advanced molecular biology laboratory, undergraduate
research) which usually depends on the biochemistry laboratory for preliminary
training. The grantee institution is matching this NSF award with funds from
non-Federal sources.
