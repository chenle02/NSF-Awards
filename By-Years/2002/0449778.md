The research component of this CAREER program will investigate processes leading
to the formation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA). The program will focus on
the impact of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) on SOA formation potentials,
experimentally investigate SOA formation from mixtures of aerosol forming
precursors, and evaluate the impact of temperature and relative humidity for a
discrete number of systems. The research will use a new, unique environmental
chamber for investigation of SOA processes at low NOx and hydrocarbon
concentrations that have not been possible previously. The program will advance
our understanding of gas-particle equilibria and provide a critical database for
evaluation of other current and future SOA predictive models. The results of
this work will provide critical insight into and advances in the prediction of
aerosol formation processes within the atmosphere. This research is relevant for
public policy on air pollution control, public health, and energy
strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational component of the program will
generate new teaching modules for K-12 students to understand air pollution. The
research will provide for the training of graduate and undergraduate students
both in the area of air quality research and in air quality education. The
students will be directly involved in the development and implementation of the
new K-12 modules in the local school districts by team teaching with local
educators about air quality in the region. The research program will advance
minority education by interesting local underrepresented students in the region
about air quality and by continuing to train a highly diverse student body.
