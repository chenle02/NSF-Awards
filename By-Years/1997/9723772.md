This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
will assist a junior faculty in the Department of Chemistry at Tufts University
to acquire an upgrade of an existing 300 MHz NMR Spectrometer. This equipment
will enhance research on elucidating the structures ( both `primary structures`
and three-dimensional structures) of peptide-DNA hybrids, porphyrin-DNA hybrids,
and substituted porphyrins. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the
most powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of
molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific
arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of
interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR
spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research.
The results from these NMR studies are useful in the areas such as polymers,
catalysis, and in biology
