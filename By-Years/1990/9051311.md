This award provides funds to the department of Linguistics at the University of
California, San Diego to help purchase a spectrograph (an instrument that
analyzes sound waves). The equipment will be used in the Phonetics Laboratory,
and will improve those courses in the undergraduate linguistics curriculum that
include a component relating to acoustic phonetics, a core sub-field of
phonetics that includes the study of the physical properties of speech sounds.
With the aid of this instrument, students will learn about phonetics: the
relationship among the way that the sounds are perceived. During in-class
demonstrations and experiments and in conducting their own experiments, the
interactive nature of this spectrograph additionally will allow the students to
learn the scientific method, how to form and test hypotheses, and how to design
an experiment. The grantee is matching this award with non-Federal sources.
