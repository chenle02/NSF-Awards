Laboratory model organisms, such as the lab rat, have demonstrated a clear link
between metabolism and aging, and it is well known that the evolution of
reproduction and aging can be driven by metabolic factors. Nevertheless, there
is little known, from either a theoretical or a mechanistic viewpoint, about how
the adoption of specific life history strategies can shape aging and life span
in populations facing different energetic demands. For example, in harsh
climates, is it better to invest energy into early growth and maturation and, as
a consequence, have a short life-span? This symposium will bring together an
international group of biogerontologists who work on a variety of vertebrate and
invertebrate organisms at different levels of biological organization (molecules
to populations) in order to discuss and synthesize studies of life history
evolution and its metabolic consequences. The symposium participants include men
and women from three different countries and who are at different career stages.
It is anticipated that the interaction of these scientists, who study aging from
different perspectives, will foster future collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
