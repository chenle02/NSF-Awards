9454397 Zielinski BISCITS or Biotechnology Initiative for Systemic Change in the
Teaching of Science is a program that will change the way our young people view
modern technology in science. The first and foremost way to do this is enhance
our nation's teachers ability to effect such change. In order to succeed,
BISCITS will start by retraining the workforce at both the middle and high
school level by recruiting teacher teams from school districts in the
Pennsylvania area. This retraining has many facets. First, teachers need to
become current and fluent about molecular biology and biotechnology subject
matter and the types of employment open to those students wishing to pursue
these areas as careers. Also, BISCITS will provide sessions discussing ethical
issues that are being raised by biotechnology. BISCITS will make the teacher
participants "biotechnology-literate."
