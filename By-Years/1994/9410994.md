ABSTRACT CTS-9410994 University of Massachusetts Amhers Peter Monson The
Department of Chemical Engineering at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst,
will purchase computer graphics workstations which will be dedicated to support
research in engineering. The equipment will be used for several research
projects on molecular and materials modeling, including in particular: 1.
Modeling absorption equilibrium in porous and heterogeneous solids; 2.
Theoretical studies of solid-phase thermodynamics and solid-fluid equilibrium
for non-spherical molecules and mixtures; 3. Analysis of transition-state
structures and reaction theory in gas kinetics; 4. Mechanistic modeling of
plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition; 5. Coupling agents at the adhesive
interface; and 6. Molecular simulations of nanophase materials. Visualization of
molecular, surface, and bulk atomic structures is central to the analysis of
these systems. The four co-PI's bring together an unusual combination of
expertise in molecular and materials modeling for chemical engineering,
exploiting statistical mechanics, molecular simulation and ad initio quantum
chemistry. The graphics workstations will help them create new insights, foster
synergistic collaborations, and educate chemical engineering students in the use
of computational chemistry and molecular structure.
