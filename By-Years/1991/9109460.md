The alveoli (air cells) in the lungs are coated with a lining of pulmonary
surfactant which is a complex of lipids, proteins and glycolipids. This
surfactant is essential to normal pulmonary behavior and its disruptions are
implicated in abnormal lung functioning. Dr. Amador will use a new technique,
fluorescence microscopy of model pulmonary surfactants spread upon the surface
of water to correlate the physiological effects of various native and
replacement surfactant systems with their microscopic phase behavior and the
dependence of this behavior upon biochemical composition. The goal of this
project is to enhance our understanding of the phase behavior and aggregational
properties of surfactant systems.
