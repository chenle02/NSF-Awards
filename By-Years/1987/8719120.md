Adult Djungarian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus) exhibit multiple reproductive and
thermoregulatory adjustments to a short day photoperiod. However, some
individuals in the laboratory population fail to use this photoperiod
information. Since photoperiod time measurement in mammals has a circadian
basis, the applicant examined short day sensitive (=responders) and insensitive
(=nonresponders) individuals to determine if differences in circadian function
exist between these phenotypes. Under constant environmental conditions we found
4 differences in circadian function in the nonresponders. As a group they
exhibited: 1) a longer free running period under DD, 2) a shorter duration of
activity, 3) a phase response curve which has few phase delays, and 4) less
'splitting' in their activity rhythm under LL. He has also established that
there is a genetic basis for these phenotypic differences and has developed
genetic lines to understand which aspects of circadian organization are critical
for proper photoperiod time measurement. The first experiment examines between
line difference in circadian function under constant environmental conditions,
while the second emphasizes entrainment to non-24 h light: dark cycles.
