Lukas OCE-9525986 Oceanographic data from hydrographic and upper ocean surveys
collected within the TOGA COARE (Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Response Experiment)
domain will be combined with satellite data and simple models to study the role
upper ocean processes play in modulating air-sea fluxes in the western tropical
Pacific. Of particular interest is the contribution of mesoscale and small-scale
thermohaline features the vertical fluxes of heat, moisture and momentum in the
upper ocean. Heat and salinity budgets including estimation of local and remote
three-dimensional circulation influences on vertical mixing will be computed.
The ultimate goal is to improve air-sea coupling parametrization in three-
dimensional coupled climate models.
