Issues concerning individual buildings and facilities have been one of the
primary focuses of design professionals and decision makers dealing with
earthquake hazard mitigation. A prevailing view has been that when seismic
building provisions are taken into consideration, the effects of an earthquake
on the urban fabric would be similar to the aggregate effects on individual
buildings in the total urban environment. However, buildings are not located in
isolation; the performance of buildings, infrastructure systems, and physical
urban patterns are strongly interrelated. The complex mix of lifelines and
buildings, moving in different modes, with dissimilar structural and
construction systems, oriented in numerous directions, and with diverse urban
functional capacities affect the performance of entire urban environments on a
large scale. This project will develop a set of practical guidelines that can be
effectively and smoothly integrated into existing or planned urban redevelopment
programs. A range of seismic urban planning mitigation measures will be
identified as a means of implementing additional urban design strategies in
communities located in seismic zones of high and moderate risk around the
country.
