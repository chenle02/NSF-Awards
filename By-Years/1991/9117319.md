This grant is to partially fund a workshop on low frequency electrical
precursors to earthquakes. Intense interest in this phenomena was generated in
the 1970s by Chinese reports of electrical changes prior to earthquakes; major
efforts are still underway in China. Other research efforts throughout the
world, including the U.S., have had mixed results in confirming the existence of
precursors, and matching the anomalous signal to a realistic physical model. A
recent example is the reported 0.01 to 10 Hz magnetic anomaly before the 1989
Loma Prieta earthquake. It is appropriate to review this subject with the major
international scientists working in the field and produce a report of the status
and recommended research on electrical earthquake precursors. This research is a
component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
