The investigator and his colleagues study various problems in&lt;br/&gt;the
analytic theory of L-functions and mean values of
multiplicative&lt;br/&gt;functions. In particular the investigator aims for an
improved&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the distribution of zeros of
L-functions,&lt;br/&gt;their behaviour at special values, and the size of
extreme values&lt;br/&gt;in the critical strip. The second main aim of this
project is&lt;br/&gt;to describe the spectrum of possible mean-values of
multiplicative&lt;br/&gt;functions whose values at primes are constrained to lie
in special&lt;br/&gt;subsets of the unit disc. The investigator, in
collaboration&lt;br/&gt;with Granville, intends to develop further the close
connection between&lt;br/&gt;such mean values and solutions to a family of
integral equations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project concerns
problems in the area of multiplicative&lt;br/&gt;number theory. A fundamental
problem in this area is to understand&lt;br/&gt;the zeros of the Riemann zeta
function and other L-functions. These&lt;br/&gt;functions encode much
information about prime numbers, and&lt;br/&gt;other arithmetic objects. Besides
being of intrinsic interest to&lt;br/&gt;mathematicians, ideas emerging from
these problems have found use&lt;br/&gt;in computer science, cryptography and
coding theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
