9406574 ZELDITCH This award will support the travel, lodging expenses and
registration costs for speakers in a symposium entitled "Historical patterns of
developmental integration" which will be presented at the meetings of the
American Society of Zoologists (ASZ) in January 1995. Patterns in the embryology
or development of organisms can reveal information important to understanding
the relationships among members of groups of organisms. The speakers, who
include several leaders in this field, will address important questions about
the independence vs integration or interdependence of developmental data (from
molecular to morphological) and how to incorporate such data in phylogenetic
analyses or the study of relationships among species. Proceedings of the
symposium will be published so that this information is disseminated to a wider
audience that just those individuals able to attend and hear the presentations.
%%% The talks given at this meeting will address means of incorporating
embryological or developmental information into analysis of the relationships
among living things. Sometimes, developmental information can shed important new
light on relationships. The best and most complete knowledge of the
relationships among members of different groups of living things is very
important for predicting things about the biology of related species, including
the possible occurrence or production or useful natural products such new drugs
to combat human or animal diseases. ***
