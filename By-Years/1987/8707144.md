Narrative: Production of fine titanium dioxide (TiO) powders by titanium
tetrachloride (TiCl) oxidation will be investigated experimentally in a high
temperature aerosol flow reactor. The focus of this project is on understanding
the interplay between chemical kinetics and aerosol dynamics during manufacture
of TiO particles. Detailed, simultaneous measurements of chemical kinetics and
product aerosol characteristics in an aerosol flow reactor will be made under
precisely controlled experimental conditions. The rate of TiCl oxidation will be
measured by a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrophotometer. Fundamental
reaction rate expressions will be derived. The aerosol size characteristics of
TiO will be measured by conventional aerosol instruments. The effect of dopant
silicon tetrachloride (SiCl) on product titania size and polydispersity will be
thoroughly investigated. A theory for TiO particle production will be developed
in terms of basic aerosol processes (chemical reaction, nucleation, condensation
and coagulation). This study will trigger the development of aerosol processes
for manufacture of high hiding power pigments and ceramic powders for advanced
ceramics.
