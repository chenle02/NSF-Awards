We propose to arrange US participation in the workshop entitled "Intelligent
Software: The Interface Between Algorithms and Machines", to be held on October
19-21, 2009 at the University of Edinburgh, hosted by the Centre for Numerical
Algorithms and Intelligent Software (NAIS)[1], that will support research in the
efficient application of algorithms to next generation computer architectures.
The goal of this workshop is to bring together leading US and European
researchers at the interface between computational science, applied mathematics,
and computer science to discuss algorithms pervasive in the scientific
applications community, and their implementation and deployment for evolving
target architectures. By bringing together researchers working together across
this divide, a scheme will be suggested with the goal of advancing computational
science infrastructure so that it can live up to its full potential.
