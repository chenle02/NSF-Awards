9313947 Fernandez According to the report of the Office of Science and
Technology Program, Executive Office of the President on National Critical
Technologies, "Intelligent processing equipment is the foundation of the shop
project is to investigate schemes to use applied intelligence in automated
manufacturing processing operations like Computer Numerical Control machine
tools. The term "applied intelligence" refers to the technologies: expert
(knowledge-based) systems, fuzzy logic systems, and artificial neural system
(ANS). These supporting technologies combined with robust control and automated
modeling techniques offer a tremendous potential when confronted with
unstructured environments like manufacturing processes. Real-world
(unstructured) operating conditions, such as those found in manufacturing
processes, are characterized by noisy sensor and actuators, as well as process
noise, drifts, system faults, and external disturbances. This project will
construct a "nervous system" for a machining center that will observe various
states of the machining system, :learn" the dynamics of a machining process,
construct corrective codes, and initiate control. The approach will incorporate
the "experience" into a knowledge base leaving an insightful trace about the
signal processing capabilities of artificial neural networks, knowledge
representation tools like fuzzy systems, and robust nonlinear control techniques
like sliding mode control, is designed to be "intelligent". *** v s t M (
