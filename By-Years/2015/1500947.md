The goal of Dynamical Systems theory is to describe the long run behavior of a
body or of a collection of particles subject to laws of motion. It is often the
case that full knowledge of the particles' position and velocity are not exact.
As a particle moves after a unit of time (say a day), the new position is not
known exactly. In this project such systems are studied. The goal is to show
that the long run behavior of the collection of particles is governed by some
probability distribution in the phase space. The distribution should have nice
geometric properties. While the "chaotic" behavior of these system is by
definition impossible to be exactly predicted there are systems which are
described by algebraic equations where researchers can probabilistically study
the long run behavior.

The random iteration of diffeomorphisms is an important model for different
types of dynamical systems. The PI plans to study these random iterations and
gives a precise (as precise as possible) description of the stationary measure
associated with it, particularly its geometric properties. Once geometric
properties are established, some statistical properties can be deduced as
corollaries, for example, the equidistribution of almost every orbit with
respect to volume. This project will develop in two additional directions. One
concerns dynamical systems with multidimensional time (i.e. actions of higher
rank groups) and the other concerns classical dynamical systems (i.e. one
dimensional time) displaying some uniform (though possibly partial)
hyperbolicity. The unifying theme in the study is the techniques used which
involve the interactions between measure theoretical and topological properties
of a system. In all cases a description of relevant invariant measures is
desired, how this impacts the topological dynamics and ultimately how this
affects the topology of the ambient manifold. The PI also seeks intermediate
interactions, for instance how the topology of the manifold imposes restrictions
on the dynamics.
