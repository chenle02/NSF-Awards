An important aspect of cell growth--how necessary nutrients get into the cell
(transport)--is poorly understood in terms of ther actual molecular mechanisms
of transport and the proteins responsible for it. The proline transport mutants
of Salmonella will be used for studies of the molecular mechanism of sodium-
driven transport. By selection for particular classes of mutants, domains of the
protease involved in substrate binding and translocation will be identified;
with the aid of site directed mutagenesis of the implicated residues it whould
be possible to test the predicted roles of certain amino acids and come to
understand, with the aid of biochemical and biophysical approaches, the
conformational changes necessary for substrate translocation. Elucidation of the
structure-function relationships of ion-driven transport proteins should result
from such examinations.
