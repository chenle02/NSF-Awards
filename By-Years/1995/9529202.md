This research project, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry program
of the Chemistry Division, develops new methods for the preparation of thin film
heterostructures. Layer-by-layer growth of inorganic thin films exhibiting
covalent and non-covalent interactions between layers are prepared and
characterized. Interlayer molecular recognition and template based synthesis of
two dimensional structures is carried out in this work. The rational design of
sensor materials using these approaches is a focus of this research. These
materials show promising technological applications as small molecule sensors
and optoelectronic materials. The rational design and synthesis of thin layer
inorganic materials which exhibit particular properties is the goal of this
research project. Using methods based on molecular recognition and an
understanding of interlayer interactions, thin layer materials are designed and
constructed, their structure and properties determined, and their technological
application evaluated. Novel sensors, and electronic and optical materials will
result from the work of this research program.
