Topology is a branch of mathematics which investigates qualitative aspects of
geometry and analysis through an abstractions of notions such as limits,
continuity, connectedness, and convergence. This subject is central to modern
mathematics and has a rich history stretching back more than a century. TOPOSYM
is a series of international topology conferences held in Prague, Czech
Republic, in a five- year cycle since 1961. The conference has long served as a
geographic and intellectual meeting point. On one hand it has a large attendance
both from North America (and the US in particular) and from Europe (and Eastern
Europe in particular). On the other, a large cross section of the more
analytical side of topology is represented at the meeting. The Twelfth Symposium
on General Topology (TOPOSYM 2016) will be held July 25-29, 2016 in Prague,
Czech Republic, under the auspices of the Institute of Mathematics of the Czech
Academy of Sciences and the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics of the Charles
University. This grant will support the US based participants who attend the
symposium.

The conference covers a broad range of topics on the more analytical side of
topology: general and set-theoretic topology, descriptive set theory, continuum
theory, topological dynamics, topology in functional analysis and algebra, and
categorical topology. The conference will contain invited lectures by many
leaders in the field of general and set-theoretic topology: A. Arhangel'skii, L.
Aurichi, D. Dikranjan, A. Dow, M. Hrusak, O. Kalenda, A. Kechris, P. Koszmider,
M. Krupski, W. Kubis, A. Kwiatkowska, J. Lopez-Abad, V. Martinez de la Vega, J.
Melleray, J. van Mill, A. Miller, J. Moore, C. Mouron, L. Nguyen Van The, L.
Oversteegen, C. Rosendal, M. Sabok, S. Solecki, L. Soukup, M. Tkachenko, S.
Todorcevic, T. Usuba, B. Weiss. The primary goal of the conference is to aid in
the dissemination of the knowledge of these speakers. In addition to this,
collecting such a group of experts at a meeting will inevitably lead to new
collaborations and the furthering of basic research in the field of topology.
