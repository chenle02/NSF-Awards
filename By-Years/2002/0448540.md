User interfaces for pen-stylus systems have not managed to deliver the fluid,
seamless, natural interaction afforded by pen and paper interfaces, as evidenced
by a resurgence of thumb keyboards, soft keyboards, and innovative mappings of
numeric keypads to alphanumeric characters. In this project the PI will study
the effectiveness of, and explore potential enhancements to, traditional
pen/stylus interfaces. The goal is to identify techniques for managing,
displaying, and supporting user interaction with ambiguous results while
maintaining the fluidity of the pen-based interface. To these ends, the PI will
develop advanced AI/pattern recognition models of the information contained by
applications, advanced and novel algorithms that use these models to reason
intelligently about user intention in interfaces, and prototype applications
centered on these algorithms. The PI will test his models in both traditional
laboratory and real world settings, including in novel applications to enhance
students' learning experiences through incorporation of this research into a
deployed smart classroom environment. Major outcomes of the project will be a
characterization of when, where, and how intelligence can be incorporated into
pen-based interfaces, and a series of specific principles for intelligent
interface design in pen systems to guide research in other areas of
HCI.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The PI's institution is RUI-eligible,
and approximately 40% of the students are of Hispanic, African American, Pacific
Islander, Filipino, and other non-Asian/Caucasian backgrounds. Furthermore, the
PI's department currently enjoys almost no external research funding. Thus, this
project, coupled with the planned integration of the work into an educational
environment, will expose a large number of students to research experiences and
educational opportunities they otherwise would not have.
