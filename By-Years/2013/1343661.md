The PIs develop a conceptual architecture for the EarthCube program. The
conceptual architecture&lt;br/&gt;will serve as the blueprint for the
definition, construction, and deployment of both existing&lt;br/&gt;and new
components to ensure that they can be unified and integrated into a evolutionary
national&lt;br/&gt;infrastructure for EarthCube. They intend to create a concept
that incorporates findings and&lt;br/&gt;requirements from ongoing EarthCube
activities as well as other cross-agency Earth Science&lt;br/&gt;informatics
efforts. The architecture models will be a roadmap for building an
extensible&lt;br/&gt;and sustainable EarthCube system that facilitates new
science and inspires substantive participation&lt;br/&gt;of a broad spectrum of
geoscientists. The project team is led by a group of computer
scientists&lt;br/&gt;from National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)
and private industry that has extensive&lt;br/&gt;experience and a proven track
record leading the architecture, design and development of complex&lt;br/&gt;and
data intensive science data systems. They will specifically focus on the
development of&lt;br/&gt;a guiding architecture report and specification.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this EarthCube architecture study can
intellectually&lt;br/&gt;contribute to other scientific and agency efforts as
they are studying new architectural models&lt;br/&gt;to address scientific data
management and discovery in the big data era.
