High redshift quasars will be used to study the distribution and state of matter
at early epochs of the universe. The radiation from quasars passes through the
gas in intervening galaxies. The gas in the galaxies can be studied by studying
the absorption lines of the quasar spectrum. Observations at radio and optical
wavelengths and theoretical analysis and simulations will be made to improve our
understanding of the stages of galaxy evolution at redshifts from 1.8 to 4. The
study will include both the detailed investigation of particular objects that
have been identified to be of special interest and new survey work to answer
statistical questions as well as providing new objects for follow-up work. The
principle goal is completion of a study of a population of Quasi-Stellar Object
(QSO) absorption systems that are characterized by heavily damped Lyman alpha
hydrogen lines, they appear to be the progenitors of galactic disks. A search
will be made for radiation emitted by stars that are presumably responsible for
the production of heavy elements. The stars emit ionizing radiation which is
converted to Lyman alpha by the neutral hydrogen (HI) layer. Thus, the ionizing
flux is concentrated in the Lyman alpha line which subsequently escapes and may
be detected in the spectrum. Surveys for dust in the damped systems,
hydrodynamic simulations of the collapse to "HI disks", and further radio
investigations of both nearby disk galaxies and redshifted 21 cm wavelength
hydrogen line absorption systems will be carried out.
