This work is aimed at the study of why some metal atoms in single layers are
metallic and others are not. Overlayers of metals on oxygen and carbon monoxide
on tungsten(110), the oxygen chemisorption and heterogeneous oxidation of carbon
monoxide, water formation and other surface reactions on bimetallic substrates
like palladium on tungsten (110) are proposed for study.
