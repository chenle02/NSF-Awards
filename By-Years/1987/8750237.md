This project will make innovative use of the microwave network being installed
by the State of North Carolina to link the Asheville campus to the North
Carolina Microelectronics Center. Using IBM PC AT's as workstations, students
will be able to use the computing power of the Center remotely. Thus, at modest
cost, fairly sophisticated design can be done at the undergraduate level in this
emerging field.
