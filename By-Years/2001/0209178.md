This workshop is for university faculty, department heads and deans as well as
economists, nationally recognized experts from the electric power industry, and
experts in adaptive systems to explore advanced research needs in the fields of
Economics, Power Systems and Adaptive Systems. The workshop is intended to
identify the basic theoretical problems now facing the electric, power industry
in the United States and suggest research needs that can be addressed by NSF in
the future. This is the second of a series of three NSF/EPRI workshops, whose
ultimate goal is to promote research leading to new solutions to existing
problems facing the electric power industry.
