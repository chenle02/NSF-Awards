Development of a cost-effective production finishing process is pivotal for
commercial success of structural precision ceramic components. High-speed
grinding of ceramics has emerged as a viable potential candidate for such
finishing operation. However, unlike metals, ceramics are brittle and highly
sensitive to process induced surface and sub-surface damages in the finished
part. Process damage may be minimized by maintaining force/abrasive grit below a
critical threshold. This, however, imposes an extremely small material removal
rate that is an order of magnitude lower than that required for commercial
viability. Current efforts focus on improving material removal rate under these
constraints. This research project seeks to explore new design avenues,
particularly for very high-speed grinding, above the current critical thresholds
of depth of cut and feed/grit. The objectives of the research are: (1) to
establish and experimentally validate a mechanistic model of material removal
and associated damage evolution in high-speed machining; (2) to use the
validated model to investigate the roles of two new design parameters:
impulse/grit and intermittent unloading; and (3) to implement and investigate
new design states in existing surface grinding facilities. The project will
establish the potential of new design avenues for precision ceramic grinding
that may deliver very high material removal rate while minimizing residual
damage in the finished part. This can have significant impact on the efficiency
and effectiveness of finished brittle materials including structural ceramic
parts and optical components, as well as processing of silicon wafers for
electronic applications.
