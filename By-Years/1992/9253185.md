The Lawrence Hall of Science at the University of California at Berkeley will
be the site of a three-year Primary Leadership Institute in Science and
Mathematics (PRISM) for teams of K-3 teachers and teacher educators nationwide.
PRISM is based on a previously NSF-funded program, and will provide education in
both content and instructional strategies, as well as preparing teachers to
serve as specialists and providers of inservice. A 4-week summer institute
providing 120 hours of educational enhancement to 30 teachers and specialists
will be offered each year (90 teachers/3 years). During the academic year,
participants will receive a regular newsletter, mini-grants to support school-
year leadership activities, and will attend leadership conferences. A new facet
of this project is the involvement of 20 teacher educators (60 total) each
project year from institutions nationwide. These teacher educators will attend
the PRISM Institute for one week to receive inservice specific to adapting the
PRISM model for use with teachers in their areas. This leadership proposal is
appropriate for teacher enhancement because it is designed to enhance the
science knowledge and teaching, and develop leadership skills and efforts of
teachers of grades K-3, and because it will also provide a 1-week workshop for
science educators who will be teamed with teacher participants when possible;
thus the project will have far-reaching impact, not only through the efforts of
teacher participants, but also through the pre- service and classroom teachers
reached by participating teacher educators. Non-NSF cost-sharing is
approximately 28% of the amount requested from NSF.
