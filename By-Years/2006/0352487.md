In this award, supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Prof. Lester Andrews of the University of Virginia will
conduct research to study the infrared absorption spectroscopy of exotic species
prepared in a reactive, solid hydrogen matrix. The experiments will be
supplemented with quantum chemical calculations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides
the applications of the present work towards developing a deeper understanding
of some interesting metal hydride systems, the work will provide basic
information that will be useful for the further development of hydrogen storage
materials and will provide a better understanding of the reactions of the
actinides. Prof. Andrews will continue to mentor graduate and postdoctoral
researchers, many of whom have gone on to serve at national laboratories, as
well as continuing his many active collaborations - both domestic and
abroad.&lt;br/&gt;
