This grant funds the Southern California Probability Symposium, a conference at
UC San Diego, May 20-21, 2023. It is an expanded version of an annual gathering,
meant to set the stage for the next 50 years of this important showcase of
research in probability theory and related fields in the Southern California
community. The primary goal of the grant is to fund the travel and local
expenses of those plenary speakers who are non-local and do not have separate
funding, along with the travel expenses of up to 24 participants from Southern
California and nearby areas. The funding prioritizes participant funding for
early career researchers and researchers traditionally underrepresented in STEM
fields. The principal function of this conference is the promotion and exchange
of research ideas in the Southern California probability community.

The two-day event features 5 distinguished plenary talks. Also featured are
several talks by early career researchers from Southern California, and a poster
session for other participants, especially graduate students and postdocs to
communicate their current work. The schedule is designed to foster small group
discussions and new collaborations among participants, growing the connections
and research accomplishments of the strong probability community in the region.
In a world that is ever more data and technology dependent, with models of
randomness playing a central role in all parts of science, conferences like this
are key to the development of new avenues for progress on real-world
applications in the years to come. The website for the Symposium is
