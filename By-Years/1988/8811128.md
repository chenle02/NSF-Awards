The advent of systematic studies of space plasmas by large- scale and
sophisticated computer simulations has brought in an exciting era to S/T
research and has become an important component of the discipline. This grant
will support a numerical study closely corroborated with analytical theory and
observations. It will continue research on the generic problems of driven
reconnection, current interruption, and magnetic energy release and their
manifestations in magnetospheric and solar plasmas. This work is based on the
following hypotheses: (i) Energetic substorms are primarily a process
characterized not by a spontaneous tearing process, but by driven linear and
nonlinear instabilities. Solar flares are the source of magnetic wind
disturbances, which induce the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in the magnetopause
and in turn trigger substorms; (ii) The onset of coronal flares is quite rapid
and violent and is often a process (once again) driven by adjacent current
carrying coronal loops or photospheric mechanical motion; (iii) this mechanical
motion is a manifestation of a more global motion of flux loops or matter
beneath the photosphere through magnetic buoyancy and convective instabilities.
One example of such coupling: the twisting of current ropes beneath the
photosphere causes buoyancy of the ropes and conversely the emergence of loops
in sheared magnetic fields gives rise to twisted loops. It is intended to piece
together the dynamic interplay of these physical processes using insights
obtained from simulation studies. The overall aim is to understand the basic
plasma physical processes at the sun and their impact at the earth.
