The Third National Conference on Doctoral Programs in Mathematics Education will
bring together a group of faculty members in mathematics education from a range
of institutions that currently graduate doctorates in mathematics education. The
conference participants will learn about current issues that impact doctoral
programs and they will have the opportunity to leverage common strengths to make
improvements to their individual programs. The conference will focus on two
goals: (1) articulate and update principles related to high-quality doctoral
programs in mathematics education; and (2) identify and disseminate information
about specific doctoral programs specializations in mathematics education. The
conference will share the products with a range of audiences in mathematics,
mathematics education, teacher education, and educational research.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The products for the conference include: (1) an updated
Principles to Guide the Design and Implementation of Doctoral Programs in
Mathematics Education document which will be available in the website of
pertinent professional associations; and (2) a mechanism for institutions and
future doctoral students to search and connect with different program
specializations. The project will organize more than 100 participants in working
groups around the two goals during the conference. The working groups will have
the opportunity to continue the work in subsequent meetings to collaborate on
the products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12)
seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology,
engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through
research and development of innovative resources, models and tools. Projects in
the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior
research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical
justification for proposed projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
