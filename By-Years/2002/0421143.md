This award supports the acquisition of a confocal laser scanning microscope
(CLSM) to be used in studies of microbial ecology including: (1) the
identification via gene probes of novel intracellular pathogens of amoebae, (2)
termite gut prokaryote symbionts, (3) ecology of food-borne bacteria with
respect to environmental protozoa, (4) the identification of food vacuole
contents of bacteria-feeding protozoa in nature, and (5) the feeding rates and
selectivity of bacterivorous protists, including those with algal symbionts. The
CLSM will enhance and promote research at Tennessee Technological University as
well as at Middle Tennessee State University, a nearby state institution that
will have access to this instrument.
