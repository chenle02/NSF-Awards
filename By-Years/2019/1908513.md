In this project the Principle Investigator (PI) will work on some fundamental
problems in a field of mathematics called differential geometry. Although
differential geometry is branch of pure mathematics, the methods it employs and
its results play a fundamental role in our understanding of the Universe. For
example, String Theory, which is potentially the "theory of everything" in
physics, uses a lot of tools from differential geometry. The PI plans to do work
in the part of differential geometry which is closely related to string theory.
The PI will also be involved in many K-12 educational activities and will be
deeply involved in the creation and innovation of both undergraduate and
graduate courses at the University of California at Irvine. The award will
support graduate students working on their dissertations under the direction of
the PI.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More specifically, the PI plans to work
on several important problems in Kahler geometry and spectral theory. In Kahler
geometry he will continue his long term project on the analysis of the Bergman
kernel and its relation to analysis on manifolds with bundle valued sections. In
spectral theory, he will continue to study the essential spectrum of the
Laplacian on differential forms on complete non-compact manifolds, and study
inverse spectral problems. These two parts of work will be combined when the PI
studies the geometry of Calabi-Yau moduli. In most cases, Calabi-Yau moduli are
not complete manifolds, and therefore the PI needs to generalize the spectrum
results onto incomplete manifolds before doing more non-linear analysis on
them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
