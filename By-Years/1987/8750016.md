A recently acquired Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectrophotometer is being used
in undergraduate instruction in organic, inorganic, physical, and
analytical/instrumental chemistry at Luther College. This instrument system,
with its enhanced resolution and variable temperature capability allows students
first hand experience in the study of molecular structure, stereochemistry,
reaction kinetics and thermodynamics.
