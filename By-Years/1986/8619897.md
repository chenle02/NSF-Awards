Although the implantation of hip joints and other bone replacements are an
astounding success, they are plagued by a relative short life span of the
patient who receives the implant. Thus, it is necessary to develop new materials
which will have longer life and greater biocompatibility. The purpose of this
research is to develop a new type of material, called a composite, that results
from combining several materials into a more optimal single material. These new
materials should be a major improvement for use in the construction of
implantable devices. There will also be development of new testing techniques
which will most likely affect other areas of materials research as well.
