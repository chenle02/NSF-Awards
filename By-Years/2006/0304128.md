PROPOSAL: 0304128 PI: Patrick Doyle, MIT ABSTRACT

This proposal was received in response to Nanoscale Science and Engineering
initiative, NSF 02-148, category NIRT.

The proposed research program focuses on using magnetic fluids (based on
magnetic nanoparticles) and fields to develop new methods of separation of
biological particles such as cell fragments, DNA, viruses and inclusion bodies
in bioMEMs devices and for controlling cell function. Process fluids will be
seeded with nanoscopic (10-20 nm) magnetic particles suspended in a fluid phase
to form magnetic fluids. Control of the spatial distribution of the
nanoparticles will attained by manipulation of the direction and strength of the
applied magnetic fields. Non-magnetic biological entities suspended in such a
fluid would be subjected to magnetophoretic forces under a magnetic field
gradient, and their migration rates will be determined by their size and
morphology, which will permit separations based on density, size, and perhaps
charge. In a related approach, magnetic beads will be aligned in an arroy of
columns, and this array can serve as an effective sieving medium for the
electrophoretic resolution of DNA fragments.

The project is being funded by two programs within CTS: Particulate and
Multiphase Processes and Fluid Dynamics and Hydraulics
