Saint Joseph?s University has received funding from the National Science
Foundation for a laser scanning confocal microscope to be used for research and
research training by faculty, Master?s students, and undergraduate students in
Physics and Biology. The researchers who need this capability are addressing a
range of topics, including properties of colloidal suspensions, how cells
maintain their shape and move sub-cellular particles, and how disease-causing
organisms interact with their hosts. The two departments are working together to
broaden the impact of overlap in research interests, especially given the
current importance of interdisciplinary approaches in Biophysics, and this
equipment will provide a focal point for collaboration. Availability of confocal
microscopy will also help attract applicants for a new Biophysics faculty
position that will promote truly interdisciplinary research. &lt;br/&gt;As a
primarily undergraduate institution with a traditional MS program in Biology,
Saint Joseph?s is committed to the faculty-student research model. Each year
about 30 students do summer research in math and science, including those
seeking a five-year combined BS in science/ MS in education. Graduate and
undergraduate students with interests in biophysics, and cell/ molecular fields
will especially benefit from experience with confocal microscopy. As a Jesuit
university, Saint Joseph?s seeks to promote an understanding of social justice
issues and constructive action addressing inequalities. Each year some of the
most talented research students bring hands-on science to underserved children
through NSF GK-12-funded activities. The equipment provided by this funding will
help faculty provide these future scientists with training in current
techniques, coupled with experience in how to share what they have learned as
widely as possible. &lt;br/&gt;
