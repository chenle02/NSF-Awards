The purpose of this US-China collaborative research project is to develop
techniques to synthesize and then process poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET)
fibers so that they have ultra high strength as well as a high melting
temperature. The material will be made in two steps: first, solid state
polymerization will be used to produce the ultra-high molecular weight linear
polymer, followed by solution/gel spinning to orient the long chain molecules.
The international collaboration will benefit both principal investigators (PI)
who have different and complementary expertise and equipment: the American PI
Hsieh has the instrumentation for fiber analysis and polymer characterization,
while the Chinese PI has the expertise and facility for fiber spinning.
