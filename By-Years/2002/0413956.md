This action funds a third year extension of an NSF Minority Postdoctoral
Research Fellowship for FY 2002. The goal of the fellowship is to increase the
participation of minority scientists at the postdoctoral level and to prepare
them for positions of scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain
this goal, the fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training and
research of the highest quality to recent doctoral recipients. It is expected
that Fellows supported through these fellowships will play important roles in
training of the future workforce. The research and training plan examines the
covariance between conflict intensity and male trail exploitation, life history
consequences, and rates of mutation in Drosophila.
