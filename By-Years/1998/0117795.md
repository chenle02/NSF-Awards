The goal of this Nanoscale Science and Engineering Center is to study the
fundamental properties of nanoscale structures with a view toward their possible
use in novel electronic and magnetic devices. The work will concentrate on the
movement of spins and charges, including their quantum behavior. The following
important questions will be addressed at the same time: How can nanoscale
structures be grown and fabricated? How can they be images and probed? What are
the fundamental behaviors of charge and spin?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center
addresses these questions through research that encompasses four areas: the
Growth of Nanoscale Structures; Scanned Probed Microscopy of Charges and Spins;
Spin and Charge in Nanocrystals and Nanomagnets; and Coherent Electronics. These
interdisciplinary topics bring together sixteen participants from three
universities, Harvard University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and
the University of California, Santa Barbara. The Center maintains close
collaborations with Sandia, Oak Ridge, and Brookhaven National Laboratories, and
active international collaborations with the Delft University of Technology and
the University of Tokyo. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center presents the basic
concepts and the possible benefits of nanoscale science and engineering to the
public at all levels. The Museum of Science in Boston works with Center faculty
to develop exhibits and workshops for the general public. An early awareness
outreach program for the Cambridge public schools brings middle school students
to Harvard to learn about college education from faculty and students, a program
that is being expanded to include Boston public schools. These activities are
supplemented by active involvement of undergraduates and high school teachers in
the research activities ongoing at the Center. A Postdoctoral Research
Fellowship for Women and Minorities is being established to attract outstanding
candidates to university research.&lt;br/&gt;
