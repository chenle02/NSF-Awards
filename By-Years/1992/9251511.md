The goal of the project is to expand and improve the existing curriculum and
teaching capabilities in computer-assisted cartography, geographic information
systems (GIS) and remote sensing in the Department of Geography, University of
Idaho. The new laboratory equipment includes PC workstations, data input and
output devices (digitizers and plotters) and a local area network to provide
transfer capability of files from IBM compatible workstations to Macintosh
workstations as well as with the campus-wide electronic network. This will
provide a versatile laboratory for undergraduate instruction in computer
assisted geographic information technologies. A series of lab sessions based on
the proposed equipment has been designed that will address a missing component
of the curriculum, learning and mastering tools and skills to address
theoretical problems and applied techniques needed in the present computer-aided
job market. The laboratory improvement is part of a larger development program
for the College of Mines and Earth Resources.
