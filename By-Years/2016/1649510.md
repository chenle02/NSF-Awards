1649510 &lt;br/&gt;Zhuang, Jie &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Food production is closely
linked to energy consumption, water/soil resources, and ecosystem conditions.
This workshop aims to develop an integrative research, education, and industry
agenda for securing food production, producing clean energy, protecting water
resources, and improving soil productivity while developing economy and social
wellbeing. Conference sessions and panel discussions will address important
issues from an international perspective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specific workshop
topics include: (1) Food Security and Safety - The workshop will overview the
existing problems and potential risks associated with food production in terms
of the demands of food quantity and quality. New methods of characterizing the
cycling processes of matter and energy in agroecosystems will be discussed; (2)
Energy Efficiency and Impact - Workshop participants will discuss specific
technologies and policies that offer the greatest possibility of high efficient
utilization of fossil fuels and renewable energy resources including biomass and
water. The workshop is expected to create international joint research teams to
further investigate these issues from life cycle and multi-dimensional
perspectives; (3) Water Efficiency and Recycling - Workshop participants will
exchange technologies and perspectives on water-saving agriculture and
wastewater utilization. In particular, urban storm water management will be
addressed; (4) Soil Productivity and Remediation - The workshop will address the
latest approaches to promoting soil fertility and productivity and safe use of
contaminated arable lands for food or non-food purposes. A joint team is
expected to be establish for developing modeling tools that could predict
threshold values of contaminants (especially heavy metals) for ensuring food
quality and ecosystem health.
