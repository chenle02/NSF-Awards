The primary objective of the research is to examine the potential for
generating and employing generic Concurrent Engineering (CE) design protocols
that would improve design efforts by adding consistency, while facilitating
communications and data sharing. Sub-objectives and methods are as follows: (1)
examine the detail of CE design protocols for two examples of two specific
component types in each of two specific manufacturing organizations; (2) explore
the potential for consistency of the detailed CE design protocol within a
consistent component- type/design-culture using non-parametric analysis of
variance; (3) develop strawman protocols for four component/organizations; (4)
conceptually design an attempt to prototype a computerized project management
system to operate in conjunction with the protocol items. The significance of
the effort is in the knowledge of whether world class CE follows generic
protocols in consistent situations and whether such protocols can be implemented
through a project management system.
