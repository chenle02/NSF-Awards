9617477 Rinaldi In this grant, two- and three-dimensional nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) triple techniques (together with isotropic labeling in some
cases) are being used to study problems in polymer structure, polymer formation
and degradation mechanisms, and polymer reactivity. Methods which have been used
for years in structural biology are being adapted for application in polymer
science and new methods are being developed which are uniquely suited for the
study of polymers. These methods allow selective probing of the structure and
transformations which occur in one small part of a large molecule without
interference from the signals from the rest of the molecule. %%% These
techniques are being used to study the structure of polymer block junctions,
polymer chain ends and defects, and the mechanisms of various polymer reactions.
A knowledge of these structures provides valuable insight into polymer formation
and stability. The materials being studied are important for the manufacture of
rubber products, plastics, semiconductors, and biomedical engineering materials.
