Abstract Horn This proposal requests partial support for a joint meeting of the
Southeastern-Atlantic Region and the Midwest Conferences on Differential
Equations to be held at Vanderbilt University on November 7-9, 1997. These joint
meetings occur at five year intervals and rotate among the campuses of the
participating institutions. Particular emphasis is given to supporting the
participation of women, minorities, and young investigators, and one of the
primary goals is to fund advanced graduate students and recent PhDs, allowing
them to present their own research and interact with the broader mathematical
community.
