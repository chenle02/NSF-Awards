Conference on Communication and Cooperation (INC) to be held at IMEC Leuven, on
May 10-12, 2016. The event will address research areas in nanotechnology, nano-
optics and nanoelectronics. Academics and industry leaders will be able to
interact on the latest issues in nanotechnology and the links with related
areas, such as biotechnology, advanced materials development, microsystems and
photonics will be explored. The conference will target world regional groups co-
operate to implement strategic and beneficial cooperative programs to progress
mankind's development through nanotechnology and its associated intellectual
merits.
