A new examination of trace metal-particle associations is proposed based on
evidence supporting the hypothesis that dissolved barium gets its "nutrient
like" distribution in the ocean, not through active uptake by phytoplankton
during photosynthesis, but through barite precipitation in particulate
microenvironment containing decaying organic matter and the remains of siliceous
plankton. Diatom culturing (growth and death) experiments designed to test the
hypothesis that barite precipitation dominantly occurs in particulate matter
micro- environments will form the basis for this study. This study will
contribute to the mechanistic framework needed for interpretation of existing
trace metal profiles and provide additional rationale for future particulate and
dissolved trace metal measurements in the worlds's oceans.
