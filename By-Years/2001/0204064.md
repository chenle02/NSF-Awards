0204064&lt;br/&gt;Teasdale&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The International Research
Fellowship Program enables U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to
twenty-four months of research abroad. The program's awards provide
opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary
facilities, expertise and experimental conditions
abroad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support a twenty-four month
research fellowship by Dr. Rachel Teasdale to work with Dr. Steve Sparks at the
University of Bristol in the United Kingdom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of
this project is to quantify the crystallinities of basaltic lava flows to
increase understanding the conditions that occur prior to eruption and during
transport. The PI will measure crystallinities from magmas with high volatile
content from non-gassed submarine lava flows and experimentally produced lavas
at variable volatile content; combine crystallinity data collected from
degassing experiments with crystallinities that develop in the open flow channel
at atmosphere pressure cooling experiments and she will develop an analog flow
model for morphology-crystallinity behavior. This project, with its modeling and
observations to determine the characteristics of lava flow behavior, will have
an impact on public safety issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Sparks is a leader
in the study of volcanic flows and has expertise in the area of crystallization
of lava flows.&lt;br/&gt;
