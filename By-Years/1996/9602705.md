Long Island University, established in 1926 in Brooklyn, NY, is the recipient
of ARI funds to relocate, consolidate, and renovate existing research space for
the Departments of Biology and Chemistry in Metcalfe Hall. Constructed in 1927,
research space as currently configured in Metcalfe Hall cannot adequately
support research in biology and chemistry. Research activities are dispersed
over six floors of Metcalfe and between two buildings creating an inconvenient,
inefficient and discouraging arrangement for research groups. Biology faculty
and students conduct research in the areas of molecular biology, cell biology,
microbiology, and developmental biology, as Chemistry faculty and students
engage in studies involving organic, inorganic, biochemistry, materials science,
and theoretical calculations. Consolidating disparate spaces into two centrally
cohesive research facilities will improve the overall efficiency of the research
enterprise at the University. In addition to reconfiguring space, renovations
will include: the upgrade of plumbing, air conditioning and lighting systems,
removal of asbestos, the installation of fume hoods, exhausts ducts, and
ensuring that laboratories meet ADA specifications. Fixed equipment, including
an autoclave, cold room and water distiller will also be installed. The creating
of focused and integrated research facilities will have a major impact on the
quality and quantity of scientific research performed, and will provide research
opportunities not feasible with current facilities. Reflecting the rich ethnic
and racial diversity of its urban environment, revitalized research facilities
will sustain Long Island University in its endeavor to provide a quality
education for minority students and equip all students with the scientific
skills needed to compete in a changing technological society.
