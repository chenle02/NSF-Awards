Algebraic geometry is concerned with geometrically understanding algebraic
varieties -- the spaces of solutions to polynomial equations -- in order to
solve algebraic equations. Abelian varieties are especially interesting because
these spaces possess the structure of an Abelian group, that is, the points of
the space can be added to each other to produce other points. Abelian varieties
appear ubiquitously in mathematics as important invariants of more complicated
varieties and are therefore a crucial tool in algebraic geometry, number theory,
representation theory, and complex analysis. This research project aims to
understand how algebraic varieties vary in families by studying the geometry of
the moduli spaces that parametrize abelian varieties and related
objects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More specifically, the project is concerned with
hyperbolicity phenomena in locally symmetric varieties. Some such varieties can
be interpreted as moduli spaces of Hodge structures, and in those cases
hyperboliciity relates to the fact that the existence of variations of those
Hodge structures (for example the periods of abelian varieties or hyperk√§hler
varieties) over a base B imposes strong conditions on the birational geometry of
B. This is closely related to conjectural uniform boundedness properties of such
variations over varying bases B, which in turn strongly parallel conjectural
boundedness properties exhibited by Galois representations coming from geometry
over arithmetic bases. The project aims to expand upon new techniques recently
developed by the investigator and collaborators to explore such phenomena, both
in the geometric and arithmetic contexts.
