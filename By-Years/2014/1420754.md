Under the supervision of Prof. Tanya Luhrmann, Ph.D. student Alexa Hagerty will
investigate the practices of forensic scientists involved in humanitarian
exhumation. By using semi-structured interviews, surveys and participation in
the daily activities at exhumation sites, labs, storage facilities and family
homes, the researcher will explore what humanitarian exhumation means to those
most intimately involved: forensic teams and families of the missing.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite the stated aim of engaging in 'science in service
of families',forensic scientists undertaking humanitarian exhumation are often
shocked and dismayed to learn that family members oppose exhumation. By
undertaking ethnographic research with a forensics team that pioneered this
young field and is the leader in terms of training of other teams
internationally, the co-PI will be able to advise forensic scientists on how to
better achieve their aims. In addition to resulting in a dissertation, the
findings will be shared with forensic scientists at the American Academy of
Forensic Sciences conference.
