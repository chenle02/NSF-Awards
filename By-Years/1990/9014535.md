In developing countries with market economies, small-scale enterprises are a
growing part of rural nonfarm economic activity. Women's participation in rural
small-scale enterprises is gaining increased recognition. Despite the increased
interest in rural women's small-scale enterprise activity, little attention has
been directed toward the spatial dimensions that may constrain or encourage
women's enterprises. This doctoral dissertation research will investigate the
impact of isolation from principal market centers on the establishment and
management of small-scale enterprises by women in Kenya. Adjustments that women
make in managing small-scale enterprises as they attempt to meet their
obligations as providers for their families through a combination of many
different productive activities may be related to their carrying out business
transactions in more isolated markets, such as periodic markets, or in village-
level markets. The project will use questionnaires administered to women
entrepreneurs in rural districts. Responses will provide a database for testing
hypotheses that examine differences in the operations of women's small-scale
enterprises in association with more isolated and less sophisticated rural
markets. By addressing influences of spatial isolation on women's economic
development, the project will add an innovative empirical and theoretical study
to the growing body of geographical research on development-related issues. It
will provide information to assist in the formulation of specific policy plans
for enhancing the more complete participation of women in rural development. The
project also will provide an excellent opportunity for a promising young scholar
to continue to develop independent research skills.
