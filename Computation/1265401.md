Numerical Modeling of Fluids and Structures at the 9th International Conference
on Large-Scale Scientific Computations (LSSC) in Sozopol, Bulgaria from June
3-7, 2013.

The investigators and his colleagues are organizing a special session on
Numerical Modeling of Fluids and Structures at the 9th International Conference
on Large-Scale Scientific Computations (LSSC) in Sozopol, Bulgaria from June
3-7, 2013. This minisymposium focuses on developing, investigating, and applying
fundamental mathematical theories and advanced modeling and simulation
techniques to various multiphysics and multiscale problems, especially fluid-
structure interactions. Key scientific questions addressed in this session have
a wide range of applications, including magnetorheological fluids, aerodynamics,
biomedical applications, micro-electro-mechanical systems, and ground water
modeling.

This special session supports participation of students, postdocs, and junior
researchers from the United States, who are working in areas related to the
modeling and simulation of fluids, structures, and their interactions. The
workshop environment promotes contacts between researchers from the United
States and other countries, including theorists and experimentalists from
applied mathematics, computational science and engineering. Mutually beneficial
discussions between junior and senior researchers and mathematicians and
engineers are expected. The special session is mainly organized by junior
researchers and, along with other young participants, makes their research
highly visible to the rest of the scientific community, providing them the
access to various application fields for which they can contribute many
advancements.
