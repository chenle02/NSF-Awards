The past decade has seen the emergence of several epidemics of deadly viral
diseases, most notably, COVID-19. A key front-line defense against the spread of
these diseases is the ability to rapidly detect viruses in infected humans, and
in other contexts. This project addresses the urgent need for fundamental
research that enables promising new, high performance technologies for detection
of specific viruses. Low cost, widely deployable new testing strategies for
detection of viral ribonucleic acids (RNAs) can greatly enhance understanding
and mitigation of the spread of epidemics and pandemics. This interdisciplinary
research project provides opportunities to graduate and undergraduate students,
including members of underrepresented groups, to develop research skills and to
work across disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research explores novel
approaches to significantly enhance key steps and the performance of
bioanalytical methods that are alternatives to the time-consuming testing based
on polymerase chain reaction amplification. In the first aim of this project,
the research team capitalizes on the phase change behavior of genetically
engineered, bioinspired, intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) to concentrate
and enhance rapid, efficient viral RNA isolation. The second aim explores the
potential use of IDP as chaperones to effectively catalyze RNA hybridization and
strand displacement reactions. These reactions are central to viral nucleic acid
detection methodologies such as CRISPR-Cas9 triggered strand displacement
amplification, toehold switches, and molecular logic circuits. The goal of this
project is to enable facile, massive deployment of low-cost, point-of-care virus
detection and diagnosis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
