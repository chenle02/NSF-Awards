Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program objective is to explore the growth,
structure, optical and electronic transport properties of III-V patterned
nanopillars formed on silicon substrate for potential novel electronic and
optoelectronic applications. The pillar formation involves a hybrid approach
which combines a lithographically patterned substrate and a catalyst layer using
either molecular beam or metal organic vapour phase epitaxial techniques. The
introduction of the catalyst enables highly crystalline pillar formation despite
the 13% lattice-mismatch to the silicon substrate. This is a promising approach
to integration of direct bandgap, high mobility III-V nanostructures into the
CMOS platform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual merit of this proposal is
the novel approach that will enable patterned selective growth of III-V
nanopillars within a masked Si substrate, by manipulating the diffusion process
of catalytic seeds on the substrates. In the end, a III-V vertical pillar based
LED and photodetector on the same Si substrate will be fabricated, as a
demonstration of the transformative concept of this heterogeneous integration of
on-chip optical interconnect. The scientific outcomes will have applications in
future high speed, low power electronic devices and on-chip opto-
electronics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader impacts of this activity combines
expertise and infrastructure from two universities in complementary areas of
nanomaterials growth, characterization, patterning, device fabrication and
modeling. The exposure and training of the next generation of scientists and
engineers occurs through substantial involvement of graduate, undergraduate
students, targeted toward the participation of underrepresented groups. Specific
involvement of high school students during summer programs is planned for each
year at UCLA and ASU.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
