The proposed research centers on stochastic inequalities, including correlation
inequalities, monotonicity of certain expectations with respect to parameters of
distributions, inequalities which quantify dependence structures, and related
notions of multivariate total positivity. The emphasis is on multivariate
distributions and processes. The proposal also refers to dependence concepts
arising in sequential analysis and the study of optimal stopping value
comparisons under various dependence structures, and prophet inequalities which
provide upper bounds on optimal stopping values. Limit theorems for various
types of dependence structures will be studied, with initial emphasis on
approximation rates. The resulting improved convergence rates may be applicable
to the study of asymptotics of multivariate statistics which can be expressed as
sums of dependent random variables and various random counts arising in problems
of combinatorial nature. The assumptions of statistical independence of sampled
measurements is basic to most methods of data analysis, and is ubiquitous in
problems of stochastic optimization. However, one encounters many situations in
which this assumption is violated. The proposed research centers on the study of
certain aspects of samples which consist of observations which are not
independent.
