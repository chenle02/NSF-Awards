The primary task proposed is to develop the theory and technology to realize
miniaturized, efficient power magnetic components for use in advanced low-
voltage (1.5 - 5 Volts) microelectronic power supplies, which will be
distributed as board-level "components" having very high efficiency (95%) and
very high power density (100 Watts per cubic inch). The technology is essential
because conventional methods to fabricate power transformers and inductors prove
inadequate to realize miniaturized, high-performance components reproducibly and
cost- effectively. To be developed are alternate magnetic configurations,
electrical and mechanical models that are useful at circuit and system levels
and for simulation, fabrication techniques, and design methodology with yield
emphasis. Also proposed is the development of a Simulator for Power Electronics
Circuits and Systems, a much-needed CAD tool in power electronic engineering.
Basic features to be realized are behavioral and hierarchical modeling, event-
driven scheduling, variable and multiple time steps, and efficient numerical
algorithms for switched-mode networks. Models for power electronic components,
functional blocks, and converter topologies are also included. Curriculum and
laboratories will be established to produce students capable of pursuing a
career or performing research in power electronics.
