The Scripps Institution of Oceanography of the University of California at San
Diego will acquire sea-going data manage- ment systems and items of
oceanographic instrumentation to be placed in a pool of shared use equipment.
This equipment is maintained for use on or in association with the four research
vessels operated by the institution. A substantial part of the ships' operating
schedules during 1990 is in support of NSF-sponsored research projects. The
instrumenta- tion will also increase the capabilities of the ships and of the
institution to support research and engineering activities. The instrumentation
includes: -Shipboard data management systems and components for real- time
acquisition, management, analysis, and display of large environmental data sets,
-Echosounder system for collecting data on seafloor bathymetry and sedimentary
profiles, -CTD enhancements for obtaining detailed profiles of seawater
conductivity and temperature as a function of depth, -Seagoing analytical
laboratory upgrades for improving dissolved oxygen and salinity measurements,
-Portable fume hoods for removing chemical fumes from the ship's laboratories,
and -Shipping containers for safely transporting delicate scientific equipment
to and from the ships. The University of California is cost sharing in the
acquisition of this equipment. The instrumentation described above will increase
the capability of the organization to support NSF-sponsored research and
engineering projects.
