This award is to support the building of Softlab, a laboratory that supports
research in computational science and engineering. The facilities provided
include: 1. High performance graphics processors for scientific visualization,
geometric modeling, and multimedia graphical user interfaces for parallel
programming and programming in the large. 2. High-performance computing power,
upgrading Purdues' parallel machines. 3. Software and development support staff
assisting application researchers in making full use of this facility comprising
a rich spectrum of high-performance workstations, powerful parallel machines,
and dedicated graphics processors. 4. A teaching laboratory providing
exploratory course that migrate cutting-edge research into the curriculum with
access to state-of-the-art facilities. This laboratory will be the principal
facility of a proposed new interdisciplinary graduate degree program in
Computational Engineering and Science. //
