This award supports fundamental research to investigate online algorithmic
methods for service systems. Online algorithms are a fast, promising class of
algorithms that make decisions adaptively but without pre-computing optimal
future decisions. Advances in online algorithms will bring current theory closer
to being able to support the dynamic, information-intensive, and large-scale
applications that are found in services today, such as multi-priority non-
stationary make-to-order systems and web and mobile-based service-reservation
systems. On the modeling side, this award will enable the analysis of new
features of service systems in important emerging applications. On the
algorithmic side, this project will provide new tools to address existing
theoretical gaps and open research problems. Performance analysis will be used
to guide the investigation of robust and efficient algorithms that work well in
practice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant investigates several concrete features
of service applications: (1) non-stationary arrival processes; (2) advance
reservation of services; and (3) customer preferences. Traditional methods like
queueing analysis can be limited in their ability to model these features of
real applications, and to address non-stationary environments. Alternative
methods that are tailor-made to handle both non-stationarity and modeling
complexity, such as multi-stage stochastic dynamic programming, frequently
suffer from the "curse of dimensionality," which makes them intractable to
solve. This project will create new models and online algorithms to address
realistic features of service systems. This grant will build on several core
techniques. Balancing and sample-path analysis will be used to perform trade-
offs under uncertainty. A new notion of distance function, which is related to
potential functions, will be used to summarize high-dimensional state
information and to evaluate the comparative performance of policies. Linear
programming will be used to decompose complex dynamic problems into smaller,
manageable sub-problems. A main contribution of this project is a theoretical
performance guarantee that accompanies each algorithm. Theoretical insights
along with extensive empirical studies on real data will be used to find high-
quality practical policies. Although the focus of this project is on service
systems, the tools investigated here will have immediate impact on other areas
such as online resource allocation and revenue management.
