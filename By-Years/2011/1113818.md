This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop
ultra-thin CdTe solar cells by improving the back-contact interface, which
facilitates the transport of positive charge carriers (holes) into the back
contact electrode and simultaneously reflect negative charge carriers
(electrons) toward the main junction where they are collected by the transparent
conducting electrode. Two complementary approaches will be taken to achieve this
objective. Suitable dopant elements such as phosphorous will be added to create
a heavily doped p-type layer before applying the back contact. The heavy doping
will create an electron reflector and facilitate a hole-conducting semiconductor
or metal contact. The second pathway will involve magnetron sputter deposition
of suitable p-type semiconductors such as ZnTe doped with nitrogen or copper.
Preliminary studies have shown promise with thick CdTe layers and CdTe crystals.
This project will extend the studies to ultra-thin, semitransparent CdTe solar
cells to validate the efficacy of either or both approaches as applied to PV
window structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of this
project will be the potential to provide an improved back-contact interface for
semitransparent photovoltaic windows, which will help move these power-producing
windows toward 10% efficiency while maintaining good transparency. The estimated
annual market for curtain-wall glass applications in the U.S. is about 150
million square feet (14 million square meters). Value-added PV window coatings
for high-rise office buildings can provide a substantial reduction of solar heat
loads while delivering a major fraction of the electricity needed for these
buildings.
