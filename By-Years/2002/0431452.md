This award to the American Astronomical Society will be used to provide
financial awards to three high school students who present astronomical research
projects that are judged to be outstanding at the annual Intel International
Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF). The American Astronomical Society (AAS)
administers the awards on the behalf of all participating institutions: the
National Science Foundation, the Astronomical Society of the Pacific (ASP), the
International Amateur-Professional Photoelectric Photometry (IAPPP), and the
American Astronomical Society. The Priscilla and Bart Bok Awards, awarded
jointly by the AAS and the ASP, and the Richard D. Lines Special Award in
Astronomy, sponsored by the IAPPP, are used by students to further their
education and research efforts. Students also receive funds that allow them to
travel to the winter meeting of the AAS to present the results of their
research. Each student's school also receives a modest amount that can be used
by their science departments to enhance their science programs.
