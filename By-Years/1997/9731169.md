9731169 Kibblewhite An adaptive optics system and laser guide-star will be
integrated with the 3.5 meter telescope of the Astrophysical Research Consortium
(ARC) at Apache Point, NM. Many of the components of the system have been
developed under earlier grants. Performance of these components will be
optimized for use in the proposed system. Field tests will be carried out with
the dual YAG, sum frequency. laser to optimize the size and brightness of the
beacon generated in the mesospheric sodium layer. The laser is expected to
generate a sub-arcsecond beacon as bright as a 7.5 magnitude star in the V band.
The laser and a beam director will be integrated with the ARC telescope, the
adaptive optical system, wavefront sensor, H band infrared camera, and telescope
control computers. ***
