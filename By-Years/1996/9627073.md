The carers of nonacademic scientists and engineers remain poorly understood,
especially why few women have technical careers in industry. Guided by
multidisciplinary theories about careers, this project compares technical
careers to other white collar careers and examines how gender influences
careers. The research design is a case study of General Motors' engineers and
scientists, including those in its high-tech electronics division. A
longitudinal database is used to examine job sequences, including promotions,
quits and lateral moves. The research contributes to public policy debate about
a recommendation that graduate programs produce more versatile scientists and
engineers. A 1994-5 survey of all GM employees is used to examine the link
between graduate education and diverse job experiences. Interactive activities
include teaching two innovative course on applying demography to business and
government issues, speaking in a campus-wide series about Women Leading
Technology, and mentoring and counseling students, especially about nonacademic
careers.
