The functional and structural mapping of brain between different modalities,
subjects and developmental stages will be made possible by the research
described in this proposal. We will develop algorithms to spatially deform data
from varied sources so that they become comparable. In addition to permitting
the direct comparison of these data, the resulting transformations and
statistics of variation will allow us to model the differences between and
within subjects and modalities. Accurate modelling is essential to the
elucidation of the relationship between anatomy and physiology as recorded in
multiple modalities and subjects, and across time. The parameterization, warping
and morphing / blending of 3D brain data will be accomplished using our Adaptive
algorithms. Adaptive algorithms will be influenced by contextual cues from
anatomic region or imaging modality. There are 5 categories of adaptive
characteristics (Anatomic, Tissue, Densitometric, Geometric, and Other) that
will be tested with each type of transformation (adaptive parameterization,
warping transformation and morphing / blending.
