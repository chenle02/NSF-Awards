The project introduces the use of the state-of-the-art analytical
photogrammetric plotter to students in the Surveying Engineering curriculum.
Aerial photographs and photogrammetric plotting instruments have been used for
making topographic maps ever since the advent of the airplane. Until a decade
ago, these instruments were manually operated and the output was a graphical map
constructed on a plotting table which was connected to the stereoplotter.
Recently, these plotters have been interfaced with computers and many of the
orientation and mapping operations have been semi-automated. It is very
important that graduates are able to attain some functional competency on this
equipment in order to meet the critical needs of the mapping profession.
