This grant will provide funds to retrofit the low-beta section of the Stony
Brook superconducting heavy ion linac with beta = 0.068 quarter wave resonators,
constructed of copper and plated with lead. The retrofit/upgrade will greatly
improve phase-stable operation of the linac, and will extend its useful mass
range for nuclear beams from the present A=80 (bromine) up to about A=120 (tin).
