This proposal requests funds to provide modern, versatile magnetic
instrumentation for materials research in chemistry and condensed matter physics
at Clark University. A magnetometer will serve as the central instrument of a
program in the synthesis and characterization of a new generation of molecular-
based quantum antiferromagnets. Research has been focused on molecular-based
magnetism, concentrating recently on the design and synthesis of low-dimensional
quantum antiferromagnets that have significant overlap with the magnetism of
high-temperature superconductivity. This new instrument will help meet the
complementary requirements of the physics group and the synthetic chemistry
group. A productive, versatile magnetometer has become an indispensable
analytical tool for synthetic magnetochemists. Measurements of a preliminary
batch of a new compound can provide guidance for determining the necessary
synthetic pathway to a new compound. The requested magnetometer will also be the
workhorse instrument for the researchers who need to make extensive studies of
the field and temperature dependences of the magnetization and dc-and ac-
susceptibilities studies of the most interesting of the new materials.

Our students, both undergraduate and graduate, profit from the multidisciplinary
nature of this research project. When students see their own work placed within
a broader scientific context they develop an appreciation for other disciplines.
Because the chemistry and physics laboratories are within the same building,
opportunities for interaction occur daily, optimal for good collaborative work.
The availability of the new instrument will have a strong impact on the
educational opportunities we can offer our students. For both chemistry and
physics students, the new magnetometer will allow them to concentrate on the
science, and less on struggling with inadequate instruments. The chemists will
be able to take advantage of the user-friendly interface of the new magnetometer
to run their own samples. This increased involvement will render them more
independent, decreasing the turnaround time and increasing their productivity.
