This grant in the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports research
by Dr. Philip Warner, Iowa State University, which aims at elucidating the
chemical reactivity of carbenes, carbenoids, and organolithium species. Carbenes
and carbenoids are reactive chemical fragments which occur as transient
intermediates in many important chemical reactions. Understanding their chemical
behavior is the key to effective utilization for organic synthesis of such
carbenic processes as cyclopropanation, the Skattebol rearrangement, and other
reactions. Dr. Warner's research will probe particular aspects of the structure
and reactivity of carbenes and carbenoids, including the net loss of carbon from
cyclopropylidenes upon interaction with certain nucleophiles, and from
cyclopropylidenoids upon oxidation. A method of photogenerating three-membered
ring carbenes, including oxiranylidene, will be developed for application to
measurement of fast reaction kinetics and cryogenic studies. Laser flash
photolytic methodology will be applied to the analysis of intramolecular carbene
rearrangements, and NMR methods will be employed for determination of the
structure of dilithiocyclopropanes.
