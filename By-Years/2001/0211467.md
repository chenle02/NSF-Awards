Multi-neuronal encoding of visual target information to direct flight in the
dragonfly

A remarkable example of visually guided interception flight is the capture of
flying insect prey by dragonflies. Prey interception flights are highly
accurate, with capture success rates as high as 97%. Using a combination of
techniques, including multi-neuronal recordings with nanofabricated electrode
arrays and high speed video analysis of wing movements, this project is aimed at
understanding the neural guidance system used to direct this rapid, precise,
visually-guided behavior. Because prey pursuit is directed by a small number of
easily accessible neurons, the dragonfly experimental preparation is ideally
suited for answering a fundamental question in neurobiology: does the
correlation of firing patterns among neurons communicate more information than
could be communicated by the neurons individually? An understanding of prey
interception by dragonflies, from neurons to behavior, could lead to the
development of effective biomimetic guidance mechanisms. In addition, this
project will give undergraduate students a cutting-edge, cross-disciplinary,
research experience, providing a vehicle for recruiting talented, enthusiastic
students from both biology and engineering into the field of neuroscience.
