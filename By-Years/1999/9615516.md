Warner 9615516 Results of studies on biogeography and population ecology of
marine organisms suggest that larval transport and recruitment are important
process in determining the distribution and persistence of adult populations.
Our understanding of these processes, however, is severely limited by our
inability to determine the sources and subsequent dispersal patterns of marine
larvae. Dr. Warner hypothesizes that spatial variation in water chemistry among
potential source populations, both in terms of isotopic ratios and elemental
concentrations, can be used to discriminate between recruitment events resulting
from larval retention versus dispersal between populations. This can be achieved
if larvae permanently record the environmental signature of their location of
origin. He will test this hypothesis by comparing the otolith chemical
composition of newly settled recruits to resident adults from populations with
different chemical environments. ***
