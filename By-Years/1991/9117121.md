Research conducted as part of this project will supply detailed information
about the evolution of foreland basins. In foreland basins, sea level change,
variations in thrust propagation and changes in sediment supply influence
depositional processes. Collection of detailed field data coupled with numerical
modeling of the processes active during foreland basin evolution will help
constrain interpretations of hinterland and basin development. Our understanding
of the interaction of tectonics, eustasy and sedimentation is currently limited
for these complex environments. The application of theoretical modeling to a
detailed data set will provide important information which can be used for
future interpretation of stratal patterns in foreland basins. Field data for
this study will be collected in the Upper Cretaceous Blackhawk Formation, and
will focus on the stratigraphic record of progradational and transgressive
events. The relatively short time interval modeled (580,000 years) distinguishes
this study from previous numerical modeling studies of foreland basins.
