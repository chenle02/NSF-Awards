This project involves the further design, construction, and evaluation of data
acquisition and analysis hardware to be interfaced to a flow cytometer. This
hardware employs digital pulse waveform processing, and during the prior period
of funding, we developed and evaluated a first-generation design. In this
proposal, we aim to develop second-generation hardware, that will provide
improved rates of cellular analysis. We also propose a thorough practical and
theoretical examination of the types of biological information that can be
obtained using digital pulse processing in flow cytometry, and the algorithms
that are required to extract this information. We finally propose to see whether
we can improve the performance of the hardware through increasing the spatial
resolution of the optics of the flow cytometer. The expected significance of the
proposed research relies on the observation that the instrumentation is novel in
capability, and can provide information about cells that is inaccessible using
other instruments. The development of a second-generation instrument will allow
full implementation of digital pulse processing in flow cytometry and cell
sorting. The ability to rapidly analyze and sort cells according to novel
optical parameters should greatly extend our ability to probe the cellular and
molecular factors that govern the operation of living cells. This should
facilitate a deeper understanding of normal cellular growth and development, as
well as of abnormal growth and disease states. This might lead to
instrumentation with improved diagnostic and prognostic capabilities. We are
convinced that the interdisciplinary approach integral to this project, which
combines expertise in very different scientific fields (engineering, optics, and
biology), has considerable potential to produce instrumentation and methods that
will significantly extend our understanding of the structure and function of
living cells.
