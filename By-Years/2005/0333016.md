This study examines the effects of anthropogenic aerosols on ice processes in
the atmosphere. The PIs will use a global atmospheric general circulation model
(GCM) coupled with an aerosol model. Parameterizations of heterogeneous ice
nucleation processes (immersion freezing and deposition nucleation) will be
developed and implemented together with an existing parameterization for
homogeneous freezing in the climate model. The climate forcing due to the
anthropogenic effects on cirrus clouds will be estimated, and the importance of
heterogeneous versus homogeneous ice nucleation in the upper troposphere will be
addressed. The effect of aircraft emitted soot particles will be studied in
comparison with soot and other sources of ice nuclei from the earth's surface.
The broader impacts of this project include: (1) that this is a policy-relevant
study that will be widely disseminated because of its direct relevance to
uncertainties in climate forcing and, hence, climate change, and will thereby
benefit society; (2) that results learned here will be incorporated into the
aerosol microphysics course offered by Dr. Penner; and (3) that graduate
students will be trained through the project.
