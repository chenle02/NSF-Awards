The project concerns the development of techniques for solving some new types
of integral equations, and the application of these techniques to a variety of
physical problems. Of particular interest are equations of Volterra type whose
solution experiences a blow-up, and equations of Fredholm type whose solution
exhibits boundary layer effects. The areas of application include (i) localized
plastic straining effects in high-strength metals, (ii) the ignition of
combustible solid materials, and (iii) the migration of atomic impurities in
crystals. The project concerns the development and application of new techniques
for solving certain scientific and engineering problems which can be formulated
in mathematical terms as an integral or integro-differential equation. The
results will be used to enhance the understanding of phenomena which exhibit
explosive behavior, such as the ignition and burning of solid matter. Related
applications concern the failure of high-strength metals which undergo
viscoplastic strain due to extreme loading. Another area of potential use
concerns the effects of impurities in crystalline materials.
