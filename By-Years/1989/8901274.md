The research focuses on the study of the properties of heavy quarks (c = charm
and b = beauty) produced by hadron beams at Fermilab. The E769 Experiment is now
being analyzed which is expected to contain 10,000 charm events. The next
experiment, E791, is expected to contain more than 100,000 charm events and
serve as a basis for future studies of b quarks. Sheaff, et al. are at one of
six institutions collaborating in these experiments. The collaboration is one of
the leading groups in the world working on studies of heavy quarks. The field of
research is that of experimental elementary particle physics. This research
studies the basic building blocks of matter (e.g., electrons, positrons, quarks
and weak bosons) at very high energies. The experiments use accelerators
(colliders) which provide the highest energy particles made in the laboratory.
The data is collected and analyzed using highly complex and sophisticated
apparatus and techniques.
