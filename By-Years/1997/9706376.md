ABSTRACT Bao Qin Li Li will study necessary and sufficient geometric conditions
for an analytic variety to be an interpolating variety for weighted spaces of
entire functions. In a second direction, he will use results and methods of
interpolation to study exponential polynomials and obtain Lojasiewicz type
inequalities, which are tied to some important conjectures in complex and
harmonic analysis. In a third direction, he plans to find estimates on the
volume of zero varieties for entire holomorphic maps, which are closely related
to geometric aspects of interpolating varieties. He will also study the
"refined" Nevanlinna second fundamental theorem for moving targets, with special
attention given to uniqueness problems of meromorphic functions and meromorphic
solutions of (partial) differential equations. Many important problems like
finding all distribution solutions (or finding out whether there are any) to
systems of convolution equations arising in signal processing, image
compression, and other applications can be translated to interpolation problems
for entire functions with growth conditions. The topic itself is one of the
major problems in several complex variables. The proposed research has as its
goal to enrich and advance the above areas in several complex variables and
their applications.
