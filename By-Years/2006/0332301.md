The focus of this research involves the synthesis of polyfuran and co-polymers
of polyfuran, pyrrole, and thiophene, doped with various concentrations of
p-toluene sulfonate, trifluoromethyl sulfonate and perchlorate. The thermal and
mechanical stability as well as electrical conductivity of the polymers will
then be characterized and compared to undoped counterparts. The research will be
carried out by undergraduates in order to help prepare them for graduate school
and careers in science and engineering.

With this RUI award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is
supporting the research of Dr. Rose M. McConnell of the Department of Natural
Sciences at the University of Arkansas, Monticello. Professor McConnell will
focus her work on developing methods for the synthesis of a series of doped
polymers which will be investigated for interesting physical properties. The
research will be used to train undergraduate students in research skills not
normally available in an undergraduate institution.
