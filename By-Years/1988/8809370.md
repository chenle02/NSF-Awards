NP-complete problems are among the most interesting and important optimization
problems known. This class includes literally hundreds of natural problems from
graph theory, routing, scheduling, compiler optimization and logic. These
problems are especially intriguing because, although no efficient algorithm is
known in the worst case, many of them can be solved quickly in practice.
Traditionally, the work on NP-completeness has focused on the complexity and
structure of their yes/no questions. Recently, new insights have come from
looking at a deeper level of structure. This investigation continues work on NP-
complete problems, focusing on the structure of their feasible solutions.
Understanding this rich level of structure will provide a theoretical framework
for coping with these problems in practice. This theory will then lead to faster
algorithms for solving these problems and a better explanation of their inherent
difficulty. This research also has applications for finding approximation
algorithms for NP-complete problems and, in particular, explaining why some
problems can be approximated well and others cannot.
