Large data sets are a given in modern industry, technology and science, and
demand statistical attention to treat such central issues as detecting new
patterns and relationships in a reliable and computationally feasible way. While
the need is apparent, paths to bringing statistical science to bear on large
data sets are not clearly mapped, in part because the sheer volume of the data
prevents direct use of standard techniques. This proposal comprises a pair of
interconnected pilot projects targeted to stimulate statistical science entree
to this rapidly changing terrain. Each has a major industria;l partner, which
has committed substantial resources. The projects and partners are Drug
Discovery (Glaxo Wellcome, Research Traingle Park, NC) and Telecommunications
Fraud (AT&amp;T Laboratories, Murray Hill, NJ). In both instances there are
specific scientific isues with high-stakes implications for the industry at
large; each is speculative, in the sense that the path from data to information
to knowledge is not known in advance. In drug discovery, the critical problem is
to find new potent, non-toxic compounds. New statistical methods will be
developed to search substantial data sets generated by recent advances in
robotic synthesis and screening in order to identify key features of compounds,
leading to better ones, in the presence of highly complex (and very high-
dimensional) descriptions of the molecules. Within the hundreds of millions of
long distance calls per day a small fraction are illegal or unauthorized, but
result in costs of hundreds of millions of dollars annually. The problem is to
detect and characterize, as rapidly as possible, patterns of transactions that
are unusual, and potentially fraudulent, with special attention to controlling
error rates (false alarms, failures to detect), an issue exacerbated by the
enormous multiplicity of decisions made on a continual basis. The two problem
areas have common features: sequential statistical search for important or
unusual patters in the data; data that are highly complex in sheer quantity, in
high-dimensional description of each data point, or in the diversity of their
sources. Approaching these issues will be done by teams of cross-disciplinary
researchers at distributed sites and closely managed by NISS. This GOALI project
is jointly supported by the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and
the Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS).
