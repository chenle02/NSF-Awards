This project is a research in algebraic geometry, a branch of mathematical
science. The Principal Investigator (PI) will study properties of certain spaces
(called moduli space) of objects that can be characterized by algebraic
properties. (An example of such are the roots of polynomials). These spaces
describe solution spaces that are vital to research in many branches of
mathematical researches and in theoretical physics. The PI will work on several
research directions. He will work toward a full understanding of high genus
Gromov-Witten invariants of Calabi-Yau threefolds; he will also develop an
alternative theory on generalized Donaldson-Thomas invariants of Calabi-Yau
threefold; develop necessarily tools to study and prove the conjecture on BPS-
states of Calabi-Yau threefolds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project is
the continuation of PI's long term research goal of broadening mathematical
research by understanding new idea from theoretical physics and contributing to
the development of theoretical physics by providing mathematical foundation
vital to its advancement. The progress on studying high genus GW invariants and
DT invariants will advance our understanding of moduli spaces in general; enrich
the research in algebraic geometry. It will also strengthen the interaction
between algebraic geometry and other subjects of mathematics, and with
mathematical physics. This project will promote teaching, learning and training
young mathematical researchers. Over all, it will contribute its share in
advancing the science research in the country.
