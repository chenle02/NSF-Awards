The proposed project seeks financial support for organizing a Workshop on the
status and challenges of a broad class of semiconductors with bandgaps larger
than 3.4 eV, i.e., larger than the bandgap of GaN. Representative materials are
AlGaN (including the binary endpoint AlN), diamond, Ga2O3, and their
heterostructures. The Workshop will be held April 25-26, 2016 at the Basic
Research Innovation and Collaboration Center (BRICC) in Arlington VA. The
Workshop will foster advances in the leading research of extreme (ultra) wide-
bandgap (UWBG) semiconductors by gathering a diverse group of experts. Topics to
be addressed include among other bulk and epitaxial growth, electronic transport
at low and high fields, device architectures, heterostructure designs,
fundamental limits to device performance, device fabrication and processing
techniques, The workshop will include 7 invited talks, 10 contributed
presentations and is expected to be attended by 70 attendees from industry,
academia, and government. The organizing committee will select topic leads to
assist with selection of attendees. The report prepared on the Workshop will
summarize the outcome of the discussions and will be available to all the
workshop attendees, as well as other members of the scientific community.
