A six-day residential workshop on the "Ecology of the Chesapeake Bay" for 24
community college science faculty from the five-state Chesapeake Bay watershed
is being held in Summer 1991 at the University of Maryland's Chesapeake
Biological Laboratory (CBL), Solomons, Maryland. The workshop includes two days
of lecture, two days of field activities on CBL's research vessels, and two days
of laboratory work at CBL. The technical content is being provided by CBL
researchers and focuses on the topics "Plant Life" and "Waterfowl and Vertebrate
Fish". These topics were selected by community college science faculty in the 17
Maryland community colleges, in response to a survey administered in spring
1989. Field activities expose workshop participants to Chesapeake Bay nutrient
and toxic budgets and to hydroacoustics technologies. A significant follow-up
activity is a videoconference scheduled for October 1991 for 400-500 additional
persons, including educators in the biological, physical and social sciences,
interested teachers, government officials dealing with the environment, and
industrial representatives. Partial support for this follow-up videoconference
is from the Chesapeake Bay Trust. //
