The retina is the sheet of tissue in the back of the eye that contains the
photoreceptor cells and complex network of nerve cells for the first stages of
visual processing. This conference is devoted specifically to how the retina
handles information, and includes topics in systems level, cellular, and
molecular biology. Results are compared between vertebrate and invertebrate
eyes, between biological and artificial/machine vision, regulation of neural
transmission in different parts of the retina, and adaptations to different
environments such as polarized light for underwater vision in fish. Discussion
of new findings in these fundamental areas emphasize presentations by young
investigators. Because studies of the anatomy, biochemistry and physiology of
the retina have provided numerous models for the way in which nerve cells in the
brain handle information flow, this conference is likely to have an impact
beyond visual neuroscience alone. It also will be an important forum for young
investigators to exchange ideas with seasoned investigators about topics of very
high current interest.
