Award is for a coordinated seismic and coring study of the Storegga Slide on the
Norwegian Margin. The Storegga slide developed in sediments thought to have
contained substantial amounts of gas hydrate. Examining this slide area will
test the hypothesis that submarine landslides can release methane from hydrates
into the oceans and/or atmosphere and thereby affect climate. The study will
test three major hypotheses; 1) How much gas hydrate is present in the Storegga
region, 2) did methane escape as a result of the slide, and if so, how much? 3)
does hydrate dissociation promote submarine landslides? A 43 day cruise of the
R/V Ewing will acquire high resolution seismic reflection data, three component
ocean bottom seismic data and jumbo piston cores.
