This award provides funding for an REU site at the University of Hawaii (UH) Sea
Grant College. This REU site is supported by the Department of Defense in
partnership with the National Science Foundation's REU program. The funding
supports a stipend, housing, travel, partial board and laboratory expenses for
eight to ten students per year for three years, beginning in the summer of 2003,
during an intensive 10-week summer research program. The students will work one-
one-one with UH Manoa faculty mentors to develop and implement individual
research projects, collect and analyze data, interpret results, and present
their findings in oral seminars and written reports. They will be expected to
write bi-weekly reports, submit a final report and give at least two oral
presentations during the session. Students will be recruited from across the
nation.
