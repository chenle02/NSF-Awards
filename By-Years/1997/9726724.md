9726724 Regan This award supports a three year collaborative research project
between Professor Kenneth Regan of SUNY, Buffalo and Professor Osamu Watanabe of
the Tokyo Institute of Technology in Japan. The researchers will undertake a
study of complexity theory for strategic goals. The main objective is the
development of more refined tools for analyzing the complexity of computations
than are currently most commonly employed in the field. Particular areas to be
investigated include: (1) linear and quasi-linear time reductions between
problems, (2) low-level circuit-based classes and reductions, often with quasi-
linear bounds on circuit size, (3) average-case complexity, including a
determination of which of several competing polynomial-time formalisms is best
suited for lower time bound analysis, and (4) a new theory of one- way functions
that realize certain concrete polynomial complexity gaps, such as being
quasilinear-time computable but not inevitable in less than quadratic time. This
project brings together the efforts of scientists, in both countries, that have
complementary expertise and research capabilities. The development of a more
acute analysis of computational costs should help gauge its practical
effectiveness now, and its strategic potential as a guide for future
investigations. Extending theories of (quasi-)linear time and of low-level
classes and reductions should provide a precise understanding of what facets of
problems make them hard to solve and how these facets are related between
problems. It is further expected that it will be possible to understand the
relationship between average-case complexity and the nature-and-distribution of
such hard instances. Through the exchange of ideas and technology, this project
will broaden our base of basic knowledge and promote international understanding
and cooperation. ***
