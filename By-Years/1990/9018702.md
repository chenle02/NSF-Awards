Project WENDI (Women Engineering Doctoral Incentives) at the University of
Kentucky presents a strategy for increasing the number of female Ph.D.s pursuing
research careers in academia, industry, and government. It specifically provides
a strategy for a mid-tier chemical engineering department to produce increase
the number of new female Ph.D.s over the next several years, beginning with
three fellowships. To encourage women to consider graduate study, Project WENDI
proposes a mentoring program for our undergraduates and contact with our alumni
to reach potential non-traditional students. A "critical Mass" of women will
result from these efforts.
