Geographic information systems (GIS) is an area of study causing increased
excitement among students. This project, therefore, strives to enhance this area
of geography by accomplishing specific objectives to improve the curriculum. New
undergraduate courses, internships, and programs are being added, and a specific
plan has been developed for enhancing four analytical geography courses. This
plan also involves redesigning courses, updating laboratory computing and
digital data analysis equipment, and redesigning laboratory exercises to
incorporate the use of new analytical capabilities. It is also expected that the
physical geography curriculum will be improved by incorporating modern image
display and geographic information analysis capabilities into existing
laboratory and field exercises.
