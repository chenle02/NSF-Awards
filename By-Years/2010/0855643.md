topic in condensed-matter, statistical and mathematical physics, and form basic
building blocks in quantum information science. This ultracold-atomic physics
project focuses on the implementation of quantum spin-1/2 systems using arrays
of coupled two-state atoms in an optical lattice with tunable parameters. The
main goal of the project is an investigation of equilibrium phases and spin
dynamics in this atomic system, based on the development of a tool for the
preparation of arbitrary initial spin configurations. The project will be
carried out with a Bose-Einstein condensate of rubidium-87 atoms.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The realization of quantum spin systems with precisely controllable
parameters can be expected to have broad scientific and technological impact.
The project will advance the state of the art in the manipulation of strongly
correlated quantum gases, and it will also provide scientific and technical
training to both graduate and undergraduate students who will gain proficiency
in the enabling technologies of lasers and optics, ultrahigh vacuum, and
electronics. In conjunction with the project, the PI is developing a graduate-
level course on ultracold quantum gases which will include laboratory visits and
demonstrations.&lt;br/&gt;
