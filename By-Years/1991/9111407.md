This project is supported under the Research in Undergraduate Institutions
Program. The purpose of this research is to analyze the impact of job
characteristics on retirement. A model is developed and estimated which takes
into account the notion that pensions and age of retirement are jointly
determined, based on comparison of a workers productivity and the marginal
disutility of work. This differs from previous studies where age of retirement
has been treated independent of these factors. The model will be tested using
data on characteristics of occupation drawn from a number of sources and
individual work histories from the Retirement History Survey. Several
alternative specifications will be tested, including continuous dependent
variables, categorical dependent variables, and transition hazards. This
research is important because it will provide a better understanding of how
retirement age may be affected by public policy regarding pensions, and how
changes in retirement age might affect the composition of the labor force.
