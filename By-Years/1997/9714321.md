The increasing need for high-temperature lightweight aluminum alloy composites
in the automobile and aerospace industries requires satisfactory performance for
cost-effective production of the composite parts. A new method for the
production of lightweight alloy composites through in-situ formation of
equilibrium reinforcement phases, without any metastable phase formation is
proposed in this project. The principal objectives of this research project
include: (1) processing of equilibrium silicon carbide, silicon nitride and
metal silicide reinforced aluminum alloy composites without any intermediate
metastable phase formations; (2) optimization of materials variables such as
precursor, compositions and the process variables such as time , temperature,
composition of melts, and the stirring conditions; (3) modeling of thermodynamic
properties of the composite melts; and, (4) determination of reaction rates and
mechanism of the composites formation. High temperature oxidation and
sulfidation of the composites will be investigated. The experiments will be
performed in an alumina crucible placed in the constant temperature zone of
resistance heating furnace. This work is expected to generate a newer
understanding of the kinetics and thermodynamics of stable phase formation and
control in composites interface reactions. The results of these studies are
expected to ultimately lead to the development of an innovative cost-effective
method of producing composites for commerce.
