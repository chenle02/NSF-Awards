This research will perform experiments to test predictions of critical wetting
in three-dimensional containers. Critical wetting is the property of a two-fluid
system where the relative wettability of the solid container, described by the
contact angle of a liquid on the solid, and the shape of the container determine
whether the liquid will form a finite-height single-valued static interface in a
container. 3D models will track conditions where the critical wetting phenomenon
lacks the solid mathematical foundation and experimental verification that
exists for critical wetting in two-dimensional cylindrical containers. Failure
to properly predict critical wetting leads to reduced performance or failure in
devices or systems that rely on capillary fluid physics when the liquid remains
in one region or the liquid wicks away to another region. Both behaviors are
important in numerous small-scale fluids systems operating today and envisioned
for the future. Predicting such conditions is important for proper two-phase
fluid system operations, such as for water management in small fuel cell
channels, pulmonary health, MEMS-based medical and other instrumentation, and
liquid propulsion systems. The planned experiment will be one of the first to
fly in the emerging commercial sub-orbital rocket flight industry. It will
deliver results that cannot be obtained by other methods and will deliver these
results far faster and cheaper than through traditional sub-orbital rocket test
programs. Locally, the impact will be through the impact that this NSF-funded
research will have on undergraduate opportunities at Purdue. Past research
advances of this research area publicized by Purdue News Service have generated
positive news of international scope. This experimental program will show how
the emerging sub-orbital rocket industry may be effectively used for critical
research for the near future.
