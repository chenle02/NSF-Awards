A control, data acquisition, and data processing system based on a personal
computer is being assembled from electronic components. This system will permit
measurement of surface reaction kinetics through control of the sample
temperature, using mass spectrometry and electron energy loss spectroscopy to
monitor reaction products. Initially, the apparatus will be used to investigate
the low- temperature oxidation of propylene and allyl chloride on the 110 plane
of silver.
