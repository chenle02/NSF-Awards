This project is introducing computations into organic, physical, and
biochemistry courses for chemistry majors to train students to visualize and
understand molecular structure, learn how to write programs for data analysis,
and appreciate the dynamic nature of molecules and their relationship to
chemical reactivity. Students are applying molecular mechanics and semi-
empirical molecular orbital methods to organic and small biological molecules,
solving physical chemistry problems through computer programming, and observing
the molecular dynamics of proteins. Specifically, organic chemistry students are
studying the conformational equilibria of substituted cyclohexanes, nucleophilic
addition to alpha, beta unsaturated carbonyls, and electrophilic aromatic
substitution reactions. Physical chemistry students are solving a particle-in-a-
box problem, examining the kinetics of chain and oscillating reactions, and
predicting the infrared spectrum of acetic acid. Biochemistry students are
examining the allosteric transition of hemoglobin and the induced fit mechanism
of carboxypeptidase A, and comparing nucleic acid structures. Advanced courses
are being developed to address several aspects of computational chemistry, such
as molecular modeling and dynamics of proteins. Four advanced graphics
workstations provide hands-on experience for students with computers and
programs actually used in major research laboratories. The program greatly
reduces the gap between undergraduate education and what is actually done in
academic and industrial laboratories.
