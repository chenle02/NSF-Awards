One of the newest developments in American business is the use of employee
involvement (EI) programs-- by which we mean a diverse set of personnel and
management practices such as self-directed work teams, total quality management,
or quality circles, and the like that give workers more authority at workplaces.
Existing studies of EI have not addressed whether these practices enhance
organizational performance save in particular sectors, whether any performance
gain is do to organizational change or human capital enhancement, or the
benefits that flow to workers from EI. They have raised questions as to whether
unions increase the effectiveness of EI programs, why some establishments have
EI and others do not, and most critically, about the set of new practices that
firms must adopt for EI programs to succeed, and what those practices might be.
To address these questions a series of 20 case investigations of establishments,
including some paired comparisons of establishments with EI programs and those
without, and of establishments where these programs have failed will be
undertaken. In addition, a new data on employee involvement programs in several
hundred establishments will be developed; examine the relationship between EI
programs and productivity using longitudinal data from the LRD Survey of
Manufacturers files of the Census. Finally, employee outcomes using the
Workplace Representation and Participation Survey will examined. The study will
provide valuable information to business, labor, and government on the
importance of employee participation in the creation and maintenance of high
performance workplaces.
