Professor Crew will study overconvergent isocrystals on algebraic varities of
characteristic p. He hopes to characterize those isocrystals with finite
dimensional cohomology or at least obtain a reasonable criterion for finite-
dimensionality for them. This project falls into the general area of arithmetic
geometry - a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of mathematics: number
theory and geometry. This combination has proved extraordinarily fruitful -
having recently solved problems that withstood generations. Among its many
consequences are new error correcting codes. Such codes are essential for both
modern computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
