This award supports the international collaborative aspects of research on
diamond anvil cell dielectric measurements between Hugo Schmidt, University of
Montana, and Bao Zhongxing, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of Physics.
This work is applicable to enhanced physical understanding of the field of
proton glasses. This collaboration draws on the expertise of Dr. Schmidt in
ferroelectricity and Dr. Bao in diamond anvil cells. Primary support for the
research is provided under DMR 9017429.
