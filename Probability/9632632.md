9632632 Pinsky Abstract This project supports the eighteenth annual Midwest
Probability Colloquium, held at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois on
October 18-19, 1996. The Colloquium is an annual gathering, at Northwestern, of
75-100 experts in probability theory from the Great Lakes region and other parts
of the U.S. and Canada. The 1996 program features David Nualart of the
University of Barcelona, Spain, as the main speaker, with Michael Cranston of
the University of Rochester and Uwe Einmahl of Indiana University as other
invited speakers. More than half of the NSF support is targeted toward stipends
for young researchers, especially those traditionally underrepresented groups
such as women and minorities. Availability of awards is advertised in
publications of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics, the American
Mathematical Society and appropriate web sites.
