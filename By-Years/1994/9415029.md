New College, the Honors College of the University of South Florida, is the
recipient of ARI funds to replace 9,778 square feet (911 square meters) of
deteriorating marine biological research space. This project is part of a
general enhancement of the natural science facilities. Since the inception of
New College in 1960, independent research studies on marine organisms have been
an important part of the scholastic activities pursued by biology faculty and
students. The marine facility reflects the central role that marine biology
plays in the mission of a college that borders Sarasota Bay. Currently, research
areas, seawater systems, and field equipment are scattered across five building
some distance away from the bay. Completion of the facility will increase
productivity of research activities by permitting: increased number of projects;
possibilities for studying a wider range of marine organisms and ecosystems; and
better control of environmental variables for maintaining and investigating a
variety of organisms. The new facility will also have a significant impact on
the number of New College graduates entering the professional biological science
pipeline, not only in traditional marine biology, but also in the areas of
behavior and community ecology, population genetics, reproductive and
conservation biology and neuroscience.
