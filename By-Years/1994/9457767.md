Object-oriented programming promises to make programs easier to write, easier
to extend, and easier to reuse. The Cecil project aims to help object-oriented
technology deliver on this promise through integrated language design,
implementation, and programming environment research. The Cecil language is a
purely object-oriented language which is serving as a vehicle for investigating
new language features. Current research includes studying more flexible kinds of
method lookup based on symmetric multiple dispatching, investigating the
effectiveness of advanced static type systems at expressing practical object-
oriented programming problems, and developing new module constructs that support
application-specific tailoring of objects. Programming environment support for
these and other features of object-oriented languages is crucial for effective
use of object-oriented programming styles. Advanced language designs and
programming styles only impact practice if efficient implementations are
available. The Vortex compiler project is investigating whole-program analysis.
Interprocedural analysis of object-oriented programs is the foundation of this
work, dynamic profile information is treated as an integral component of the
compiler, helping to focus the compiler's efforts on profitable optimizations.
Incremental recompilation techniques for object-oriented languages help to keep
turn-around time short. The Vortex compiler initially targets the Cecil
language, with front-ends for other languages such as C++ planned for the
future. The Vortex compiler is written in Cecil itself, providing feedback for
the language design research and a realistic benchmark for the compiler
research.
