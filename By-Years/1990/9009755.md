The objective of this project is to build CEP, an environment for Conditional
Equational Programming. This will include a practical, efficient interpreter for
the equational language, facilities for proving program correctness, and for
doing program transformation and synthesis. Equational Programming is gaining
wide popularity as the cleanest way to provide in a simple, well-understood, and
uniform framework the features of both Lisp-like functional programming and
Prolog-like logic programming. A program is a set of (conditional) equations for
example {0 + x = x, s(x) + y = s(x+y)} and a computation consists of solving an
equation, for example x + y = s(s(0)) (finding substitutions that make two terms
equal in the theory). A new procedure, formulated as a set of inference rules
has been developed for equation solving. This formulation not only improves
current methods, but also permits easy incorporation of techniques, that are
being developed, for detecting equations that are unsatisfiable, thus pruning
the search space even further. Also, building on previous results in the theory
of conditional rewriting, methods will be investigated for proving the
correctness of a given equational program. Building CEP and distributing it to
other researchers will have a significant impact in the fields of logic and
functional programming. It will spur a lot more development and the use of this
paradigm as the cleanest way to combine logic and functional programming.
