Research into a broad spectrum of topics in collision physics, ultra-cold atomic
gases and optical physics, will be undertaken by the three PI's supported in
this award. JILA, and the University of Colorado provide an ideal environment
for the theoretical atomic, molecular and optical physics of the three
investigators. The funding goes entirely for the support graduate students who,
in addition to having superb mentors, will be exposed to the leading edge
experiments in Bose condensation and quantum computing.
