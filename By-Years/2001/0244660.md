Summary for award DMS-0244660&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project concerns deep
connections between fundamental questions in&lt;br/&gt;number theory, analytic
properties of L-functions, and random matrix&lt;br/&gt;theory. The investigators
will undertake a series of projects aimed at&lt;br/&gt;establishing links
between arithmetic and the random matrix conjectures&lt;br/&gt;for zeros of
L-functions. These results will lead to significant progresson long-standing
questions in number theory. Conversely, progress onthese arithmetic questions
will lead to new results in random matrixtheory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work
in this proposal will extend recently discovered connections&lt;br/&gt;between
problems in number theory and results in mathematical
physics.&lt;br/&gt;Significant progress is anticipated by exploring the
relationship betweennumber theoretic L-functions and the random matrix theory
techniques developed by physicists. This work will bring together researchers in
different fields and, through the participation of graduate students and
postdoctoral fellows, provide an opportunity for stronger connections between
these two research areas. It will also introduce undergraduate students to
nature of scientific research. Finally, progress in this area will be presented
at a workshop and conference in the final year of the proposed work. Designed to
introduce graduate students and postdocs to new developments in these fields,
these forums will map out the progress made by this grant and prepare the
participants to extend this work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
