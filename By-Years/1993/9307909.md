9307909 Klinzing An advanced control system to optimize the operation of
pneumatic conveying equipment will be investigated, using as input the pressure
fluctuations which is naturally induced by two-phase solids-gas flow in pipes.
The flow pattern to be optimized determines the energy consumption, the
operation life of the equipment, and the stability in operation. Computer
control, fuzzy logic analysis and neural network techniques will be developed
and applied, in order to obtain a stable and economical flow pattern in
operation. The recommended control techniques will be transmitted to industrial
partners, who will form an "industrial advisory board" to review the research
progress and its transfer to industry. The proposed research may have important
results for increasing the efficiency and reliability of pneumatic transport in
chemical manufacturing, mining sites, pharmaceutical and food industry. This is
a university-industry collaborative research project, as defined in the NSF
Announcement GOALI (Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry, NSF
93-149). ***
