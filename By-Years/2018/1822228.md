This project will examine the relationships among social media use, community
attachment, social capital, and civic engagement. Concerns have been widely
expressed that our increasing use of individualizing technologies such as a
personalized Internet potentially threatens civic engagement and thereby the
health of our communities. Civically engaged communities experience lower rates
of crime, poverty, and unemployment, and higher rates of health and education.
This research seeks a set of best practices or guidelines that can be used by
community members to facilitate increased civic engagement in the Internet
context, and the participatory design activities will produce situated tools for
specific civic activities within each of the three communities to be studied. By
focusing on rural contexts, this study will also contribute to our understanding
of how an understudied population uses information and communication for social
purposes. Both women, who outnumber men among rural social media users, and
rural residents generally are underrepresented in current studies of social
media. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The participatory design components of the project
will help design useful tools for increasing civic engagement and will
contribute to a critical discourse on design methods. This effort builds on
current research in the development of social capital through social media,
technology and social change to produce a model of the relationship between
social media and civic engagement that provides more nuanced understanding of
how social media facilitates collaborative endeavors. This model will explain
how users decide which social media to use, under what conditions, for what
purposes, and how their use impacts collective civic endeavors. Interviews will
be conducted with participants in both rural and urban communities in order to
understand how social media can (or cannot) be leveraged in service of civic
engagement.
