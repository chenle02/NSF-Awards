Students are benefiting from a laboratory equipped with microcomputers running
the computer algebra system Derive in their preparation for careers in high
technology environments. "Real world" problems of a complexity not approachable
by students before are being analyzed by graphical, numerical, and symbolic
techniques. The institution will contribute an amount equal to the award.
