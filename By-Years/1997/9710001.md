9710001 Bein The focus of this research is on nanoporous films as hosts for
selective chemical sensors derived from assembled ordered nanostructures
composed of optically responsive receptors encapsulated in thin films of micro-
and mesoporous hosts. The novel structures will be formed by first inducing the
growth of certain molecular sieve crystals and mesoporous ordered channel
structures on modified sensor substrates, followed by encapsulation of receptor
sites into these channels. Using this approach, it will be possible to create
chemically sensitive nanostructures on optical fibers that combine unique
chemical selectivity with high stability due to encapsulation in rigid host
cages. %%% The focus of this research is on nanoporous films as hosts for
