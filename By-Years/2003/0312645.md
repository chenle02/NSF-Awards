This collaborative proposal comes from the MIT and Rice University groups and
requests funds to support the testing and refinement of the Grid-embedded
framework, developed under an earlier ITR grant, to support the analysis of
large high energy physics datasets. The framework is based on the implementation
of the Parallel ROOT Facility (PROOF). The new proposal builds on the
developments currently underway and aims at providing a consistent interactive
analysis interface over the full range of available computing resources. The
main research topics are the optimization of resource discovery and allocation
algorithms based on tests in a fully operational prototype environment, and
real-time monitoring and fault tolerance and recovery in an interactive
environment. Prototypes of the proposed system will be used in the context of
physics studies for the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS), one of the experiments
under construction at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the CERN Laboratory in
Geneva, Switzerland. The data from this experiment is on the scale of several
petabyes per year. This research will be of immediate benefit not only for High
Energy and Nuclear Physics, but also for a large number of ROOT-based projects
outside of physics, including life sciences and medical applications.
