0424682&lt;br/&gt;Karner &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is for support of a
planning visit by a team of geologists from Columbia and other US universities,
headed by Dr. Garry Karner, Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory, Columbia
University, to Egypt to develop plans for a large, multi-university, proposal on
MARGINS to be submitted to NSF. There is evidence that there is a need to have
firm Egyptian agreement to support US investigators doing research within Egypt
before these investigators may apply for NSF support. The PI and some of his
colleagues will meet with Dr. Aly Tealeb, the president of Egypt's National
Institute of Astronomy and Geophysics Research (NIARG), to discuss the issues
involved and the expected participation by several research institutes in the
U.S. and several others in Egypt in the proposed research. The two sides are to
clarify terms of US-Egypt collaboration in this major research effort to study
the Red Sea rift in which researchers on a research vessel will conduct work in
Egyptian territorial waters and on the land along the length of Egypt's coast.
The research is expected to shed light on the evolution of the Red Sea basin
given the movements of the adjacent continents, and may explain some of the
phenomena leading to seismic activities in the countries in the region.
