9353500 Stanley This project builds on earlier and concurrent projects to
develop materials for students which incorporate the concepts of randomness in
nature. Participating teachers, and ultimately students, are given the
opportunity to discover and explore natural phenomena in much the same way a
scientist would. Using existing units including random walks, accretion and
percolation, many activities have been and are being developed which relate to
each of the sciences. Examples include the growth of nerve cells, lightning
strokes, termite tunnels, erosion gullies, tree roots, and forest growth.
Lessons such as these can be included in existing courses or be combined to make
a complete one year course on interdisciplinary science. An important aspect of
this project is the reeducation of the teachers to assume different roles.
Teachers become guides, mentors and coaches to students. Instead of the more
traditional mathematics and rule based science, the students build their
understanding of processes and relationships through exploring natural
phenomena. The project trains 32 (country-wide) teachers the first summer and
two groups of 32 teachers each of the following two summers for a total of 160
From each group of 32, 10 teacher leaders are selected to assume additional
roles and to help train additional teachers. The cost sharing is estimated at
43%
