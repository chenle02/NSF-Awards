INT-9600505 Schilling This U.S.-Polish Cooperative Research award is to support
research on "Starch Additives for Plastic Shaping of Ceramics." The principal
researchers are Dr. Christopher Schilling of Iowa State University and Dr. Piotr
Tomasik of the Hugon Kollataj Academy of Agriculture in Crakow, Poland. The
researchers plan to develop a variety of new, modified starches that can serve
as environmentally safe plasticizers and binders in the powder processing of
advanced ceramic materials. By developing a better fundamental understanding of
the chemical interactions between ceramic powders and the new starches, the
collaborators hope to establish an improved scientific basis for ceramic
manufacturing in an industry where Edisonian approaches are typical. This
research in materials research fulfills the program objectives of bringing
together leading experts in the U.S. and Poland to combine complementary efforts
and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence on the basis
of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit. *** ??
