This is a continuation of the research on "Drought Management in the Humid
Southeast of the United States". The intense drought of the summer of 1988
provided additional information that will be used for determining the
effectiveness of measures taken by different sectors of the economy: the
coordination of efforts between the public and the private sector; the
effectiveness of the knowledge and technology transfers from the research to the
operational communities; and the research still needed on this natural hazard
especially for intense and protracted drought episodes. A series of regional
assessments will be conducted and a gathering will be called by the end of the
project.
