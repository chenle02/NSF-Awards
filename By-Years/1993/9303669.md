9303669 Bloomer The PIs have completed descriptions and interpretations of
dredged samples, bathymetry and petrology of most of the Mariana Trough. In the
present project they will carry out petrological/geochemical analysis of a
selected group of samples. The data will be used to model evolution of incipient
back arc basins. ***
