This award is for the development of educational materials for early
introduction into the computer science curriculum of formal methods and object-
oriented programming. Material on operational, denotational, and logical
semantics will be developed, as well as laboratory exercises and related
materials for teaching object-oriented programming and design. Colgate
University plans to develop a network of computer science educators from a wide
variety of institutions who will contribute to this project. Curriculum
materials will be disseminated through Internet, and presented at workshops, and
at other educational and professional meetings. Colgate University plans to
develop materials in object- oriented programming and in formal methods for
introduction into intermediate-level computer science courses. Work on object-
oriented programming and design will focus on the development of laboratory
materials for several hardware platforms; work on formal methods will focus on
two major areas: program verification and operations, denotational and logical
semantic. The results of the curriculum and materials development will be
disseminated through Internet, and will be presented at workshops, and
educational and professional meetings.
