The purpose of the project is to probe the dissipation&lt;br/&gt;mechanism in
viscous approximation of multidimensional compressible&lt;br/&gt;potential flow
by studying the regularity property, positivity of density,&lt;br/&gt;and
dynamics of convective singularity surfaces, to justify the
relation&lt;br/&gt;between variety of plate theories and three dimensional
elasticity theory by&lt;br/&gt;deriving the asymptotic limit of three
dimensional nonlinear elasticity,&lt;br/&gt;to deepen the understanding of
optimal transport mechanism in&lt;br/&gt;non-turbulent semi-geostrophic
equations, to investigate evolution of&lt;br/&gt;interface in multi-phase
crystal growth in material science, stochastic&lt;br/&gt;solutions of Hamilton-
Jacobi equations which model many interesting&lt;br/&gt;physical processes such
as front propagation in combustion.&lt;br/&gt; Rigorous mathematics in the study
of the nonlinear partial&lt;br/&gt;differential equtions addressed in the
project make it possible both to&lt;br/&gt;conduct stable numerical computation
in, and to understand the qualitative&lt;br/&gt;features of the phenomena
addressed above. One of our objectives is to&lt;br/&gt;study viscous
oompressible potential flow and semi-geostrophic flow. The&lt;br/&gt;advance in
the knowledge of global large solutions of mathematical&lt;br/&gt;equations has
important impact on our fundamental understanding of air&lt;br/&gt;flow. The
second objective is to analyze the front propagation of crystal&lt;br/&gt;growth
and thin-film blistering in the semiconducting materials from
which&lt;br/&gt;computing devices are manufactured. The third objective of this
project is&lt;br/&gt;the training of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows
in the&lt;br/&gt;mathematical analysis of applied problems.&lt;br/&gt;
