This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Online social networks (OSNs) have
become central to the lives of millions of people worldwide. Unfortunately,
existing OSNs cede responsibility for user data to a single administrative
entity, and are inherently prone to violations of users&amp;#700; privacy. This
sensitive user data creates an attractive target for hackers and can be abused
by internal administrators. This work argues that more decentralized
alternatives to the dominant OSN architecture can provide a better balance
between features and privacy. By endowing OSN participants with full ownership
and control of their personal data, including control over which machines are
allowed to store information and who is allowed to access it, decentralized OSN
architectures have the potential to reduce the risk of a large-scale privacy
breach while providing OSN features, efficiency, and availability that are
competitive with more centralized schemes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
work will provide insights into the fundamental tension between privacy and
features in OSN-service architectures. Implementation and evaluation of methods
based on these insights will lead to greater understanding of the features,
efficiency, and availability that decentralized OSN architectures can support.
The work will enable scientific inquiry into a wide range of social phenomena
through the development of privacy-preserving methods and infrastructure for
collecting location data. The work will also strengthen ties between computer
science and on-campus initiatives for integrating undergraduate education and
research through the Duke SmartHome.
