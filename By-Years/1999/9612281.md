9612281 Sturm The PI's propose an interdisciplinary program to investigate the
critical issues currently confronting developments in the new and very promising
field of polymer-based organic light emitting devices (OLEDs). Red, green and
blue emitting OLEDs have recently gained worldwide attention due to their
promise for revolutionizing the flat panel display industry. Before these
devices can be used in practical low cost displays, however, many problems of
fundamental as well as of a practical nature must be addressed and solved. Among
the most important issues, which are the subject of the proposed investigations,
are: (i) thickness and compositional control of the light emitting and charge-
transporting thin films; (ii) control and reduction of impurity incorporation
into the films, as well as assessment of the effects of impurities on OLED
performance, (iii) understanding and control of electron and excitor transport
across organic/organic and organic/metal interfaces, (iv) improvement of device
reliability, and (v) device processing and integration. We have assembled a
multidisciplinary team of researchers from the Departments of Chemistry,
Chemical, and Electrical Engineering at Princeton University and the University
of Southern California with a long term track record of collaboration for making
fundamental advances in the field of OLEDs. We will apply a range of novel
concepts and experimental methods to address all four of these key issues to the
study of polymer/polymer, polymer/small molecule, and organic/metal interfaces
and devices. We anticipate that the impact of this work will extend well beyond
OLED science and technology, into the field of a wide range of active polymeric
and small molecular organic heterojunction devices such as transistors and solar
cells. ***
