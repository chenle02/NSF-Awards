The history of the climate is recorded in deep sea sediments and reflection
seismology is one of the principal methods of studying these sediments. Yet we
have a poor understanding of the relation between observed seismic reflection
records and variations in physical properties of deep sea sediments. In order to
investigate the relationship between the observed sequence of seismic
reflections in the deep ocean and various physical and chemical oceanographic
events over the last 30 million years the principal investigators propose to
collect high resolution seismic data on the Ontong Java Plateau where water
depths range from 2000 meters to 4500 meters and where a series of existing and
proposed drill holes provide a detailed record of oceanographic events over this
time period. This region is one of the few regions of the world where seismic
lines can be run continuously over this depth range without encountering major
structural or erosional interruption. This depth range is critical because
sediments deposited in depths of 4500 meters will have experienced considerable
dissolution of carbonate, a major component of the sediment record; sediments as
shallow as 2000 meters will not have experienced this dissolution. It is thought
that the seismic reflection record in the deep Pacific Ocean is related to
periods of varying degrees of dissolution. It is not known what causes the
impedence contrasts that produce the reflection record in shallower waters away
from sources of terrigenous sediment. Seismic lines tying directly from the deep
ocean to intermediate depths will be important in advancing our understanding of
observed seimic records.
