This award provides support to the Department of Anthropology at City College of
the City University of New York to establish an REU Site Project to involve
undergraduates in the study of contem porary socio-cultural change among the
highland Maya and Mexican national (Ladino or Mestizo) communities of Chiapas,
southeastern Mexico. Students will live with families in Indian villages three
days a week, coming in to the research center in the city of San Cristobal de
las Casas for seminars, Maya language lessons, and discussion with the PI. Group
trips to handicraft production cooperatives, experimental agricultural stations,
and government offices will take place periodically in accord with the research
needs of the project. Students will learn basic censusing techniques, extensive
interviewing and oral narrative accounts, participant observation, and
apprenticeship training to learn the socialization process in handicraft
production. They will write daily diaries and submit a summary report at the end
of the project. The observations of students located in families in five
different communities will add up to an account of coping strategies in the debt
crisis Mexico is undergoing. She will draw on the expertise of George Collier,
Jan Rus, and Nancy Modiano who will help in the allocation of students and enter
into weekly seminar discussions.
