The purpose of this grant is to provide financial support for an International
Conference on Auroral Physics which will take place at St. Johns College in
Cambridge, England from July 11 to 15, 1988. Space physics, particularly the
subject of solar terrestrial interaction, has progressed very rapidly since the
late 1960's. The various spaceborne low altitude particle and field measurements
over the polar region and the global auroral imaging capability on several
spacecraft have brought auroral physics into a new era. On the other hand,
because of the complication of each specific instrumentation, and the need for a
higher level of knowledge in interpreting the observations, many scientists
doing auroral-related investigations focus on relatively narrow topics.
Communication and information interchange have not matched the recent rapid
progress in both observations and theoretical work. This interchange is
particularly difficult in auroral physics because activities are spread over
many disciplines: atomic and molecular physics, geomagnetism, ionospheric
physics, spectroscopy, magnetospheric physics, optics, theoretical plasma
physics, space instrumentation, etc. There has not been any dedicated conference
on auroral physics for over ten years, even though there have been numerous
conferences on magnetospheric topics which included only certain parts of
auroral phenomena. The purpose of the international conference is to bring
scientists who are working and interested in different aspects of auroral
research, and scattered in the various disciplines together to review and
discuss the state of knowledge of auroral phenomena. More importantly,
scientists must know others' present endeavors. This meeting will, of course,
stimulate further collaboration is auroral research across different
disciplines. A monograph will be published. Furthermore, this conference will be
able to encourage young scientists to participate and identify future research
in his/her specialized discipline as well as an opportunity to broaden into
other disciplines.
