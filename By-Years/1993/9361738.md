9361738 Entine A high speed, high sensitivity avalanche photodiode (ADP) array
is proposed to meet the stringent requirements of detectors for high energy
physics experiments such as the central tracker vertex detector and calorimeters
which are being designed for existing and proposed particle physics detectors.
These detectors will have unprecedented performance characteristics to be used
as readouts for the very low light levels produced in scintillating plastic
fibers which result from charged particle interactions at very high recycle
rates. The approach taken will be to modify existing APD designs to yield a
device with lower dark current, increased sensitivity at short wavelengths, and
faster cycle times when operated in the single photon Geiger mode. Consideration
was given to adaptability of the APD to active quenching circuitry. Constructing
high gain devices that fulfill detector needs for proportional mode operation
such as those required for high dynamic range calorimetry measurements will also
be investigated. The data gathered during this work will be used to produce an
APD array with the required combination of characteristics to be used in high
speed, low light level applications envisioned at modern detectors such as the
D0 at Fermilab and L3 at CERN. Millions of detectors will be needed for modern
particle physics facilities. This alone is a large market. Also, these improved
APD's will find numerous other uses in industrial applications, such as medical
imaging, and research applications. *** v s t $ $ $ ( F / / 1 Courier Symbol
