This is a Career Advancement Award supported under the Research Opportunities
for Women Program and the Economics Program. The broad purpose of this type of
award is to enable promising women scholars to increase their research
productivity. With this award, the investigator will concentrate on acquiring
graduate level training in economics. The investigator's field of expertise is
agricultural history of the Soviet Union. This training will allow her to
incorporate economic analysis into her study of the Soviet Union. The
investigator has already gathered a rich, village level data set of agriculture
in general and also of nonagricultural employment in three districts in Northern
Russia. Her research will focus on nineteenth century labor migration using
these and other data. An analytical framework will be developed to measure the
impact of peasant migration on the village community, on rural development, and
the process of industrial development during the nineteenth century. This
research is particularly important for developing a better understanding of the
economic development process.
