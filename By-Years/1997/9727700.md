The project seeks to implement a computational scheme for evaluating the
nonlinear interaction terms which describe ocean surface waves. The objectives
include treatment of the four-wave interaction important for deep-water
computations, and treatment of the three-wave interaction with capillary waves
present. The three-wave and four-wave interactions in water of finite depth will
also be treated. The research consists of three phases: The first is to program
the solutions, which is aided by recent release of Matlab Version 5; the second
phase is to exercise the solver on a range of problems, about which valuable
information already exists; And the third phase is to incorporate models of
driving and dissipation into the equations.
