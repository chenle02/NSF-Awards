This award provides 53% of the acquisition costs for an automated multiple
collection thermal ionization source mass spectrometer to be operated and
maintained in the Department of Earth and Space Sciences at the State University
of New York (SUNY) in Stony Brook. The remaining funds are to be provided by the
SUNY system. The acquisition of the mass spectrometer system is necessary for
the continuance of research projects involving five faculty members and
approximately 15 graduate research students in the Department of Earth and Space
Sciences. The research areas needing the high precision, the low-abundance
sensitivity, and the micro-sample capabilities of the new instrument include:
work on Tertiary volcanism in the southwest U.S.; geochemical studies of
magmatism along the East Pacific Rise; trace element studies of the origin of
dolomites; lead isotopic studies of the lead- zinc ores in the Mississippi
Valley; and the oxygen, carbon, strontium and boron isotope abundances of
ancient seawater and carbonate deposits.
