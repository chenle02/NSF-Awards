This award supports continued cooperative research between Dr. Hans R. Bilger of
Oklahoma State University and Dr. G.E. Stedman of the University of Canterbury,
Christchurch, to complete construction and attain operation of a plane, square 1
m2 high- resolution ringlaser and of a prototype of a slightly smaller ring (898
mm X 837 mm) at the University of Canterbury, and to use the instrument to
measure geophysical effects such as seismic action and earth tides. The
collaboration, begun in 1989 under award number INT 89-00033, is a productive
blend of the experimental skills of Dr. Bilger with the more theoretical
interests of Dr. Stedman regarding the use of ringlasers to measure geophysical,
atomic spectroscopic, and general relativistic effects. Sensing and recording
earth tides and seismic activity with a ringlaser is novel, and should
significantly advance assessment of the instrument to these applications. In
addition, the site of the ringlaser should allow more exact measurement of
seismic activities from the nearby, very active, Pacific Plate-Indian Plate
boundary.
