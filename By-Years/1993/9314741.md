9314741 Heathcock The focus of this research is the continuation of a varied
program of total synthesis. Among the projects are the use of biomimetic routes
to the Daphniphyllum alkaloids, the development of synthetic approaches to the
Lycopodium aklaloids including magellanone, synthesis of the highly cytotoxic
marine natural product cephalostatin, preparation of the squalene synthase
inhibitor zaragozic acid and the synthesis of severalusual polysulfide natural
products. %%% With this renewal award, the Synthetic Organic Program will
support the research of Dr. Clayton H. Heathcock of the Department of Chemistry
at the University of California, Berkeley. Professor Heathcock will focus his
work on synthetic projects directed towards the preparation of interesting
natural products. ***
