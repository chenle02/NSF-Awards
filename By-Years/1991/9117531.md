Fluid exerts significant mechanical and chemical effects on virtually all
crustal processes. Recent observations suggest that elevated pore pressures may
exist in a range of crustal environments, including mature fault zones and
accretionary complexes. Quantitative modeling of the generation and maintenance
of overpressure in most of these problems requires a fundamental understanding
of the relation among permeability, porosity and stress. This is an experimental
program to determine permeability and porosity changes in porous aggregates
(sandstones, hot pressed quartz, and ODP samples) under triaxial compression
conditions. Microstructural observations, acoustic emission measurements and
percolation modeling will be integrated in the study so as to gain a fundamental
physical understanding of compaction/dilatancy and hydraulic transport in the
crust.
