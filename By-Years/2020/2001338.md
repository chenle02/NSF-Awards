This project examines how social class affects the experiences of women with
police. Few studies have researched police behavior against women across social
class lines. This project addresses three questions: (1) How does social class
influence womenâ€™s experiences with police? (2) How prevalent is police
misbehavior involving women? (3) How do women draw on resources to contend with
police misbehavior involving themselves and their communities? This study will
provide empirical evidence regarding the impact of social class on police
misbehavior involving women, including the documentation of various forms of
misbehavior. Findings from this project will assist stakeholders at multiple
levels of government in creating gender-inclusive police procedural and police
reform policies. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project uses a mixed-methodological
design consisting of interviews, field observations, and surveys. In-depth
interviews are conducted with women from different social class backgrounds
about their interactions with police. Field observations include attendance at
community events regarding women, police misbehavior, or police reform. Local
surveys are utilized to examine the specific types of policing women report
experiencing. Based on an analysis of these data, a national survey was
developed to examine the prevalence and scope of police misbehavior involving
women. Findings from the national survey will provide insights regarding
criminological theories of policing, as well as theories regarding racial
inequality and gender inequality in the operation of the criminal justice
system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
