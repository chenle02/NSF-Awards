This project brings the Mathematica public-domain software Signal Processing
Packages (SPP) to engineering, mathematics, and physics students who can use
computers to speed up their learning process, to learn material on their own, to
test themselves, to generate their own problems and answers. The University of
the Pacific is setting up a laboratory with computers dedicated to SPP for
students to do assigned problems. These computers are being used to complement
and not to replace students' understanding of the basic principles involved.
Thus, only after the students demonstrate they can solve problems in a certain
area are they assigned computer problems in that area. SPP covers most areas
taught in engineering and mathematics. Areas not covered by SPP are covered by
Mathematica. This project is being designed liberate students from the drudgery
of repeated calculations. The student use the time saved to learn new material
or do other homework.
