9404601 Gromoll The research involves studies into the structure and
parametrization of submanifolds of certain classes of differentiable manifolds.
Rigidity problems will be undertaken in view of curvature properties. The
geometry of metric fibrations will also be considered. This research has
potential important applications to other branches of differential geometry and
mathematical physics. Submanifold geometry has found recent applications to
soliton theory. ***
