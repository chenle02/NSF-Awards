9301049 Ravizza This study will refine results from a pilot study which suggests
that the ratio of Os isotopes in two kinds of sediments (from mid ocean ridges
and from areas of high organic input) may record variations in seawater
chemistry over time. the author proposes to study several different sites at
greater detail in order to determine intersample precision. Successful
development of the technique will permit use of Os to address issues of global
geochemical cycles and possibly of varying cosmic flux. ***
