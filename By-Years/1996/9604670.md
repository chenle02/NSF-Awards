9604670 PADEN The pituitary is often called the master gland of the body because
hormones that it releases control the function of other glands. One of these
hormones is adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), which stimulates production of
cortisol and other steroid hormones by the adrenal gland. ACTH release is in
turn controlled by the brain, which stimulates the pituitary to release ACTH in
times of stress or injury. Thus understanding the mechanisms by which the brain
controls ACTH release is essential for understanding how stress affects the
body. It has been known for many years that the brain stimulates ACTH release in
part by releasing hormones itself, but it has been unclear if other control
mechanisms also exist. Dr. Paden and others have recently discovered that nerve
fibers of unknown origin enter the pituitary gland and appear to contact the
cells that make ACTH (called corticotrophs). His current studies will determine
where these nerves come from and what type of chemical signals they may employ
to affect the activity of corticotrophs. Other experiments will investigate
whether or not these nerves respond to stress. Results from these studies may
demonstrate the existence of an additional pathway by which the brain can
control ACTH release, providing new insights into the mechanisms of the stress
response.
