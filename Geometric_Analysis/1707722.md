This grant funds the travel of participants from the United States to attend the
international conference "Analysis and Geometry on Graphs and Manifolds" to be
held from July 31 through August 4, 2017, at the University of Potsdam in
Germany. The focus of this conference is the interplay between analysis and the
geometry of the underlying space in both the continuous and discrete settings. A
main goal is to bring experts from these two different frameworks together in
order to exchange ideas and develop techniques for a unified approach.

The conference will focus on the prototypes for the discrete and continuous
settings, namely, graphs and manifolds. Both settings have an associated
Laplacian and Dirichlet form which is non-local in the case of graphs and
strongly local in the manifold case. Thus, while there are many commonalities in
terms of set-up and questions asked, the techniques are often quite different
with no direct analogues between the two. Recent advances in notions of
curvature and intrinsic metrics in the discrete setting have lead to a better
conceptual understanding of the similarities and differences between these two
settings; however, a unified perspective is still incomplete.
