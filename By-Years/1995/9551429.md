This project builds a regional, multidisciplinary database on local watersheds
using the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) platform. The database supports
three curricular innovations by allowing the university to (1) introduce GIS as
a novel multidisciplinary tool to teach lower-division nonmajors about science,
(2) incorporate a variety of GIS applications by adding Global Positioning
Systems (GPS) technology to enhance upper- division, field-based courses in the
sciences, and (3) expand our present GIS capability to support multidisciplinary
and collaborative undergraduate research. Faculty and students from four
disciplines (Biology, Geography, Geology, Environmental Health), with a combined
population of over 700 majors, participate in this project. The new equipment
enables the university to integrate GIS capabilities across multiple
disciplines, to provide reasonable access to the regional GIS database by
students and by faculty who will be involved in curriculum development, and to
provide the new technology to gather primary site data in field-based courses
and in student research.
