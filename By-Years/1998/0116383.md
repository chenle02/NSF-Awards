With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Maryland in College Park will
acquire an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. This equipment will enhance
research in a number of areas: a) nanostructure reactivity and registration at
solid surfaces; b) derivatization of metal and metal oxide surfaces via
molecular and mesoscopic self assembly; c) chemical vapor deposition of metal
oxides; d) combinatorial synthesis of functional oxides; and e) soft chemical
routes to novel solid state materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The X-ray
photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) is used for chemical analysis. It irradiates a
sample with a beam of monochromatic X-rays and the energies of the resulting
photoelectrons are measured and related to specific elements. XPS often plays a
crucial role in defining the system under study. The work to be carried out by
these investigators represents a highly coherent attack on a range of issues at
the forefront of materials chemistry. &lt;br/&gt;
