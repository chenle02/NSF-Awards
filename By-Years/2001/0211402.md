A kinetic theory of the electron heat flux instability in low-beta solar coronal
holes will be developed and its role in the heating and acceleration of the fast
solar wind will be investigated. A new paradigm is advanced, wherein the
electron heat flux coming from the sun is produced by nanoflares and then
generates ion cyclotron waves, which subsequently heat the overlying corona.
Thus the solar wind driven by ion cyclotron waves is directly coupled to the
nanoflare activity. A new wave damping mechanism, involving the parametric
resonance of particles with a pump wave which drives a cross-field current
instability, and the waves generated by the instability, will be modeled
analytically and numerically. Finally, a kinetic theory of ion heating in the
fast solar wind as a result of this cross-field current instability will be
investigated.
