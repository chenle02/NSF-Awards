9301835 D'Asaro New ideas on the dynamics of the oceanic mixed layer will be
tested using Lagrangian floats to follow turbulent eddies and acoustic remote
sensing to quantify the bubble field. In addition to these field observations, a
series of numerical simulations will be conducted with a three-dimensional model
driven by the observed wind stress, surface fluxes and wave field. The ultimate
goal of this research is to identify the simplest physics that can reliably
reproduce the observations and be incorporated in a mixed layer model.
