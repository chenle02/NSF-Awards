The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research Phase I project is a novel tree bio-herbicide to prevent sprouting of
stumps and girdled trees. If successful, it would replace synthetic chemical
herbicides currently used to stop stump sprouting, cull unwanted trees, prevent
disease, and control invasive species in national parks and forests, managed
timberlands, and along roads, railroads, pipelines, power lines, and other
rights-of-way. In a termite biomimicry approach, the enzymatic mode-of-action
mimics the digestive mechanisms of termites to degrade woody tissues into their
natural breakdown products. This project will enhance the scientific
understanding of termite digestion and apply this understanding toward
developing a commercial biological alternative to the synthetic chemicals used
today.

The technical objectives in this Phase I research project are to characterize
termite digestive enzyme activity responses to feeding on different wood
species, to develop a heterologous production microbe capable of large scale
production of the most promising termite lignocellulases, to determine their
synergistic effects in combinations with commercial lignocellulases, and to
demonstrate the ability of these blends to degrade solid wood and prevent
cambium healing. This project advances termite digestomics and seeks to
commercialize research previously funded in-part by the NSF.
