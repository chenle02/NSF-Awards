This research award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry
program supports work by Professor John F. Hartwig at the University of Illinois
at Urbana-Champaign to develop reactions at typically unreactive C-H bonds. This
work will create new methods to prepare organic molecules by selective chemical
transformations at positions that are inert to most reagents. Complexes
containing bonds between transition metals and boron catalyze these reactions,
and this grant will reveal the properties of the transition metal that lead to
this unusual reactivity. The reactions catalyzed by these complexes have been
and will continue to be applied to the synthesis of polymers containing new
properties, organic molecules with enhanced abilities to emit light, components
of catalysts for other reactions, and organic probes for understanding
biological systems. Work emanating from the proposed research is part of new
curricula for the classroom, short-courses, many external lectures, and a major
textbook project that will be completed in the next grant period by the PI.

This research will lead to new methods to conduct chemical synthesis in fewer
steps, with less waste, and with less reliance on the installation and
protection of functional groups. In addition, this research creates the
underlying principles on which future design of catalysts and processes for more
efficient synthesis are based. Studies to define how the electronic properties
of the metal and how electrophilic or nucleophilic properties of the reactive
ligand affect C-H bond cleavage and functionalization will create these
principles.
