This project establishes two modern workstations/data acquisition systems to
extend student laboratory experiences in electronics, digital systems design,
and materials science. The facility is also used to support senior majors in
conducting their group design projects. The presence of such equipment allows
for more extensive design and analysis of various design alternatives. As such,
the equipment enhances the exposure to computer assisted engineering (CAE)
systems. The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal
investigator's institution.
