Exhumed, orogen-parallel shear zones are commonly found to contain conflicting
sense-of-shear indicators, especially where (1) the pre-shear structures were
not homogeneous, (2) local perturbations modified the flow patterns, or (3) the
shear zone is overprinted by later structures. This study will examine anomalous
shear sense indicators in the Brevard Zone of the southern Appalachian Blue
Ridge and Inner Piedmont, where late stage ductile, brittle-ductile and brittle
structures occur. The results of this study will provide important information
on the kinematic history of this major orogen-parallel deformation zone.
