This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project addresses the
need for low-cost manufacturing of fuel cell components, by the development of a
reel-to-reel electrodeposition process to maximize catalyst dispersion and
utilization at loadings of 0.1 mg/cm2. In Phase I, 1) The feasibility of plating
0.1 mg Pt/cm2 loadings of highly dispersed catalyst (120 m2/g Pt) onto carbon
electrodes will be demonstrated, 2) the catalyzed electrodes will be analyzed
for loading, dispersion and performance in fuel cell stacks, and 3) a reel to-
reel electrodeposition system will be designed.

The ultimate customer for the proposed technology is the automotive consumer. It
is expected that 2.4 million fuel cell powered vehicles, a 4.3% market share in
global auto production, will be on the road by 2011. Further commercial
applications include stationary and non-automotive mobile power sources.
