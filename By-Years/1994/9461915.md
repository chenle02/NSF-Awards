This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project targets the efficient
production of rare earth (misch metal) alloys for use in metal hydride battery
electrodes. The electrolytic reduction of rare earth oxides will be studied.
Deposition characteristics (potential, metal redissolution, sludge formation) of
various rare earth components of misch metal will be investigated in Phase I,
other aspects in Phase II. The information will be used to design, construct and
operate a pilot cell for the production of misch metal with high feed
utilization, high current efficiency, high product quality, and the ability to
tailor product composition by adjusting feed properties. Availability of an
economically attractive process to produce rare earth alloys is expected to lead
to their domestic manufacture. This is desirable because their broad use in
advanced materials is being projected.
