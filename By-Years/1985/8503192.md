The theme of this research is the investigation of the structural properties of
various classes of discrete optimization problems, and the development of new
solution methods capable of extending the sphere of problems that are currently
tractable. The work covers various topics in integer and combinatorial
programming, a theory and methodology with a wide range of applications. Some of
the objectives of the research are: identifying new facets of the set covering
polytope, with a view to using them as cutting planes; developing and testing
new types of randomized heuristics for set covering; identifying new classes of
graphs for which the vertex packing problem is polynomially solvable; developing
disjunctive programming techniques for tighter formulations of mixed integer
programs; applying disjunctive programming and polyhedral combinatorics to
expert system design; decomposing vehicle routing problems; and devising new
relaxations for the traveling salesman problem. The expected outcome of the
research is both new structural insights and efficient solution procedures.
