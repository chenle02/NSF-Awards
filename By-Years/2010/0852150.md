The Principal Investigator (PI) will investigate discontinuities in the solar
wind near the Sun and at the Earth, and use these structures to study magnetic
reconnection events at the Sun. His team will catalog discontinuity types,
calculate discontinuity occurrence frequency as a function of solar wind
characteristics and solar source region, and develop a capability to predict the
types of plasma structures that arrive at Earth. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI's
team will statistically analyze high-resolution plasma and magnetic field data
from the Wind, ACE, Helios-1, and Helios-2 spacecraft to develop criteria to
identify the various types of discontinuities existing in the solar wind. The
team will then use the Wang-Sheeley-Arge (WSA) model to map the solar wind at L1
back to the solar surface, and thus determine from which type of solar-surface
region (for example, center of coronal hole, coronal-hole edge, small coronal
hole, or active region) each discontinuity in their catalog originated.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using their discontinuity catalog, the PI's team will
identify plasma boundaries and suprathermal-electron boundaries, and then
calculate the amount of magnetic flux between each boundary pair using magnetic
field and plasma data collected at 1 AU. From this amount of flux and the
calculated transit time of the solar wind, the will estimate the reconnection
rate at the solar surface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The data needed for this project
are accessible online. The PI expects this effort to lead to a better
understanding of the origin of plasma structure in the heliosphere and the
physical processes acting in the solar wind. This project will train a
postdoctoral scientist and the research results will be incorporated into an
educational outreach program.
