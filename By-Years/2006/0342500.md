With this award from the Chemical Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program, the Department of Chemistry at Howard University will acquire a gas
chromatograph mass spectrometer (GC/MS). This equipment will enhance research in
a variety of areas including a) the synthesis and characterization of
enaminones, a class of anticonvulsant agents; b) bacterial production of
biodegradable plastics; c) synthesis and characterization of surface active
agents from plant metabolites; d) synthesis of calixarenes and study of their
molecular recognition properties; and e) new non-metallocene olefin
polymerization catalysts; and f) behavior of aerosols and particulates in the
environment. &lt;br/&gt;Gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detection
(GC/MS) is an extremely powerful technique used for the separation and analysis
of complex mixtures. This instrument will substantially strengthen scientific
research and training at Howard University. &lt;br/&gt;
