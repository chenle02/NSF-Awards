Sex differences in brain and behavior are a result of the perinatal hormonal
environment. Exposure to testicular androgens during critical developmental
periods can permanently alter the anatomy, biochemistry, and physiology of the
central nervous system. A major question is how do the gonadal steroid hormones
regulate the differentiation of the brain at the cellular level. It is likely
that the hormones act through fundamental developmental mechanisms, such as
controlling how many cells are born, how such cells migrate to reach their
targeted destinations, and whether or not they survive. In this Small Grant for
Exploratory Research, Dr. Tobet will exploit recent technological advances to
examine the mechanisms by which gonadal steroid hormones influence neuron
migration during brain development. He has identified a molecule in radial
glial, a particular cell type of the brain, that could play a role in hormone-
dependent cell migration. Dr. Tobet will now localize this molecule in the
brains of developing males and females and then determining whether its
synthesis is regulated by gonadal steroid hormones. In addition, he will
establish an in vitro culture system to examine cell movements and contacts
directly and under defined and manipulatable conditions. The results from this
work will provide new insights leading towards understanding the biochemical
steps involved in the actions of steroid hormones on the developing nervous
system. The identification and characterization of molecules that regulate the
translation of gonadal steroid signals into permanent changes in brain structure
and ultimately function are essential for determining the process of sexual
differentiation. The importance of these hormonal effects is underscored by
evidence of sex differences and androgen influences in the susceptibility to
certain syndromes, learning disabilities, and neurological disorders.
