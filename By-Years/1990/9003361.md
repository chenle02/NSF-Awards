Two investigators will study Kleinian groups and Teichmuller spaces. One will
analyze deformation spaces and cohomology of Kleinian groups, moduli of Riemann
surfaces and their explicit representations, automorphic forms, and projective
structures. The second will continue his investigation into the structure of
Kleinian groups and hyperbolic 3-orbifolds emphasizing the classification of
geometrically finite groups and combination theorems. The two investigators will
work toward solving several problems related to the study of Kleinian groups. An
example of such a group would be a collection of motions of the plane which
preserve a periodic tiling. As elements of a group these must satisfy several
axioms including one which requires the existence of an inverse element
associated with each element of the group. If one element translates the plane
by two units to the "right," its inverse element would translate the plane two
units to the "left." The study of such motions has led mathematicians to the
solutions of problems involving crystal structures.
