The proposed research will examine synaptic connections in the cortex and
hippocampus of rats. This work will lay the groundwork for future investigations
of experimentally activated pathways in the brain. The discovery of a
generalized marker for recent neural activity will be of great value in studies
of brain dysfunctions in which learning is impaired.
