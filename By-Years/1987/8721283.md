Within a market the reservation value that a trader places on the good being
traded may be private, known to him alone. This privacy enables him when he
makes a bid or an offer to misreport strategically his true value. In small
markets, because of this strategic misreporting, trading mechanisms implement
inefficient allocations at least part of the time. In large markets this
inefficiency vanishes because each trader is negligible and can not manipulate
the price effectively. This project identifies and verifies fundamental
conjectures about the characteristics of markets. One such conjecture is that
under general conditions doubling the number of traders (1) halves the maximal
amount by which traders misreport their reservation values and (2) quarters the
mechanism inefficiency. Another conjecture is that no equilibrium of a sealed
bid double auction has ex ante efficient performance, no matter how many traders
there are. The project also compares the performance of structured markets such
as double auctions with decentralized exchanges. The results of this study
should improve our understanding of the advantages of organized markets and the
reason why such institutions developed.
