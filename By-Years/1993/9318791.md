Over the past seven years there has been an increasing interest in database
programming languages that has resulted in a number of working prototypes and
has influenced, for example, the design of query languages for object-oriented
databases. This research is now taking on new directions. It includes
foundations of database programming languages, bulk types and iterators, types
and data models, distributed object stores, heterogeneous databases,
interoperability and communication with structured text. Much of this research
stems from co-operation between groups of researchers in the US and EC, and the
objective is to maintain this cooperative research through a series of joint
workshops that include the continuation of the Database Programming Language and
Persistent Object Store workshops as well as new workshops on Finite Model
theory, Data Exchange Formats, and Data Mapping and Matching. The results of
these workshops, which will be published as conference proceedings, will provide
new techniques for querying and and integrating not only standard database
systems but also the wide variety of oth er structured data sources that are
used, for example, for the representation of scientific data.
