University&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: The Global Engineering College: Integrating
International Training into Engineering
Education&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most
significant development in modern engineering over the last decade has been the
increasing globalization of corporate economies. Today's engineering graduates
are regularly asked to collaborate with colleagues of diverse backgrounds and
who are working at sites or with affiliate companies around the world.
Specifically, modern engineering practice requires competence in novel
collaboration and communication skills in addition to the technical skills
taught in traditional engineering curricula. These skills include, for example,
collaborative teaming and team management skills, cross-cultural communication
skills and the ability to perform on geographically distributed teams. This
project will undertake plans to infuse the engineering curriculum with
opportunities for international experiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
