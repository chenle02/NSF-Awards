This project is based on the idea that the climate system may be understood as a
network of nonlinearly coupled structures, an approach developed under a
previous NSF award (ATM-0438612). Work published under that award indicates that
major shifts, or regime transitions, in the climate system result from changes
in the synchronicity and coupling strength among climate
modes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will extend their previous results
in two ways:&lt;br/&gt;1) They will further explore the dynamics of
synchronization events by analyzing the underlying connections between the modes
of the network, seeking a single "pace keeper" mode for the internal dynamical
shifts in global temperature trends, and further investigate the physics of
synchronization events. The idea, here, is that the teleconnection patters
comprise nodes of a network, which become synchronized prior to major shifts in
the climate system.&lt;br/&gt;2) They will apply new network-theoretical tools
to climate records, such as "communities" of modes, optimal modularity, and
"minimum spanning trees." These concepts describe and define properties of the
network that is hypothesized to represent the climate
system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of this work are in encouraging
student participation in professional meetings, through graduate student
training, and in disseminating the value of and results from network theory to a
broad community of investigators. Society will benefit from a greater
understanding of climate events.
