9321261 Alley This award is for support for a three year program to continue the
physical properties measurements and dating of the Greenland Ice Sheet Project
Two (GISP2) ice core, reconstruct accumulation rates, and jointly interpret the
accumulation rate, contaminant and isotopic records. Dating of the GISP2 ice
core has relied most heavily on visible strata, although other indicators have
been critical. Flow discontinuities in the deeper part of the GISP2 core could
invalidate the climate record obtained there. It is thus critical to know at
what depth the climate record becomes suspect. Fortunately, flow discontinuities
have a physical signature that may be detected by study of the size, shape, and
arrangement of grains and their c axes using optical and sonic techniques.
Physical data are also important in ice flow modeling for dating of the deep ice
core and for understanding any past and future changes in the ice sheet. ***
