Grabel 9604367 The long term goals of this investigation are to identity the
genes involved in making, early lineage decisions during mammalian embryogenesis
and to define how the products of these genes interact. Dr. Grabel propose that
the Indian hedgehog (Ihh) gene is involved in initiating both extraembryonic
endoderm and mesoderm differentiation. Evidence accumulated by us using the P9
teratocarcinoma system, as well as ES cells and mouse blastocyst cultures,
suggests a role for Ihh in establishing extraernbryonic endoderm. Proposed
studies will substantiate this role, begin to define the molecular mechanism of
action of Ihh in early mouse embryogenesis, and determine if mesoderm induction
involves Ihh action. Specific Aims are: 1. To substantiate the role of Ihh in
extraembryonic endoderm differentiation. These studies will include situ
hybridization analyses and immunocytochemistry, generating an Ihh-deficient P9
cell line by targeted mutagenesis, and testing the effect of hh peptides. 2. To
identify gene products involved in the hh signaling pathway active during early
mouse embryogenesis. These studies will test the role of the patched (ptc) gene
and of protein kinase A as downstream mediators of Ihh. 3. To determine if Ihh
provides a signal that acts via BMP-2 or BMP-4 to induce mesoderrn. Hedgehog
genes clearly play a critical role in patterning the embryo. These studies
promise to define the role of Ihh in signaling the earliest lineage decision in
the mammalian embryo, distinguishing embryonic from extraembryonic and
establishing primary germ layers.
