This project provides a realistic laboratory environment for training
undergraduate computer science majors in the tools and techniques of software
implementation. A computer-aided software engineering (CASE) laboratory with
sixteen networked workstations is to be established. The workstations are to be
configured with a variety of specialized programs used by software professionals
for the design, implementation, and maintenance of large software systems. Two
senior level software design and implementation courses are to be developed for
the laboratory. In the first course, students study software design using
"Software through Pictures," a CASE tool for structured analysis and design. In
the second course, the focus is on implementation, testing, and maintenance in
the ADA environment. Undergraduates are currently poorly trained in software
design and implementation. This project will establish a laboratory with state-
of-the-art CASE tools for use by undergraduates in software design and
implementation and will address the nation's need for well-trained software
designers.
