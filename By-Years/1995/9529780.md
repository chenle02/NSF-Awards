SBR-9529780 Kwan, Mei-Po Ohio State U. While much research has found differences
in the direction and length of the journey to work of men versus women,
relatively few of these studies have made explicit, empirically based, causal
connection to the other travel activities of women, to the entirety of the time-
and space- constraints of the women, or to differences among women of different
ethnic groups. This Research Planning Grant will support the specification of a
multi-city research design for a survey-based study to investigate these
contexts and differences. The research design will include household surveys,
data tracking and manipulation using a geographic information system, and data
analysis using two large, structural-equation models. Through this award, a
pilot survey will be conducted in metropolitan Columbus, Ohio. The theoretical
utility of this research should be in the conceptual and empirical connection of
women's travel patterns to household context, distance perception, and
ethnicity. The practical utility lies in the potential for improving traffic
forecasting and transport-demand-management models, used for any kind of
infrastructural planning or pollution-control scenarios.
