This grant will support the PI and his collaborators to work on invariants of
incidence matrices, difference sets, strongly regular graphs and the related
error-correcting codes. Incidence matrices arise whenever one considers
relations between two finite sets. Invariants of incidence matrices, such as
p-ranks and Smith normal forms, can reveal a great deal of information of the
underlying incidence structures. The PI plans to continue his research on
various geometric incidence matrices, such as the subspace-inclusion matrices
and their symplectic analogues. The Smith normal form results will have
interesting geometric applications, for example, in classifying ovoids in three-
dimensional projective space over a finite field of even order. Other topics of
research include constructions and nonexistence proofs of difference sets and
strongly regular graphs. The PI's investigation will make use of techniques from
several different areas of mathematics, including representation theory, p-adic
number theory and combinatorics.

Incidence matrices play an important role in many parts of discrete
mathematics, including the theory of error-correcting codes. Most of the
incidence matrices considered in this proposal can be used to generate low
density parity check codes. Efficient error-correcting codes are used nowadays
in our daily life, for example, in CD players, high speed modems, and cellular
phones. Cyclic difference sets are the same objects as binary sequences with
two-level periodic autocorrelation functions. Such sequences have many
applications in radar, spread-spectrum communications and cryptography. This
project will concentrate on the study of invariants of incidence matrices and
the existence questions of difference sets.
