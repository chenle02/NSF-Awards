An agenda-setting workshop of 25-30 invited participants wil be held by the
Center for Information Policy a the University of Maryland. This workshop will
bring together diverse shcolars and practitioners to explore social and economic
issues raised by open source software development. These issues include its
relationship to other forms of hybrid enterprise (such as standards development
and scientific research), and implications for institutions and policies ina
digital society. Particpants will submit sohor statments in advance to structure
the substantive discussion and these statements later will be edited and
published on the Center's web site. The workshop will consider the feasibility
and design of a future international conference that brings together U.S.,
European, and developing world perspectives and
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The qualities and values claimed for open-source
software-security reliabilty, adaptability, extensibility, low cost, and
openness-create marketing opportunities and pose policy questions. The latter
include how the government develops or licenses software for its own use, how
marketplace competition is regulated to promote economic growth and consumer
welfare, and arguments for making the Internet and the benefits of the digital
economy more broadly accessible, in lesser developed countries as well as in the
United States. The success of the open source invites far-ranging speculation
and debate about information architectures, contracts, institutional economics,
and the configuration of intangible assets and innovation processes. Expected
outcomes, include a prioritized set of questions for future research, a web site
for academic research on open source, a bibliography and summary report of the
workshop publicly available on th Center's website along with edited
contributions of participants and links to related other workshops and research.
The workshop wil seek to promote new channels of communication among researchers
and between the practitioner community and academic researchers, and to elicit
broader academic understanding and interest in the issues surrounding open
source. The workshop will consider the feasibility and design of an
international conference that brings together U.S., European, and developing
world research on open source.
