To assist developing countries and countries with economies in transition
formulate their climate-change policies, the United States Government has
committed $25 million over two years for the development of Country Studies to
Address Climate Change. These studies will help establish an analytical and
institutional foundation upon which recipient countries may construct their
national climate action plans and help those countries fulfill their obligations
under the Climate Change Convention. Following review of proposals submitted by
eligible countries, financial and technical support will be provided to selected
counties to enable them to conduct inventories of their greenhouse-gas
emissions, to assess their vulnerability to climate change, and to evaluate
response strategies for mitigating and adapting to climate change. Agencies
participating in the U.S. Global Change Research Program have been directed by
the Office of Management and Budget to transfer funds to one of the three
agencies cooperatively managing the Country Studies initiative to be used for
support of the initiative. This interagency agreement transfers $1,366,000 from
NSF to the Environmental Protection Agency as directed by OMB for this purpose.
