This research will address some key technical problems that will need to be
resolved before proceeding with the development of a comprehensive and flexible
set of Ada program quality enhancing tools, the Ada Quality Toolset (AQT). These
tools will support Ada system developers by checking, and where appropriate
enforcing, a set of Ada programming style guidelines. Specific toolsets will be
configured from a collection of general purpose tool components, customized to
the precise needs of a project or a developer's role within a project, and
applied by developers during system development. The specific technical problems
that will be resolved by this research include: o identification of guideline-
defined Ada program properties which can be checked automatically. o feasibility
of checking high-level semantic properties of Ada programs. o identification and
outline specification of the general purpose components which will be
instantiated and configured into specific toolsets. o definition of a software
architecture that supports component instantiation and configuration, and
toolset customization and application.
