The Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW) seeks to provide access to and
educational support of the INTERNET to hospitals and clinics throughout the
state of Wisconsin, Northern Illinois and the upper peninsula of Michigan. At
present, these non-academic, non- government agencies have only limited access
to some of the functions Internet provides (i.e., e-mail) through the commercial
sector. MCW is already an Internet node and seeks to enhance its outreach
mission by providing access to the Internet's services in order to improve state
and regional health professionals' access to information. The objectives of the
proposal are: * provide access to the Internet for rural and community hospitals
and clinics * educate users as to what the Internet is * instruct and support
users on how best to utilize Internet's services * serve as a demonstration
project for other regions
