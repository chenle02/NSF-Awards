Duplication and functional divergence of genes are critical steps in the
evolution of complex organisms. In D. melanogaster, one such gene family encodes
a-tubulin, a primary component of microtubules. Expression of this four member
a-tubulin family, which contains the most divergent tubulin yet identified, is
regulated in both time and space. A study of the four a-tubulins will provide
useful information on two fronts: as an example of how a multigene family has
been exploited, and how the individual a-tubulin proteins function in Drosophila
development and reproduction. Our overall objective is to determine how cells
regulate and employ of each of the four a-tubulin genes. This goal encompasses
an understanding of 1) the normal expression pattern of each gene, 2) the
cellular functions served by each a-tubulin protein under normal conditions, 3)
the functions each tubulin is capable of serving under aberrant conditions, and
4) the role each a-tubulin plays in the regulatory mechanisms(s) that controls
tubulin pools. The results of this work should give greater insight, not only in
the specific details of differential tubulin synthesis, but also into a more
general understanding of the regulation of expression of complex gene families.
