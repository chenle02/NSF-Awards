The grant investigates fundamental aspects of solidification, phase equilibria
and deformation mechanisms in order to establish a foundation for the design of
future high temperature magnesium systems. Phase equilibria and microsegregation
will be studied in two quaternary systems, Mg-Al-Ca-Sr and Mg-Al-Ca-Ce, followed
by high temperature deformation using conventional microscopy along with high-
resolution strain mapping techniques. The casting experiments will be made at
casting facilities at Ford Motor Company and Eck Industries Inc. Computational
thermodynamics and phase equilibria will be used to optimize the alloy
compositions. A major goal is to structure an efficient combination of
experiments and computation to accelerate alloy design in complex structural
alloy systems. The research is a collaborative program between the University of
Michigan, University of Wisconsin and the Ford Motor
Company.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The grant allows an effort to develop new high
temperature structural magnesium alloys for transportation industry
applications, where vehicle weight reduction is a critical element of achieving
greater performance and fuel efficiency. An important goal of the proposed
research will be to develop in the United States a more concentrated research
effort on high temperature cast magnesium alloys and to provide a nucleus of
research activity that will train students and postdoctoral fellows in the
fundamentals of magnesium alloy design. Beyond this, the program will also
develop an educational module on Mg for mechanical engineers and high school
teachers participating in a summer camp for high school science teachers hosted
by the University of Michigan and sponsored by ASM International, SAE and the
Minerals Metals and Materials Society.&lt;br/&gt;
