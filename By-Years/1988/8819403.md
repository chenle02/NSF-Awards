Stochastic general recognition theory is a precise mathematical formalization
of several ideas that have been popular in perceptual and cognitive psychology
for many years. One of these is that repeated exposure to any complex stimulus
does not always elicit the same perceptual state; a second is that the
perceptual system that analyzes such a stimulus is composed of several mutually
interacting channels that operate in parallel. The theory makes specific
numerical predictions about response probabilities and response times in a wide
variety of cognitive and perceptual experiments, such as identification and
categorization. In addition, it has the potential to account for the effects of
varying stimulus exposure duration, the masking of one stimulus with another,
and the effects of short interstimulus intervals. This research will include a
number of experiments whose results are predicted by the theory; thus, these
experiments will provide a rigorous test of the theory. One set of experiments
will investigate how the structure of a category affects categorization time;
another set will investigate how different types of interactions during the
perceptual processing of separate stimulus components affect categorization and
identification performance. These experiments will increase our understanding of
how humans identify and categorize complex patterns. This, in turn, may improve
our understanding of some reading and learning disabilities and may also lead to
more accurate pattern recognition by machine.
