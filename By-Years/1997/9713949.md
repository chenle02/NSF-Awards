A new technique to accurately measure interfacial energies between arbitrary
materials systems will be studied. The technique relies on a soft structure (a
bent elastica or a pressurized blister) for the measurements, instead of the
commonly used soft material. Solutions for a bent elastica brought into contact
with a rigid substrate will be modified to account for the perturbations which
result from weak interfacial attractions. Experimental large-scale prototypes
for the configurations well be constructed and tested to evaluate the techniques
and validate the mathematical models. Small prototypes will be compared with
values obtained from the Johnson-Kendall-Roberts (JKR) technique for some of the
more limited materials systems for which this technique is applicable.
