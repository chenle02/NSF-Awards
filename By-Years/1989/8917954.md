The research planned in this proposal is directed towards obtaining preliminary
data for a long-term project to study the expression of protein kinase C (PKC)
isozymes under conditions of cell proliferation and differentiation using the
friend murine erythroleukemia (F-MEL) cell line as a model system. Studies
involving the use of PKC cDNA probes to identify variations in total RNA
preparations from differentiating and proliferating (non-differentiating) F-MEL
cells are proposed to characterize the possible role of PKC in the processes of
differentiation and proliferation.
