One of the most critical problems in Internet security is &lt;br/&gt;the Denial-
of-Service (DoS) attack, which aims to make a &lt;br/&gt;service unavailable to
legitimate clients. In this project, &lt;br/&gt;we consider a sophisticated
attack, called service-level DoS &lt;br/&gt;attack, which is very difficult to
identify as malicious &lt;br/&gt;requests can be made arbitrarily similar to
legitimate ones &lt;br/&gt;and can bypass the network-based defense systems. We
propose &lt;br/&gt;a novel framework to detect the attackers based on the group
&lt;br/&gt;testing (GT) technique which can overcome the limitations of
&lt;br/&gt;current detection approaches. More specifically, this project
&lt;br/&gt;seeks to investigate the following challenges: 1) Dynamic
&lt;br/&gt;threshold model is studied to handle the legitimate bursts
&lt;br/&gt;and variance in the number of clients on each server; 2)
&lt;br/&gt;Legitimates and malicious requests are similar, required
&lt;br/&gt;new testing design without examining each request one by
&lt;br/&gt;one or tightly specifying legitimate behaviors; 3) In
&lt;br/&gt;addition, the study of the proposed model evokes a new
&lt;br/&gt;type of GT, called Size Constraint Group Testing (SCGT)
&lt;br/&gt;which requires an in depth analysis of matrix construction
&lt;br/&gt;complexity. This mathematically rigorous framework helps
&lt;br/&gt;to minimize the false positive and false negative of detection,
&lt;br/&gt;which is the main problem currently for any existing defense
&lt;br/&gt;mechanisms.
