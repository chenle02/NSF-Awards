An award is made to Brigham Young University to purchase a PacBio Sequel Single-
Molecule, Real-time (SMRT) Sequencer-the latest in single-molecule sequencing-to
benefit faculty, undergraduate, and graduate student research and education at
BYU and BYU-Hawaii, and to implement an outreach program designed to educate
underrepresented minorities in science through BYU's deep connection into
Polynesian cultures. BYU has one of the most vibrant undergraduate research
programs in the world, involving students directly in research early in their
education. BYU's undergraduate research program also includes concerted efforts
to involve students from underrepresented minorities. Additionally, the BYU
program has arranged an exciting collaboration with Pacific Heritage Academy in
Salt Lake City to perform sequencing studies on species endemic to their native
Hawaii. Having a PacBio Sequel System will make BYU a major SMRT sequencing and
educational hub for faculty, graduate, undergraduate, and high school students
in the intermountain west region of the United States&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With
new technologies such as the PacBio Sequel System, it is now possible to
accomplish what was previously unfeasible. This new technology dramatically
improves or enables researchers to: (1) construct more complete genomes, (2)
identify large genetic mutations, and (3) resolve unknown aspects of gene
expression, amongst many other exciting applications. Researchers across the
intermountain west will have easy access to this breakthrough technology to
advance genomic understanding from numerous non-model organisms, and to develop
needed computational algorithms.
