The PI studies mathematical problems motivated by quantum mechanics, wave
propagation, and chaotic dynamics, in particular, oscillations and decay of
waves. Just as a bell sounds a fading note, a wave or an unstable molecule
oscillates and decays at certain rates. These two rates (of oscillation and of
decay) are properties of the system and not of the way in which it is measured.
Understanding their behaviour can be useful both in construction and in
detection. For instance, in engineering, the ratio of the two rates is called
the quality factor and tells us the amount of energy loss per cycle. Knowing
this ratio for modes of specific systems is important in design of, for
instance, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). On a different scale, similar
modes appear in gravitational waves generated by colliding black holes and their
(hypothetical) detection could provide information about black holes. The PI
searches for unifying themes connecting the distribution of these modes and
geometries of various systems.

Many physical systems can be described using evolution of states. The following
correlations are observed: one measures the time evolution of one state against
another state. The time representation can be replaced by the frequency
representation (by taking a Fourier transform) which produces the power
spectrum. The poles of power spectrum appear in different settings and are
called scattering poles (obstacle scattering), quantum resonances (quantum
scattering theory), quasinormal modes (general relativity), Pollicott--Ruelle
resonances (chaos theory). These poles provide information about long time
behaviour: the real part corresponds to the rate of oscillations, and the
imaginary part to the rate of decay. The PI studies these poles in the different
settings mentioned above. One recurrent theme is the use of the
classical/quantum (wave) correspondence which suggests subtle interplay between
"classical" properties of the system and properties of waves. The PI
investigates this phenomenon in many settings, in particular when chaotic
behaviour is present on the classical level. Most recently methods that were
developed for the study of classical quantum correspondence (microlocal
analysis) became useful in the study of purely dynamical problems such as
meromorphic continuations of zeta functions and problems in X-ray tomography.
