Abstract 97-27058 Schladow Collaborative Research: Deep chlorophyll layers as
export production zones in lake ecosystems: The importance of hydrodynamics and
biological transport in the formation and maintenance of metalimnetic production
In clear lakes and seas, much of the microscopic plant biomass occurs deep in
the water column, in strata called deep-chlorophyll layers. Little is known
about the processes that form these layers, nor their importance for fueling
production of zooplankton and fish. Working in lakes of the Sawtooth Mountains
of Idaho, the investigators will use the stable isotope lsN and water mass
tracers to determine: (1) the sources of nutrients that support plant production
in the deep chlorophyll layers; (2) the relative importance of physical mixing
processes (e.g. wind, turbulence) and biological processes for moving nutrients
between strata, and; (3) how much of the plant production in the deep water is
transferred to the invertebrates and fish in different strata. This research
will thus further our understanding of linkages between physical, chemical, and
biological processes that govern production in aquatic food webs.
