This project will investigate several key problems in algebraic geometry and
related areas of mathematics. Algebraic geometry is the study of solutions to
polynomial equations; it has many applications in other areas of mathematics and
other sciences. The project will focus on algebraic transformations over
arbitrary fields, which has potential for practical application in computer
science. The research involves graduate students and postdoctoral researchers at
the University of Missouri.

This project is research in the areas of commutative algebra, algebraic
geometry, valuation theory, and singularity theory. The problems that are being
investigated are in four basic areas: Asymptotic multiplicities and Hilbert
polynomials of graded families of ideals in a local ring, understanding better
the cone of effective divisors modulo numerical equivalence (inradius, outradius
and volume), toroidalization of morphisms (after blowing up nonsingular
subvarieties make a morphism locally have a monomial like structure) and
ramification, the defect and local uniformization. This last part involves
better understanding ramification along a valuation in positive characteristic,
with a view towards resolution of singularities.
