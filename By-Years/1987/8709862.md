This study will involve a detailed analysis of Arab-American ethnicity in the
San Francisco Bay area. The student will look at ethnicity on an interpersonal
level by analyzing individuals and their actions in relation to issues of
nationality, religion, social class, and gender. Data will be obtained through
in-depth interviews, life histories, participant observation, and archival
research. By combining historical, interpretive, and action-oriented
perspectives with analytical narratives, this study will test the usefulness of
a new approach in ethnology. It will also provide new information for the
continuing debates over the dynamics of ethnicity. Besides filling significant
gaps in our knowledge of Arab- Americans, the least studied U.S. minority, this
research has the potential for influencing social policies toward ethnic
minorities in the United States. It is particularly relevant at a time when
stereotyping of Arab-Americans is on the rise.
