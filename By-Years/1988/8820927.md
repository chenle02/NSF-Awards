This proposal requests support from the National Science Foundation Biological
Instrumentation Program to purchase a liquid scintillation spectrometer. Seven
faculty and their research groups are designated in this proposal as major
users. The research projects of the major users include: investigation of (a)
the mechanism of visual transduction and adaptation, (b) the role of highly
unsaturated fatty acids in biological membrane structure and function; (c)
molecular basis of algal/bacterial interactions in biofilms, (d) the structure
of insect agglutinin and its role in immune-defense mechanisms, (e) the
characterization and biosynthesis of aggregation pheromones in Drosophila; (f)
construction and utilization of a restriction fragment length polymorphism based
linkage map of three barley genes, (g) development and evaluation of molecular
methods for the evaluation of genetic diversity in alfalfa and lentils; (h)
phytic acid pathways in plants and suppressor-mutator transposable elements in
maize; and (i) the metabolism of phytotoxins by plants pathogens of weedy
plants.
