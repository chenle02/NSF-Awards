The simplest yet non-trivial complex dynamical systems are algebraic: iteration
of noninvertible polynomials in one complex variable and, more generally,
rational self-maps of a complex algebraic variety. Certain analytic quantities
associated to these holomorphic systems have surprising connections to algebraic
constructions. Examples from this project that illustrate the rich algebraic
structures in a complex dynamical setting include: (1) the study of one-
dimensional polynomials by their associated trees and the connection with
valuations on the field of regular functions on the moduli space; (2) an
analysis of regular self-maps on toric varieties, the resultant of such
mappings, and connections with pluri-potential theory; (3) the structure of the
moduli spaces of regular self-maps (e.g. of projective spaces) and their
"dynamical" compactifications (describing how such systems degenerate) as
algebraic varieties.

One of the most familiar examples of such a dynamical system is Newton's method,
an iterative algorithm for finding roots of polynomials, first introduced in
calculus courses. Even for this famous and seemingly simple example, we have
only recently begun to understand its structure, and its failure in general,
using modern mathematical techniques. With Newton's method (its history, its
applications, and recent studies) as a guide, I will pursue a collection of
educational projects for students: (1) undergraduate research projects, with an
emphasis on computer exploration of examples; (2) the development of an
undergraduate course in dynamics, to present both the theory and recent
applications; (3) two workshops for graduate students; and (4) regular student
seminars. The research described above is designed to explore the interplay
between chaotic dynamical systems (such as Newton's method and its
generalizations) and any underlying algebraic structures. Such structures add an
extra element of symmetry or regularity to a system which might otherwise seem
intractable. The experts in these aspects of complex dynamical systems are
concentrated in France, England, Japan, and the US (with smaller groups in
Chile, Spain, Poland, and Germany, to name a few); with this project, the
Principal Investigator will bring together some of these experts to work with
students and clarify these connections between algebra and dynamics.
