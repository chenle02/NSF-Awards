This National Science Foundation award funds Student Travel Fellowships for US
students attending CIKM 2017, the 2017 ACM International Conference on
Information and Knowledge Management, which brings together researchers and
practitioners from the knowledge management, information retrieval, and database
communities. The Student Fellowships help cover the travel costs for US
students, enabling them to participate in CIKM and interact with other attendees
of the conference.

Through the publication, presentation, and discussion of applied and theoretical
research findings, CIKM attendees shape the future by identifying challenging
problems facing the creation of advanced knowledge and information systems, and
by providing insightful solution approaches for those problems. CIKM 2017 has
broad and interdisciplinary programs including workshops, tutorials, industry
speakers, keynote speakers, research papers and posters, demonstrations,
competitions, and other special events. Students will also benefit from
activities designed especially to appeal to them, including a Hackathon, an
Industry Networking Day; a resume circulation service; and three data analytics
competitions.
