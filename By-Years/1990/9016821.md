This award provides support for a continuing cooperative research project on
solid-state dynamics, between Professor David N Hendrickson, Department of
Chemistry, University of California, San Diego, and Professor Michio Sorai,
Chemical Thermodynamics Laboratory, Osaka University, Japan. The onset of
dynamics associated with ligands, counterions and even solvate molecules in
crystals can dramatically affect several phenomena involving transition metal
complexes in solid state. Intramolecular electron transfer in mixed- valence
complexes, spin-state interconversion in spin- crossover-complexes, and
thermochroism in copper and nickel complexes are current phenomena being
studied. In all these phenomena, intermolecular interactions in the solid state
are important in controlling the events. A study of the onset of the dynamics
involved in these phase transitions will help considerably to elucidate the
factors controlling these phenomena. Heat capacity measurements and a variety of
spectroscopic techniques are being employed to delineate the macroscopic and
microscopic details involved in the above phenomena. Thermodynamic studies serve
as a powerful tool to elucidate energetic and entropic aspects of a phenomenon,
from which one can gain better evidence as to whether a phase transition exists
or not. Moreover based on the transition entropy, it is possible to discover the
microscopic processes involved in a phase transition that spectroscopic and
structural studies fail to detect. On the other hand, spectroscopies and X-ray
diffraction provide us with very detailed microscopic information at the atomic
or electronic level. The aim of this proposal is to bring together these
techniques in order to study the mechanisms of those phase transitions in which
electrons play, either directly or indirectly, important roles. The skills of
the two research groups involved in this project are both comprehensive and
complementary; the Japanese group having considerable expertise in macroscopic
calorimetric studies and the US group having similar expertise in microscopic
spectroscopies and structural studies. Because of their very different
backgrounds Professors Hendrickson and Sorai will bring quite different
perspectives to developing a model for a given order-disorder transition. If
successful, this project should make a considerable contribution to this complex
area.
