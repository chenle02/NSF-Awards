This doctoral dissertation improvement project will use high-resolution remotely
sensed data from aircraft to map plant species distributions and vegetation
structure in the mediterranean-type ecosystem of Santa Cruz Island, California.
The project will test the hypothesis that heterogeneity in plant occurrences is
explained by both environmental variables and the dispersal abilities of the
plants and that the relative importance of environment vs. dispersal will be
related to the spatial scale at which the plant communities are
examined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will contribute to the further
development of techniques to assess fine-scale detail of plant communities from
remotely-sensed data. It will also contribute to our understanding of processes
determining plant species distributions, which is important for developing
effective restoration and conservation projects.
