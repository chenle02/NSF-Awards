Among the more serious problems in transport of wastewaters is the rapid
corrosion of concrete interceptors in large collection systems. The progress of
such corrosion is driven by the evolution of hydrogen sulfide gas followed by
its reoxidation in the aerobic crown with accompanying acid production. Both
steps are microbially catalyzed. Consequently, the process may be interrupted by
appropriate engineering measures designed to suppress the activity of sulfate
reducers or acidophilic autotrophs in the conduit's crown. Such measures will be
explored within the proposed project. Candidate actions, including chemical
control in the liquid phase and pH control in the crown can be economically
investigated in a bench-scale laboratory program.
