Routine, time-consuming, and repetitive information processing tasks performed
by employees in organizations can be potentially automated. Possible benefits
from automation include relieving employees to concentrate on relatively
fruitful and productive jobs, and in improving the quality of work by
eliminating human errors that are inadvertently introduced due to the tedious
nature of work. A candidate task for automation is that of scheduling meetings
between individuals. Though past efforts have produced necessary techniques for
building distributed agents that can schedule meetings on behalf of associated
users, much work remains to be done in encoding user goals and constraints
before a useful system can be implemented. The proposed research will produce an
efficient implemented system that effectively schedules meetings without
compromising user preferences and constraints. This will fill a void in the
currently available calendar management software. This research will involve
developing a language and inference procedure to specify and reason about user
preferences, building models of agents from limited information, and developing
negotiation mechanisms to coordinate partially cooperative agents. A unique
contribution of this research lies in developing intelligent agents that are
adaptive to the environmental demands and the needs of associated users at the
same time. These techniques will be a significant contribution to the evolving
field of Distributed Artificial Intelligence, and can be gainfully applied in
fields like Cooperative Information Systems and Computer Supported Cooperative
Work.
