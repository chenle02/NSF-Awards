The El Verde Field Station, Puerto Rico, is a long-established research
facility in the only Neotropical rain forest under the jurisdiction of the
United States. The field station is located in the Caribbean National Forest,
which is an Experimental Forest, a Biosphere Reserve, a participating component
of the University of Puerto Rico Minority Research Center of Excellence, and the
site of the Luquillo Long-Term Ecological Research Program. For over 30 years,
the field station and adjoining research area have been the focus of projects by
scientists from more than 50 institutions in the United States and other
countries. Current research projects are funded by the National Science
Foundation, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the USDA
Forest Service. Research and living facilities at the El Verde Field Station
date to the 1930s and their current size restricts ongoing research activities.
Living space for researchers consists of four dormitory rooms with 28 beds with
little space available for personal effects. A single self-service kitchen
serves all visitors. Communication from the field station is limited to a radio
connection with San Juan, a cellular phone, and a telephone line located three
kilometers from the field station. There is no capability for data transfer or
Internet connection. previous NSF grant supported development of,a master plan
for improvements to El Verde Field Station. This project will enact the first of
four phases describe in the El Verde Field Station Master Plan. The project will
provide the construction visitor's cabin and provide a modern voice and
electronic communications system. Matching funds provided by the University of
Puerto Rico will be used to construct additional kitchen and dining facilities
for visitors and improve the physical plant of the station.
