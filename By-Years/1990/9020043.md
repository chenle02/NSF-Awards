The Gas Chromatograph and Mass Spectrometer (GC/MS) system separates mixtures of
volatile compounds and identifies the molecular mass of each separated
component. The GC/MS is essential when there is a need to quantify soluble
compounds found in dilute solutions. The GC/MS is useful in areas such as
chemical synthesis, kinetics and structural analysis. This award from the
Chemistry Instrumentation Program to the Department of Chemistry at Harvard
University will help acquire two GC/MS systems. The acquisition will enhance the
ability of the department to educate students and will enhance chemical research
in the following areas: 1. Synthetic Organic, Bioorganic and Natural Product
Chemistry 2. Studies in Biochemistry: Sugars, Receptors and Surfaces 5. Studies
