The objectives of this research are (1) to complete studies of the reaction
chemistry of complex biopolymer model compounds (such as glucose and sucrose) in
supercritical water and other supercritical solvents, (2) to extend the studies
of homolysis in supercritical fluids to temperatures greater than 500o C. The
flow reactor has been designed to function as an ideal plug flow reactor; thus
studies of the influence of residence time, temperature, pressure, solvent
media, and catalysts on the reaction products can serve as a source for both
kinetic data and mechanistic understanding of the reaction chemistry.
