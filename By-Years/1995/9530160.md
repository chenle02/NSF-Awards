9530160 Ryan Ships from numerous agencies, oceanographic institutions, and
nations are mapping the ocean floor with sophisticated sonar. These maps can be
combined with other data such as rock type, animal type, and hydrothermal vent
locations to created new maps that are extremely useful to scientists, teachers,
and the business community. This approach has been successful and offers even
more potential applications and broader distribution via the Internet. The
principal investigators intend to maintain the current database and to add
multibeam bathymetric data and gridded gravity data in order to expand the
usefulness and completeness of the database.
