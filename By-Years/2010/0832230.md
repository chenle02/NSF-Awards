Community input is necessary in the planning of National Science Foundation
initiatives to ensure alignment of program mechanisms with community capacity
and needs. This award supports a workshop, attended by representatives from the
mathematical and physical sciences community, to advise the NSF Directorate of
Mathematical and Physical Sciences on construction of a program to enhance
proactive recruitment of undergraduate students in science and mathematics. Such
a program addresses the NSF strategic goal to "Cultivate a world-class, broadly
inclusive science and engineering workforce, and expand the scientific literacy
of all citizens."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The concept of an NSF program to support
proactive recruitment in the lower division is inspired by the United States
(Executive Branch) American Competitiveness Initiative and (Congressional)
America Competes Act, both of which include as a goal strengthening the Nation's
scientific workforce. Successes in this area catalyzed by the proposed workshop
will strengthen US worldwide economic competitiveness through greater
recruitment of US students to science and mathematics.
