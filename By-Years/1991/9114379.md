The 19th Rare Earth Research Conference (RERC) will be held in Lexington,
Kentucky, July 14-19, 1991. This project will provide partial support for (1)
domestic travel expenses for invited foreign speakers and a few foreign Session
Chairs/Plenary Lecturers with special financial need (priority for support will
be given to invited speakers from Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union, India, and
other third world countries), and (2) stipends for travel support of U.S.
citizens who are graduate students or junior investigators in the general area
of rare earth and actinide research, and who have financial difficulties in
attending the Conference. The RERCs are international forums normally held in
the U.S. to promote exchange of information in general areas of pure and applied
research and various applied technologies involving rare earth and actinide
elements. Broad-scale participation from universities, industrial concerns, and
national laboratories is purposefully sought, encouraging cross-disciplinary
exchanges and technology transfer.
