9320468 Slocum A novel high-performance laser-pumped helium free precession
(LHFP) magnetometer is proposed for use for geomagnetic field measurements and
magnetic geophysical exploration. In Phase I we defined a concept for a portable
laser-pumped helium 3 magnetometer which has small size, high sensitivity and
low power consumption. A miniature tunable near-infrared laser pump source
developed by Polatomic for NASA was used to demonstrate laser pumping of helium
3. The laser pumping light will be carried by optical fiber link between the
sensor and the laser/electronics package. During Phase I we demonstrated the
feasibility of the laser-pumped helium 3 magnetometer and identified the laser
pump source suitable for pumping helium 3. The concept will be validated in
Phase II with the design, fabrication and testing of a laser-pumped helium 3
magnetometer. In Phase II two sensors will be built in order to evaluate a
laser-pumped helium 3 gradiometer. The LHFP magnetometer provides continuous
read-out and has sensitivity improved by more than an order of magnitude over
the proton free precession (PFP) magnetometer. The laser pumped helium free
precession magnetometer for geomagnetic observatories and surveys would replace
the PFP magnetometer as the world standard.
