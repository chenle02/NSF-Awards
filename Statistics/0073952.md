Though inherently a statistical issue, model evaluation lacks a unifying
statistical framework; this project supplies such. The foundation of the
framework is the use of Bayesian techniques to quantify the degree to which a
model captures an underlying reality; develop theory and methods that allow dual
use of data in both estimation of model inputs and evaluation of outputs; select
evaluation functions, by which a model and reality are compared and through
which flaws (causes of "invalidity") are found; and to design the collection of
field and computer simulation data. The building of the framework relies on
specific formulations of problems, motivated by testbed examples such as
subsurface fluid flow models - where the computer model is deterministic but
uncertainties are present in the model inputs and specifications - and traffic
simulators - where the model is intrinsically stochastic, in addition to having
uncertain inputs. Computer models are everywhere and evaluating their fidelity
to reality is central to assessing their effectiveness in understanding real
phenomena (such as flow of pollutants through soil and into groundwater) and
predicting results of innovative technologies (such as new signal timing
strategies to relieve traffic congestion in urban networks). This project
develops a statistical structure and basis for such evaluations applicable
across the scientific and technological landscape. In the process, the project
creates the ingredients for a virtual laboratory to disseminate results, broaden
involvement of other researchers (and users), and establish a unique educational
and training environment.
