Programming is a rigorous and intellectually demanding activity. Programmers are
expected to provide instructions to a black box device, whose behavior is very
different from their own, to accomplish complex tasks. Even seasoned
professionals can find this challenging, and beginners often struggle to do it.
These problems are greatly amplified when a program has errors or produces
incorrect output. A major obstacle is for the programmer to understand how the
computer works at a level that is useful for expressing their needs and
correcting their programs. The intellectual merits are to evaluate existing
models of programming systems, and to define new ones that enable programmers to
better understand the computer's execution. The project's broader significance
and importance are to make effective programming more accessible to a much
broader range of people, including those who intend to apply computing in other
data-intensive domains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Concretely, the research examines
the use of programming language semantics as explanatory tools for non-technical
users. Existing semantics provide rich explanations of behavior, but are
expressed in highly technical terms that require significant expertise to
understand and use. Furthermore, they have not been tested through application
to actual debugging tasks. Therefore, this work intends to open up investigation
into the human factors aspects of programming language semantics, understanding
how well they perform in different settings, and potentially defining new
semantics forms that are better suited to a broad range of programmers. The work
will specifically focus on functional programming with an eye towards its role
in data science curricula, which are of value across a broad spectrum of
disciplines.
