This award supports a program detailed of laboratory studies of subglacial
materials obtained from immediately below the base of Ice Stream B in West
Antarctica. The four piston cores to be examined range in length from 2 to 3
meters. These core will be analyzed for their sedimentological characteristics
and their physical and mechanical properties. These studies will help to test
the initial conclusion that the material composing these cores is glacial till
that has been transported in a subglacial shear zone whose deformation
lubricates the base of the ice stream, making possible the rapid motion
characteristic of the ice streams.
