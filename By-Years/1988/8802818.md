Links are natural geometric objects generalizing knots. Habegger will pursue
the goal of classification of links up to concordance, based on his work with X.
S. Lin on classification of links up to homotopy. He also intends to relate his
work with Lin to the Jones polynomial invariant of links, and to various link-
related problems in low-dimensional topology. Habegger may also implement the
link classification algorithm on a computer.
