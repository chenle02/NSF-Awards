This project supports a cultural anthropologist from San Jose State University
analyzing data collected in India on pre-college students' attitudes towards
women in science fields. The project will test theories of the
underrepresentation of women in science fields against this data from over 5,000
questionnaires administered to 1,600 students in 6th, 9th and 11th grade
classrooms. Theories to be tested relate to the hypothesis of self-selection
(that females avoid science due to their felt inadequacies in math), structural
barriers (that females face a social definition of science as `male`), and
cultural models (that the definitions of appropriate life-style and gender
behavior create a `patrifocal family model` and a peer group dynamic that
prevents women from choosing these fields.) This research is important because
gender disparities in professional fields limit the benefits society can expect
from these fields as well as limiting the accomplishments individuals can expect
from their choice of occupations. Advances in our understanding of why women
avoid science fields -- and which parts of the avoidance are determined by
specific cultural features -- will help policy makers develop incentives to
level the playing field.
