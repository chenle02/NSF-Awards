Many practical problems require for their solution the sampling of a random
object from a combinatorial class or, worse, an exhaustive search through all
objects in the class. In order for such a search to be possible, even for
problems of moderate size, combinatorial generation methods must be extremely
efficient. As an example, the Gray code approach to combinatorial generation is
to generate the objects as a list in which successive elements differ only in a
small way, as in the binary reflected Gray code. Each combinatorial Gray code
problem has an alternate formulation as a Hamilton path or cycle problem in an
associated graph, which may be vertex transitive or even a Cayley graph.
Asymptotic improvement in the efficiency of combinatorial generation requires
not only good data structures and algorithm design techniques, but, more often,
some new insight into the structure of the combinatorial class involved. These
structure questions put us into the realm of well-known open problems on
Hamilton cycles, graph isomorphism, Cayley graphs, and symmetric chain
decompositions in lattices. Progress on the enumeration problems is made by
studying the structure problems hand in hand. The research proposed herein is to
continue work on combinatorial generation and Gray codes and also to address
directly some of the outstanding problems in related areas. These include the
Hamilton cycle problem on vertex transitive graphs and Cayley graphs, new
problems on de Bruijn - like sequences, and the existence of symmetric chain
decompositions and complete matchings in certain partially ordered sets
involving permutations and integer partitions.
