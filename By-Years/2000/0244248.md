Workers are more likely to find that social sexual misconduct constitutes sexual
harassment when the law encourages them to take the perspective of the
complainant, (i.e., apply the reasonable woman as opposed to the reasonable
person standard). To explain these findings, we developed a two-stage processing
model in which workers reach a preliminary harassment judgment based upon well-
rehearsed and easily retrievable attitude structures, such as hostile and
benevolent sexism. In two studies full-time workers will view videotapes
depicting action sequences in two influential sexual harassment cases. The first
study manipulates legal standard (reasonable person vs. reasonable woman) and
the complainant's initial behavior. Study 2 uses a similar paradigm but imposes
the reasonable person standard on all participants. However, half the
participants will expect a scrutinizing interview following the videotapes. We
predict that those who do not expect an interview will react to their own
hostile and/or benevolent sexist attitudes triggered by the complainant's
conduct. However, those who anticipate an interview in which they must explain
their judgments will correct their initial biases and examine the action
sequence from an impartial point of view. A successful test of these hypotheses
would suggest that in reasonable woman jurisdictions, organizations can
sensitize workers by training them on the subtleties of the law, that is the
difference between the reasonable woman and person's perspectives. In reasonable
person jurisdictions, organizations could routinely interview all workers
involved in or reporting suspicious conduct.
