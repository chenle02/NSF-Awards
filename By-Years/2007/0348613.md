In this work new experimental techniques are being developed to investigate
electric-to-thermal energy conversion at nanojunctions and the effective thermal
transport properties across current-carrying devices with nanosize interfaces,
such as superlattice nanowires and nanowire-thin film junctions. Strategies to
engineer the transport properties of nanostructured materials and/or
nanojunctions using stress, strain, and temperature annealing are sought. The
findings will be used to design and fabricate efficient thermoelectric energy-
conversion devices, high thermal-conductivity carbon-nanotube composites, and
nanojunctions with low electrical contact resistance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A
multidisciplinary approach is leading to an understanding of key aspects of
transport in nanomaterials and nanodevices with potential breakthroughs in
designing efficient thermoelectric power generators and reliable carbon-
nanotube-based nanoelectronics. The specific research activity is integrated
with a comprehensive program of education and outreach designed to target
participants over a wide range of age groups and scientific expertise.
