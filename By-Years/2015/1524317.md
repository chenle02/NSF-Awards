Recent growth in mobile and media-rich applications has greatly increased the
demand for wireless capacity, straining wireless networks. This dramatic
increase in demand poses a challenge for current wireless networks, and calls
for new algorithms that make better use of scarce wireless resources. Recently
developed algorithms for optimally managing wireless resources hold the promise
of significant performance improvement, but require all of the nodes in the
network to be upgraded with new functionality which is both costly and
impractical. This project introduces a novel architectural paradigm for wireless
networks, whereby optimal algorithms are designed to operate in networks with
both new and legacy nodes. This new paradigm allows optimal algorithms to be
incrementally deployed alongside existing schemes, thus providing a migration
path for new control algorithms, and the promise of dramatic improvement in
network performance at incremental cost. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
develops a novel overlay architecture for implementing optimal network control
algorithms over legacy networks. New nodes, capable of implementing
sophisticated network control algorithms, will be connected in a virtual network
overlay that operates on top of the legacy network. The research will answer
fundamental questions about which nodes must be upgraded with new functionality
and the tradeoff between the number of new upgraded nodes and network
performance. The project will develop new routing algorithms that send packets
from their sources to their destinations in the overlay network, and
transmission scheduling algorithms for mitigating the effect of wireless
interference. These new algorithms will be designed to operate efficiently in a
network with a mix of new and legacy nodes, by taking interoperability into
account. Thus, this project will answer fundamental questions about the
introduction of new control techniques into legacy networks, and provide a
promising approach to bridging the gap between new techniques developed for
universal deployment and the reality of the networks in operation today.
