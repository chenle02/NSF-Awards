The proposal is to support the attendance and participation of graduate students
in the Fifth International Conference on Boiling Heat Transfer in May of 2003.
This is a well-established conference that involves the most productive
researchers presenting the most advanced work in the field of boiling. The topic
continues to be crucially important in the thermal transport arena, especially
in the areas of microscale phenomena. The proposed participation of 14 students
wll be restricted to currently enrolled graduate students attending universities
in the United States who are co-authors of a paper being presented at the
conference. The requested support will help to promote the goals of the
conference through NSF participation. It will also foster the professional
development of the next generation of boiling and two-phase flow researchers in
the thermal transport community.
