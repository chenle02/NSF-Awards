This research will lie in the area of mathematical statistics and will concern
bootstrap methodology. The bootstrap methodology was introduced by Efron in 1979
and is being increasingly used in statistical inference in a wide variety of
situations. The method is simple, generally applicable both in parametric and
nonparametric problems, and has great potential to be an important tool in
extracting information from data. This research is aimed at examining the
existing techniques and working out modified or alternative techniques which
lead to more efficient results. The bootstrap method is highly computational and
this grant supports computer equipment to continue work in this area of
statistics. In addition to this equipment support, the principal investigator is
supported by the Army Research Office and the Air Force Office of Scientific
Research.
