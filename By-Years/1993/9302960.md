Funds are provided for a joint US, Canada, Russia cruise to the Sea of Okhotsk.
The largely inland Sea is believed to be an important source of North Pacific
Intermediate Water. Suitable suite cores and water profile samples will be
collected to test the hypothesis of ocean circulation and climate change beyond
the last glacial maximum. The cruise will be undertaken on the Russian vessel
R?V Lavrentiev with contributions from US and Canadian PI's.
