The stability of the share of total income paid out as compensation to labor, or
the labor share, has been a fundamental feature of macroeconomic models. This
assumption carries with it a broad range of important implications for
macroeconomic dynamics, growth, and income inequality. Recently, however, a
significant decline has been documented in the labor share over the past 30
years in the United States and in most countries in the world. The declining
labor share has been among the most important policy topics over the past
several years, attracting calls for changes in government policies. The project
aims to develop tools to better understand the causes and implications of the
labor share decline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Empirically, this research project
aims to create novel state-industry and firm datasets of labor shares that would
offer rich variation useful for identifying the cause of the labor share
decline. It has been demonstrated that labor share declines were greatest in
countries and industries experiencing the largest declines in the relative price
of investment goods. This suggests the importance for this trend of
technological progress in capital producing sectors in an environment with
highly substitutable capital and labor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These additional
new datasets will help corroborate the extent to which cost of capital declines
caused the decline of the U.S. labor share and to differentiate between this and
alternative explanations, such as changes in monopoly power or industry
composition or the influence of international trade. Differentiating among these
alternatives will directly inform what types of policies, if any, may be
warranted in response to the declining labor
share.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Theoretically, this research project builds a
framework that allows one to think about the repercussions of the labor share
decline for income inequality. This research team is developing a model that
incorporates a CES production structure with capital-skill complementarity into
an incomplete markets model with heterogeneous agents, allowing one to
understand the joint dynamics of the distribution of income across factor shares
and the distribution of income across households. While various countries have
generally witnessed declining labor shares and increasing income inequality
during recent decades, the relationship between these trends can be quite
complicated in an environment with realistic features such as endogenous savings
decisions, endogenous labor supply, capital-skill complementarity, and life-
cycle dynamics.
