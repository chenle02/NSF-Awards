9623612 Tong The research project will utilize light scattering and laser
Doppler velocimetry techniques to study statistical properties of, and
correlations among the velocity, temperature, and vorticity fields of turbulent
thermal convection in water. The experiments will investigate (1) the spatial
structure of the coherent motions and the correlations between the velocity and
temperature fluctuations in turbulent convection, and (2) new scaling laws of
velocity and vorticity statistics over varying Rayleigh numbers and length
scales in the turbulent core region and near the boundary layers. The project
will provide a body of reliable data to test current theories for turbulent
convection and to understand key features in the turbulent heat transport and in
the atmospheric convection. %%% The research project will utilize light
scattering and laser Doppler velocimetry techniques (similar to automobile laser
radar) to study statistical properties of turbulent motion in thermal
convection. The proposed experiments are of fundamental interest for
understanding the nature of convective turbulence, and they are also relevant to
many practical applications in engineering, geography, and meteorology. The
project will provide a body of reliable data to understand key features in the
turbulent heat transport and in the atmospheric convection. Understanding the
heat transport phenomena under different boundary conditions will shed new light
on technological improvements for more efficient heat transfer in various
industrial applications ranging from heat exchangers in a nuclear reactor to a
reentry vehicle. The development of novel laser light scattering techniques will
have additional applications in the discipline of fluid mechanics. ***
