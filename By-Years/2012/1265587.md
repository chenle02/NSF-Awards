The investigator will focus on two projects. First, a program to extend the
current description of the subgroup structure of the finite simple groups, and
to use that information to establish a negative answer to an important question
in universal algebra, open for over thirty years: Is each finite lattice an
interval in the lattice of subgroups of a finite group? Second, a program to
classify the simple saturated 2-fusion systems of component type. One
consequence of the second project should be a simplification of the proof of the
theorem classifying the finite simple groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
classification of the finite simple groups is one of the premiere achievements
of modern mathematics, providing the algebraic foundation for the study of the
symmetry of finite objects. Unfortunately the proof is very long and
complicated, consisting of as many as ten thousand pages, spread amongst
hundreds of articles. There are at least two books, aimed at a lay audience,
describing the human aspects of the effort. An emerging area of mathematics,
studying objects called fusion systems, offers hope of simplifying the proof of
the classification using an innovative approach.
