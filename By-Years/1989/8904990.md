Most volcanic eruptions are preceded by measurable geophysical and geochemical
changes although, even with such data, successful forecasts are rare. A new way
of approaching the prediction problem is to draw a mathematical analogy between
the terminal stages of material failure and the precursory behavior of a volcano
as it builds towards an eruption. In this work, eruptions are described in terms
of a fundamental law that governs failure; and from this law specific equations
and rate-time plots can be derived which will be used to predict rock failure
and the attendant eruption. The result is that "eruption windows" may be
recognized earlier than by other methods, and with enhanced precision. This
approach can be applied to landslides, earthquakes, dam breaks and other hazards
related to material failures.
