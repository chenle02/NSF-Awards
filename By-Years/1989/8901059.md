A variety of problems in finite dimensional linear algebra are to be
investigated. These include the properties of the exponent, the invariant
factors of a product of integral matrices, the eigenvalues of a sum of Hermitian
matrices, the matrix valued norm inequality comparing a matrix valued norm of a
product to the matrix norm of its factors, and a conjecture that geometry
underlies many spectral inequalities for matrices. This project is concerned
with research in matrix theory. A matrix is a rectangular array whose entries
can come from a wide variety of rings including the integers, the complex
numbers and the real numbers. Matrices are valuable in many branches of
mathematics, as well as, physics, chemistry and engineering.
