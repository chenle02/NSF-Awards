Understanding the set of integer solutions to a system of polynomial equations
is one of the oldest and most basic problems in mathematics. The subject is also
closely related to topics in computer science. Fundamental questions include
determining whether or not the set of integral solutions is finite, and if so
how to explicitly compute the set of such solutions. The introduction of
powerful geometric ideas and concepts into the subject has led to major advances
and a wide-ranging and deeper understanding of the basic problems. From this
geometric viewpoint, this research project aims to enhance our understanding of
these difficult and fundamental problems by substantially extending the known
results, techniques, and tools. In addition to research activities, the PI will
organize and initiate student-faculty research projects for a select group of
undergraduate students at Michigan State University. The research projects will
be enhanced by an undergraduate colloquium series and funded conference travel
for the undergraduate students. The PI will continue his close involvement with
graduate education and mentor graduate students and postdocs, suggesting
problems related to the proposed research strands.

The PI will study several interrelated problems revolving around the study of
integral points on varieties. First, the PI will examine the problem of
generalizing Siegel's theorem for integral points on curves to higher-
dimensional varieties, along the lines of the PI's conjectures. In a second
project, the PI will study integral points of bounded degree on curves. Then, in
a different direction, aspects of the problem of effectively computing integral
points on varieties will be studied, both for curves and higher-dimensional
varieties. Fundamental tools for studying integral (or rational) points on
varieties come from the subject of Diophantine approximation. One such key tool
is Schmidt's Subspace Theorem. The PI will continue his recent work on proving
generalizations of Schmidt's theorem, with a Schmidt-Wirsing type conjecture for
algebraic points as an ultimate goal. The PI will study several "uniform
boundedness" conjectures in arithmetic dynamics, a subject well-suited for
applications of the above techniques and results. Lastly, by work of Vojta and
others, there exists a surprising correspondence between statements and theorems
in Diophantine approximation and statements and theorems in Nevanlinna theory.
The PI plans to study the analogues of the above problems in Nevanlinna theory,
with the hope of enriching both subjects.
