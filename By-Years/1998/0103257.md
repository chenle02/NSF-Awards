Champaign&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
research is aimed at developing effective methodology for the study of nanoscale
mechanical behavior of materials. In particular, combined atomistic simulations
and continuum models will be developed to investigate the energetics of
dislocation nucleation and motion and their respective roles in nanoscale
discrete plastic deformation. The nanoindentation technique will be used to
probe the mechanical behavior of materials at the nanoscale as well as to
validate the developed methodology. The emphasis will be to link atomistic
simulations and continuum approaches to develop a mechanism-based model that is
able to predict mechanical behavior of crystalline materials at length scales
ranging from nanometers to submicrons. Collaborations with national laboratory
and industry partners will focus on practical applications of the developed
models.&lt;br/&gt;
