9412636 Bass It has been projected that mass-produced electric vehicles will
penetrate the U.S. market in substantial numbers by the end of this decade. Much
of the required infrastructure needed to support this new technology remains to
be developed. The proposed collaboration is jointly sponsored by Georgia Power
Company and Electricite de France. Both of these utilities have established
major research programs in EV infrastructure development. The 6 month internship
will occur at the EDF Research Facility in Paris, where Dr. Bass will be exposed
to a broad spectrum of research activities. More specifically, he will focus on
charging and power quality issues. ***
