Lewis 9630611 Reproductive behavior is mediated by a hormone called
gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) which is produced by cells in the brain.
This hormone is secreted by neurons and binds to a specific protein, called a
receptor, on GnRH target cells. However, little is known about how the binding
of this hormone to its receptor influences other nerve cells and subsequently
controls reproductive behavior. Dr. Lewis is investigating the mechanisms by
which GnRH binding to its receptor changes the excitability of neurons. She is
using a unique and powerful system to express the GnRH receptor in nerve cells
that do not normally contain the receptor. Her studies center on the coupling of
the receptor to intracellular second messenger systems, which lead to changes in
permeability to various electrically charged molecules. These investigations
will generate valuable insights into the coupling of intracellular messengers
with receptor activation, and provide an improved understanding of the basic
principles underlying reproduction in all species.
