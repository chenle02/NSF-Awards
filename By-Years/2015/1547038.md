On April 25, 2015, a devastating M=7.8 earthquake occurred approximately 80 km
to the northwest of the Nepalese capital of Kathmandu. At the location of this
earthquake the India plate is converging with Eurasia driving the uplift of the
Himalayan mountain range. This RAPID award will enable the expansion and
updating of a planned television documentary (The Himalaya Connection) about
earth science research in Nepal, Bangladesh, India, and Mongolia from a half-
hour to a one-hour show, in order to incorporate the Nepal earthquake and the
lessons learned for making the region safer from natural
hazards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The earthquake?s occurrence provides a rare
educational opportunity to increase the impact of new scientific information
about earth processes while the disaster remains fresh in the global public
consciousness. Using footage of scientists doing field research and related
landscape, cultural scenes, and interviews filmed over the past several years
under several NSF-funded projects, the producers will build on the opening
created by the earthquake and its aftermath to incorporate lessons learned from
this event into a deeper understanding of the forces at work and their wider
impact on the region, and the scientific research behind this knowledge. Because
The Himalaya Connection was already in post production, the film can be revised
and completed fairly quickly and distributed soon enough to take advantage of
the recent information about Nepal that has been so widespread in the global
media. The documentary?s primary audience is television viewers watching PBS in
North America; the film will also be distributed for international broadcast.
The filmmakers are Doug Prose and Diane LaMacchia of Earth Images Foundation,
award-winning producers of earth science television documentaries. Activities
under this RAPID project will involve post-production, mastering, and
distribution of the documentary.
