Trevecca Nazarene is one of five small Nashville institutions which Vanderbilt
University is assisting in connecting to NSFNET. The 56,000 bit per second
connection is made through the mid-level network SURANET using the SURANET
connection Vanderbilt has had for two years. Two of the institutions are
historically black, two are small liberal arts institutions that emphasize
teaching rather than research, and one is a two-year technological school.
Travecca Nazarene is one of the small liberal arts colleges. Benefits of the
NSFNET connection include file transfers, electronic mail communication between
local and remote researchers, and remote login to and use of supercomputers and
other research facilities. In addition, the local institutions have access to
Vanderbilt's resources, and add another dimension to the diversity of resources
Vanderbilt can offer its students. Cross- registration, software sharing and
other benefits also result from the network.
