The objectives will establish whether or not conventional designs are vulnerable
to progressive collapse, to give the following goals: (1) study the significance
and sensitivity of some of the many design parameters on the structural
integrity of double layer grid space trusses; (2) investigate the sensitivity to
the analysis method of the conclusions from the analyses; and (3) establish
whether this form of construction can be "deemed to satisfy" structural
integrity requirements.
