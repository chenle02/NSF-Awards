Image understanding, how the visual system determines what and where objects
are just by looking, is one of science's greatest mysteries. Despite its seeming
effortlessness, it is a problem because the image input to the eye is locally
ambiguous, i.e., in any patch of a natural image, there is rarely an unequivocal
cue to shape, surface material, or lighting. Somehow, the visual system makes
its best bet as to what is out there from the noisy pattern of intensities that
make up the image, and this visual perception in a complex natural environment
is rarely wrong. The mystery is exactly how the human visual system solves the
problem of ambiguity by exploiting the regularity or statistical structure in
the eye's image and its visual world. This research will model regularities in
images and object properties and measure how well human observers make use of
their implicit statistical knowledge of these regularities. Whenever the
statistical information available for a visual task can be made explicit and
quantified, it is possible to model an "ideal" observer, one that makes optimal
use of this information. A direct comparison of human and ideal performance
provides a measure of statistical efficiency for a visual task. This research
will study efficiency in four problems of image understanding: 1) Nearby points
in natural images often have similar intensities, that is, brightnesses are
correlated. This research will measure the efficiency with which human vision is
tuned to the intensity correlations in natural images and relate this to known
image encoding processes in visual cortex. 2) Many objects have some form of
symmetry in 3D, but this symmetry gets distorted when the image is formed in 2D.
In principle, symmetry can be used to see how objects are slanted in space and
to infer object parts that are occluded. This research will show what forms of
symmetry are detected most efficiently and how they may be used. 3) Nearby
objects often cast shadows on each other. Experiments will show whether depth
from cast shadow information is used by human vision to infer shape and how it
interacts with other cues to depth, such as motion. 4) Object recognition is
formally difficult because of uncertain illumination and viewpoint. The research
will measure efficiency for the classification of 3D objects from 2D images.
Understanding vision has become a key problem in brain and cognitive science.
The problem of image understanding is not only important to our understanding of
how we acquire knowledge of the world, but it is formally hard, resisting the
best efforts of computer scientists to produce a machine that can recognize
objects in natural images. Progress in this quest can inform research into brain
mechanisms as well as computer vision.
