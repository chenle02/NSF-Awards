Abstract

Award: DMS 1207654, Principal Investigator: John W. Lott

The principal investigator will work on three projects in differential geometry
and analysis on manifolds. These involve both linear and nonlinear aspects of
geometric analysis. The first project is the long-time behavior of the Ricci
flow in three and four dimensions. In three dimensions, the main open problems
are the finiteness of the number of surgeries, the decay of the sectional
curvature and the long-time asymptotics of the geometry. In four dimensions, the
goal is to use Ricci flow to identify canonical geometries. The second project
concerns optimal transport. We will work on a construction of parallel transport
on the space of probability measures, equipped with the Wasserstein metric. We
will also work on isoperimetric inequalities and sharp Sobolev inequalities for
metric-measure spaces with positive Ricci curvature. The third project will
develop an index theorem for transverse Dirac-type operators on manifolds with
Riemannian foliations. The principal investigator will also develop a model of
differential K-theory based on infinite-dimensional vector bundles.

Optimal transport is the study of the optimal way to transport mass. It was
first considered by Monge in 1781. In the past few decades, links have been
established between optimal transport, partial differential equations and
applied mathematics. More recently, links have also been found with differential
geometry. It seems likely that ideas from geometry will find applications to
optimal transport. The Ricci flow has clear importance for geometry and
topology. The methods that are being proposed to study its long-term behavior,
in particular the use of monotonic quantities adapted to collapsing flows, may
well have application to other geometric flows.
