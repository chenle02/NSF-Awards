Drs. Sempowski and Saunders will analyze and publish the large collection of
Seneca Indian material held by the Rochester Museum of Science Center. In total
this consists of ca. one million artifacts and 800 skeletal samples from nearly
50 Seneca sites which represent an unbroken sequence of villages occupied from
1550 to 1820 A.D. Most of the material was derived from the excavation of over
3000 burials and is supported by maps, field notes and other written and
photographic evidence. While Charles Wray, the primary excavator, worked out a
chronology based on these materials that has been widely used, the basic data
have never been published. Drs. Sempowski and Saunders will re-analyze the
artifactual material using a revised typology. They will also study the skeletal
materials, aging and sexing individual skeletons and noting signs of pathology.
They will examine the associated mortuary materials as well and the results of
all these analyses will be published. In their own analyses they plan to
investigate the dimensions of social and cultural change which took place over
this span of time. These include: demographic trends and their possible relation
to disease, famine and absorption of outsiders: biological relationships within
the Seneca population; interrelationships with other native groups; and the
impact of European goods and the fur trade economy on Seneca culture, technology
and internal status hierarchies. This research is important for several reasons.
First, it will show how both indirect and direct European presence affected a
native American group and how this population responded to the stresses thus
imposed. Second, it will make a large and anthropologically significant body of
data available to the research community.
