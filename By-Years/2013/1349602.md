Even as the availability of computing power, network bandwidth and other
resources increases at a rapid rate, users and applications increase their
demand for computation and their use of resources at roughly the same pace.
 Thus, no matter how much progress is made  on hardware efficiency, we will
always need efficient algorithms to manage these resources. The philosophy of
managing additional resources in an intelligent manner goes beyond computer
systems, and is relevant to many other  scientific and industrial areas. In
various real-life systems, processing times may be controllable by allocating
resources, such as additional money, overtime, energy, fuel, catalysts,
subcontracting, or additional manpower, to the job operations. In such systems,
job scheduling and resource allocation decisions should be coordinated carefully
to achieve the most efficient system performance. Applications arise in many
industrial areas.

The PI plans to study several algorithmic problems that arise in scheduling with
additional resource constraints.   While this field has received much attention
over the past ten years and beyond, the PI will focus on two areas that have
received very little attention in the computer science community -- scheduling
when the benefit of the schedule and the cost of energy or other resources are
monetized, and scheduling in models that go beyond the typically studied
computer systems setting.  Because these have received very little attention,
this work is somewhat speculative.  If successful, this work could have a high
impact, with applications into many new areas. The PI will design simple, low
overhead algorithms.
