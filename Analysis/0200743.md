ABSTRACT

This project proposes the further study of the geometric complex analysis,
mostly, through pluri-potential theory. Research will be conducted in the
following topics: the existence of a "general" potential theory containing all
the necessary background; the complex geometry of infinite-dimensional spaces
related to classical problems for plurisubharmonic functions; the complex
geometry of compact sets via the pluri-potential theory on such sets; the
geometry of domains and multipole Green functions (the classical analog is the
Martin-Caratheodory compactification) and Bernstein-Walsh and Markov
inequalities for generalized polynomials. Other geometric questions will also be
considered.

In this project research will be conducted on geometric complex analysis.
Geometry, as a part of mathematics, aims to describe qualitative links between
different objects. For example, parallel lines do not meet and the heights in a
triangle meet at the same point. When Euclidean objects: points, lines and
planes are replaced by more complicated structures: functions, surfaces and
sets, the research is of a more delicate flavor. It happens because the
mechanism providing links between objects is not transparent. In our proposal we
will look for such a mechanism in the form of potentials similar to the energy
levels of electrical charges.
