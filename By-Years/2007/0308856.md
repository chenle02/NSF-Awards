Explaining why species diversity varies among plant communities remains
difficult because diversity is affected by many environmental factors that
interact at different scales. Although several studies have shown that larger
pools of potentially colonizing species increase local diversity, we recently
found that this rate of increase depends on the productivity of a particular
site. We propose to test if colonization by new species is controlled by site
productivity or by the resident species, and if traits of potential colonists
can be used to predict successful colonization under varying environmental
conditions. These results will contribute to generalizations that can be applied
to conservation and restoration of diversity in plant communities, and to
understanding what influences invasion of exotic species.
