This award by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
supports research by Professor Carl J. Carrano at Southwest Texas State
University to study a family of ligands that allows for the systematic variance
of donor atom, charge, steric bulk, hydrogen-bonding and other factors that can
have an important effect on metal-catalyzed biotransformations. Ligand effects
on oxygen atom transfer reactions between acceptors such as organophosphines and
models for molybdoenzymes will be systematically studied. New sulfur-rich model
complexes to more closely mimic enzyme active sites will be prepared.
Pentaacoordinate complexes of iron will be prepared as models for several non-
heme iron oxygenase enzymes in order to determine the effects of the donor atom
set, charge, and hydrogen bonding and other factors that control oxygenation
versus oxidation. Pseudotetrahedral iron complexes will be synthesized and
studied as models for peptide deformylases and compared with analogous complexes
of Co(II), Ni(II) and Zn(II) in order to determine why Fe(II) rather than Zn(II)
is employed by nature in these unique hydrolytic enzymes.

Relatively small complexes of metal ions will be prepared that simulate the
structure and function of metal active sites in enzymes. Studying these
complexes will help to elucidate the fundamental nature of the function of the
metal ions in a number of important enzymes.
