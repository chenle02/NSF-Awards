This project will supply shipboard scientific equipment for the research vessels
COLUMBUS ISELIN and CALANUS, operated by the University of Miami, Rosenstiel
School of Marine and Atmospheric Science, and dedicated to use in support of
ocean science research. The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program
provides funds for ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe
conduct of ocean science research. This Program provides support for such items
as deck equipment including winch systems for the deployment and retrieval of
scientific instruments, navigational equipment such as radars, gyroscopes and
earth satellite receivers to pin point the location of research sites,
communication equipment including radio transceivers and satellite transceivers
for voice and scientific data communications and other equipment such as
motorized workboats for transporting scientists to and from data retrieval
sites. The Project Director, Ronald Hutchinson is fully qualified to direct this
project having had considerable experience in overseeing the acquisition and
installation of shipboard equipment. This project will allow the institution to
acquire two freezers for science materials on the ISELIN, modify the hydraulic
system on the CALANUS, install a backup GPS navigation system on the ISELIN,
replace two outboard motors, obtain a SCUBA refill station for diving and obtain
an emergency power supply for the bridge and a clean work station for the
ISELIN.
