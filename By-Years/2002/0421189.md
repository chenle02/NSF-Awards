A grant has been awarded to Cornell University under the direction of Dr. David
Lin for partial support of instruments to be utilized in a core microarray
facility. These instruments include a standard microarray platform, a spotted
array platform, a hybridization station, and a liquid handler. The facility will
be housed in the Veterinary Research Tower on the Cornell campus. The ability to
monitor the activity of thousands of genes at once has generated new insight
into diverse model systems and questions. In addition, the interpretation of
microarray data can encourage interactions across disciplines, promoting
collaborations among computer scientists, statisticians, and biologists. The
rapid rise in microarray use, coupled with the completion of the various Genome
Projects, has fueled interest in genomics. This in turn has attracted growing
numbers of graduate and undergraduate students to this new field of study. These
instruments will supplement existing equipment on campus, enabling a large
number of faculty to complete a wide range of microarray experiments. Faculty
will be able to: perform standard and spotted array experiments, create custom
libraries, print custom chips, hybridize and scan chips, and use available
software to analyze the data.

Cornell is also developing a Genomics Program of Study aimed at training
graduate and undergraduate students. As a component of this program, this Core
will position Cornell to successfully provide for the needs of faculty,
postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, and undergraduates. This will improve
access to and increase the use of state-of-the-art instrumentation for research
by scientists across departmental units and is expected to promote interactions
among diverse members of the Cornell campus, including biologists, computer
scientists and statisticians.
