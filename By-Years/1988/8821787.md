The University of Southwestern Louisiana has several researchers who would
benefit from access to supercomputers and access to other researchers connected
to the NSFNET. The campus will be connected to SURANET, a mid-level network
which attaches to the National Science Foundation Network, NSFNET, through
medium speed (56,000 bits per second) communication lines. The proposal requests
support to purchase a gateway system and fund communication lines to connect the
campus network to NSFNET. The communications lines will connect the campus to a
similar gateway at Louisiana State University which is a main node on the
regional network, SURANET.***
