Amid growing concern over toxic waste and pollution of drinking water
resources, the need for well-educated hydrogeologists increases. The aim of this
project is to teach students methods for the detection of ground water
pollution, particularly pollution by waste disposal facilities. This will be
done by improving the already-existing program in hydrogeology at Northeastern
Illinois University. Major instruments to be purchased under this program
include a mobile motorized auger, which students will use to learn methods of
drilling, logging, and developing monitoring wells, and a pressure transducer-
type water level indicator, which will allow students to make tests of the
water-tightness of landfill covers. For detection of pollution, a gas
chromatograph and spectrophotometer will enable students to chemically analyze
water samples to detect and quantify pollution by leaking toxic wastes. This
project is significant because it will train hydrogeologists in the areas most
needed today. Identifying the paths and rate of movement of leaking landfill
leachate is crucial to detection and remediation of polluted water. Toxic waste
cleanup efforts have shown that studying the interactions between water and
organic chemical wastes is of paramount importance. If today's students are to
address these problems as tomorrow's scientists, they must learn the proper
methods of research. The institution will match the award with an equal amount
of funds.
