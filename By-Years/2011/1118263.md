Intellectual Merit: The meeting for the 22nd International Conference on
Arabidopsis Research (ICAR) will be held June 22-25, 2011 at the University of
Wisconsin-Madison. This will be the first meeting since 2006 and the last one
until at least 2014. The breadth of the conference makes it an important focus
for the exchange of information in this era of scientific specialization. The
conference will cover a range of topics: 1) Translational Plant Biology, 2)
Hormone Signaling, 3) Organ and Cellular Polarity, 4) Epigenetics and Small
RNAs, 5) Stem Cells, 6) Biotic Interactions/Stress, 7) Environmental Responses
Global Regulation of Transcription, 8) Natural Variation/Quantitative
Genetics/Evolution and 9) Computational Biology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts: The broader impacts of this meeting allow for new efforts and
collaborations to be discussed. In addition, the participation of young and
ethnically diverse scientists ensures the future of the field. A conference
website will feature the complete program.
