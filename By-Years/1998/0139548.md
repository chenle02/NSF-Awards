The Atlanta Consortium for Research in the Earth Science (ACRES) will conduct a
Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site program at Georgia State
University. The purpose of the proposed REU program is to extend opportunities
to participate in geoscience research to undergraduate students and secondary
school science teachers from the southeast region. REU program participants will
work in teams with ACRES faculty on selected research problems in regional
geology. Projects are 1) The Paleontology, Petrology, Depositional Environments
and Early Diagenesis of the Sandersville Limestone member of the Tobacco Road
Sandstone (Eocene), Coastal Plain of Georgia 2) A Comparative Study of the
Geochemistry, Sedimentology and Micropaleontology of Developed and Undeveloped
Marginal Marine Systems on the Georgia and South Carolina Coasts 3) Comparative
Geochemistry of Flat Rock Park Gneiss, Motts Gneiss, and Other Granitoidal
Gneisses in the Uchee Belt and 4) Fluid Inclusions from the Uchee Belt:
Theoretical and Experimental Evaluation of Decrepitation Behavior and
Microthermometric Determination of Pressure-Temperature Conditions During
Metamorphism.
