Flora North America is a long-term multi-investigator project designed to
provide consistent and comparable information about the vascular plants (ferns,
conifers, and flowering plants) of North America north of Mexico in both
published and computerized form. The project is a cooperative effort among
botanists and other scientists in more than twenty institutions in the United
States and Canada; the Missouri Botanical Garden serves as the organizational
center for the project, with Dr. Nancy Morin as convening editor. Funding of the
first stage of work will support preparation of taxonomic synthesis for the
estimated 600 species of ferns and conifers, with treatments contributed by
thirty botanical specialists; support for postdoctoral research on the
Cyperaceae (sedge) family; conduct of a workshop to evaluate current uses and
future requirements for floristic data; and initial development of a national
computer database of floristic information. Taxonomic study of all plant groups
will entail critical examination of specimens as well as synthesis of the
literature and will involve a two-tiered review, by an Editorial Board of
leading floristics researchers and by extramural experts. Consequently,
authoritative information on the vascular plants of continental United States,
Canada, and Greenland (estimated to include 17,000 species), describing and
evaluating their full range of variation, will be available in comparable and
fully retrievable form for the first time. The computerized database is
envisioned as an expandable, relational repository of data on characteristics
about the plants, allowing correlation and analysis with geographical and other
physical parameters. The published floras and developing computer database will
benefit research in systematics and evolutionary biology, including ecology and
biogeography, and will serve as practical references in biology, wildlife and
land management, horticulture, agriculture, and conservation biology.
