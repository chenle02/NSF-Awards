1403905&lt;br/&gt;Izatt, Joseph A.&lt;br/&gt;Title: Gigapixel Widefield Super-
Resolved Structured Illumination
Microscopy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Significance:&lt;br/&gt;An award is made to Duke
University to perform research to improve microscopy technology for imaging
biological specimens over wide fields of view at high resolution. Many widely
used applications of microscopy such as in cell biology and histology require
frequent switching between a wide field-of-view (FOV) to identify tissue
features and locations of interest, and narrow FOV to image at cellular and sub-
cellular resolution. The need to manually zoom in and out is time consuming and
incompatible with improvements in modern digital image capture and review
methodology. This research addresses and provides a solution for this
problem&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description:&lt;br/&gt;The PI will
develop a novel spatially structured illumination element to be placed in close
proximity to the sample to multiplex high spatial frequency image content into
the detection aperture of a wide field of view microscope objective. The project
will advance the state of the art in coherent super-resolution imaging
technology. The project will include extending modern super-resolution imaging
techniques from their current focus on nanometer scale imaging to broader
applications in biological research and clinical laboratory diagnostics. The
project will also support the education and scientific training of engineering
students from Duke and elsewhere at multiple levels. The project will comprise
the Ph.D. dissertation research of a Duke biomedical engineering student, and
Duke undergraduate engineering students will have opportunities to participate
in the research through independent study. Additionally, three underrepresented
engineering students recruited into Duke's Research Experience for Undergraduate
program will each spend a summer assisting with this research as well as
participating in related training and outreach activities.
