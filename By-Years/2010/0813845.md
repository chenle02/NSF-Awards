This year, the IEEE Communications Theory Workshop will take place on May 11-14
in St. Croix, US Virgin Islands. The continued success of this workshop lies in
its informal and highly interactive atmosphere, in contrast to more formal
conferences. As before, the workshop will be single track, with five technical
sessions, three plenary speakers, two panel discussions, and a hot-topics
submitted poster session. The technical sessions consist of invited lectures
given by leaders in academia and industry. In addition, there will be hot-topics
poster session with an open call for participation. This workshop uniquely
combines communications, information theory, and networking. The NSF support for
travel to the workshop will be carefully disseminated to women, minorities, or
young researchers by the young, successful, up-and-coming organizing committee.
