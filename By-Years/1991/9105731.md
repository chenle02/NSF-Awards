This is a study of phase transformations and kinetics studies studies on mantle
minerals at high pressures and high temperatures. Instrumentation and techniques
to be employed in the proposed study includes diamond-anvil pressure cells,
laser-heating system, x-ray diffraction system (either with synchrotron
radiation at National Synchrotron Light Source or with in-house x-ray
facilities) and analytical transmission electron microscope (ATEM).
