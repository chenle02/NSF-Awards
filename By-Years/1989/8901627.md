The proposal is a continuation of previous work in intermediate energy nuclear
physics. It involves three-quark models for the nucleon and baryon resonances
and their role in nuclei, as well as a relativistic few-body formalism on the
light cone with applications to 2- and 3- body quark and nucleon systems. As a
separate project with a Research Opportunity Award to H. T. Williams, it is
proposed to calculate nucleon photon cross sections and polarizabilities at low
energy from a chiral constituent quark model.
