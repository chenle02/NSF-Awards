ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ten largest freshwater lakes hold nearly two-
thirds (62%) of the planet's surface fresh water. These and other large lakes
are already important sources of fresh water for society that may be tapped for
greater withdrawals in the coming century. Large lakes are also invaluable
national resources for transportation, tourism, recreation, commercial fisheries
and food production, and they are increasingly stressed by regional development.
Most of these lakes are unique, complex ecosystems whose dynamics differ from
both oceans and small lakes. Despite the importance and uniqueness of large
lakes throughout the world, the current level of NSF funding for these aquatic
systems is surprisingly small. We propose to hold a workshop that will develop a
science and implementation plan for basic research on large lakes. A report will
be produced that will define the rationale for this research, outline some of
the current pressing questions, identify the needs of the research community,
and provide advice to NSF for the future management of great lakes
proposals.&lt;br/&gt;
