La Salle University is the recipient of ARI funds to revitalize laboratories
for research and research training programs in biology and chemistry. Located in
Philadelphia, PA, the University serves a large population of urban students of
diverse ethnicity, and is committed to providing a quality education in all
disciplines including the sciences. At present, all science activity occurs in
the Holroyd Science Center a facility constructed in the early sixties that has
limited utility to support modern research. The configuration, size, and
obsolescence of the structure impairs experimental work conducted in the
building. Utility systems are inadequate, shared usage of rooms between research
and instructional activities results in the duplication of efforts, and safety
concerns create an environment that is not conducive for research. To rectify
the problems that impede the faculty's ability to perform state of the art
research and provide students with improved training opportunities, La Salle
University, as the part of a larger effort to ameliorate the physical
infrastructure, will renovate Holroyd in its entirely. By partnering with the
National Science Foundation, the institution will reconfigure laboratories,
install new fume hoods, create a tissue culture facility and equipment room, and
make space accessible to those individuals who are physically challenged. Upon
completion, three modernized research laboratories will be established for
neurobiology, molecular biology, biochemistry and organic chemistry. Faculty
will have controlled environments to conducted experiments requiring the use of
delicate and precise instrumentation. Most importantly, the renovation will
increase research productivity, improve the quality of research, expand training
opportunities and maximize access to a diverse group of students interested in
pursuing science as a career.
