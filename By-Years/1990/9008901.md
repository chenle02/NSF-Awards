The goal of the work described in this proposal is to determine how stress
negatively influences learning and memory. It is known that a brain structure
called the hippocampus is necessary for many forms of learning. In addition, the
hippocampus has a high number of receptors which detect the presence of stress
related hormones in the blood. What does the presence of such stress hormones do
to the normal function of the hippocampus? This question will be answered using
electrophysiological and behavioral techniques in rats. In particular, work will
focus on determining the influence of stress related hormones on primed burst
potentiation, a very long lasting increase in the strength of connections in the
hippocampus which is induced by threshold electrical stimulation. Primed burst
potentiation may represent a mechanism which is normally used by the brain to
make memories.
