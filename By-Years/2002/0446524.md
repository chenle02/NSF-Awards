EAR-0446524&lt;br/&gt;Draper&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Support from NSF's Instruments
and Facilities element will be used to upgrade the high-pressure facility at the
University of New Mexico. The existing multi-anvil press will be refurbished to
correct some minor problems, and additional streamlining of its operational
procedures will take place. An existing, smaller press will be converted to a
second multi-anvil, and a piston-cylinder frame acquired from the University of
Oregon will be fitted with new components to bring it into service. At the
completion of this work, the lab's capacity to reach pressures appropriate for
studying petrological processes in the deep interiors of the Earth, Moon, and
Mars will be doubled. The new piston-cylinder will also allow us access to lower
pressures relevant to mid- to deep-crustal to upper-mantle processes applicable
to both terrestrial and martian studies. The lab supports two principal
investigators and several graduate students, with plans for a new postdoctoral
scientist as well. These upgrades will yield a robust facility with a long
projected lifespan of productive work in studying planetary
interiors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
