This award provides partial support for the Federation of Latin American
Physical Societies. The principal investigator for the U.S. is Leon Lederman of
Fermilab and his counterpart is Gil da Costa Marques, President of the Brazilian
Physical Society, President of the Federation and a professor at the University
of Sao Paulo. Members of the Federation include Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil,
Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Chile, Ecuador, Honduras, Mexico, Peru and
Venezuela. The first meeting will be in July, 1990 with major meetings every
year and those in each third year expanded into a Pan American Symposium. The
U.S. has extensive connections and collaborations in physics throughout Latin
America. It is clearly in our interest to encourage activities which will
strengthen the infrastructure of science in developing countries as well as our
bilateral agreement partners. This Federation will improve the level of
interaction in physics among the members and with the American Physical Society.
The improvement will enhance communications and the sharing of facilities as
well as scientific ideas and the study of physics.
