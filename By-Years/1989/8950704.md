Another step toward integrating computers into the teaching of mathematics has
been taken at Glendale Community College. Students are using Macintosh SEs and
software for computing and graphing in their calculus courses. The new computer
laboratory/classroom gives students the ability to handle "what if" situations.
This makes the computer a much more powerful teaching tool than its computing
and graphing capabilities alone can provide. This award is being matched by an
equal amount from the principal investigator's institution.
