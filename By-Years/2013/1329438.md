This CAREER award investigates whether challenge-based curricula are widely
adoptable in engineering education and whether the innovation and efficiency
gain in challenge-based educational experiences transfer to innovative
performance in professional engineering settings. The PI will conduct a five-
year program of developmental and comparative research organized into two
concurrent, interrelated strands. Strand 1 involves classroom research and
addresses how undergraduate-level engineering faculty innovate in their teaching
to adopt Challenge-Based Instruction. Strand 2 investigates the transfer of
innovation from engineering learning environments to the world of engineering
work. The two main research questions are: Does Challenge Based Instruction
increase retention rates of underrepresented students so that they stay in the
pipeline toward an engineering career and successful employment in professional
engineering? This work leverages the NSF's investment in the VaNTH ERC
(Vanderbilt, Northwestern, University of Texas, and Harvard/MIT Engineering
Research Center). In addition, this work will benefit society more broadly by
producing engineers who are ready for the challenges of their field in the
future, and who can innovate in the global economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award is co-funded by the Directorate for Engineering, and the Directorate for
Education and Human Resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
