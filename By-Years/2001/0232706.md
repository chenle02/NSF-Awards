This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate
the feasibility of developing an innovative manufacturing process to produce
cost-effective, high-performance long-fiber thermoplastic composites for Next-
Generation Vehicles applications. There is general concern in the U.S. over the
growing usage of imported oil, and about 68 percent of the total U.S.
consumption of petroleum are related to transportation. Materials technologies
to enable production of safe and cost-effective lightweight vehicles have been
identified as critical to reducing fuel consumption in future vehicles. This
project will validate the concept of using compounding technique to produce
well-mixed long-fiber thermoplastic composites with a fiber length exceeding its
critical length. Additionally, the innovation would be versatile and inexpensive
enough for widespread use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial and broader
impacts of this technology will be to supply the automotive and other industries
with improved performance long-fiber thermoplastic composites at a significantly
lower cost (by 30-50 percent) to meet their needs for lighter, stronger,
recyclable and cost-effective materials for future generation vehicles
applications. &lt;br/&gt;
