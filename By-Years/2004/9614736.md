9614736 Brown MSA will expand both its educational and research roles through a
new venture that involves the Internet. The MSA Council recently approved the
creation of a new standing committee, referred to as the MSA Outreach Committee,
to coordinate the development of MSA Internet resources and to begin an outreach
effort designed to enlist the help of MSA members and others in identifying and
developing these resources. MSA will hire an "MSA Coordinator of Internet
Resources" who would be responsible for making mineralogical resources on the
Internet more accessible to MSA members and others interested in the mineral
sciences. He or she would also be responsible for organizing existing
educational resources and creating new ones that would appeal to students of all
ages.
