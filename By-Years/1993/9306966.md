The purpose of this project is to determine how the properties of atomic nuclei
such as, for example, their shapes, depend upon their temperature and rotational
velocity. Increasing temperature or rotational velocity can induce transitions
between different nuclear shapes, i.e., prolate, oblate, spherical, etc. A
single nucleus may also undergo transitions between a normal fluid phase and
various kinds of superfluid phases, i.e., there may be correlated pairs
containing two neutrons (or two protons) which have parallel or anti-parallel
intrinsic spins, or there may be correlated pairs containing one neutron and one
proton. Since hot nuclei are small systems, they should have significant
fluctuations in (a) their shape, (b) the orientation of the shape relative to
the rotation axis, and (c) the strength of their superfluity. The neutrons and
protons occupy orbital, which are determined for each combination of temperature
and rotational velocity.
