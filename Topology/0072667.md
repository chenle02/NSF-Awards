DMS-0072667 Allen I. Knutson

Allen Knutson's proposed work is about Schubert calculus on flag manifolds,
which combinatorially is about counting the (obviously nonnegative) number of
flags satisfying a list of intersection conditions with other flags, and is
computable as a (not obviously nonnegative) integral over a flag manifold. The
main question in the field concerns finding a totally-positive combinatorial
formula rather than the alternating sum. His work with Dr. Terence Tao on the
case of single subspaces, refining totally-positive formulae already known and
solving long-standing conjectures in that relatively simple case, has suggested
new lines of attack on the general problem.

Given four straight lines (picture them as blue) drawn in space, in generic
directions, how many other straight lines (picture them as red) touch all four?
In special cases there are many, but generically there are exactly two such red
lines. This is the first interesting case of a general problem counting the
number of flat subspaces (in this case one-dimensional) intersecting a number of
other subspaces (which can even be curved). Computers can determine this
obviously nonnegative number in any given case, but do so by adding many large
positive and negative numbers together -- in particular it is difficult to
determine easily if the number is zero. Also many interesting cases in
engineering are beyond the reach of computers. Dr. Knutson's work concerns the
search for a manifestly positive formula for these (no cancelation), which in
particular would make it much more straightforward to determine which such
problems have any solutions at all. Under previous NSF support he and Dr.
Terence Tao already determined this positivity criterion in a famous subcase of
the general problem.
