This award provides travel for 10 U.S. computer scientists to attend a workshop
on the applications of tree automata held in Dagstuhl, Germany. The purpose of
the workshop is to bring together researchers from three different communities-
automated deduction, term-rewriting, computer- aided verification and compiler
construction who have been utilizing tree automata, in an attempt at cross
fertilization of ideas among the disciplines and forging new research
directions.
