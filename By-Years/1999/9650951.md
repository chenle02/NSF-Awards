The purpose of this project is to improve course content in chemistry
laboratories at Rancho Santiago College, with emphasis on Organic Chemistry and
Quantitative Analysis. Implementation would involve purchase of four modern gas
chromatographs (GC), one modern ultraviolet-visible recording spectrophotometer
(UV-VIS), and eight pH meters. Students will have direct hands-on experience
with these instruments and acquire skill in interpreting the measurements they
provide. New student exercises will be implemented which take advantage of the
increased capabilities of the new equipment. UV-VIS will be used for molecular
structure determination and allow enhanced knowledge of structure/property
interrelationships. GC is a valuable adjunct to these methods because it allows
rapid separation, identification, and quantification of volatile substances.
Information obtained from pH meters are useful in the determination of the
percent of a substance in an unknown, helping to identify an unknown, and
determining the dissociation constant of a weak acid. Students in General
Chemistry will also benefit from this new instrumentation.
