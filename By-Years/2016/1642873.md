The radio frequency spectrum that can be used for wireless communications is a
finite but extremely valuable resource. With the proliferation of new wireless
applications, the use of the radio spectrum has intensified to the point that
there is a critical need of new spectrum-sharing mechanisms and improved
spectrum policies. In the recent NSF workshop report on Enhancing Access to the
Radio Spectrum (EARS), several Grand Challenges are outlined for the research
community to realize the vision of enhancing the efficiency of future spectrum
use. One of the Grand Challenges is harmonious co-existence of heterogeneous
wireless technologies, with the goal of accommodating multiple wireless access
technologies that would operate in the same radio spectrum band. The proposed
research addresses the co-existence Grand Challenge by investigating the
following three tightly-coupled research areas: (1) Coexistence between Wi-Fi
and cellular on unlicensed bands; (2) Coexistence of radar and cellular on radar
bands; and (3) New software and hardware testbeds for coexistence. The proposed
research activities will catalyze broader impact activities in multiple
dimensions: (1) improving and influencing future spectrum policies by the
government; (2) transitioning technologies to industry; (3) developing new
education materials and software tools to be used in classroom; and (4)
attracting and engaging students, particularly female and under-represented
students in spectrum-sharing research activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
proposed research addresses the coexistence Grand Challenge by tackling two of
the most popular wireless services (Wi-Fi and cellular) on radio spectrum bands.
The proposed research on coexistence between Wi-Fi and cellular on unlicensed
bands takes a new approach to resolve the potential conflict between the two
technologies by shifting focus to the user side and maximizing total user
satisfaction. The research on coexistence between radar and cellular on the
radar bands explores the largely untapped radar spectrum that the government is
considering for coexistence. The proposed architecture goes well beyond the
current Spectrum Access Server concept by considering some unique
characteristics and challenges associated with radar systems. New software and
hardware testbeds will be developed to offer the much-needed facility for the
research community for validation and experimentation of new approaches for
coexistence. The outcomes of the research will be shared with government and
regulatory agencies to help improve spectrum policies, which are crucial to
enable the proposed new coexistence technologies to make impacts in the real
world.
