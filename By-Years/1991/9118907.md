It is proposed to investigate an approach to the controlled synthesis of
ultrafine particles of narrow size distribution. Particles are nucleated during
the rapid mixing of microemulsion solutions containing the two reagents, one in
considerable excess. The particle growth is controlled by the addition of the
limiting reagent to the microemulsion via dialysis in a hollow fibre membrane
module. Then, the particles are dispersed in thin glass films cast via spin-
coating techniques, and recrystallized before densification of the film. Linear
and nonlinear optical techniques, and external field dependent measurements are
used for optical characterization of the quantum crystallites. A theoretical
analysis of the transport and reaction processes in the microemulsion system
based on detailed population balance considerations will be carried out. Models
for the recrystallization of the particles, both during lyothermal processing
and in thin films, will be developed. Itis expected that the project will lead
to the development of new processing technologies for fine, uniform particle
synthesis via the microemulsion based route.
