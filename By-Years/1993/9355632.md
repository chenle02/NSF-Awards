9355632 Hickox "Living on the Edge" will be the name of an exhibit in three
editions that will explore multiple edges of boundaries between land and sea,
air and sea, ocean bottom and overlying water, and differing water masses.
Scientists have become increasingly fascinated by the study of these edges or
fronts because of the new understanding it provides regarding such basic
principles as the productivity of coast waters, migrations and feeding patterns
of marine life, upwelling and downwelling, chlorophyll dynamics, and water
quality issues, for example. The educational objectives are to bring an
understanding of coastal ocean science and its social implications to broad
audiences in museums and aquaria. It will consist of eight mulit-faceted
interactive activity centers totally approximately 1500 square feet. Two
editions of the exhibit will become part of the permanent displays at the
University of Rhode Island Graduate School of Oceanography and the Museum of
Science in Boston. The third will be a traveling version; the management of
which will be handled by the Association of Science and Technology Centers. It
will go to 12-15 venues during its three-year tour schedule. It is estimated
that a total of 2.5 million will experience this exhibit. A suite of materials
will be developed for use by formal educators with all three of the exhibits.
These materials will include teacher training materials, exhibit-related modules
for on-site interpretive programs, and traveling kits for in-class
presentations.
