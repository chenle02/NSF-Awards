The study will aim to reconstruct surface ocean changes in the equatorial
Atlantic of the past 2 m. yrs. using diatoms assemblages in cores from ODP Site
662. Diatoms are sensitive recorders of productivity and surface circulation
conditions. The investigators hope to generate a long term record of equatorial
circulation and decipher the history of cyclic forcing. They will compare this
with the record from the Pacific and other latitudes to test for climatic and
oceanographic linkages. The study is an important avenue of investigation which
will generate critical time series data for detailed paleoceanographic
reconstructions of the equatorial hydrological regime. It is also a natural
extension of the PIs previous work that needs to be completed to its fruition.
