PROGRAM: Oceanographic Instrumentation The University of Hawaii (UH) requests
funding to purchase shipboard instrumentation in support of NSF-funded research.
The instruments will be used aboard the research vessel MOANA WAVE, a 210'
vessel that is owned by the Navy and operated by the University. All of the
instruments are for shared-use by a wide variety of scientists. Funding will
include the acquisition of shipboard computer upgrades, a CTD, and a
thermosalinograph. //
