Error correcting codes are a fundamental tool for protecting data in
communication and storage. Since the seminal works of Shannon and Hamming in the
1950s, error correcting codes have found uses throughout computer science and
engineering, including in algorithm design, complexity theory, and cryptography.
The goal of this project is to develop extremely efficient decoding algorithms
for error correcting codes, in a variety of settings. In addition to addressing
fundamental problems in algorithmic coding theory, this research will have
applications algorithm design, complexity theory and pseudorandomness. Further,
this award advances education by supporting graduate students and by providing
research opportunities for undergraduates. This project is an international
collaboration, made possible through joint funding with the US-Israel Binational
Science Foundation (BSF). The project brings together one US investigator and
one Israeli investigator, both of whom are experts in algorithmic coding theory,
and who have a history of successful collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project develops linear-time and sublinear-time algorithms for decoding error
correcting codes in scenarios where these codes operate at capacity: that is,
where they attain the best possible combinatorial and/or information-theoretic
trade-offs. The approach is to bring together algebraic, graph-theoretic, and
information-theoretic techniques. Traditionally, graph-theoretic and
information-theoretic techniques have been useful in developing linear-time or
near-linear-time algorithms for decoding, while algebraic techniques have been
useful in developing sublinear-time algorithms. By combining these techniques,
this project will make progress on fundamental questions in algorithmic coding
theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
