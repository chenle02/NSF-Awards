Symplectic manifolds are geometric objects that generalize the concept of phase-
space in classical mechanics. During the past four decades, the field of
symplectic geometry has evolved rapidly, leading to new connections with other
significant areas of research, such as algebraic geometry, low dimensional
topology, and high energy physics. This award supports research on fundamental
objects known as holomorphic curves and their corresponding invariants and
algebraic structures. In particular, the investigator will address foundational
questions, such as the construction of well-behaved families of holomorphic
curves in the presence of objects known as divisors. This research contains
specific projects that can be carried out by graduate students and postdocs. The
investigator will organize annual mini-symposia for introducing undergraduate
students to research opportunities in geometry and topology, and their
applications to other fields. He will also initiate a math club at the public
library aimed at high school students.

The main objective of this proposal is to construct moduli spaces of holomorphic
curves for arbitrary pairs of symplectic manifolds and normal crossing
symplectic divisors, satisfying particular properties. Construction of such
moduli spaces requires a compactification, an analytical framework for
deformation theory, addressing the transversality issue, and proving a gluing
theorem. These moduli spaces have immediate applications in enumerative
geometry, Mirror Symmetry, construction of Fukaya categories, and other active
areas of research in symplectic geometry, algebraic geometry, and string theory.
In collaboration with M. McLean and A. Zinger, the PI introduced topological
notions of normal crossing symplectic divisor and variety. They have constructed
tools such as regularizations and logarithmic tangent bundle for working with
such objects. Recently, the PI developed a novel compactification and a
deformation theory based on the logarithmic tangent bundle. He will use this
setup to work on the remaining steps of the construction. The main project is to
define Gromov-Witten invariants relative to an arbitrary normal crossing
divisor. Other projects include proving a degeneration formula for Gromov-Witten
invariants, finding the relations with the algebraic approach, and exploiting
the applications to Mirror Symmetry. This project is jointly funded by Geometric
Analysis and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
