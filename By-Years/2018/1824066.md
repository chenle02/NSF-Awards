Title: Ascertaining Intergovernmental Coordination Mechanisms
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract: &lt;br/&gt;Jurisdictional boundaries of
governmental agencies often do not align with the geographic or social
boundaries of the policy issues they are tasked with addressing. This spatial
mismatch is especially common in relation to natural resources and the
environment. Where it occurs, achievement of policy goals may require
coordination across jurisdictions, which can lead to mutual benefits. Yet,
governmental agencies may view coordination as costly or as leading to a loss of
autonomy. This project will examine the choices of local governmental agencies
as they respond to a State legislative mandate to coordinate in order to achieve
groundwater sustainability.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project will investigate
coordination decisions made by Groundwater Sustainability Agencies (GSAs) as
they coordinate plans under California's Sustainable Groundwater Management Act
(SGMA). The project will employ a mixed-methods approach, including interviews,
surveys, content analysis, and statistical modeling, to analyze differences in
coordination mechanisms among various GSAs. To do so, the research will examine
compatibility between groundwater sustainability plans submitted by GSAs which
share a groundwater basin, as well as the fit of those plans with SGMA statutory
definitions of groundwater sustainability at the basin-level. Though the
research examines coordination over shared groundwater, findings will be
applicable more broadly to the management of other shared natural resources and
cross-border environmental issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
