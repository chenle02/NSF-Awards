This project will enable The University of Toledo to provide 45 Mbps connections
to support faculty research, research collaboration, and collaboration for
specific educational projects. The project provides needed bandwidth for seven
applications needing to transfer large data sets, images, and video files. The
projects are: o X-ray Crystallography that provides UT chemists with access to
national synchrotron laboratories and to other Ohio researchers involved in the
Ohio Crystallography Consortium; o Geographic Information Systems and Remote
Sensing that provides access to OhioView and to other remote data centers; o
Internet-based Laboratories that provides high bandwidth, high fidelity
connection to transfer data, control signals, audio, and video in real-time for
Internet-based laboratory experiments; o Astrophysical Data and Observations to
access archived data and for remote observing and control; o Computational
Studies of G Protein-Coupled Receptors in a Lipid Bilayer to access the Ohio
Supercomputer Center and other supercomputers; o Speech-language Pathology to
provide therapeutic services to distant or mobility impaired clients with
language disorders; and o Large Scale ATM and MLS Network Simulation to
collaborate with the Ohio Supercomputer Center on research issues related to
simulation of large scale Multi-Protocol Label Switching networks.
