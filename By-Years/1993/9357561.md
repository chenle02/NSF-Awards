This research is concerned with the analysis and modeling of electrical
performance of high-speed interconnects in electronics packaging. The finite-
difference time-domain (FDTD) method, which is a full-wave solution of Maxwell's
equations in three dimensions, is used to simulate signal propagation through
interconnects. Topics pursued are: 1. Development of a computational scheme for
conformed finite-difference grid to model complex-shape interconnects. The
objective of this scheme is to enhance the resolution and accuracy of numerical
solutions while maintaining the computation efficiency associated with the
regular rectangular finite-difference grid. 2. Analysis and modeling of
electrical properties of interconnection discontinuities in electronics
packaging. Issues involved in this topic include: modeling of electrical
characteristics of interconnection discontinuities over the frequency range from
dc to tens of gigahertz; evaluation of impacts of parasitics associated with
interconnection discontinuities on the propagation of high-clock rate signals;
and development of design guidelines for typical interconnection discontinuities
in high performance electronics packaging.
