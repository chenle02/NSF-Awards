The Theoretical Advanced Study Institute in particle physics will operate each
summer during the period 1993 - 1997 at the University of Colorado. This
Institute is a summer school which provides advanced training to students of
elementary particle theory. It provides a much needed bridge between courses
offered in universities and the expertise required for research at the
frontiers. The topics for any given year are organized by the program leaders
for that year, with help from the Scientific Advisory Board. The emphasis each
year is on timely subjects which are relevant for both theory and experiment,
and the lecturers are typically of excellent quality.
