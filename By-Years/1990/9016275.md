NSF and the National Research council of Canada have reached an agreement to
interconnect Canada's newly.forming national research and academic network,
"CA*net ( the asterisk represents a Maple Leaf in its official logo) and the
NSFNET with international links between three major nodes ("NSS's) on each
network. The NSS.NSS links will represent a "first" in the interconnection of
international peer networks, inasmuch as CA*net and NSFNET both employ switching
technology furnishid by the IBM Corporation, and this eliminates the need to use
devices which adapt dissimilar technologies. CA*net is fashioned on the NSFNET
model both in its technology and in its topolgy which connects
regional/provincial networks in Canada. The CA*net NSFNET interconnection will
facilitate scientific and academic collaborations between the two countries.
