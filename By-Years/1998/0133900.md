&lt;br/&gt;This project will study the role that video can play in how teachers
learn and how they develop a professional vision of their craft. The use of
video based lessons of various sorts has become popular in the professional
development of teachers. Meanwhile, research has sought to focus on the notion
of a "professional vision" for teaching as researchers work to refine our
understanding of how good teachers optimize their blend of pedagogical and
content knowledge in the context of specific instructional tasks. This project
will examine the use of video in the context of teacher professional vision. It
will develop, apply, and refine a new organizing and analytic framework for
studying this phenomenon, and will include the analysis of video content,
professional development program design, interviews with teachers, and
observations of video clubs. The research will be the source of several new and
revised courses on learning sciences, teaching and pedagogy, mathematics
teaching methods, and alternative certification. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
