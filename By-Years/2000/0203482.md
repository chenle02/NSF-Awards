This award provides funding for a three-year Combined Research-Curriculum
Development (CRCD) program, entitled, "Environmental Informatics in Coastal
Margins," at Texas A&amp;M University College Station, the regional campuses in
Corpus Christi and Kingsville, and the Texas Engineering Experiment Station,
under the direction of Dr. James S. Bonner. The overall objective of this
project is to develop four new and significantly modified courses, which will
provide the nation with the next generation of engineers and decision-makers
able to utilize the latest environmental modeling tools in their designs and
fully comprehend the environmental impacts of new developments on infrastructure
and serve industries.
