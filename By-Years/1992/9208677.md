Prior beliefs can be characterized using ideas of partial exchangeability by
describing certain convex sets of proba- bilities in terms of their symmetry
properties using deFinetti's theorem as a paradigm. Statistical procedures
suggested by priors will also be examined using usual frequentist criteria like
consistency and asymptotic normality. Tests of the assumptions for statistical
models useful for policy analysis will be considered and the performance of such
models under failure of these assumptions will evaluated. The foundations of
statistics include concepts of prior beliefs and their characterization and
their relation to good statistical procedures. How standard statistical
procedures behave under nonstandard conditions and how to test the conditions to
verify assumptions are other basic issues to be considered in this project.
