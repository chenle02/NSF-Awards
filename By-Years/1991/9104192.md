Professor Sperber will study exponential sums using methods from p-adic
analysis and p-adic cohomology. He intends to produce better congruence
estimates for these sums and relate them to singularities and Hodge theory. The
goal is to obtain sharp effective estimates on the size of exponential sums.
This project falls into the general area of arithmetic geometry -a subject that
blends two of the oldest areas of mathematics: number theory and geometry. This
combination has proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved
problems that withstood generations. Among its many consequences are new error
correcting codes. Such codes are essential for both modern computers (hard
disks) and compact disks.
