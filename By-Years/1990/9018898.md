This is a proposal to create and develop a sequence of courses for upper-level
undergraduates in the area of human-computer interfaces. The courses will be
based on readings and discussions and on group projects in the structured
instruction, and will require novel materials as well as subject matter. A major
objective will be developing skills to help students become competent in the
design of computer-human systems. Funds will be used to develop a hardware -
software design platform and to promote an environment for group project design.
Teaching materials and laboratory manuals will be developed to aid in
transporting this environment to other institutions.
