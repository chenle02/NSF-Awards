This research program explores the use of optical fields to manipulate atomic
collisions. The work has two principal goals, production and trapping of
ultracold molecules and ultracold collision spectroscopy in and near a Bose-
Einstein condensate, although studies in continuum dynamics in the
photoassociative ionization of rubidium atoms and polarization anisotropy of
optical shielding and suppression will play a part. All processes rely on the
excitation of atoms to selected states that have specific relationships to the
intermolecular potential curves, such that bond formation and breaking can occur
in a carefully controlled manner.
