The Department of Chemistry at Montana State University, which is an EPSCOR
state, will use this award from the Chemical Research Instrumentation Program to
help acquire a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) Spectrometer. The areas of
chemical research that will be enhanced by the acquisition include measurements
of: the motions of non-rigid molecules, proton glasses, low frequency vibrations
in organometallic complexes, corrosion of metal surfaces, general organic and
inorganic chemical systems, and secondary structures of membrane protein
receptors. %%% Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is a technique
that uses absorption of infrared energy to probe molecular structure. When used
in conjunction with a modern computer, FTIR studies on large numbers of samples
can be conveniently carried out and the resulting data readily analyzed. The use
of FTIR spectroscopy is essential to chemists who are carrying out research in
many important frontier areas.
