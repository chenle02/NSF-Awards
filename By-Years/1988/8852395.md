This project will support a computer laboratory dedicated to lower-division
mathematics instruction at the University of Connecticut. It is being funded
under the Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement (ILI) Program, which has
the stated goal of improving "the quality of the undergraduate curriculum by
supporting projects to develop new or improved instrument-based undergraduate
laboratory and/or field courses in science, mathematics, or engineering." The
major thrust of this project will involve an effort to integrate computing into
large lecture sections of a three-semester main-track calculus sequence. Regular
laboratory periods will be scheduled and students will be asked to modify
existing programs and to write new programs.
