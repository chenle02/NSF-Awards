In this award, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Professor Gordon and his students will use lasers to control
the relaxation rate of electronically excited organic molecules. Such processes,
known as "radiationless transitions," play an essential role in vision,
mutagenesis, and carcinogenesis, as well as in many industrial processes. For
example, a unique property of the four nucleotide building blocks of DNA is that
their conversion of electronic to vibrational energy is faster than
fragmentation, allowing these molecules to be stable in the presence of
ultraviolet radiation. This property is essential for life to exist on the
surface of the earth. The goal of this project is to use ultrashort femtosecond
laser pulses either to accelerate or inhibit the rate of such radiationless
transitions. By using a combination of theory and experiment, the temporal
profile of the pulses will be optimized to achieve the desired goal. This
research fits into the larger context of coherent control of chemical reactions,
in which light pulses are designed to control the outcome of chemical and
physical processes. The research will also provide a deeper understanding of the
mechanism of this important class of chemical processes.
