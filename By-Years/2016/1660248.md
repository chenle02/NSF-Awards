The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in reducing the energy consumption from air
and gas compression. In the United States, industrial air compressors consume
over 12% of manufacturing electricity consumption, or 399 trillion BTU. 5% of
natural gas production in the US is consumed by compression to move the gas to
the end-user. On a global basis, compressors driven by electric motors are
estimated to consume 32% of the electricity consumption from electric motor
driven systems, or 2,267 terawatt hours per year. At $0.10 per kilowatt hour,
this translates into nearly $227 billion of annual electricity costs for
compression. Carnot's technology has the potential to reduce energy consumption
from compression by 20% or more across multiple compression applications. By
reducing the energy consumed for air and gas compression, the technology will
reduce the carbon footprint of industrial and commercial activity in the US and
internationally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Isothermal
compression has been thought unachievable due to the requirement of rapidly
capturing the heat of compression. The Phase I project allowed us to integrate
proven design elements from prior prototypes, along with a complete liquid
recirculation and heat dissipation system, into a single platform. This project
will build upon research performed under the Phase I project to bring our
compression technology to commercial readiness. A 2-year research and
development plan will be executed to address key systems engineering elements of
the technology to achieve commercial ready status. A combination of lab
experiments, thermodynamic modeling, design, engineering, and benchtop
prototyping will be used to develop a commercial ready system design that can be
applied to a broad range of industrial compression applications. Further study
and exploitation of isothermal compression may lead to an ever-evolving field of
application, potentially creating additional areas of research and learning.
