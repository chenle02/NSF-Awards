The objective of this project is to establish an interdisciplinary undergraduate
instructional laboratory. This laboratory will feature equipment and processes
typical of applications in chemical, electrical, and mechanical engineering,
e.g. heat transfer, motor speed and servomechanisms position control robots,
pressure control, phase-lock loop, hydraulic actuator, and temperature and level
control. Resources are provided for new experimental equipment and
instrumentation and also to upgrade and provide modern instrumentation for
existing experiments. A unique feature of this laboratory is the makeup of the
student teams. Three students, one from each of the three disciplines, will work
together on a series of six experiments that expose the students to a broad
range of industrial control applications beyond that which is possible in an
individual departmental laboratory. In addition, the students will have the
opportunity to work on a team whose members have different backgrounds. These
shared laboratory experiences will result in cross fertilization of ideas and
mutual understanding for other disciplines.
