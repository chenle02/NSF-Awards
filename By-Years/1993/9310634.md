9310634 GOWING As part of the U.S. JGOF Arabian Sea Process Study (ASPS), this
study is aimed at understanding how changes in species composition and abundance
in the pelagic community of primary producers, zooplankton grazers, and
microheterotrophic decomposers impacts the biochemical cycling of carbon in the
Arabian Sea. Physical forcing by the monsoon winds triggers seasonal burst of
biological productivity in this region. As in other ecosystems, this production
will involve a temporal succession of species of producers, grazers, and
decomposers-- each with differing capacities to influence carbon production,
respiration, physical repackaging (e.g., shredding, fecal pellet production),
and transport-- and the PIs propose to follow these changes over time.
Therefore, while other investigators involved in the ASPS, will be making
relatively gross chemical measurements of the rates of carbon production,
mineralization, and transport, this study will provide valuable insights into
the actual contributions of specific biophysical and ecological mechanisms
accounting for those rates.
