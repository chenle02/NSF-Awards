The Counterflow Virtual Impactor (CVI) is an inertial separation device for
removing cloud droplets from their gaseous environment for subsequent chemical
and physical analysis. In its present stage of development, the CVI is now being
used by the P.I.'s group in both airborne and ground- based sampling of clouds.
This new grant provides for the further development of the sampling probe and
its application in cloud chemistry studies. There are four objectives. (1) to
test design modifications to extend the range of measurable droplet sizes and to
improve the sharpness of "cut-size" fractionation. (2) To better define the
operating limitations of the device with respect to problems of droplet
distortion, break-up, evaporation, and coalescence, using both experimental and
theoretical approaches. (3) To apply the CVI in studies of dissolved labile
species in cloud droplets, especially of sulfur dioxide. (4) To conduct field
observations in clouds to explore chemical and physical questions that can be
approached by measuring droplet properties as a function of particle size.
