The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of a cost-effective
replacement to x-ray-based imaging devices currently used in dentistry. Several
peer-reviewed scientific studies have suggested a link between pediatric
exposure to x-rays and subsequent development of head tumors. The recent
introduction of CT-based dental imaging systems has actually increased x-ray
exposure, going against the long-established public health policy of reducing
exposure to levels as low as reasonably acceptable (ALARA). This project will
provide a cost-effective alternative to dental x-rays (and hence reduce
pediatric radiation exposure). The device will also improve the depiction of
root disease, which is currently poorly described with x-ray-based systems. The
ability to describe both hard and soft tissues with the instrument is valuable
to oral surgeons, who must consider the cosmetic results of reconstructive
surgery as well as the functional aspects. Commercial impact is demonstrated by
the fact that a chain of 2,500 dental clinics, intrigued by the ability of the
system to guide oral surgery, has already offered to invest in the project.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project involves the development of several
novel and important research activities that address critical requirements of
dental imaging: speed, spatial resolution, avoidance of imaging artifacts due to
oral hardware, safety, spatial footprint, cost, and energy budget. The first
three of these requirements are addressed through the use of MRI gradient pulses
that are hundreds of times faster and stronger than are conventionally used.
Safety, energy and spatial footprint, and cost are addressed with novel coil
manufacturing techniques that reduce fabrication time from months to days.
Energy costs are addressed with novel regenerative schemes similar to those used
in hybrid cars. By the end of the project, a working MRI dental system will have
been constructed, with demonstrations of its effectiveness (on animal
specimens). These steps will ready the product for subsequent human studies that
will be required for approval by the FDA. Follow-on applications of the
technology to non-dental uses (e.g., trauma, cancer detection) are anticipated.
