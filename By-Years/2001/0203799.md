Science Summary: This study will provide laboratory measurements of the
coefficient of friction of natural sediments entering the subduction systems of
Nankai, and Costa Rica. The frictional studies will be conducted in a
combination of ring shear and direct shear experiments at effective confined
stresses between 0.1-50 Mpa. Samples will be characterized by X-ray diffraction
(for bulk and clay mineralogy) grain-size, SEM/EDS geochemistry, and wet
chemistry (for biogenic silica content). The mechanical properties will be
compared with the clay mineralogy to determine the effect of clay minerals on
the coefficient of friction. The study will assess the role of the smectite to
illite transition and opal to quartz reactions on controlling the up-dip limit
of seismogenic activity in subduction zones.&lt;br/&gt;
