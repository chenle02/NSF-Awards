This project includes organization of a workshop to be conducted by NSF with
support from WTEC, Inc. for a preliminary assessment of U.S. and international
R&D activities in spin electronics. This topic has been identified by NSF's
Engineering Directorate as the focus of a potential NSF/ENG research study. The
purpose of the workshop, to be held December 14, 2001, is to gather facts and
opinions from experts from the U.S. research community on how this emerging area
of research should be defined for purposes of such a study, to provide an
overview of U.S. and international R&D activities that fall within this
definition. This information presented at the workshop will be distilled into a
report for NSF/ENG.
