Professor Iwaniec and his postdoctoral associate Dr. Duke will use the methods
of Analytic Number Theory to investigate modular and automorphic forms; in
particular, Dr. Iwaniec will continue his longterm project of refining the
theory of modular forms by means of exponential and character sums. The field of
Analytic Number Theory applies to the discrete realm of the whole numbers the
techniques of Analysis, dependent on the notions of Continuity and Limit,
originating in Calculus. The idea of using continuous methods to investigate the
Discrete is two centuries old, but with the work of the modern analytic number
theorists such as Professor Iwaniec, the field has had a new rebirth.
