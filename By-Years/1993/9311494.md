9311494 Kellert The field of nonlinear dynamics has enjoyed tremendous growth in
recent years. Researchers in the physical, biological, and social sciences have
found the methods and techniques to be useful for investigating linear models
when they break down because of effects such as friction or feedback that
introduce strong nonlinear terms into their idealized systems. The study of
strongly nonlinear systems often reveals highly complex and unpredictable
behavior even in very simple mathematical models, and this phenomenon has been
called "chaos." The scientific investigation of chaotic behavior is popularly
known as "chaos theory." The popularization of chaos theory has also invited
some misunderstandings. Here the philosophy of science can be of some public and
professional help in removing confusion and critically evaluating the claims
made. Further, as a field of investigation which is even now enjoying dramatic
growth and change, nonlinear dynamics provides an excellent situation for
philosophy of science to make contact with scientific knowledge in the very
process of its construction. Under this grant, Dr. Kellert is continuing his
efforts to improve our understanding of the structure of non-linear dynamics,
the new techniques associated with it, and the general impact it will have on
our conception of science. In particular, he is applying an examination of the
modeling techniques used in the study of chaotic systems to the questions of the
structure of scientific theories and the nature of the relationship between
different sciences. ***
