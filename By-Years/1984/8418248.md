Modern communication systems must deal with the problem of multiple users on
systems which use satellites, large-scale computer communication networks, and
local area networks. Usually, either broadcasting or multiple access channels
are involved. Major concerns are what communication rates can be achieved and
how to achieve reliable transmission of information near these rates. This
research attacks some fundamental problems in coding and the flow of information
in communication networks. These problems fall into four research areas: coding
for multiple-user communication channels; error detection coding for these
channels; weight distribution of linear block codes; and achievable rate regions
for communication networks.
