OPP 95-28349 PI: P. SCHLOSSER This proposal requests funds for collection,
measurement, and interpretation of about 200 tracer element (Tritium, Helium,
Oxygen, CFC's) samples in the framework of the planned 1996 Arctic Ocean
submarine cruise. The work will be focused on a broad survey of the upper waters
in the Canadian Basin. Results from a previous submarine cruise (USS PARGO,
1993) demonstrated the feasibility of obtaining high-quality transient tracer
samples from surface stations. The measurements will be used, together with
hydrographic data, to (1) study the transport of shelf waters into the Arctic
halocline, (2) derive evolution, circulation patterns, and mean residence times
of the upper waters in the Canadian Basin, (3) delineate pathways and storage
times of river runoff and sea-ice meltwater in the upper layers of the Canadian
Basin, and (4) to validate Arctic Ocean circulation models.
