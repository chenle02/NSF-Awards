This Presidential Young Investigator awardee will continue to work in three
areas of probability theory: measure-valued diffusions, weakly self-avoiding
random walks on hierarchical lattices, and tree-indexed stochastic processes. In
addition, Evans has started work on problems in the probabilistic aspects of
molecular biology. The award will enable Evans to continue his collaborations in
all areas of his work, and to gain access to needed computational hardware.
