The American Association for Aerosol Research (AAAR) Specialty Conference
"Particulate Matter (PM): Atmospheric Sciences, Exposure and the Fourth
Colloquium on PM and Human Health" was held in Pittsburgh, PA, April 1-4, 2003,
bringing together leading national and international scientists and policy
makers from the atmospheric sciences, exposure and health effects communities to
a common forum to exchange data, results and ideas while engaging in substantive
discussions on current and emerging issues of relevance to air quality. Papers
from this conference will be published in special issues of high-profile widely
available peer-reviewed journals. This project partially supports printing costs
- shared with other private, state and commercial agencies - for one or more
special issues of Conference papers in international scientific journals. The
broader impacts of this activity are in the high profile distribution within the
scientific and policy-making communities of key science findings and seminal
research results within an important interdisciplinary area of atmospheric
science.
