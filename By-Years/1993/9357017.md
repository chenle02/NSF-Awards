9357017 Cyert This is an NSF Young Investigator Award to Dr. Martha S. Cyert.
The overall objective of her research is to elucidate the physiological
functions and substrates of the phosphoprotein phosphatase, calcineurin in the
budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisciae. A major focus of her research will be
to examine the role and mechanism of action of calcineurin in the process of
adaptation to pheromone and recovery from pheromone-induced growth arrest. She
will also examine the possible involvement of calcineurin in regulation of the
cell cycle. Her experimental approaches include techniques of molecular genetics
and biochemistry. ***
