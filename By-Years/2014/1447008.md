The Midwest Geometry Conference is taking place at the University of Oklahoma on
January 17-18, 2015. The conference is designed to enhance both the educational
and the research opportunities of the active community of mathematicians working
in the field of geometry in the Midwest and the surrounding states. This award
supports participation in the conference, which features a wide spectrum of
research topics of current interest. The main aim is to create a focused
environment, conducive to a lively exchange of ideas, in which members of this
regional community can benefit from each other's ideas, and from contact with
leading geometers from outside the region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference
will highlight recent developments and new research directions in a number of
areas that include: p-harmonic geometry, Lie groups and geometric representation
theory, Lp cohomology and nonlinear Hodge theory, geometry and topology of
submanifolds, uniqueness in analysis, geometry and topology, geometric flows,
stable minimal varieties, complex and Riemannian geometry, metric and
differential geometry, conformal geometry, algebraic geometry, geometric measure
theory, partial differential equations, geometric function theory, several
complex variables, symplectic geometry, mathematical physics, and related
problems. Both well-established researchers and promising junior researchers in
the field will present talks at the meeting. More information can be found on
the conference web page&lt;br/&gt;http://www.math.ou.edu/mgc20/
