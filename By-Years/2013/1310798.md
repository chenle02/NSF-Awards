This action funds Jennifer Apell of Massachusetts Institute of Technology to
conduct a research project in Engineering during the summer of 2013 at National
University of Singapore in Singapore. The project title is "Comparison of Food
Web Models Constructed with Traditional and Passive Sampling Data." The host
scientist is Dr. Barry Kelly.

Food web modeling, which allows for the prediction of chemical concentrations in
biota based on concentrations measured in sediments, water, or air, is often
used for remediation decisions and to establish cleanup goals for contaminated
sites. Yet, the accuracy of the model is dependent on how well the contamination
is characterized. Traditional sediment sampling techniques often incorrectly
estimate the concentration of contaminants that are readily accumulated by
biota, which is referred to as the bioavailable fraction. However, passive
samplers, constructed of a polymeric material, can act as surrogate for biota
and have been shown to be a more accurate estimate of the bioavailable
concentration. This research uses contaminant concentrations of polychlorinated
biphenyls, measured using both traditional and passive sampling techniques, in a
Gobas food web model to compare the outcomes as well as evaluate the impact
these sampling techniques have on the model.

Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce. Furthermore, results from this research could lead to
innovation in the way contaminated sediment sites are evaluated and remediated.
Findings will be presented to parties involved in the remediation of Superfund
sites as well as graduate and undergraduate students at MIT.
