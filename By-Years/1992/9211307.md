Although gonadal hormones act on the brain to influence a variety of processes,
it is unclear exactly how these hormones act on the brain to produce their
effects. Recently, induction of the proto-oncogene c-fos has been used as a tool
to identify individual neurons and areas of the brain which are activated by
particular physiological stimuli. The present project proposes to adapt the
technique of c-fos immunocytochemistry to examine which nuclei in the brain are
activated during exposure to the ovarian hormones estrogen and progesterone and
during sexual behavior in the female guinea pig. In addition, the techniques to
double label cells for c-fos and a variety of neuropeptides will be developed so
that it can be ascertained whether particular neuropeptides are contained in the
cells which are activated by ovarian hormones and sexual behavior. This will
give us further insights into exactly how and where these gonadal hormones may
be exerting their effects and will provide the preliminary data to form the
basis of a grant proposal which will examine whether the noradrenergic system
and ovarian hormones interact at a particular subset of neurons to exert their
facilitatory actions on female lordosis behavior.
