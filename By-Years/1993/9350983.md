9350983 Etheridge The project will use computer simulation to provide students
with experience with IR, NMR, and mass spectrum analysis. This will be
particularly advantageous for this community college environment where the costs
of sophisticated instrumentation is prohibitive. Using interactive multimedia
computers, the investigators will develop videodiscs containing both full motion
video and still images as well as interactive courseware to teach proper
sampling and instrumentation techniques. Properly designed interactive
multimedia is a proven instructional method that works in teaching sampling and
instrumentation techniques. ***
