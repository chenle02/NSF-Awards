This project from an EPSCoR state, developing a hardware-in-the-loop simulator
(HILS) for mechatronic systems including robotics and hybrid electric vehicles,
services 2 on-going projects and two new ones.&lt;br/&gt; Remotely controllable
PUMA 560 Robot, &lt;br/&gt; Modeling and Simulation of HEV's,&lt;br/&gt;
Remotely Controllable HILS for direct drive robot configuration, and &lt;br/&gt;
Remotely Controllable HILS for geared robot configuration.&lt;br/&gt;The
projects involve the remote control of an open architecture robot. PUMA, a
staple learning robot, services introductory robotics. The project allows and
encourages conducting different remote experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impact: The platform services the wider Alaska community allowing hands-on work
in courses that are currently limited to only theory, thus providing strong
outreach educational opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;
