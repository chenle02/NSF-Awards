Abstract 9601950 Gaisser This is an Academic Research Infrastructure (ARI) award
to upgrade the instrumentation for the South Pole Air Shower Experiment (SPASE)
and to provide analysis equipment for the home laboratory at Bartol Research
Institute at the University of Delaware. SPASE has three main scientific goals:
to search for sources of ultra high energy gamma rays; by working in conjunction
with the Antarctic Muon and Neutrino Detector Array (AMANDA), which is a
detector buried deep in the ice below South Pole, to determine the elemental
composition of very high energy cosmic rays; and to provide pointing calibration
for AMANDA. The equipment funded by this grant will be especially useful in the
composition studies, an area of the highest priority in the cosmic ray physics
community. SPASE is a collaborative effort of Bartol and the University of Leeds
(UK). Funds for this award is being provided by both the Antarctic Aeronomy and
Astrophysics Program and the Office of Science and Technology Infrastructure.
