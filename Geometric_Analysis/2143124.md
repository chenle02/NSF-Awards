Minimizing the area functional is one of the most famous examples of geometric
variational problems in mathematics and it has had a major impact both in
mathematics and in physics. However, for several natural phenomena, the area
functional is only a first approximation. In order to capture microstructures,
most models in the sciences use directionally dependent functionals, referred to
as anisotropic energies. Ever since the introduction of anisotropic energies by
Gibbs in the 19th century to model crystals, they have been extensively applied
in material sciences and engineering, motivating seminal works in geometric
analysis. However, since anisotropic energies are not invariant under
translations and rotations, they don?t enjoy the conservation laws of the area
functional, which makes them significantly more complicated to study. The PI
will advance the anisotropic minimal surfaces theory. Understanding existence,
regularity, uniqueness and stability of solutions to anisotropic geometric
variational problems plays a major role in analysis, geometry, topology and
physics. The PI will also conduct vertically integrated educational activities
tied with the research activities. In particular, undergraduate and graduate
students will be exposed to the problems and techniques of this project via the
organization of seminars, conferences, and a summer school.

The PI will study existence, regularity, uniqueness and stability properties of
anisotropic minimal surfaces. The existence of anisotropic minimal surfaces in
Riemannian manifolds will require extending the min-max theory. In order to
determine the regularity of anisotropic minimal surfaces, the PI will study the
related geometric nonlinear elliptic PDEs. In addition to the stationary
configurations, this research will shed light on the anisotropic Brakke flow and
its approximation, through the analysis of the related parabolic PDEs. This
project will also address the uniqueness of critical points of the anisotropic
isoperimetric problem and investigate the stability properties of the Wulff
shapes. Furthermore, part of this research will be devoted to optimal transport,
with an emphasis on the regularity and stability properties of branching
dynamics.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
