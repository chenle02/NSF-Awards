There is considerable geological and geophysical evidence that downslope
sediment deformations occur due to creep on or within many submarine slopes. The
rate of creep is primarily controlled by the configuration of the slope and the
sediment type. The objective of this research program is to understand the
mechanisms of creep and creep rupture and be able to predict creep deformations
both quantitatively as well as qualitatively. To achieve this goal four distinct
phases of work are proposed: a geological/geophysical analysis, a laboratory
testing program to determine creep related material properties and to verify
constructive models, development of a finite element procedure to analyze creep
deformations, and laboratory physical models to study deformation patterns under
simplifed conditions.
