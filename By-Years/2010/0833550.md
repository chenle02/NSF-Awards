France ? U.S. Young Engineering Scientists Nanotechnology Symposium
2008&lt;br/&gt;0833550&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award to Duke University will
support a nanotechnology workshop to spur collaboration between researchers in
France and in the United States. The three-day workshop will be held at the
French Embassy in Washington, DC in July of 2008 and will include the
participation of thirty U.S.-based researchers and an equivalent number of
French researchers, all at early stages in their careers. The workshop has three
thrusts: ?Beyond Silicon? Nano electronics, Medical and Health Applications, and
Societal Impacts. The U.S. participants are mostly at the assistant professor
level. Partner funding is provided by the French government to support the
participation of the French researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The senior
researchers who are organizing the conference include the principal investigator
Mark Wiesner from Duke University, Jim Yardley from Columbia University, Barbara
Harthorn from UCSB, Dominique Vuillaume from the Insitut d?Electronique, Micro-
électronique et Nanotechologie - CNRS, Bertrand Foucade from Université Joseph
Fourier de Grenoble, and Jean-Yves Bottero from the Centre Européen de Recherche
et d?Enseignement de Géosciences de l?Environnement-
CNRS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
