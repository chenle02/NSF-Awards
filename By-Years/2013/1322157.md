This project will support approximately 10-15 U.S.-based graduate students to
attend the 11th USENIX Symposium on File and Storage Technology (FAST), which is
scheduled to take place February 12-15, 2013. FAST is a leading forum for
innovative research in storage systems, bringing together researchers and
practitioners from both industry and academia. Topics include reliability,
performance, mobility, power management, measurement, and other areas germane to
file and storage systems. Participation in leading conferences is an extremely
important part of the graduate school experience, providing the opportunity to
interact with more senior researchers and to be exposed to leading edge work.
