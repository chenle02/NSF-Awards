This comparative case study of the influence of community participation in
environmental management, for the Valdez oil terminal in Alaska and the Sullom
Voe oil terminal in the Shetland Islands, will contribute to several
underdeveloped areas in the environmental policy literature: empirical studies
of the mechanisms through which communities can contribute to environmental
management, the effects of decisions involving national and sub-national
regulatory bodies, and the relationship of community involvement to atrophy of
vigilance in organizations. It will generate two detailed examples of how
national and sub-national styles of regulation interact in shaping a specific
set of policy choices and explore the processes and institutional arrangements
through which various groups have debated proposals for and influenced
deployment and maintenance of environmental safeguards at the two terminals
throughout their histories. The study proposes that organizations responsible
for pollution prevention are vulnerable to an atrophy of vigilance in which
environmental safeguards are reduced over time to save costs, but that
incorporation of the concerns of local communities into the environmental
management process tends to counteract this phenomenon. Detailed examination of
institutional arrangements, the substance and outcomes of public policy debates,
and company and public records is necessary in order to measure whether or not
and when organizational atrophy of vigilance occurs. Results from the research
will provide a detailed empirical basis for theory development and hypothesis
testing in the three areas of the environmental policy literature identified
above. Results will be reported in articles and presentations.
