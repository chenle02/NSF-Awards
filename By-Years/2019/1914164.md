The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to empower American
workers to compete with low-wage workers abroad by providing a lower cost, more
flexible way to fabricate complex aerospace structures than labor-intensive
manual drilling. Increases in global demand for aircraft are putting pressure on
large Original Equipment Manufacturers to increase rates of production. For
example: A large aircraft manufacturer increased production of one of their
aircraft from 47 to 52 aircraft per month in 2018 and is anticipated to continue
to increase this rate to 57 in March 2019. These rate increases are not just
putting pressure on the OEMs but also on their sub-tier suppliers who must
increase their rates as well. Many of these smaller companies operate on tight
budgets in rural areas with smaller employment pools. They are experiencing
difficulty keeping up. By enhancing American worker productivity and quality
with robotic systems that rural manufacturers can afford, this project will help
keep quality manufacturing jobs in America for the next
generation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
Phase I project will design, build and validate a mobile, agile robotic drilling
system for aircraft manufacturing. This system will be capable of interfacing
with and operating on existing aircraft assembly jigs broadly used in the
industry for manual drilling. The system will deliver 90% reduction in drilling
cycle time from 60 to six seconds per hole and eliminate repeat motion injury
from hand drilling, while eliminating hole quality and positional accuracy
defects associated with hand drilled holes. The system will seek to implement
human-robot collaboration through a speed-and-separation monitoring
approach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
