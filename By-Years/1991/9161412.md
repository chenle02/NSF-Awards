This project addresses machine cutting of threads, a key step in reliably
manufacturing many products. The research intent is improving the process for
enhanced accuracy. This will be accomplished by using nonlinear piezoactuators
controlled by neural nets to obtain 5 arc minutes accuracy in positioning a
cutting tool. Specifically, in Phase I, neural networks will learn to control a
highly nonlinear set of piezoactuators as simulated on a computer, whereas in
Phase II, a machine tool will be instrumented to demonstrate the concept in
hardware. Tool positioning information will be supplied by a laser measurement
device already available. There are many types of metal cutting operations where
this technology could be applied to reduce waste and improve quality. The
utility of the neural network is apparent since it can learn to compensate for
many repeatable variables in the machining operation and also compensate for
tool wear.
