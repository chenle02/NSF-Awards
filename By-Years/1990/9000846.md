This award provides funds to the Department of Biology at the State University
College at Buffalo to establish a research experiences SITE in aquatic biology
for 8 undergraduate students during the summer 1990. A particular effort will be
made to recruit minorities and women. Each student will be matched with one of
several participating faculty members and will conduct an 8-week project in one
of the following areas: effects of UV-B radiation on metabolism of Cyanobacteria
(blue-green algae); effects of a planktonic predator on zooplankton communities;
survey of bacteria that are pathogenic to fish in fish, water, and sediments in
polluted waters; occurrence of fish parasites in polluted environments; and
determination of habitat preferences in Lake Erie fishes. Experience will be
obtained in field sampling as well as in laboratory investigations. Research
skills will be developed through a series of planned seminars and through
interactions with faculty mentors. Students will present the results of their
research in final written reports and orally in a concluding symposium.
