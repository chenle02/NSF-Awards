*** 96-60438 Shah This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project
will explore the use of semiconductor photodetectors to replace photomultiplier
tubes in nuclear bore hole logging instrumentation. Advantages are expected in
more compact design, low power requirements, increased ruggedness, and
insensitivity to magnetic fields. Lead iodide is a promising detector material
because its wide bandgap allows low noise operation at room temperature as well
as at elevated temperatures. These detectors have very good optical quantum
efficiency and low power requirements. Thus, lead iodide photodetectors coupled
to scintillators are thought to be promising gamma-ray spectrometers for well
logging. Phase I will demonstrate the feasibility of this concept by performing
in-depth characterization of these photodetectors. Commercial applications are
expected in detectors for bore hole instrumentation and in various process
control systems and nondestructive testing of materials. Other potential uses
may be found in health care treatments and in scientific research. ***
