9623972 Wirtz The main research objective of this CAREER grant is to establish a
prominent program with a focus on the dynamics of complex fluids and
macromolecules. Novel experimental, numerical, and theoretical methods are being
developed to investigate the structure and dynamics of complex fluids and
macromolecular assemblies These experimental methods involve the measurement of
the structural and rheological properties of either individual aggregates or
molecules (microscopy) or of an ensemble of colloids/macromolecules (scattering
and rheology). These experimental methods include (i) magnetic tweezers to
micro-manipulate individual biological macromolecules such as DNA and proteins
in the bulk and near interfaces, (ii) high-resolution fluorescence microcopy to
image the Brownian motion of individual biological macromolecules, vesicles, and
colloidal aggregates (iii) diffusive wave spectroscopy to probe the collective
dynamics and the quiescent micro-rheology of concentrated colloidal suspensions,
microemulsions, and polymer solutions. To analyze these scattering and
microscopy experiments, Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations, as well
as stochastic equations of motion are being developed to describe the non-
equilibrium dynamics of complex fluids and macromolecules in external force
fields. %%% This research will provide a direct test of theories of gel
electrophoresis and will help improve current theories of gene therapy and
polymer-based drug-delivery systems. These new tools will also offer a direct
way to probe conformational and transport-properties changes induced by DNA-DNA,
protein-DNA, and protein-protein interactions, which have implications on the
design, development, and testing of new drugs. ***
