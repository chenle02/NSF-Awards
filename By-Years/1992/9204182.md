This research is concerned with the homological aspects of finite dimensional
algebras. The principal investigator will examine several dimensions which
measure the homological complexity of an algebra in order to obtain precise
structural descriptions of higher syzygies, and to describe and exploit
repetitive homological behavior. There will be a heavy emphasis on
crossconnections to related areas. In particular, the principal investigator
will seek replacements for the Tarsy conjecture on the global dimension of
classical orders over discrete valuation domains. This research is in the
general area of ring theory. A ring is an algebraic object having both an
addition and a multiplication defined on it. Although the additive operation
satisfies the commutative law, the multiplicative operation is not required to
do so. An example of a ring for which multiplication is not commutative is the
collection of nxn matrices over the integers. The study of noncommutative rings
has become an important part of algebra because of its increasing significance
to other branches of mathematics and physics.
