9320513 Horowitz This is a research planning grant, the first phase of a study
of the positions of professional and consumer groups on whether there should be
representatives of the public on boards of medical practice. It will employ a
range of methodological approaches, including interviews, analysis of documents,
and field observations from public meetings. From these diverse sources, a
quantitative questionnaire will be developed that will be the heart of a major
research study. Among the chief policy- related aims of the project are to
increase our presently limited knowledge about the functioning of medical
regulatory boards, and to explore means of making these boards more accountable
to the public. The research will explore new intellectual territory in the
sociological sub-disciplines of professions, public regulation, and authority
relations. %%% This work is supported under the Research Planning Grant program
for women scientists and engineers, and thus among its chief aims are to assist
a promising woman social scientist to prepare for a major research project, and
to expand the scientific personnel of the United States. The results of this
study will be valuable for policy-makers attempting to revamp the American
system of health care delivery over the coming years. ***
