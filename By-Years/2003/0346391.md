In humans and other mammals, marked daily variations in behavioral and
physiological function are generated by endogenous neural clocks, which are
synchronized with the light environment through both direct and indirect neural
projections from the retina to the brain. Previous work has shown that bright
light is necessary to reset the phase of circadian clocks, and cells with
matching sensitivity to light have been identified in the retina. The present
project explores novel actions of very dim light (less intense than dim
moonlight) on the circadian system. Counter to expectations, preliminary studies
show that dim nocturnal illumination results in marked changes in circadian
function: in its presence, animals more readily adjust to seasonal changes in
daylength; they entrain their rhythms more successfully to non 24-h days and
they reorganize their circadian rhythms into multiple components under bimodal
24-h light:dark:light:dark cycles. In a series of behavioral studies, this
project explores the hypothesis that dim light exerts its effects by altering
the coupling, or interactions, between component circadian oscillators. Further,
the investigators examine the wavelength and intensity requirements of dim light
to assess the retinal photoreceptors that mediate its effects. Finally, these
effects are examined in animals with lesions of the intergeniculate leaflet of
the thalamus through which midbrain visual projections ascend to the circadian
pacemaker. These studies may suggest new avenues for rapid manipulation of human
circadian rhythms. These findings may be of value in optimizing human
performance during shift-work, in trans-meridian and space travel, and in other
contexts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
