Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) programs are one of the best
recruiting tools for Geoscience-related graduate programs, and successful
management of these programs is a high priority. This award supports a workshop
that will bring most of the Directorate of Geoscience (GEO) REU PI's together to
discuss best practices in a changing REU landscape and to discuss common
community issues, such as combining resources, creating common evaluation or
application tools, and assessing the combined impact of REU-type programs in the
Geosciences. Participants will include the leaders of REU Site programs
supported by the Divisions of Ocean Sciences, Earth Sciences, Atmospheric and
Geospace Sciences and Polar Programs.
