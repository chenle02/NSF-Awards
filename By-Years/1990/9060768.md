The objective of this proposed program is to develop a deposition technique for
a silver-based high-reflectance coating which will exhibit long-term corrosion
resistance under typical terrestrial operating conditions. The experimental
program will be directed towards identifying specific alloying and overcoating
materials, establishing effective stoichiometric ratios of the alloy components
resulting in enhanced optical performance and improved corrosion resistance, and
developing efficient techniques for the deposition of the coating layers.
