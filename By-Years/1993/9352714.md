Organic chemistry and biochemistry students will construct, manipulate, and
analyze computer generated visual models of chemical systems on a frequent and
routine basis. These exercises will make use of computer-based molecular
modeling tools and compatible chemistry modeling software. The workstations will
enable faculty to lead modeling sessions for large groups of students, and will
ensure easy access for students engaged in independent modeling exercises. This
project is unique because it does not view computational chemistry as an end in
itself. Rather, state-of-the-art computational techniques will be used to
develop student "chemical intuition", and to provide a means for employing
modeling, with an emphasis on structure visualization and analysis, as a
learning activity.
