9401167 Concus This award supports mathematical research on capillarity theory
and geometrical questions for liquid bridges, for (asymmetric) pendent liquid
drops and for slowly rotating fluid masses. Exotic behavior for surfaces of
curvature type in wedges and proboscis domains and a-priori curvature estimates
for H-graphs will also be studied. Some of these investigations are to be
conducted in connection with space experiments, in cooperation with NASA and
with the European Space Agency. Others relate to the joint Stanford-Lockheed
Gravity-B experiment to use orbiting gyroscopes in a test of the general
relativity theory and a Stanford experiment of the equivalence principle between
gravitational and inertial mass. These studies will include reference
calculations, but the underlying substance of the work will be mathematical. The
formal theory is being developed from a completely rigorous point of view
involving analysis of solutions of partial differential equations from a
geometric perspective. The resulting experiments can be regarded as precise
tests of the underlying physical hypotheses on which the mathematical formalism
is based. The physical problems continue, in turn, to suggest new mathematical
questions. ***
