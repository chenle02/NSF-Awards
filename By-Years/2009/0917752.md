This award from the Division of Chemistry supports a unique international
meeting, Chemical Sciences and Society Symposia (CS3). The CS3 will convene
eminent high level researchers from each country to explore frontier chemistry
research as well as its potential application to global problems. The global
challenge identified for this pilot meeting is solar
energy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CS3 is a partnership with the funding societies and
professional associations from the United States, China, Japan, United Kingdom
and Germany. The series has the potential to be of great value to the global
chemistry enterprise and to the world at large.
