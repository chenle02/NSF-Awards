A major issue in sensory systems processing is how a relevant signal is
extracted from distracting background noise in the environment. Hearing is
excellent for detecting certain highly relevant signals, such as communication
signals, and we know little about the neural mechanisms involved. This project
uses a combination of neurophysiological recording with computational modeling
to determine how single cells can detect features of an auditory signal.
Computational techniques are used to change particular features of the sounds
presented to the ear, and to analyze the responses of the cells. Spatial and
temporal patterns of activity from single cells are compared to the patterns of
activity coming into those cells from auditory nerve fibers, in a part of the
brainstem called the anteroventral cochlear nucleus. These experiments test
hypotheses about how much "feature detection" can be done at this level of the
auditory system, and how much of this depends on analysis of the "spectral
shape" of combined frequencies in a complex signal. Results from this study will
be important beyond auditory perception to studies of sensory processing in
general, to understanding how the brain integrates a wide range of simultaneous
activity, and to better design of electronic devices for artificial listening
and auditory aids.
