9320824 Bielak This project investigates the seismic performance of earth and
rock-fill dams, focusing on the coupling effects between the dam and its
support, as well as on the effects of the spatial variability of the incoming
seismic waves. Current design methods generally assume a rigid dam foundation,
whereas observations of the behavior of earth and rock-fill dams during
earthquakes suggest that canyon-dam interaction can significantly influence
their seismic response. The main objective is to elucidate the conditions under
which dam- canyon interaction effects are practically significant, and to
develop methods that can be used in design and remediation practice for
calculating these interaction effects. The projects involves computer
simulations with two- and three-dimensional models which reflect realistic
conditions. In as much as the main focus is on gaining a clear understanding of
the mechanism by which the dynamic coupling between the dam and the canyon
affects the seismic response of the dam, attention is confined largely to dams
constructed of either dry or dense saturated granular soils and cohesive soils
that are not susceptible to liquefaction. Some consideration, however, is given
to seismic liquefaction evaluation for cases in which loose saturated sands and
cohesionless silts are present. ***
