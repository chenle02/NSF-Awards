Faculty in the Departments of Biology and Microbiology are undertaking a
significant enhancement of courses in Molecular Biology, Microbiology, and
Genetics. The vehicle by which this advance is being achieved is the
introduction of recombinant DNA techniques into selected courses, one of which
is entirely new. Concomitant with this is a greater integration of the teaching
activities of the Biology and Microbiology Departments. The degree in which
recombinant DNA technology has advanced in recent years makes it quite feasible
to teach techniques of gene manipulation to advanced undergraduate students.
This provides both a body of knowledge and technical skills which should enhance
the competencies of these undergraduates. It also provides the necessary basis
on which many of the undergraduates could make a decision regarding further
study in graduate school. As recombinant DNA technology permeates more areas of
biology and is applied to an expanding number of disparate problems, knowledge
of it becomes increasingly necessary in the undergraduate curriculum. The
equipment provided through this award will enable the faculty to employ their
biotechnology skills more effectively in their teaching -- to the great
advantage of the curriculum.
