With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor Plummer at Trinity
University is investigating the effects engendered on an aromatic system by
increasing the ring strain. The focus of this research is to distort the normal
planar geometry of aromatic systems by appending cyclopentene units to the
aromatic rings. This distortion will alter the pi electron density, which is
manifested by a detectable change in chemical reaction characteristics. Further,
protons in the `Bay Region` of these perturbed polynuclear aromatic ring systems
should exhibit marked NMR chemical shifts as a result of steric compression.
Aromatic compounds are ubiquitous in feed stocks from crude oil. Thus, finding
new ways to control the chemical characteristic of them would have widespread
usefulness in industry. This research will probe ways to alter the chemistry of
aromatic systems in a predictable manner by imposing ring strain. This research
is to be conducted at an undergraduate institution.
