For over a hundred years, anthropologists, comparative anatomists and
paleontologists have sought evidence from the fossil record and from; studies on
the morphology of nonhuman primates in order to understand how, why, and when
the ancestors of living humans became habitual accomplished bipeds. Early in
this endeavor it seemed that the answer to this question ;might be that the
practice of brachiation, or arm-swinging, by human ancestors preadapted and
predisposed them for bipedalism. Recent information on the natural behaviors of
apes lend little support to this theory, land new attempts must be made to
discover the probable behavior of the form which gave rise to humans. Since the
fossil record currently provides limited data bearing directly on this question,
and the data which do exist have led to contradictory interpretations about the
stages through which the earliest humans passed on their path to becoming
accomplished bipeds, emphasis must be placed on determining the functional
significance of: (1) osteological features characterizing the oldest fossil
hominid, (2) anatomical similarities between humans and nonhuman primates, and
(3) those anatomical traits that are unique to humans. Specific hypotheses of
muscle function, and the ways in which bony changes might influence such
function, can only be tested by in vivo physiological techniques. The proposed
study will apply telemetered recording of muscle activity (combined, when
appropriate, with force-place and kinematic analyses) in nonhuman primates
during regular arboreal locomotor behavior, terrestrial movement, and bipedalism
in order to establish the actual roles of individual muscle in these behaviors.
In so doing, a better understanding of changes that might have preadapted or
predisposed a human ancestor for bipedality is sought. The same methodology will
be applied in humans to a study of uniquely human muscles during a wide range of
bipedal activities. Combined data nonhuman primates and humans will provide a
sounder basis for interpreting the differences in muscle attachment,
orientation, and size that can be deduced from fossil evidence of early hominid
skeletal structure.
