This two-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research in population biology
involves Jay Hestbeck of the University of Massachusetts, Kenneth Pollack of
North Carolina State University, and the research group led by Roger Pradel at
the Centre d'Ecologie Fonctionnelle et Evolution in Montpellier, France. The
objective of their research is to estimate and model recruitment of young
animals within a metapopulation system. The ecological setting involves multiple
locations where adult animals reproduce and among which adults may move. Young
animals undergo a period of maturation during which they must survive and
possibly move to a different location to enter the breeding population as an
adult. Current studies and models for population dynamics do not include this
dispersal component. Through the combined efforts of these two complementary
research groups, new models will be developed that include animal dispersal.
