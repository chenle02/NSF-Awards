This proposal is a central element of the Tracer Release Experiment (TRE), a
process study of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE). The PI will
release and track a suite of mid- depth floats. These will be released in
conjunction with the release of measured amounts of a stable chemical species.
At selected intervals, the distributions of the chemical will be measured. Over
the duration of the experiment, the floats will be tracked to provide a
continuous record of the tracer history.
