This project concerns research in number theory. Classical problems in number
theory include questions about the distribution of prime numbers,
representations of a number as a sum of squares, and counting the number of
lattice points in a circle or polygon in the plane. These questions have
applications to such varied fields as cryptography, integer programming,
complexity theory, and numerical integration. This research project will study
several related questions through the unifying perspective of Dirichlet series
in several complex variables. Integrated with the research activities will be
continued mentorship of high school, undergraduate, and graduate students. The
investigator will introduce these students to research-level mathematics through
supervised research projects.

This research project will investigate number-theoretic problems in four
different areas, unified by the common theme of naturally occurring multiple
Dirichlet series. The research in the first area, zeta functions of
prehomogeneous vector spaces (PVS), is particularly timely due to the recent
resurgence of interest in this field. A second topic is the study certain period
integrals of Eisenstein series. Arithmetic consequences include explicit
formulas for representation numbers of quadratic forms, which can in turn be
reinterpreted as formulas for counting integral points on certain flag
varieties. In a third direction, hyperbolic Fourier expansions of Eisenstein
series motivate the construction of different type of multiple Dirichlet series
which count totally positive elements in the ring of integers of a totally real
number field. This can be reinterpreted as a lattice point counting problem in
irrational polytopes. Fourthly, the project will study new types of subgroup
growth and subring growth zeta functions. While this work should stimulate new
research in subgroup growth, the initial motivation for study of these objects
comes from complexity theory and lattice cryptography.
