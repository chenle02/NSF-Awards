A different algebraic equation (DAE) is an implicit differential equation
relating various quantities, their rates of changes, and control and source
terms. DAEs are the natural way in which to describe many industrial and
scientific processes. A DAE formulation often provides the quicker model
development and more accurate modeling than when using explicit equations.
However, using the DAE formulation on complex problems poses a number of
technical challenges. Recently, it has been shown that a number of fundamental
problems in control and systems theory including observer design, model
identification, and failure detection can be naturally viewed as problems
involving DAEs. In the past this has mainly been examined for lower dimensional
linear systems. It is proposed to examine these problems for large complex
nonlinear systems. In particular, systems with delays and mixed discrete
continuous dynamics will be examined. Both theory and practical, robust,
numerical algorithms will be developed. Particular questions to be examined
include model identification, failure detection, observer design, system
simulation, and fault isolation. The results will be applied to applications
from the aerospace, chemical processing, and other industries.
