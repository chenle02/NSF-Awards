This project provides a transition from Phase II to Phase III of Project
2061:Education for a Changing Future, AAAS's major reform effort for K-12
education in science, mathematics, and Technology. Phase II focussed on the
teacher enhancement aspects of Project 2061. The transition year will focus on
activities to develop 1) alternative curriculum models; 2) blueprints for action
on equity, higher education, parental/community involvement, and interactions
between science and other school subjects; 3) leadership models; 4) a resource
base; 5) computer-based curriculum design; and 6) implementation at Vanguard
sites.
