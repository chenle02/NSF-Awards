In population biology the estimation of parameters such as effective population
size and migration rate is crucial. The rapid increase in the collection of
population samples of genetic data allows investigation of patterns and rates of
migration among geographically subdivided populations with much greater power.
Present estimation methods either assume knowledge of the exact genealogical
tree of ancestry of the sampled genes or neglect all the information about this
tree. Taking the uncertainty in the estimate of the genealogy into account is
the major challenge for a proper statistical analysis of these data. The
proposed research will use maximum likelihood to infer these rates and patterns,
using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to sum over all possible genealogies
when computing the likelihood. Methods will be extended to multiple populations:
(1) for a number of different models of population structure, and (2) for
different kinds of data, such as molecular sequences. Computer programs for
estimating patterns of migration will be developed and produced. They will be of
interest in ecology, conservation biology, and anthropology.
