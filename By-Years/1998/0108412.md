DEB-0108412 - Lovell Environmental disturbance by such factors as storms, fires
and predators, is a pervasive force impacting the diversity and organization of
organism communities. Because of competitive interactions, higher organism
typically have their peak species diversity at intermediate disturbance levels.
Microbial communities are much more dependent upon positive interactions than on
competition, and are organized in mutualistic consortia. The interactions among
species in these consortia facilitate vital ecological functions, such as
organic matter decomposition and nutrient cycling, and are highly dependent on
the physical structure of undisturbed sediments and on modifications of this
structure by the organisms. Among the most dramatic modifications by the
resident microbiota is biofilm formation. The biofilms stabilize consortia and
provide homeostasis for the microorganisms within them. We predict that unlike
higher organisms, the mutualistic nature of sediment microbial assemblages will
be seriously disrupted by disturbance and will take several experimental
approaches to test this theory. We seek to integrate the impacts of disturbance
on sediment microbiota into the theoretical and empirical framework of
disturbance effects on higher organism communities. This would serve both fields
by providing much needed theoretical underpinnings to an important aspect of
microbial ecology.
