Increasing the Minority Scientist Pool is a three-year project (1991-1994)
which consists of an intensive academic support program coupled with an early
research experience. It is designed to involve 15 minority students each year in
an undergraduate program that leads to a career in the laboratory sciences.
Eight project students will major in chemistry, six in biology, and one in
physics. While enrolled in a degree- seeking program, project students will be
involved in an academic support system which includes counseling, tutoring,
study groups, support classes and cultural enhancing activities. All students
will be assigned to mentors who will engage them in a summer research project at
the end of the first academic year. During the remainder of the project years,
mentors will engage project students in research projects during the academic
years and summers. The progress of project students will be closely monitored
throughout the project.
