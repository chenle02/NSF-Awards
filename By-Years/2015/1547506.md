Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) have become understood and widely used in
technical fields, especially those relating to information security and privacy,
as necessary to protect human subjects in computer studies. However, IRBs do not
address all issues. This workshop explores the notion of a broader ethical
review procedure in white papers, opinion pieces, and public comments. This
multidisciplinary workshop develops how organizations can develop ethical review
boards for data uses outside the Common Rule.

The workshop considers how ethical guidelines, based on the foundational Belmont
principles for human subject research, can help entities make careful decisions
to balance data experimentation against risks to individual privacy and civil
liberties broadly. It surveys lessons drawn from the medical research ethics
community and existing institutional review boards (IRBs). The purpose of this
workshop is to bring together experts in academia and industry, as well as
ethicists, privacy officials, and government regulators, to develop a blueprint
for ethical reviews for computer science research, and provide guidance to those
who might seek an ethical opinion to engage in important research, and find a
balance to promote research.
