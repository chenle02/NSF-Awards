The Chemistry Department will purchase computers and software for molecular
modeling, electronic modeling, data manipulation, graphing, interfacing
hardware, and output devices. This equipment will be used to transform the
traditional introductory chemistry course to an innovative, interactive approach
to the discipline. The goals are to promote the following: (l) more student
discovery of chemical trends and relationships, (2) more student decisions about
the chemical questions being asked and the data being collected, (3) more
student/ instructor interaction. The equipment will acquire and manipulate data,
simulate experiments, chemical reactions, and other dynamic processes, and serve
as a chemical tutor.. The creative use of these attributes of the computer will
blur the distinction between lecture and laboratory.
