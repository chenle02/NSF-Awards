The research involves asymptotic problems in statistics, mostly in
nonparametric inference. Observational studies will be analyzed using bandwidth-
matching. The choice of smoothing parameters for estimating a conditional
quantile function by kernel and nearest-neighbor methods will be studied.
Change- point problems include developing a nonparametric control chart,
estimating a two-phase linear regression and detecting a signal of constant
intensity in part of a noisy field. In the area of Bayesian nonparametrics with
Dirichlet priors, one of the goals is the development of a program package for
approximating the posterior distribution in quantal response analysis by a
Markov chain simulation technique. Research will also be conducted on the
problems of inference in linear regression based on truncated and censored data.
