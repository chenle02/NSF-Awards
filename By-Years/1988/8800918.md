Graduate student Jeffrey Jensen proposes a study of the marine percifom family
Embiotocidae, an ecologically important component of the North Pacific nearshore
fauna. The project will determine the evolutionary relationships among species
in the family, and will document patterns of morphological variation in feeding
structures. These functional variations will then be interpreted in the
framework of their ecological roles and evolutionary histories. The proposed
study has broad implications for evolutionary biology and functional studies. By
combining functional, ecological, and evolutionary data, Mr. Jensen will gain
insight into functional convergence between separate lineages, and the
constraints placed on morphology by inheritance. The ease with which functional
structures have changed to suit their ecological roles is an issue of interest
across a wide spectrum of taxonomic groups, and this project will represent a
noteworthy case study.
