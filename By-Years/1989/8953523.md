CAEME seeks to stimulate and accelerate the use of computers in
electromagnetics education. Steps for achieving this include: 1) developing a
catalog to include brief descriptions of available software in all areas of
electromagnetics education, 2) document and publish in a standard format some of
the available software, 3) stimulate research to create new systems and tools
for improving the quality of undergraduate electromagnetics education, 4)
provide a mechanism for distribution of the software. Support for this project
from other sources is expected to be an approximate match for the SF funds.
