This investigation of a computer based language processing formalism will focus
on characteristics that facilitate the implementation of linguistic models. It
should not only be possible to embed such models in the system concisely, but
the resulting system should be computationally efficient. In order to achieve
the form of the restrictions determined by the requirement that it be suitable
for expressing natural language models. In earlier work, the investigator
identified several features common to a range of constrained grammar formalisms,
despite their very different notations. These features concern restrictions of
the form of the derivation process, and appear to indicate that each of these
formalisms is amenable to efficient parallel parsing algorithms. The research
will now formalize the common features of these systems and of their processing
implications, using results from research on parallel models of computation.
This should lead to a deeper understanding of the desirable computational
properties inherent in theories developed by computational linguistics.
