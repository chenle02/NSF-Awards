The Exploratorium proposes to conduct a staff development program to help 36
museum professionals expand their exhibit development capabilities. Our intent
is to conduct a 2 year program in which eighteen participants a year will take
part. Each year, Eploratorium senior exhibit development staff and quest faculty
from other science museums, will hold a one-week seminar; this will be followed
by a four- week internship at the Exploratorium. The year would conclude with a
week long seminar on the educational and programmatic use of exhibits. A maximum
of two persons from any single museum would be allowed to participate in the
program enabling us to serve a minimum of 18 and a maximum of 36 museums from
around the United States. Candidates would have to demonstrate an appropriate
level of professional experience and committment. A significant aspect of the
program is the individual attention the Exploratorium will provide by organizing
the internships to occur in six consecutive sessions, each limited to three
participants. A senior exhibit developer will act as a mentor/advisor for the
participants and help them experience the process of turning ideas into variable
exhibits. Participants will be able to make use of the exhibit staff, shop
resources and the participating museums would obtain a core set nof 20 exhibits;
these would be selected from a matrix of over 100 possible exhibits. In this way
museums would aquire refined and innovative exhibits which would best serve
their individual pedegogical and technical needs. These exhibits would be built
by Exploratorium staff with the directinvolvement of the program participants.
Selections would be made during a week-long consultation visit with
Exploratorium staff.
