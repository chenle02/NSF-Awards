Students in precalculus and calculus are benefiting from a laboratory equipped
with Hyundai computers running MathCad. The curriculum that this lab supports
allows students to explore and better understand mathematical concepts and
emphasizes more realistic and interesting problems. The institution will
contribute an amount equal to the award.
