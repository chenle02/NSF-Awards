NSF supported a Special Session on Hybrid Systems as part of the Eighteenth
Workshop on the Mathematical Foundations of Programming Semantics (MFPS 18),
March 20-25, 2002 at Tulane University. This meeting was also held concurrently
with the Clifford Lectures of the Mathematics Department at Tulane University,
which focused on mathematical logic and computer science. Research in areas
relevant to MFPS focus in theoretical computer science, programming semantics,
including domain theory, logics such as temporal logic and linear logic,
applications of category theory to semantics, and non-standard set theories. The
Special Session on Hybrid Systems included an invited address and talks on
special topics in hybrid systems. NSF funds supported this session, which
enabled the participation of the keynote and invited speakers, and enabled
widened opportunity for participation and inclusion of graduate students.
