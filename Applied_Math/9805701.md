Dockery 9805701 The investigator develops differential equation models to study
heterogeneous biofilms in fluid-saturated porous media. The underlying question
is how biofilm interactions affect spatial heterogeneities in the biofilm. Of
specific interest are causes of observed heterogeneities, whether heterogeneity
is purely a hydrodynamic effect, whether cell-cell communication through
chemical signaling can be responsible for some of the heterogeneity, and whether
species competition can be a contributing factor in the observed roughness of
the film. The mathematical approach involves one- and two-space-dimensional
models, the development of analytical techniques, and computational studies. In
the project the investigator collaborates with experimentalists at the Center
for Biofilm Engineering and shares mentoring of students with members of the
Center. Understanding the variations in biofilm form and structure will clarify
the important issues of transport and chemistry within the biofilm. In the
vernacular, a biofilm might be called slime or sludge. A biofilm is a film of
microorganisms that accumulates on the surface of an object in a flowing fluid
environment. The microorganisms secrete polymers outside their own body cells,
which anchor the cells to each other and to the surfaces on which the film
forms. Biofilms can clog pipes, foul the hulls of ships, corrode steel, sour oil
fields, or cause infections by growing on host tissues or medical implants.
Because of their pervasive effects on water quality, power generation, energy
efficiency, and product quality, their negative effect is felt in most U.S.
industries. Not all biofilm activity has negative results. They can also break
down contaminants in water or soil and often are used for bioremediation. The
potential of biofilm process control has yet been fully realized due in part to
a lack of fundamental knowledge of biofilm form and structure. Recent
experiments have shown that biofims are not so uniform in structure as once
thought. In this project, the investigator develops mathematical models of
biofilms to study heterogeneity in biofilms. Understanding the variations in
biofilm structure will lead to understanding issues of chemistry and transport
in the biofilm: how the biofilm grows and what it can do. He collaborates with
