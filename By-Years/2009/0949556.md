Gene duplication is observed in virtually all lineages, and duplicate genes can
play significant roles in regulation of gene expression. This project will
integrate experimental and mathematical approaches to examine whether duplicate
genes contribute to the ability of organisms to adapt to changing environmental
conditions and whether selection in varying environmental conditions can
maintain duplicate genes with redundant function. Working with yeast, the
project will characterize regulatory dynamics of redundant glucose transporter
genes in response to environmental conditions and examine the fitness
consequences of asynchronously regulated redundant genes.

This project will develop methodological and empirical bases for future research
on the role of asynchronous regulation of redundant gene copies. The research
focuses on the genes and metabolic pathways that underlie glucose transport, a
highly important process for organisms in general. The research has the
potential to transform understanding of the role of gene duplication in
evolution and of the basis of adaptation to changing environmental conditions. A
student will receive training in an interdisciplinary research enterprise, and
the research will inform teaching and outreach.
