Infrastructure: Research Infrastructure for Parallel and Distributed Systems:
Real-Time, Multimedia and High-Performance This award is for the acquisition of
computing and communications resources to support the two primary research
thrust of the Computer Science Department's experimental scientists. The
disciplines of both high performance computing and digital multimedia are
characterized by their need for distributed computing nodes connected by high-
bandwidth interconnections. For high performance computing, distributed
architectures are necessary to achieve sufficient price/performance when
constructing gigaflops-capable machines. In addition, high-bandwidth
interconnects provide the necessary data distribution paths to supply each
processor with work. For digital multimedia, distributed systems allow multiple
simultaneous users, and high-bandwidth interconnects are needed to supply the
demands of multiple video and audio streams per user. The equipment will also
enable Boston researchers to apply advances in high performance computing to
multimedia, medical imaging research and their three WWW related projects,
capitalizing on the unique collective strength of the department.
