This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project sets the foundation for
the development of an graphic software package for simulation of head impacts.
Head-Brain traumas are not only the most damaging injuries, but also one of the
most costly. However, the existent research results and models in this field
have not yet been transformed into diagnostic or evaluation tools. In Phase I,
Cheshire CAT Computers will organize the existing head-brain injury data and
models, and develop an integrated model of the skull-brain complex's response to
direct impacts and sudden-massive accelerations. This model will become the
mathematical engine for a software package to be developed in Phase II. The
package will allow non-expert users to visualize and estimate brain injury
likelihoods from the characteristics of the impact. It is anticipated that a
functioning proto-type of this mathematical engine will be implemented by the
end of Phase I.
