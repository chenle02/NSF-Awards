9628543 Weiler Dissertations Initiative for the Advancement of Limnology and
Oceanography: DIALOG II This award helps support a symposium (DIALOG II)
sponsored by multiple agencies to promote and develop interdisciplinary, inter-
institutional, and international communication and collaborations among young
Ph.D. recipients in limnology and oceanography. An opportune time to bridge
disciplinary differences and promote interdisciplinary research is shortly after
the completion of the Ph.D. This symposium targets 40 young scientists within
1-3 years of completing their Ph.D. degrees to participate in a week long
meeting to present and discuss emerging trends and issues in aquatic sciences.
In addition, the meeting promotes communication between young scientists trained
in freshwater and marine aquatic sciences.
