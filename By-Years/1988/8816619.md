This research is part of a broader, multi-institutional study to monitor and
analyze contemporary surface deformation due to an active continental hot spot.
The project currently involves direct participation from MT, University of Utah,
National Geodetic Survey (NGS), U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), and ETH-Zurich.
An extensive crustal deformation experiment was completed in the vicinity of the
volcanically and seismically active Yellowstone Hot Spot in 1987 involving 80
GPS sites, 15 EDM points, 620 km of releveling, and 160 precise gravity
observations. The present work focuses on deformation in the Hebgen Lake region
and includes monitoring rapid horizontal and vertical surface movements
associated with the Hebgen Lake earthquake and strain accumulation (and release
in the event of an earthquake) across a number of Cenozoic normal faults. 2
repeat surveys of the Hebgen Lake GPS network will be carried out during the
next 3 years. Both of these surveys will likely be done in collaboration with
NAGS and USGS.
