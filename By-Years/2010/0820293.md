Torque and rotation are of paramount importance in many essential cellular
processes including transcription. Transcription is the first step in gene
expression and a major point of gene regulation. It is carried out by RNA
polymerase which functions as a highly processive molecular motor that moves
along the DNA template transcribing genetic information from DNA to create
messenger RNA. During transcription, RNA polymerase is known to transcribe
against DNA supercoiling. The mechanism by which RNA polymerase carries out
transcription under torsional stress remains one of the most fundamental and
intriguing problems in biology. The PI's lab will carry out a comprehensive set
of single molecule experiments to investigate the regulation of E. coli RNA
polymerase under a well-defined applied torque using an angular optical trap
that has been developed in the PI's lab. Although the proposed project focuses
on E. coli RNA polymerase, the general methodology and approach are readily
extendable to viral and eukaryotic polymerases as well as many other DNA-based
molecular motors. This project should prove to be a powerful cross-disciplinary
approach for tackling important problems in biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
results of our work will be well disseminated through publications,
presentations, and broader education to the community. The project will involve
graduate students, undergraduate students, and even high school students in
research. The PI also plans to involve undergraduate students to construct an
optical tweezers mobile exhibition for the ScienCenter, a hands-on science
museum in Ithaca, and to participate in various outreach activities organized by
Cornell Nanobiotechnology Center.
