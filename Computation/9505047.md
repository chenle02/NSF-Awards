Knowles The investigator studies parameter identification inverse problems.
Typically, in such a problem one uses certain given information about the
solution of a partial differential equation to compute one or more of the
coefficients in the equation. Such problems are invariably ill-posed (sometimes
badly so) and, to make matters worse, in processing the data in most practical
applications, one must contend not only with measurement error but sometimes
also with the fact that the readings may only be taken at a rather sparse
collection of measurement points. In consequence, in many areas, it is well
documented that algorithms for parameter identification that are sufficiently
reliable to engender widespread practical use are not yet available. In this
project the investigator develops a new approach to a broad class of parameter
identification problems. At the core of the approach is the Dirichlet principle
for elliptic boundary value problems, that the solution may be obtained by the
minimization of a certain energy functional; that the same energy functional can
also be used to compute coefficients in the elliptic equation, if an appropriate
constrained minimization is employed, is the key observation. Recent experiments
have shown that the same numerical stability that is associated with the
Dirichlet principle approach to finding solutions is also present in the
constrained minimization, and furthermore the method appears to be quite robust
in the presence of noise in the data. The class of parameter identification
problems to which the approach is applicable is, roughly speaking, those that
involve elliptic equations that may be solved by means of a Dirichlet principle;
as is well known, this is a large class, having considerable practical
significance. The bulk of the work in the project involves applying these ideas
to producing working algorithms for the solution of the aquifer transmissivity
problem (a crucial step in the modeling of under ground water systems) and the
problem of imaging inside the human body with electrical impedance tomography.
Inverse problems dealing with parameter identification in the presence of data
error are of fundamental practical importance in a number of areas, including,
but by no means limited to, medical and industrial imaging, high energy physics,
geophysics, and hydrology. Such problems are mathematically ill-posed in the
sense that small variations in the data (caused by measurement error for
example) can cause uncontrollably large errors to appear in the calculated
parameters. In this proposal a new optimization approach to a broad class of
parameter identification problems is presented that already shows significant
promise for handling the moderately ill-posed problems in this class, and there
are indications that such an approach may help solve the most egregiously ill-
posed examples. The project concentrates on two test cases, the aquifer
transmissivity problem (a necessary and crucial step in monitoring the flow of
contaminants in underground water systems, for example) and the problem of
(noninvasive and nondestructive) imaging inside the human body using electrical
impedance tomography. If suitably effective algorithms can be developed with
these ideas in the test cases, similar algorithms should be possible for a wide
range of related applications in the areas outlined above, and elsewhere.
