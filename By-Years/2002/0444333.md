Regulation and catalysis of mRNA molecules are important mechanisms for
controlling gene expression. The conserved nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD)
pathway accelerates the decay of aberrant mRNAs containing premature
translational termination codons. Inactivation of the yeast Saccharomyces
cerevisiae NMD pathway also affects the accumulation of hundreds of wild-type
mRNAs, which suggests that NMD has a second role regulating the expression of a
significant number of wild-type genes. Wild-type PPR1 (pyrimidine pathway
regulatory 1) mRNA encodes a transcription activator of the uracil metabolic
genes and is degraded by the NMD pathway. The long-term goal of this research is
to understand how wild-type PPR1 mRNA decay is controlled by the NMD pathway.
The Principal Investigator has shown that decay of PPR1 mRNA depends on the same
proteins that degrade nonsense mRNAs. Her laboratory also has identified a small
region of PPR1 mRNA containing a cis-acting element, called the
Upf1p-destabilizing element (UDE), that targets PPR1 mRNA for Upf1p-dependent
decay by a novel mechanism. The central hypothesis is that the UDE functions
with a downstream sequence element (DSE) to mark an RNA for Upf1p-dependent
decay by serving as a trans-acting factor binding site. The UDE trans-acting
factor(s) could act directly by interacting with general factors required for
NMD to trigger the decay of PPR1 mRNA. Alternatively, the trans-acting factors
could act indirectly by causing the ribosomes to shift to a new reading frame
causing premature translational termination and then triggering the NMD of PPR1
mRNA. The overall objective of this project is to characterize the structure and
function of the PPR1 UDE. This project will advance discovery and understanding
of an important gene regulatory mechanism while promoting teaching, training,
and learning by undergraduate students, graduate students and a post-doctoral
candidate.
