The major goal of Project Linkage is to increase the number and effectiveness
of Wisconsin partnership programs that stress science and mathematics education.
The Wisconsin Academy of Sciences, Arts, and Letters plans to accomplish this
task by (1) identifying existing appropriate partnerships, (2) developing a
framework for improved understanding of the initiations, implementations, and
outcomes associated with these partnerships, (3) conducting and disseminating
case studies for specific partnership components, (4) creating a climate for the
awareness and importance of existing partnerships, (5) encouraging and assisting
the formation of new partnerships, and (6) developing a continuing linkage of
existing and projected partnerships through a newsletter and annual conference.
