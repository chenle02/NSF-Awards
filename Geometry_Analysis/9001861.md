The principal investigator will study the existence of compact leaves in
contact foliations of compact contact manifolds. The existence of these
foliations was conjectured by Weinstein. Several special cases have been solved
by this investigator and by other mathematicians. Lickorish surgical techniques
will be used to investigate the three-dimensional version of the problem.
Okumura's theory will be applied to the problem in the case of hypersurfaces
with contact types in Kaehler manifolds. Diffeomorphism groups will also be
studied. "Manifolds" are generalized surfaces. These may be filled with
collections of lower dimensional "leaves." Such collections of leaves are called
"foliations." The principal investigator will study leaves which do not wrap on
continuously but actually close up. These are called in the literature, "compact
leaves." Such are particularly important in applications to other sciences in
that they represent, in a general sense, behavior which repeats indefinitely.
