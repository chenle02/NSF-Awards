9508992 Chen Ascomycete fungi occur in terrestrial, freshwater (rivers, streams,
lakes), and marine (estuaries, salt marshes, oceans) habitats around the world.
The marine and many of the freshwater ascomycetes have distinctive morphological
features of their spore bodies (the ascoma) that have traditionally been used to
distinguish them from terrestrial ascomycetes. The same features occur in many
different species and genera and may represent adaptations to the aquatic
environment. It is difficult to determine whether two morpholgically similar
species are similar because they share the same recent common ancestor or
because they have both adapted to the aquatic environment in the same way
despite different ancestries. Thus, evolutionary or phylogenetic relationships
among terrestrial and aquatic ascomycete fungi remain obscure and poorly
studied. In particular, whether marine fungi constitute a single major lineage
or an assemblage of multiple lines that have adapted to saltwater conditions
stands as a classic problem of mycology (the study of fungi). Drs. Chen,
Shearer, and Crane of the Illinois Natural History Survey are analyzing new
molecular sources of evidence, including nuclear ribosomal DNA sequencing, along
with traditional morphological features in an attempt to determine the
phylogenetic relationships among a large group of freshwater and marine fungi.
Nucleotide sequences provide information about mutational differences between
species that is independent of their morphology. Understanding the evolutionary
relationships among ascomycetes is important because these fungi play an
important role in our living world as decomposers of organic matter and as
agents of plant and animal diseases, and as sources of medically and
industrially significant compounds such as penicillin. Knowledge of the
phylogenetic linkages among the ascomycetes allows us to search for new
chemicals or to identify new pathogens from knowledge of their closest living
relatives.
