In the sector of medical diagnostic, there is an emerging set of data showing
that volatile metabolites provide a signature of infectious and disease states.
For instance, biomarkers for cystic fibrosis have been found in patients? saliva
and lung cancer biomarkers have been found in a patient's breath. A facile
method with trace detection limits would benefit not only diagnosis but also
point-of-care evaluations. In the automotive industry, there is concern with
detection limit and quantitative real time monitoring of nitrous oxide. To
address these challenges, this team proposes the surface enhanced Raman
scattering (SERS) sensors that are low-cost, scalable to large areas, with low
detection limits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An innovative method has been developed
for fabricating self-organized clusters of metal nanoparticles on diblock
copolymer thin films as surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)-active
structures. Sensors based on SERS provide a molecular fingerprint of molecules
near the surface though issues of reproducibility and cost have limited
technological impact. The developed method reproducibly produces size controlled
nanoparticle clusters with nanometer scale inter-particle spacing and represents
a significant advancement in scaling, cost and point-to-point reproducibility in
sensor performance. The team has theoretically and experimentally identified key
geometric properties desirable for performance as optical sensors.
