The purpose of the proposed workshop is to bring together members of the
international community of researchers and industry practitioners who are
working in the area of real time feedback of information for scheduling control
of complex manufacturing systems. Particular emphasis will be placed on critical
industries such as microelectronics industries. The specific objectives are (a)
the exchange of research ideas, cross fertilization between manufacturing
systems and control systems researchers, and leveraging of complementary
research efforts, (b) technology transfer to the industry and initiation of new
dialogues between academic researchers and industrial practitioners and (c)
promotion of educational goals through the participation of graduate students.
