9530043 Cargill This small grant for exploratory research (SGER) supports a
study of strain and composition gradients associated with electromigration in
passivated polycrystalline aluminum - 5% copper conductor lines. The objective
is to apply a new experimental approach to the long standing problem of
electromigration in order to improve understanding and test theories concerning
the origins, control, and consequences of strain and composition distributions
in polycrystalline metallization structures undergoing electromigration. The
program integrates capillary optics with X-ray diffraction apparatus and energy
dispersive X-ray detection. One of the challenges in the work is to achieve the
necessary spatial resolution in microdiffraction measurements while having
sufficient incident X-ray flux to make accurate diffraction measurements in a
practical time period. %%% This research provides a demonstration of the
approach described above, and should permit the first direct , spatially
resolved measurements of strain gradients during electromigration in passivated
conductor lines. It should advance scientific understanding and industrial
design practice. ***
