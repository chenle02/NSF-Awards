The University of Texas System Alliance for Minority Participation (U.T. System
AMP) brings together all none universities of The University of Texas system and
six closely partnering community college systems to increase the number of
minority students enrolling in, graduating from, and entering graduate programs
in mathematics, science, and engineering (MSE). Activities will be supported by
partnerships with industry and national laboratories. Prominent among
participating institutions are those in Border regions serving large numbers of
Hispanic students and those in metropolitan areas serving mainly commuter
student, including many minority students. Goals set for the proposed AMP are:
1) to produce approximately 2,000 minority MSE B.S. graduates each year by the
end of the 1996-97 academic year; and 2( to enroll at least 500 minority
graduate students per year in U.T. System universities. The approach proposed is
characterized by: 1) high level leadership for programmatic change; 2) focus on
essential, "gate-keeper" science and mathematics courses; 3) substantive
involvement of community college partners in curriculum efforts; 4) flexible
programs for supporting minority student participation in research; and 5) task
forces that bring faculty leaders from different institutions together to make
systemic changes in undergraduate MSE education in Texas. The proposed AMP will
cooperate with the Texas A&amp;M-directed AMP, which includes seven Texas
universities; other major projects; and state agencies.
