Electron excitation of atmospheric constituents takes place in the atmospheres
of Earth, the major planets and certain of their satellites, and other objects
such as comets. Both photoelectron collisions with the ambient atmospheric
species as will as impact of accelerated electrons in the auroral zones of the
Earth and in certain regions on other planets are important. The award is a
three-year renewal of a current NSF Aeronomy grant whose focus is to develop the
techniques to measure the laboratory electron cross sections for unstable
atmospheric species, principally atomic oxygen.
