ABSTRACT

A lacuna of a linear hyperbolic differential operator is a domain inside the
propagation cone where its fundamental solution vanishes identically. The study
of lacunas for general hyperbolic equations was initiated by I.G.Petrovsky
(1945). Extending and clarifying his results, Atiyah, Bott and Garding (1970-73)
developed a profound and complete theory for hyperbolic operators with constant
coefficients. In contrast, much less is known about lacunas for operators with
variable coefficients. The investigation of this classical problem with a view
of generalizing the Petrovsky-Atiyah-Bott-Garding theory is one of the primary
purposes of my project. In particular, the efforts will be aimed at resolving
the old question of J.Hadamard on explicit determination of second order
analytic wave operators satisfying Huygens' principle on Minkowski spaces. Some
new conjectures and problems (mostly from Analysis and Algebraic Geometry)
arising in connection with the theory of lacunas will be also explored.

The study of propagation of waves in continuous media is one of the fundamental
problems in Mathematical Physics with many important applications in natural
sciences and engineering. Of special interest (both from practical and
theoretical point of view) is the question of when the waves may propagate
without diffusion to allow the possibility of transmitting `clean-cut' (sharp)
signals. Well-studied in homogeneous spaces this question remains largely open
in general. My project aims to develop new mathematical tools and techniques to
investigate this difficult problem in the case of inhomogeneous and anisotropic
media. The results sought are of fundamental interest and significance in
mathematical theory of wave propagation and may have applications in related
physical disciplines including the theory of electromagnetic and acoustic waves,
space communication technologies, magnetohydrodynamics, crystal optics, etc.
