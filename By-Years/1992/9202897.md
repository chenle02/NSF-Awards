The PIs would like to participate in the next scheduled airborne and
groundbased lidar/radar/optical observations campaign, the ALOHA-93 campaign;
and to conduct various small-scale organized groundbased campaigns within their
laboratory and other US research institutions. Additionally, the research
planned includes the measurements of OH rotational temperature, gravity wave
induced intensity and temperature oscillations, vibrational distribution of
OH(2>), and correlation studies of mesospheric nightglow O(1S), O2(1>) and OH
Meinel band emissions.
