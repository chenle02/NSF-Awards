This award from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program
is in the general area of organometallic chemistry. The research is concerned
with the planned synthesis of new types of stacked organometallic complexes
(multiligand sandwich compounds) and metal-boron-carbon clusters. Such extended
sandwich systems in which electrons are delocalized over a large number of atoms
are of interest as potential precursors to novel low-dimensional electrical
conductors or semiconductors wherein the current flows only parallel to the
chain. An important aim of the research is to discover new materials with
unusual electronic properties. The principal building blocks which will be used
to synthesize new extended sandwich systems are carboranes, paramagnetic
transition metal ions, and polycyclic arenes. These will be combined in
complexes having two or more metal centers and designed to favor delocalization
of electrons between the metals. The new complexes will be characterized by
multinuclear NMR, infrared, electron spin resonance and mass spectroscopy, as
well as by X-ray crystallography, where feasible. Detailed electrochemical
studies will be conducted on several families of these compounds. Small
carborane ligands will be combined with diborolene units to create novel mixed-
ligand sandwich species which may be used to construct large multilevel sandwich
systems of a novel type, and which also may undergo oxidative ligand fusion to
generate new classes of carbon-rich carboranes. Attempts will be made to also
synthesize (carborane)metal(metallacycle) and (carborane)metal(borazine)
complexes, types of compounds which are presently unknown, and to attempt
linkage or fusion between the ligands.
