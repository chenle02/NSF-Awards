9414084 Kirk This Americas Program award will support a collaborative research
between Drs. T. Kent Kirk and Dan Cullen, Forest Products Laboratory,University
of Wisconsin, Madison, and Prof. Rafael Vicuna, Pontificia Universidad Catolica
de Chile. The aim of this project is to advance the characterization of the
ligninolytic system of the white-rot basidiomycete Ceriporiopsis subvermispora ,
mainly at the genetic level, with the goal of improving the treatment of wood
pulp by the use of biological methods. The joint research will be performed in
both the Madison and Chilean laboratories. The investigators' past collaboration
has shown that there are fundamental differences in enzyme expression patterns
in defined liquid media vs. solid substrates. With these results in mind, the
present study 's emphasis is directed toward characterizing the enzymes and
genes expressed in complex, woody substrates. This is very important research.
The basic information obtained from the study could potentially be utilized to
improve the efficiency of the fungus in biopulping and it is believed that
biological treatment of wood fiber during processing with either whole-cell
ligning-degrading microorganisms or microbial enzymes may someday eliminate the
use of polluting compounds that are presently used. ***
