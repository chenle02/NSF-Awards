The Southern Ocean (SO) plays a dominant role in the climate system, accounting
for a disproportionate amount of anthropogenic heat and carbon uptake and
determining how the largest source of potential future sea level rise, the
Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS), evolves. Therefore, dynamics in the SO have an
outsized role in the climate system and the trajectory of climate change and
associated societal impacts. The swift westward flowing Antarctic Slope Current
(ASC) that moves along the boundary between the Antarctic continental shelf and
the open SO is hypothesized to influence heat delivery to Antarctic ice shelves,
suggesting an important mechanism for controlling AIS melt rates and thus future
sea level rise. The ASC also may act as a key gateway for the exchange of
nutrients and carbon between the shelf and open SO, with implications for the
marine carbon cycle and ecosystem dynamics.

To constrain how the thermal and biogeochemical properties of the Antarctic
shelf and open SO will evolve, a comprehensive understanding of the ASC, its
variability, its role in tracer transport, and its response to internal and
external climate forcing is required. Despite its hypothesized importance,
beyond sub-annual timescales and at localized regions, critical knowledge gaps
exist in our understanding of the ASC. The proposed research will utilize a
hierarchy of state-of-the-science observationally-constrained and validated
physical and biogeochemical SO state estimates and fully-coupled climate model
simulations to address these existing knowledge gaps. A novel, fine-resolution
Southern Ocean State Estimate (SOSE) with tidal forcing, ice shelf cavities, and
thermodynamically-active ice shelves will allow for the investigation of the
connection between ASC variability and ice shelf melt events. The results from
this work will provide foundational knowledge on the ASCâ€™s climatological state
and structure, its variability, and its role in the evolving climate system.
This research will also provide critical insight on the role that model
resolution may play in ASC dynamics, a step which is vital for improving the
fidelity of model simulations and future projections. In addition to engaging
with the Temple University First-Generation Initiative for recruiting early
career researchers, a partnership with the Compute-STEM program to develop
lesson plans and teacher trainings will extend the impacts of this research
project.
