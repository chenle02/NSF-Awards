The research proposed by the PI will investigate how animals use their muscles
to power their movement, both during flight and terrestrial gait. Muscle
function will be analyzed in relation to the mechanical role of tendons for
elastic energy savings and the design and loading of bone elements to which they
attach. These studies will be carried out using state-of-the-art techniques that
allow direct measurements of muscle force, muscle shortening and bone strain to
be made in living animals. These in vivo measurements will allow the PI to test
assumptions about muscle function, such as uniform fiber shortening, that have
had to be made using more traditional indirect approaches. The research
objectives will yield important basic information concerning how muscle function
during animal movement relates to the strucutral organization and physiological
properties of the muscle's fibers. This information will have importance for
developing a better understanding of exercise-related influences on
musculoskeletal function in vertebrate animals and the neuromuscular basis for
controlling movement. It is also likely to yield important technological insight
into applied areas, such as robotics and the design of physical therapeutic
devices.
