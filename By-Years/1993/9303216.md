This award is concerned with research in algebraic geometry and category
theory. The principal investigator will work on using Chow varieties to obtain
desingularizations of quotient varieties by algebraic groups and to construct
higher-dimensional generalizations of Grothendieck-Knuidsen moduli spaces of
stable punctured curves. He will also develop the formalism of braided monoidal
2-categories and apply it to the study of Zamolodchikov's tetrahedra equations.
In addition, he will study Koszul duality for quadratic operads as motivated by
graph cohomology; polyhedral syzygies among Steinberg relations in order to get
a more formal algebraic approach to higher algebraic K-theory; and the setting
for generalizing the Langlands correspondence to 2-dimensional schemes by using
a certain generalization of a concept of operad. This is reasearch in the field
of algebraic geometry, one of the oldestparts of modern mathematics, but one
which has had a revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century. In its
origins, it treated figures that could be defined in the plane by the simplest
equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays the field makes use of methods not only
from algebra, but from analysis and topology, and conversely is finding
application in those fields as well as in theoretical computer science and
robotics.
