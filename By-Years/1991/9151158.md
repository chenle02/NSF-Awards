The aim of the proposed project is to improve the quality of instruction in an
undergraduate human neurophysiology course by supplementing classroom teaching
and discussion with laboratory experiences which are currently not available
because of a lack of instrumentation. The proposed purchase of a motion analysis
system and 5 computer workstations which use state-of-the-art technology in the
computer controlled analysis of videotaped movement and muscle electrical
activity will allow students the opportunity for direct involvement in the
collection and analysis of data as well as the formulation of conclusions
pertaining to the neurophysiological basis of human movement. The development of
the laboratory experiences through the use of the proposed equipment will
significantly enhance the students' abilities to comprehend complex
neurophysiological concepts relative to normal and pathological sensory motor
transformations by allowing them to actively participate in the replication of
classical and original experiments.
