Proposer plans to investigate the topology of smooth 4-manifolds by attacking
some unsolved problems in 4-manifolds by decomposing them into basic easy to
understand pieces (PALF's), and studying the pieces by applying techniques of
complex and symplectic manifold theory. He also plans to work on calibrated
manifolds, and on real algebraic varieties. In particular he plans to study on
certain classes of 7 and 8 dimensional manifolds (so called G2 and Spin(7)
manifolds); by studying the certain families of 3 and 4 dimensional submanifolds
in them (so called associative and Cayley submanifolds) Proposer hopes to get a
global understanding of the gauge theories of low dimensional manifolds, and
construct a counting theory for these submanifolds (similar to Gromov-Witten
counting theory of holomorphic curves in symplectic manifolds). Also, Proposer
wants to continue to work on the project of topological characterization of real
algebraic sets.

Three and four dimensional manifolds, and certain classes of seven and eight
dimensional manifolds (so called G2 and Spin(7) manifolds) are current interest
of physicist because they play central role in understanding of space-time and
the String theory physics. Also, algebraic sets are a nice way to describe
topological spaces in equations, but not all the topological spaces can be
described this way. Proposal plans to characterize all the topological spaces
that can be described as real algebraic sets.
