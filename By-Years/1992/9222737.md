A color camera, real-time data processing boards, and a robot arm shall be
procured in order to support several research projects in robotics. These
include: * 3D vision in extreme clutter and partial occlusion. * 3D orientation
determination from image spectra * Fast vision algorithms. * Vision-based
supervisory control of dual-arm robotics system. The research results stemming
from these projects will be integrated in a manner so as to promote technology
transfer to the aerospace electronics industry.
