This project is providing better spatial analysis tools for students at various
levels in the cartography/geographic information system (GIS) curriculum.
Primary objectives of the project include (1) improving the integration of
activities and concepts in the sequence of courses; (2) providing more
opportunities for linkages to local and state organizations; (3) incorporating
additional field experiences, particularly the use of global positioning systems
(GPS); and (4) developing an advanced-level GIS course that builds in more
sophisticated spatial analyses and provides a capstone experience for senior
students. *
