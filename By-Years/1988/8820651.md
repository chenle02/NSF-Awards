The Organic Synthesis Program is supporting the work of Dr.Donald Burton.
Burton, a professor of chemistry at the University of Iowa, is investigating new
methods for preparing fluorine-containing organic molecules. The replacement of
a C-H bond with a C-F bond dramatically alters the physical, chemical and
biological properties of a molecule. The methods for carrying out these
replacements have often required specialized equipment, reagents and facilities.
Prof. Burton has pioneered, and continues to develop, techniques and reagents
that make these replacements accessible to research workers without these
specialized facilities. Prof. Burton's research focuses on the development of
new reagents, new procedures, and a mechanistic understanding of basic chemical
principles that govern these reactions. The program will generally develop new
approaches to fluorine-containing ylide intermediates and stable fluorinated
organometallic reagents. Specific studies include new approaches to
fluoroolefins via ylide intermediates, development of trifluoromethyl copper
reagents that can be applied to novel difluoromethylene grafting and
fluorocarbon chain homologation protocols, development of fluorinated allene,
diene, vinyl and acetylenic reagents, and the general development of new methods
for preparing fluorinated heterocyclic molecules.
