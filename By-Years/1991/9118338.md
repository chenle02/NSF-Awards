The principal investigator will develop and implement computerized X-ray
tomography and automated petrographic image analysis. This will aid in the
analysis of porphyroblast distribution, patterns of compositional zoning, and
crystal size distributions in rocks. The work will help geologists relate two-
dimensional analysis to a larger three-dimensional framework. It also will help
establish the relative importance of possible reaction mechanisms and kinetic
controls on crystallization in diverse metamorphic environments.
