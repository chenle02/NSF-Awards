The nascent Science of Security (SoS) seeks to develop the principles with which
to understand how computing systems are architected, built, used, and maintained
with a view to understanding and addressing security challenges systematically
across their life cycle. The Symposium and Bootcamp on the Science of Security
(HotSoS), held April 2014 in Raleigh, North Carolina, will help further research
in the field. HotSoS is a follow-on to the NSF/NSA-sponsored Science of Security
Community meeting held in conjunction with the 2012 SaTC Principal Investigators
Meeting. As this is the first year of HotSoS as a separate event, it is
difficult to predict attendance, but the organizers are anticipating 150-200
people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the travel grant program is to
encourage participation in HotSoS by students who would normally find it
difficult to attend. Availability of student travel grants is publicized through
the website and announcements, with particular encouragement for women and
underrepresented groups to apply. Preference for awards is given to full-time
students with limited other means to support their participation, with priority
given to students who are presenting papers at HotSoS.
