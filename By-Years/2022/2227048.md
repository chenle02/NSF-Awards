The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development of properly fitted bicycle helmets for children. The proposed effort
seeks to reduce head injuries. The use of poorly fitting helmets by children
results in greater risk of injuries such as concussion and head injuries. This
innovation also has the potential to improve fit, compliance, and safety in
other applications that require helmets and other forms of personal protective
equipment and may be useful for construction workers, emergency responders,
military personnel, and athletes in other sports.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
I-Corps project is based on the development of a bicycle helmet fit for children
using 3D scanning, surface generation, mesostructure design, finite element
analysis (FEA). This technology may also result in new methods of product
development for personal protective equipment. The proposed process and
technology involves thermoplastic mesostructures that can be repeated and
additively manufactured, with comparable or improved impact resistance compared
to the traditional foams used in helmets. Additively manufactured mesostructures
may result in a more personalized fit, circumventing slow, traditional helmet
design and manufacturing processes and allowing for a safer, bespoke helmet that
is affordable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
