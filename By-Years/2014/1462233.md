The broader impact of this workshop benefits society at large. NSF SBIR Grantees
sometimes have innovations that could afford societal impact in education. This
makes them candidates for foundations that fund projects for their societal
impact in education. Exposing such NSF SBIR Grantees to such foundations could
serve the societal objectives of the foundations, the National Science
Foundation, and also support the commercialization path of the NSF SBIR
Grantees.

There are foundations whose missions are education oriented. These foundations
make grants into organizations that support the foundation?s educational
missions. These missions include K12, STEM, adult learning, and workforce. These
foundations seek social impact from their grant making. Raising their awareness
of quality education innovation enables them to improve the societal return on
their investments. Presently, the awareness of NSF SBIR portfolio and program
for education by educational foundations is minimal.
