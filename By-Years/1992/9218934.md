Two models are currently applied to large-scale mountain building resulting
from compressional tectonics. One maintains that the processes in the
construction of fold- and-thrust mountain belts are continuous and are
everywhere at failure (the critical wedge hypothesis). The other is that these
processes are discrete and discontinuous, more in keeping with actual structural
observations. This work will attempt to reconcile these hypotheses by a finite
element analysis that incorporates both structural and thermal parameters, to
systematically explore different thrusting scenarios and to test the modeled
consequences against relevant observations. Results are expected to add to
understanding of the process of mountain building.
