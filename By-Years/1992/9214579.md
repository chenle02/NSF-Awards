We anticipate an era in which superconductors form the basis for a whole new
industry of high performance electronics. These electronics frontiers include
the use of Josephson-coupled superconductors, proximity-coupled
superconductor/normal metal materials, and ultra-small (normal and
superconducting) tunnel junctions which are sensitive to the presence of single
electrons. As these technologies develop we have an excellent opportunity to
study the fundamental physical processes which give rise to them. However,
conventional low-Tc superconductors (which are most promising for all of these
applications) are very sensitive to impurities, such as oxygen, water vapor and
carbon contaminates. Hence it is necessary to produce these materials in ultra-
high vacuum (UHV) thin film deposition systems. We will assemble a UHV, three-
gun sputtering system for making superconducting, superconductor/insulator and
superconductor/semiconductor multilayer structures as well as many other non-
oxide superconductors for use in studying fundamental physical processes in
solids.
