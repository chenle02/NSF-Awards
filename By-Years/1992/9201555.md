This award provides support for continued VLBI operations at Haystack Radio
Observatory, for many years one of the foremost university operated
observatories. It provides for a smooth transition of VLBI support operations to
the VLBA as that instru- ment comes on line, and also provides for some
development of VLBI operations at 3 mm wavelength and further research into high
density recording techniques. These two areas will combine to permit the highest
resolution radio observations possible on the Earth's surface.
