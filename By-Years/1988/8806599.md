This award will support the enhancement of the Pattern Recognition and Image
Processing (PRIP) Laboratory of the Department of Computer Science at Michigan
State University. A modern, distributed, pattern recognition facility will be
established, consisting of four image processing/graphics workstations, a
dedicated file server and a computation server, image acquisition and image
output devices, a laser range finder for capturing 3-D range data, an optical
disk for archiving images, a LISP machine with a signal processing board, and
several workstations for software development. The PRIP Laboratory will provide
the environment for the following research projects: 1. extraction and
evaluation of features for recognition of 3-D objects and construction of object
models, 2. examination of the role of Markov Random Field models in pattern
recognition and computer vision, 3. investigation of the perceptual grouping
problem in computer vision, 4. development of parallel programming environments
for computer vision applications, 5. application of pattern recognition and
image processing algorithms in remote sensing for land use planning, measurement
of root systems by soil scientists, detection of structures in magnetic
resonance brain scans, and the analysis of sequences of fluid images. The grant
will also support development of the Artificial Intelligence/Knowledge Based
Systems research group, which will interact with the PRIP Laboratory in studying
the object recognition problem.
