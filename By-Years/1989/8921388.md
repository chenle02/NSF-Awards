PIs proposed to develop construction control systems to better understand
production operations, to develop methods of satisfying conflicting objectives,
and to design standards for integrated process and project control. An
interdisciplinary research team, including academics (Maryland, Virginia Tech,
Stanford and Penn State), NIST and construction industry, is assembled. The team
will work to develop and test on site, a computer based open system for planning
and control during the construction phase of a project. The overall goal of this
research is to establish an integrated and flexible control concept for
construction which is based on system and information theory, hierarchical
control and state-machine concepts, uncertainty analysis, and computer
simulation and emulation. In this context a generic framework will be developed
to provide a structure for controlling four specific construction objectives:
Quality, Safety, Productivity and Precision (As-Built). Data acquisition,
reduction and analysis of construction parameters are needed. This process can
be in the form of point-in-time sampling rather than real time. A case study
will be considered to perform this process. Automatic data collection devices,
such as senors (e.g., strain gauges) and voice recognition systems, will be
selected and tested for the case study.//
