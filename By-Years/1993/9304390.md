This research encompasses three separate lines of study: a) Asymptotics beyond
all orders; b) Kinetic theory and resonant triads, and c) Models for motion of
curves and surfaces in space. The results have potential for important
applications in nonlinear dynamics and applications of the KAM theory. The KAM
theorem asserts that under appropriate circumstances most of the trajectories of
the system remain regular at the onset of chaos; only a few trajectories
actually become irregular, or chaotic. So far there is no available theory that
can identify which trajectories become chaotic under small perturbations. If
successful, the work proposed here will enable scientists to work with dynamical
systems containing both chaotic and regular trajectories. This issue is
important in many fields, one of which is the design of plasma fusion devices
like tokomaks.
