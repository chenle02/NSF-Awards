This award supports research on orthogonal groups and quadratic forms. The
principal investigator will examine three problems in this general area. The
first is concerned with the number of generators of certain kinds which are
required for the commutator subgroup of the orthogonal group. The second is
concerned with Arf invariants of quadratic forms over commutative rings and the
information that this invariant imparts. The third problem is to investigate the
deviation between the 2-torsion in the Brauer group of a commutative ring and
the subset of images of Clifford algebras. The research supported involves the
theory of quadratic forms. This, in its simplest form, is the study of
polynomial forms of degree two. Equivalently, it is an analysis of the types of
inner products that can define the metric geometry of an n-dimensional vector
space. The study of quadratic forms has deep interrelations with algebraic
geometry and algebraic K-theory.
