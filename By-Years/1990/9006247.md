This proposed research addresses an areas of present interest in the
intercontinental academic networking community. The United States' networking
plant is built on a connectionless (datagram) service, and the European (and
Japanese and other) plant(s) are based on connection-oriented service. The
implication is that even when we all use the international stantdard (ISO/OSI)
protocols, our networks will not be able to interwork unless the
incompatibilities of the underlying network services are bridged. A European -
U.S. workshop addressing the issue is scheduled for February, 1990. The proposed
effort would produce an assessment of the state-of-the-art in bridging between
the two underlying network protocols, in time for use at the February meeting.
Such a paper could increase the chances of success of the workshop by getting
all the attendees off to a fast start with a shared view of developments.*** //
