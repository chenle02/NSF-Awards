This award will provide one-half the funding required for the acquisition of
computing equipment to be installed and operated in the Department of Geological
Sciences at the University of Michigan. The University of Michigan is committed
to providing the remaining funds needed for the acquisition. The computing
equipment will be used primarily in the research projects and teaching
responsibilities of the geophysics research group at the University of Michigan.
Their research areas currently include earthquake seismology, geodynamics,
tsunami research, and geothermal research.
