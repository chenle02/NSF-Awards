This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY
2011, Intersections of Biology and Mathematical and Physical Sciences. The
fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the
Fellow at the intersection of biology with mathematics. The title of the
research and training plan for this fellowship to Clayton Cressler is "A
theoretical-empirical approach to life history evolution under joint starvation
and predation risks in Daphnia." The host institution for this fellowship is
Queen's University with sponsoring scientists Drs. William Nelson and Troy Day.

The need to avoid starvation, on one hand, and to avoid predation, on the
other, are two of the strongest selective forces acting on animal populations.
Furthermore, many traits affect an organism's interaction with both its
resources and its predators, so starvation and predation risk will often jointly
affect trait evolution. However, very little is known about the relative
importance of each risk to trait evolution for any organism. Disentangling the
interaction between starvation and predation risk requires an intimate dialogue
between biological experiment and mathematical theory. This project employs such
a dialogue to (1) gain insight into how different resource and predator
environments drive selection on life history in the zooplankter Daphnia pulex;
(2) identify the traits most strongly influenced by each force; and (3) explore
how feedbacks between resources, predation, and life history contribute to the
coexistence of different Daphnia genotypes. Training objectives include learning
experimental techniques for the model organism Daphnia pulex, using empirical
data to parameterize dynamical models at both the individual- and population-
levels, and rigorously confronting these models with novel experimental data
that definitively test model predictions or point out the need for better
models. Data will be shared with the Daphnia Genome Consortium for public use.
Broader impacts include mentoring undergraduates from both mathematics and
biology to work across disciplinary boundaries, a crucial skill for tackling the
complexity of natural systems.
