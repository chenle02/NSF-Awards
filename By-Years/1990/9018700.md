The long range goal of the proposed research is to understand the role of
intercellular communication in regulating adenohypophyseal cell function. To
investigate this issue, initial studies will elucidate the relationship between
somatotroph function and topography of Growth Hormone (GH) and other cell types
in individual tissue slices. Basal and stimulated GH release will be measured
from sections placed in perifusion; subsequently, tissue slices will be
processed for routine histological examination. Serial (adjacent) paraffin
sections obtained from each tissue slice will be stained immunocytochemically
for GH, ACTH, TSH, LH/FSH, PRL and the S-100 protein. Distributions of these
cell types, assessed by image analysis, will be correlated with GH secretory
profiles. These studies are based on the hypothesis that differential GH release
from tissue sections is the result of specific neighboring cells influencing
somatotroph function via cell-to-cell communication. A second component of the
project will identify to what extent cell-to-cell contact affects somatotroph
function.
