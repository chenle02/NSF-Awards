9722205 Woodard Technical section steroid hormones control a wide range of
developmental processes in higher organisms, acting in conjunction with receptor
proteins to regulate the stage- and tissue-specific transcription of target
genes. Little is understood about how these effects on gene expression result in
the dramatic developmental changes associated with steroid function in the fly,
Drosophila melanogaster. The goal of the proposed research is to answer the
question of how a single hormonal signal can elicit different responses at
different times during development. The proposed study will examine the
regulatory hierarchies triggered by 20-hydroxyecdysone (ecdysone)during the
onset of Drosophila metamorphosis. Previously isolated as well as newly isolated
loss-of-function mutations in a mutant, BFTZ-F1 will be analyzed with a focus on
salivary gland histolysis, pupal cuticle formation, and head eversion. The
mutations will also be characterized at the molecular level. Non-technical
Understanding biological processes at the molecular level has led to rapid,
major advances in our understanding of mechanisms underlying biological
processes and that understanding has had a major impact in the everyday world.
Thus it is critical for students to gain a solid understanding of molecular
biology, whether they wish to become scientists, or informed citizens who are
well-equipped to deal with personal and societal decisions regarding use of
scientific knowledge. In this study, undergraduate students will be involved in
the analysis of the mechanism(s) involved in the function of the steroid hormone
in triggering developmental processes in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster.
The plan to integrate molecular biology into the curriculum is an effective way
of teaching scientific principles of biology. ***
