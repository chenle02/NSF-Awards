The objective is the measurement of the thermophoretic forces acting on single
particles suspended in an electrodynamic balance, and the evaluation of existing
theories related to this experiment. The focus is on relatively large particles
and high thermal conductivities, for which negative thermophoretic effects have
been suggested. Single particles will be suspended in an electrodynamic balance
and will be sized by use of their Mie resonance and angular spectra. Thermal
gradients from 0 to 75 K/cm and mean temperatures from 250 to 400 K will be
studied. The research is of fundamental nature, and has relevance to several
industrial processes, including manufacture of optical fibers, clean room
technology, particle erosion and deposition processes, as well as pollution and
combustion.
