The Cleveland Math and Science Partnership includes the Cleveland Municipal
School District, John Carroll University, Case Western Reserve University,
Cleveland State University and the Education Development Center. The Cleveland
Municipal School District is the largest school system in Ohio, enrolling over
74,000 preK to 12th grade students of whom 71% are African American and 8% are
Hispanic. The Cleveland Math and Science Partnership focuses on the mathematics
and science teachers of over 15,000 secondary school students as the majority of
these teachers in the District are not properly qualified and do not have the
certification to effectively teach these subjects.

The partnership aims to improve student achievement in the Cleveland Municipal
School District by equipping its teachers with additional skills acquired
through university continuing education programs. The universities will
establish three diverse graduate programs for Cleveland middle and high school
mathematics and science teachers (grades 6-12): John Carroll University will
establish a master's degree program with a specialization in mathematics or
science for middle school teachers; Cleveland State University will offer
graduate-level content courses that may be counted towards state licensure for
middle school teachers; and Case Western Reserve University will offer graduate
courses focusing on applied science laboratory and mathematics demonstration
preparation for high school teachers. The university partners will work together
on a regular basis to custom-design and refine their courses to align with the
District's needs. The District and university partners will also join with the
Education Development Center (a) to train master teachers to become
instructional leaders and mentors within the District's schools and (b) to
develop a mentoring program for middle school teachers new to teaching
mathematics and science.
