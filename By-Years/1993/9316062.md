9316062 Steele This award provides two-thirds of the funds required to purchase
equipment for the purpose of upgrading the electron microprobe instrument
operated in the Department of Geophysical Sciences at the University of Chicago.
The institution is committed to providing the remaining funds necessary to
acquire the equipment. Equipment items for the upgrade include a vacuum pump, a
synthetic layered X-ray monochromator for analyzing light elements such as
oxygen and fluorine, a back-scattered electron detector, and an image display
terminal. The University of Chicago electron microprobe laboratory provides
microanalytical capabilities for a large number of student and faculty
researchers needing accurate chemical analyses of materials with a spatial
resolution in the micrometer range. The upgrade items are necessary to match the
instrument's capabilities with the extensive and growing needs of a broad range
of users. ***
