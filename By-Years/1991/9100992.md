Professor Bing M. Fung and other members of the Chemistry Department at the
University of Oklahoma are being supported to continue a Research Experiences
for Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry. For the period 1991-93, eight
undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in a
variety of research projects. Some of the projects will involve characterization
of proteins, enzymes, and DNA, development of liquid crystal devices, and
characterization of marine natural products. In addition to work in their own
research groups, students will attend seminars on ongoing research in the
department and research in local industries, take field trips to local
industrial laboratories, and receive instruction in library use. In addition to
presenting a seminar on the results of their own research, the students will
prepare a poster presentation.
