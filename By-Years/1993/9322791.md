Hakansson Computer technology can increase student interest in science topics by
allowing students to become more involved in the analytic process of problem
solving and, at the same time, freeing them from getting mired in highly
technical procedures and repetitive mathematical computations. Yet despite the
advantages of new technologies, including interactive software, teachers have
found it difficult to integrate existing products into their teaching plans.
Results of the Phase I Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) study establish
the technical basis for the creation of a new software tool Science Analysis
Multimedia ( SAM) to facilitate turning the promise of computer technology in
K-12 science instruction into reality. SAM will consist of a shell (video
playback and analysis capabilities as well as features for data gathering,
computation, and presentation) and learning modules (video and text data
organized in subtopics and groups according to major scientific themes); it is
unique in that it is designed to function both as a content- neutral tool and as
a modular science program. The objectives of the Phase II research focus on (1)
developing and testing the prototype of the SAM software tool; (2) developing
and testing prototype classroom materials; (3) developing and testing model
teacher workshops; (4) assessing attitudes and achievement among various
students who use SAM; and (5) developing means of making SAM available to the
broadest spectrum of students. The project will contribute to the creation of a
software tool employing state-of-the-art digital video technology and advanced
programming techniques and combining many of the most useful computer
applications to assist teachers in the delivery of the new science curriculum.
