The Chile Ridge is a major branch of the global ridge system. The magnetic
lineations formed by seafloor spreading on the Chile Ridge have recorded the
relative motion of the Antarctic and Nazca plates since the breakup of the
Farallon plate around 25 million years ago. These magnetic lineations contain
adetailed record of the tectonic history of this region during the Neogene.
However, the spreading history of the Chile Ridge cannot be accurately resolved
with the current set of magnetic data collected by ships. An aeromagnetic survey
of the Chile Ridge would enable the PIs to map the magnetic anomaly pattern on
the Chile Ridge in considerable detail. Funds are provided to support the
participation of Lamont scientists in both the acquisition and interpretation
phases of the survey to be run by Naval Research Lab (NRL). The aeromagnetics
data, along with existing shipboard marine geophysical data and GEOSAT/SEASAT
geoid altimetry data, will be used to reconstruct a detailed tectonic history of
the Chile Ridge during the Neogene. This detailed tectonic history will provide
the basis for studying the effect on the Chile Ridge and Nazca plate of a series
of Neogene ridge-trench collisions.
