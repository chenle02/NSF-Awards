This project focuses on the study of inverse scattering and non-scattering
phenomena, which are used for determining the properties of an object or medium
using only scattered waves from the exterior, without having to physically probe
the object or medium. Inverse scattering has a wide range of applications in
fields such as radar and sonar imaging, medical imaging, geophysical
exploration, and astrophysics. This project aims to investigate non-scattering
features of inhomogeneous media in a homogeneous free space and explore their
potential applications to inverse scattering as well as invisibility, or
cloaking, which can be used to make objects undetectable or unimpacted by
certain waves. In addition, graduate and undergraduate student will be mentored
as part of this project, which will add both depth and breadth to their
mathematical education. Despite recent progress concerning some special
geometries, the existence or nonexistence of nonscattering wavenumbers for
general inhomogeneities largely remains an open question. This project aims to
explore the non-scattering behavior of inhomogeneous media by addressing several
challenges. The specific goals of this work are to (1) characterize necessary
conditions for inhomogeneities and waves to be nonscattering, or the opposite,
to be nontrivially scattering, (2) mathematically construct nonscattering media
and waves, (3) establish quantitative results on nonscattering wavenumbers for a
general class of inhomogeneities, and (4) apply results of nonscattering and/or
nontrivial scattering to inverse problems for uniquely determining the shape of
an unknown medium by one single measurement. This project will shed light on
non-scattering phenomena and pave the way for advancements in inverse scattering
and related fields.
