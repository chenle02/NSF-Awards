Partial support is provided for the North East Set Theory Seminar. NESTS was
formed in the fall of 1981. It meets monthly during the academic year at Smith
College. Four one-hour talks are scheduled each meeting. The seminar is
organized by set theorists on faculties throughout the region. While the focus
of the seminar is set theory, lectures have been presented related to set theory
in other fields, both in and outside of mathematical logic. Numerous graduate
students and occasional foreign visitors to one of the region's institutions
also participate.
