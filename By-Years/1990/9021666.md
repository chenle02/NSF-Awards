Clathrates are ice-like, crystalline solids composed of water and low molecular
weight gas molecules. Because of the unique pressure and temperature fields in
which they are stable, clathrates tend to be abundant in continental slope and
rise sediments in the deep sea. The resulting precipitation of solid clathrates
within marine sediments is detectable from the occurrence of bottom-parallel
reflectors which are visible in seismic reflection records, are generally
parallel to the ocean bottom, and cut across other sediment reflections. The
bottom parallel reflector apparently represents the base of the clathrate
stability field. Below this reflector the clathrate decomposes into fresh water
and dissolved gas. Few pristine samples of clathrates from the deep-sea have
ever been fully analyzed, since the clathrates tends to decompose rapidly when
brought to the sea surface. Recently the Ocean Drilling Program has developed a
pressure core barrel which is capable of retrieving a one meter long sample of
marine sediment and returning the material to the drillship under in situ
pressure. During a recent engineering test of this system, an undisturbed sample
was recovered from the Nankai Trench. the present award will support preliminary
development of the necessary analytical techniques to examine this unexpected
sample important in fully documenting chemical reactions and conditions and in
evaluating the release of clathrates gasses to the atmosphere during sea-level
changes.
