The PI's will investigate chain-folded polymer crystals as possible electronic
devices. It has been demonstrated experimentally that single crystals of
polymers show negative resistance and hence can be used as active devices. Our
recent theory <3> shows that the operating principle of these devices is
tunneling and that there are potential practical device applications possible.
Lacking further information on these systems beyond the original measurements,
it is mandatory to obtain a complete set of experimental parameters, before we
will be able to use these crystals in devices. The work will consist of growing
high-quality polyethylene crystals and testing their current-voltage (IV)
characteristics for a variety of parameters: quality of the crystals, thickness
of the crystal, choice of different metal electrodes, and temperature
dependence. Secondly, in order to establish switching speeds, we want to make ac
measurements on these devices by time domain spectroscopy (pulse method) using
automated instrumentation. The instrumentation for this method will be built,
using the methods pioneered at the National Bureau of Standards by Mopsik, and
will be useful for general use in dielectric measurements.
