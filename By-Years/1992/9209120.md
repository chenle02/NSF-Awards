Knowledge of the magnitudes of stresses in the earth's crust is fundamental to
a broad range of problems of lithospheric mechanics. This is a project to make
in situ stress measurements to ~10 km depth in the KTB scientific drillhole in
cooperation with the University of Karlsruhe. It has never before been possible
to measure in situ stress at nearly mid-crustal depth. If such measurements are
successful, it will provide the opportunity to test such fundamental concepts as
the hypothesis that stress levels in the brittle crust are in equilibrium with
frictional strength as defined by simple faulting theory and laboratory-
determined values of the coefficient of friction. In a related collaboration
with the University of Karlsruhe (and Geoforschung Zentrum (GFZ), in Potsdam,
Germany and the U.S. Geological Survey), the Principal Investigator will
implement a new research program in eastern Europe to measure in situ stress
orientation and heat flow (as well as other geophysical measurements) in
boreholes in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. The basic idea of this
research is to utilize a nearly- new (and nearly fully-outfitted) geophysical
logging system acquired by GFZ for use in existing boreholes. In situ stress
orientation will be determined from detailed analysis of borehole televiewer
measurements. Over time, these measurements will help fill an extremely large
gap in knowledge of stress orientations and relative magnitudes. The U.S.
Geological Survey will collaborate in this effort as will investigators from the
countries in which the holes are located.
