9415451 Barrett This three-year award will support U.S.-France cooperative
research in nuclear physics between Bruce R. Barrett of the University of
Arizona and Piet van Isacker at GANIL (Grand Accelerateur National d' Ions
Lourds), Caen, France. The objective of their research is the study of
properties of exotic light nuclei away from the proton and neutron lines of
stability. They propose to reach as high a mass as A=11 in order to investigate
the so-called "halo" structure. Studies on large-scale microscopic (also known
as shell- model) calculations will be complemented by model calculations
utilizing the Interactive Boson Model-3. Recent advances in nuclear structure
theory and computer technology will be applied to these investigations. Dr.
Barrett brings to this project expertise in shell-model calculations and
effective theory. This is complemented by the French investigators' experience
in group theory and Interacting Boson Model. The project takes advantage of
excellent facilities at GANIL, including a very powerful LISE spectrometer, and
provides access to an experimental group currently performing investigations on
the structure of exotic light nuclei. These studies on nuclear structure have
important applications in energy research, physics and astronomy. ***
