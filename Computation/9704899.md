9704899 Lamm The main goal of this project is to develop local regularization
methods for the solution of ill-posed inverse problems such as those arising in
applications of inverse heat conduction and image reconstruction. The ideas of
local regularization developed by the P.I. naturally lead to a "predictor-
corrector" type of solution method. The idea is that a regularized solution is
first obtained on a small part of the domain of the solution, after which
subsequent correction is applied in order to avoid oversmoothing. This method
has been seen to be as effective as standard Tikhonov regularization for
Volterra problems, with improved computational performance. In addition, the
scheme naturally suggests a "variable regularization" approach in which a
functional regularization parameter is used to apply more smoothing in some
parts of the domain and less in others. In this project the P.I. plans to
continue to develop the existing theory for Volterra problems, and to extend
this theory to non-Volterra problems of the type arising in image reconstruction
and image deblurring. The design of a theoretically-sound adaptive process of
selecting the functional parameter is an essential and difficult part of this
project. Inverse problems naturally arise in numerous scientific applications,
including biomedical imaging (Magnetic Resonance Imaging and CAT scans), the
nondestructive thermal testing and analysis of materials, satellite sensing of
remote images, and geophysical applications such as seismic and reservoir
engineering. These problems are of considerable challenge to scientists because
they often lead to very large computational problems which are extremely
sensitive to errors in data. The aim of this project is to develop new methods
for the stable and efficient solution of such inverse problems. The successful
attainment of this goal would have an important impact on applications such as
biotechnology, remote imaging, and materials science.
