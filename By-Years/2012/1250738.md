This grant provides partial financial support for a two-day workshop that will
bring together ERFI/RESIN principal investigators, program directors, and others
from universities, federal agencies, and industries to discuss theories and
methods to advance the design of future infrastructures that will be more
resilient and sustainable in light of the growing coupling between
infrastructures. A white paper will be crafted on the challenges facing
researchers in this field. Included will be identification of research gaps,
determination of common ground that defines metrics and evolving theories of
sustainability and resiliency. The workshop will continue to define education
requirements for professionals charged with designing and managing complex,
critical infrastructures.
