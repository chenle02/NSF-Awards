This is a collaborative project between C. Rogers (Tufts U.) and J. Eaton
(Standford U.). A combined experimental-numerical simulation approach is
proposed to displace the masuring control volume of an LDV system as it were a
particle in a turbulent field. The LDV system will use an active control loop.
The fluid velocity autocorrelations in a particle-Lagrangian reference frame,
and the correlations between the fluctuating velocities of the particle and the
fluid at the same point, will be detrmined. The obtained data are similar to the
results derived from direct numerical simulations, which currently are feasible
only at turbulent flow with low Reynolds numbers. The results may be useful to
calibrate various theories and numerical simulations in tow phase flows. The
conditions of the experiment are simplified: only point particles are simulated,
particles do not affect the flow, the testing domain is two- dimensional, the
effects of particle shape and wake are considered. The present project may lead
to significant advances in understanding and modeling disperse two-phase flow at
high Reynolds numbers of interest in various industrial processes.
