The basic output feedback invariants for linear systems are discovered. These
invariants are a list of quantities from the knowledge of which one can
determine whether two systems are feedback equivalent. There are many important
applications of these calculations; for example, it is expected that they will
lead to the solution of the problem of determining a minimum order stabilizing
compensator for a given plant.
