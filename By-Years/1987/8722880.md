Magnetization-vector measurements are proposed for the detailed investigation of
rotational magnetic processes in various spin- glass alloy systems (e.g. Copper-
Manganese, Gold-Iron), including the onset of irreversibility arising from
dissipative rotations of the anisotropy (initially produced by field-cooling)
relative to the disordered crystal lattice. The lattice instability of the cubic
phase of Yttrium-Copper (indicated by anomalous quadrupolar interactions in
Holmium1-xYttriumxCopper of high x) will be probed by inelastic neutron
scattering experiments. A binding-potential model for the structural instability
of cubic Praseodymium-Silver1-xCopperx will be tested against neutron
diffraction data on the orthorhombic compounds of high x. A series of
Lanthanum2-xNeodymiumxCopper Oxide4 compounds spanning the composition for the
tetragonal-orthorhombic transition will be studied magnetically for quadrupolar-
coupling evidence of a lattice instability. Magnetization, specific heat, and
resistivity measurements, supplemented by neutron diffraction work, will be
performed on Terbium1-xYttriumxSilver and Gadolinium1-xYttriumxSilver in a study
of the percolation- breakdown of the long-range antiferromagnetism with
increasing x.
