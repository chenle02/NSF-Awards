The goal of the proposed research is to demonstrate epitaxial growth, by laser
ablation in a UHV vacuum system of high quality, insulating oxide films onto
heated single crystal silicon substrates, followed by CVD epitaxial growth of
silicon onto the insulating oxide. Based on recent reports of successful
epitaxial growth of MgO on silicon and gallium arsenide, CeO2 on silicon, and
PrO2 on silicon, we propose to focus on MgO, CeO2, and PrO2 as the candidate
epitaxial insulating layers. Although a successful process would open up many
applications, the goal for this work is to enable a silicon-on-insulator
structure in which the insulator is grown epitaxially. Alternatively, the
epitaxial oxide film may provide a highly selective etch stop for a bond-and-
etch-back silicon-on-insulator process.
