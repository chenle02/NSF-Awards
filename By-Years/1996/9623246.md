9623246 Harp Multilayer magnetic thin films containing 4d elements (Nb, Mo, Ru,
Rh, Pd) are fabricated as candidate materials for enhanced magnetic properties.
Properties of interest are magnetic moment, magnetic anisotropy,
magnetoresistance, and Kerr rotation. All of these properties are critical for
magnetic recording applications. Magnetic properties are characterized using
magnetometry, magnetotransport, and x- ray diffraction. The students involved
with this research will be employable in the magnetic data storage industry, and
are encouraged to gain experience relevant to industry, such as with sputter
deposition of thin films. Students are given support for summer internships in
industry. Furthermore, an upper level undergraduate course in solid state
physics is developed that uses computer simulations to demonstrate basic
concepts. %%% Of all the more than 100 elements, only three transition metals,
iron cobalt, and nickel are ferromagnetic at room temperature. As a result,
these three are incorporated into nearly every device that uses magnetic
materials, from electric motors to computer hard disk drives. This research aims
at making new ferromagnetic materials by sandwiching very thin layers of some
other transition metals between layers of iron, cobalt, nickel, or other
materials. These layers are only a few atoms thick. Theories predict that such
`multilayer' structures may possess properties useful to improved computer hard
disk drives. The students involved with this research will be employable in the
