This award provides supplemental funds to Physics grant 9100221 which provided
support for construction of the high resolution eye detector, a set of
instrumentation which allows scientists to study the nature and origin of the
highest energy cosmic rays. The additional funding provided in this award will
allow the US scientists to work with Chinese scientists who are conducting
another experiment, in China, which exposes photographic emulsion to cosmic
rays. Data produced by the Chinese experiment is complementary to the data from
the US experiment, and through this collaboration, both groups will have ready
access to each body of data for comparison. The Chinese facility is located in
Tibet, and without cooperation of this kind, it would be unlikely that US
scientists would have access to the data obtained there. Chinese scientists will
also visit the US to work directly with the team of scientists at the US
facility in Utah.
