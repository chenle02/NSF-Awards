Stanford University is awarded a grant to enhance an existing biological
knowledge resource known as Open WetWare that enables researchers to organize
and disseminate protocols, interim and negative results, and contextual metadata
generated during the execution of bench biology research. The system provides a
groupware type of collaborative environment that is currently used by 1000 users
in 60 labs. The specific tasks are to establish leadership and technical
infrastructure under a sustainable model, develop additional tools for expanding
the types and organization of knowledge that is managed by the system, and
implement a Wiki-based framework for distributing and supporting the software.
Establishment of OWW as a community resource will enable collaboration, promote
better practices for data documentation and sharing, aid development of
educational materials, and provide bench biologists with meta-level linkages to
other biological knowledge resources.
