The investigator plans to study problems in algebraic and geometric topology
and algebraic K-theory. These include studying K-theory parameterized by metric
spaces, studying infinite groups acting on a sphere cross euclidean space,
studying the L-groups of certain infinite groups, and studying controlled-type
surgery theories. Topology arose originally as an approach to the study of
differential equations. Over the intervening century it has evolved
prodigiously, often seeming to have a life entirely its own and independent of
its source. Increasingly, however, it has begun to repay its debt. The point is
that it is often more important to know of the solution of an equation whether
it is a closed loop or whether it is knotted, for example, than to know
precisely and numerically what are the coordinates of all its points.
Furthermore, although the former qualitative information is implicitly contained
in the latter complete description, it is not at all obvious how to extract it.
The sophisticated machinery that has been developed by topologists, such as the
surgery groups and algebraic K-theory which are under investigation in this
project, has now been developed to a degree that often permits these natural
problems to be handled in a natural way.
