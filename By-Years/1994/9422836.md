Will the expansion of democratic governance in Africa lead to a strengthening of
national identities and a consolidation of nation-states or will it lead instead
to an intensification of ethnic, religious, regional or linguistic identities
and the emergence of sub-national groups with revisionist demands? This research
will assess the impact of democratic political change in two Central African
nations, Zambia and Malawi following recent transitional elections. Attitudinal
surveys will be conducted in each country with questions repeating those
conducted in earlier surveys. This design permits longitudinal analysis of
political cleavages in these nations that are undergoing rapid political and
social change.
