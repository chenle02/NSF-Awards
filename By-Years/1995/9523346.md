This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
will assist the Department of Chemistry at the University of Texas in the
purchase of an upgrade of the existing Fluorimeter. This new instrumentation
will enhance greatly research in a number of areas, including the following:
novel photoreactive amphiphilic polymers, novel probes of photochemical
mechanisms, vectorial electron transfer in spatially ordered arrays, development
of artificial enzymes, carbohydrate receptors and sensors, synthesis and study
of new expanded porphyrins superconductor-based optical detectors. The
fluorimeter measures the fluorescent radiation emitted by a material which is
exposed to monochromatic radiation. It is used in studying chemical kinetics
todetermine amplitudes and rate constants that are extracted from fluorescence
decay.
