This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
develop copper-graphite and copper-SiC composites with 40-50V% reinforcement
loading using a microencapsulated powder metallurgy process. These
microencapsulated powders will be combined with injection molding for the low
cost fabrication of highly complex parts such as a finner radiator. The project
will demonstrate an economical solution to metal matrix composite
microstructural control and reliability problems, and will develop a new, high
performance class of materials able to be used with injection molding and rapid
prototyping equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts from this
technology would be first demonstration of injection molded metal matrix
composites, opening up and entirely new range of properties/cost for performance
materials. The combination of high thermal performance and low cost solves a
number of problems with waste heat management in automotive/transportation,
space vehicle, heating and climate control, as well as electronics and power
conditioning applications. Furthermore, the ability to injection mold highly
loaded metal matrix composites will be immediately translatable into structural,
optical, and wear/mechanical components.
