This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of
2021 (Public Law 117-2). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this Small
Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to understand, and
eventually manipulate, the immune, metabolic and microbial activities that occur
in the intestines for the purpose of improving human health. Many important
diseases are caused or regulated by activities in our intestines, yet very
little is known about this hard-to-access organ. This project will develop a
pill-sized gastrointestinal sampling device for routine, non-invasive sampling
of the human gut and the analysis of its metabolic, microbial, and immunological
content for the first time. The discoveries enabled by this project may lead to
new commercial opportunities in diagnosing and treating important disorders,
such as inflammatory bowel disease.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project
seeks to perform validations of a pill-sized gastrointestinal sampling device
for routine, non-invasive sampling of the human gut using bench testing and
evaluations of clinical samples. The team will also prepare the collected data
for submission to the Food and Drug Administration for market clearance.
Sampling the human intestinal tract safely, non-invasively and reliably is a
daunting challenge due to the constraints on the size of a device that is safe
to swallow and the variability of human physiology. The technology will lead to
the commercialization of the first gut sampling device in the market. The device
may help elucidate the roles of the gut microbes and their interactions with the
immune system and metabolic processes in human health and
disease.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
