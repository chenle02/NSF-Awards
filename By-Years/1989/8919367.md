In this project within the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organo- metallic
Chemistry Program, David E. Wigley of the University of Arizona will investigate
the chemistry of a recently discovered arene tantalum complex and other related
complexes of tantalum and tungsten in which the transition metals are in
intermediate oxidation states. These compounds may be of value in developing
carbon-hydrogen activation chemistry as well as leading to new synthetic
methodologies in organic chemistry and in arene chemistry in particular. The
combination of intermediate oxidation states ıtypically tantalum(III) or
tungsten(IV)! and hard pi-donor ligands ıtypically alkoxides! can be expected to
impart high reactivity to these complexes. General synthetic routes to these
arene transition metal alkoxide compounds will be investigated, the mechanism of
intramolecular C-H metallation examined, and other reactions of the arene
moieties surveyed.
