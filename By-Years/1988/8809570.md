This research is focused on building a theoretical foundation for machine
learning. In this theory, it can be shown whether or not learning is feasible in
given situations, the nature of the resources required, and the possibility of
extending learning algorithms successfully from one situation to another. The
main approach is based on reductions - relationships between learning problems
and better understood combinatorial optimization problems. The importance of
this research is that programs which learn - improve their performance by
experience, without explicit programming - will be a central part of future
computer systems. In order to shed light on the many possible approaches to
machine learning, it is vital to build theoretical foundations, describing what
is learnable in theory and what is not, within practical limitations of time and
resources. This award is being funded as one of the 1988 Research Initiation
Awards for outstanding new investigators in the Computer and Information Science
and Engineering (CISE) Directorate.
