The objectives of this research are (a) to enhance the information content of
current geometric models to convey information necessary for machining, and (b)
to develop an integrated, automated method for manufacturing data generation
that interacts with all phases of die and mold manufacturing. The enhancement of
information content of geometric models will focus on methods for representing
incremental changes in topology and geometry as a result of machining operations
(surface roughness levels of detail will be considered). The geometry of the
manufactured surface will be generated by considering the interactions between
the tool and workpiece. Specifically, the information of excess material left
behind as a result of the previous pass will be used to generate paths for
various activities (e.g., milling, grinding, measuring, etc.) thereby
integrating these activities. This research, if successful, will result in
improvements in the process of manufacturing data generation for dies and molds
leading to savings in time and improved accuracy. In addition, a new framework
for representing manufactured surfaces (in the context of dies and molds) will
result, providing a seamless flow of information across activities that are
currently independent thereby reducing the product development cycle.
