This award will support early career researcher attendance at the Optogenetic
Technologies and Applications Conference, which will be held in Boston, MA on
December 8-10 of 2019. The conference aims to promote collaborative,
interdisciplinary research by bringing engineers and life science researchers
together at the same venue. The conference is designed to be highly interactive,
with talks, poster sessions, panel discussions and informal meetings. The
conference is organized into sessions on optogenetic technologies, optogenetics
in biomedicine and optogenetics in bioengineering. There will be ample
opportunity for sharing the latest research results and for
networking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Optogenetics is an emerging technique that
allows researchers to use light in order to control living cells that have been
modified to be light sensitive. Optogenetics has tremendous potential for use in
research, medicine and industry. The Optogenetic Technologies and Applications
Conference will be used to showcase the novel and cutting-edge research
conducted in this field. The conference aims to provide a venue for the
following: (1) scientific presentations from a diverse group of researchers,
including biologists, chemists, and engineers; (2) bringing together members of
industry and academia to showcase different perspectives and approaches, as well
as to encourage potential collaborations; (3) encouraging active participation
of graduate and post-doctoral researchers who represent the future of the field;
(4) bringing scientists and engineers together to discuss their disciplines and
approaches, and to motivate new research into barriers limiting the development
of optogenetics in a variety of fields; (5) scientists who are from
underrepresented groups to present their research and to
network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
