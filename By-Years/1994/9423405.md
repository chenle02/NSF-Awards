This grant provides funding to purchase shipboard and shorebased instrumentation
in support of NSF-funded research. The shipboard instruments will be used aboard
the R/V MOANA WAVE, a 213 foot vessel, which is owned by the Navy and operated
by the University in support of oceanographic research. Instrumentation funded
includes computer hardware, repair of water bottles, a CTD, a thermosalinograph,
a continuous seawater sampling system, a fluorometer, a portable sonobuoy
system, an optical scanning system, a portable digital scope, and shipboard
meteorological sensors. The instrumentation is required for support of NSF-
funded cruises aboard the MOANA WAVE during 1995 and to enhance the scientific
capability of the vessel in the future. ??
