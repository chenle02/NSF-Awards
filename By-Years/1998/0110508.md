The broad, long-term objectives of this project are to determine the genetic and
molecular mechanisms by which nuclear receptors control post-embryonic
development. The short-term goals are to identify genes involved in nuclear
receptor signaling pathways. Genes that are involved in nuclear receptor
signaling will be identified in Drosophila melanogaster using both genetic and
molecular approaches. A primary genetic screen will identify candidate loci that
enhance phenotypes associated with sensitized stocks in which nuclear receptor
signaling has been compromised. A secondary screen will identify those candidate
loci in which the enhancement correlates with altered expression levels of
ecdysone-responsive genes; genes whose expression is dependent upon appropriate
nuclear receptor signaling. A subset of chromosomal deficiencies stocks and
approximately 100 EP stocks will be tested. EP stocks carry single random
insertions of a modified P-element that allows ectopic expression of the gene
residing near the P-element. These genetic screens have the potential to
identify genes that physically interact with nuclear receptors, genes that are
direct targets of nuclear receptors, and genes that are further downstream in
nuclear receptor regulated pathways. To complement this genetic approach, a
yeast two-hybrid screen will b used to identify proteins that physically
interact with the amino-terminal domain of the A-isoform of the ecdysone
receptor (EcR-A). Understanding the genetic and molecular mechanisms by which
nuclear receptors and their ligands function is significant because nuclear
receptor signaling coordinates the development of virtually all organs and
tissues in higher eukaryotes. Thus, to fully appreciate and understand
developmental mechanisms, it is necessary to understand the role that nuclear
receptors play in orchestrating the developmental program. The proposed
activities are significant because they have the potential to identify
biologically relevant interactions between genes involved in nuclear receptor
signaling pathways.
