It is now recognized that more than 50% of the stars in our Galaxy are in binary
systems. Some of these binary stars are contact binaries, meaning that their
atmospheres are in contact and that the two stars interact strongly (tidal
interactions, mass transfer). The Principal Investigator proposes in this
Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) proposal to observe a relatively
homogenous sample of contact binaries with the aim of determining 1. their
masses ratios, radii, and luminosities and 2. testing current theories of the
origin and evolution of these systems.
