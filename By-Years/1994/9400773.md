We present a user interface paradigm for database management systems that is
motivated by scientific visualization applications. Our graphical user interface
includes a "boxes and arrows" notation for database access and a flight
simulator model of movement through information space. We also provide means to
specify a hierarchy of abstracts of data of different types and resolutions, so
that a "zoom" capability can be supported. The underlying DBMS support for this
system is described and includes the compilation of query plans into megaplans,
new algorithms for data buffering, and provisions for a guaranteed rate of data
delivery. This proposal requests resources to continue the exploration of these
topics and to build a prototype implementation of our ideas, which we have named
Tioga.
