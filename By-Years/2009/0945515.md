This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) project will result in the design
and manufacture of an industrial quality, electrochemical, Carbon Monoxide (CO)
sensor based on screen-printed electronics technology. Printed electronics is a
growing field, and some groups have applied it to create low-cost biosensors or
temperature sensors. However, no one has yet applied printed electronics to
making an electrochemical (EC) gas sensors. The team has extensive knowledge and
experience in the design and manufacture of electrochemical sensors, and has
done prior R&amp;D with printed sensor electrodes. As such, the company has the
unique opportunity and qualifications to merge these two fields and create an
innovative product of significant merit: an industrial quality electrochemical
sensor costing less than $0.25 to produce in high volume (as compared to
industrial EC sensors that can cost well over $20 to purchase even in volume).
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research arise from the fact
that while the sensor proposed will be ideal for detection of CO only, very few
changes to the production techniques developed through this SBIR will be
required to produce similar EC sensors for the detection of other toxic gases.
These gases include: O2, NO, H2S, SO2, Ozone, and NO2, for which EC sensors are
commonly needed and used. The design, production, and sales of electrochemical
sensors, and the monitors/detectors that incorporate them, is a worldwide market
valued in the hundreds of millions of dollars. These sensors and detectors are
used to detect a variety of gases in fields such as environmental monitoring and
control, fuel processing, medical gas, national security, home inspection, first
responder, worker safety and health, scientific research, and personal and home
protection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
