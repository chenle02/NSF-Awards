9317301 Prasanna Future parallel processing systems will consist of diverse high
performance computers integrated to form a Heterogeneous Computing Network that
allows them to cooperate in solving complex scientific and engineering problems.
Each machine connected to the network may be suitable for a different class of
parallel computations. Such an organization will exploit the current advances in
parallel hardware architectures, interconnection technologies, and programming
paradigms to provide a cost-effective environment for high performance parallel
computing. Efficient utilization of such an environment depends on a number of
issues to be addressed including techniques to partition application tasks and
map the subtasks onto various machines in the network. This research addresses
several key issues in using a heterogeneous computing environment. The work will
focus on modeling the Heterogeneous Computing paradigm for algorithm
development, addressing the computational issues involved in using such a
paradigm, design of partitioning and mapping strategies, and integrating these
strategies into existing programming systems to solve computationally demanding
problems in image understanding. ***
