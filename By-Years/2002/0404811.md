MIDWEST COMMUTATIVE ALGEBRA AND GEOMETRY MEETING: A CONFERENCE IN HONOR OF
JOSEPH LIPMAN

Commutative algebra has seen a great deal of activity and success over the past
two decades, with the solution of important conjectures, the development of new
directions, and the discovery of unexpected connections to other parts of
mathematics, ranging from topology to combinatorics and from computer algebra to
statistics.

Perhaps the most fruitful interaction remains the one between commutative
algebra and algebraic geometry. Our conference will continue the long standing
tradition of Midwest meetings in these fields. We will bring together many of
the leading national and international experts on the following topics that have
been of central importance to both areas: - Resolution of singularities -
Singularity theory - Rees algebras and Briancon-Skoda theorems - Duality theory
and homological algebra.
