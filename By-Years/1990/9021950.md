This award supports a workshop which assesses the status of and identifies
research needs and opportunities in the field of intelligent control systems.
Many of the topics addressed at the meeting have a direct bearing on research
supported by the Dynamic Systems and Control Program as well as other programs
in the Engineering and CISE directorates. Specifically, the theory of
intelligent control systems, the formulation and application of intelligent
control systems, knowledge based control systems, and software/hardware issues
for real time intelligent control are included in the workshop topics. Support
of this proposal satisfies, in part, several key NSF goals including
strengthening cooperation between industry and university researchers, and
aiding in the transfer of technology from the research level to the users. It
also represents cooperation between a government research agency and an
independent organization on research of mutual interest to the two entitles
involved. The workshop objective is to develop a better understanding of
specific research needs, and to identify specific research areas whose
exploitation will be instrumental in achieving the full potential of intelligent
control systems.
