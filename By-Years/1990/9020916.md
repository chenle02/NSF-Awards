The theme of the Trent Homotopy Conference is the interplay between a space and
its loop space under certain finiteness conditions. There are several lines of
inquiry related to this theme which are of current interest and in which major
contributions have recently been made. This grant will help defray expenses for
American researchers in this area to attend this conference to be held June
9-15, 1991 in Ontario, Canada. Established experts in the various areas will be
brought together, along with younger researchers and some students, to foster
beneficial exchanges of ideas, problems and techniques.
