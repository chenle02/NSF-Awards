The Community Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMC) is an interagency center
devoted to space weather modeling and prediction. One of the goals of the CCMC
is to determine which space weather models are appropriate for use in
operational space weather forecasting. This project will examine the various
metrics and scientific validation methods that should be applied to space
weather models. The CCMC staff will perform direct data-model comparisons for
space weather events. It will also provide an independent, unbiased forum for
calculating the prediction or nowcasting metrics for different space weather
models. In addition to the calculation of metrics and general scientific
validation of models, the CCMC will explore the models performances under
different space weather conditions to determine the limits under which the
models can be used.
