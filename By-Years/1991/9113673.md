This proposal is part of a systematic study of the Arctic environment and its
role in global change promoted by NSF's Arctic System Science Program. It is a
two year project to quantitatively investigate aspects of the Arctic hydrologic
cycle that are most relevant to the freshwater input to the Arctic Ocean.
Existing rawinsonde data will provide the basis for computations of atmospheric
water vapor convergence and of net P-E (Precipitation minus Evaporation) over
the Arctic Ocean and the arctic drainage basins of northern land areas. The
computations will use daily data to obtain estimates of monthly hydrologic
quantities for a 30-year period, 1961-1991.
