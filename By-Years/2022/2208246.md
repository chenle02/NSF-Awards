The conference “From Subfactors to Quantum Topology” will be held in Geneva,
Switzerland, June 27 - July 1, 2022. The topics will cover quantum invariants in
low-dimensional topology, subfactor theory, and their connections to many
branches of mathematics and theoretical physics. The conference will consist of
talks by leading experts as well as early-career mathematicians. Many talks are
survey talks directed to a wide audience and suitable for graduate students and
young mathematicians. This award provides partial travel support to US-based
mathematicians, particularly those in the early stages of their
careers.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The conference will address topics on quantum
invariants, topological quantum field theories, Khovanov and Heegaard Floer
homology, the volume, AJ, slope, and knot-quiver conjectures, subfactors, and
planar algebras,. It will provide a venue for sharing new results in the related
fields; it will increase collaboration and communication among research experts
globally; and it will introduce researchers, especially students and early
career researchers, to important areas of current research. The conference

been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
