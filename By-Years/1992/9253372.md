Talcott Mountain Science Center, in cooperation with the Urban Schools Learning
Network (encompassing a variety of state, regional and national partners), seeks
$698,141 in National Science Foundation funds under the Informal Science
Education Program for a three year national model for increased minority
interest and participation in Informal Science Education Program for a three
year national model for increased minority interest and participation in
informal science education. The title of this partnership is Project PROMMISE
)Promoting Role Model Minorities in Science Education). Over the next three
years, Project PROMMISE will produce and broadcast at least 30 distance learning
programs for thousands of secondary level students in urban and disadvantaged
communities throughout the U.S. These Project PROMMISE broadcasts will bring
distinguished minority and women scientists, explorers, astronauts and other
figures in touch with urban young people through interactive video programming.
Broadcasts will be preceded and followed by hands- on informal science education
activities. The project also will broadcast national career exposure,
exploration, and mentoring programs to better inform urban minority students of
academic and career enrollment in secondary and post-secondary math, science and
technology studies and cultural isolation by urban students, teachers and urban
informal science education institutions. Major national partners for reform and
pre- college minority enrichment are participating in the project, including the
Edna McConnell Clark Middle School Change Network, the Museum Satellite Network,
PIMMS at Wesleyan, the CT Pre- Engineering Program (CPEP). Private sector
support has been gained from United Technologies, CIGNA and Union Carbide.
