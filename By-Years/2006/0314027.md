Professor Zeev Rosenzweig of the University of New Orleans is funded by the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program to develop a new generation of
fluorescence nanosensors suitable for intracellular measurements with high
sensitivity, selectivity and reproducibility. One approach is to miniaturize
lipobeads, which are polymer nanoparticles coated with a layer of phospholipids,
to produce sensors for glutathione, chloride and nitric oxide. In a second
objective, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) based interactions
between fluorescent nanoparticles and drug molecules will be used to monitor
drug delivery into neurons.

The in situ, temporal and spatial mapping of intracellular concentrations of
specific target molecules is of enormous priority in biology. Present reporter
molecules are sometimes inadequate to detect certain key molecules and drugs
non-invasively. The ability to monitor the locale and timing of analytes in
living cells can contribute to the understanding of how they work and the
effects of physiological conditions on them.
