9317576 Jenski This proposal's objective is to obtain funds to establish a
fluorescence laboratory equipped with a research grade fluorescence
spectrophotometer. The fluorescence laboratory will be stationed in the
Department of Biology (in the School of Science) at Indiana University - Purdue
University at Indianapolis (IUPUI), serve four major and three minor users, and
contain a Perkin-Elmer LS-50B Luminescence Spectrometer. The Department now has
only an old, very inadequate and heavily used fluorescence spectrophotometer. As
a result, research in existing labs has been severely compromised and the
development of new faculty will be hampered. Unlike the old spectrophotometer,
the LS-50B Luminescence Spectrometer will be able to maintain viable cells or
heavy cell components in suspension, analyze cell monolayers, accept substance
during a run, monitor at dual wavelengths in millisecond intervals, and rapidly
read multiple samples. The biologic applications for the fluorescence
spectrophotomer include monitoring the expression of membrane proteins on cell
monolayers, kinetics of protein redistribution on membrane surfaces, membrane
permeability and fusion, membrane structure and dynamics, calcium binding
proteins, and intracellular calcium and pH levels. These experimental
measurements are essential for the continued development of the research
programs of the principal investigators. iH5 ~CRD1D46TMP jH5 ~CAL3171TMP =_5
