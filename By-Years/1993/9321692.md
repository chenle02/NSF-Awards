9321692 Mendelssohn Global sea level rise is expected to result in severe
impacts to coastal ecosystems. However, mechanisms affecting regeneration of
vegetation following disturbances in low salinity marshes most susceptible to
impacts are poorly understood. Disturbances that kill plants may result in
different patterns of regeneration than non-killing disturbances, leading to
differences in community structure. The objectives of this dissertation research
are to: (1) examine the ability of vegetation to resist invasion by other
species when affected by killing or non-killing disturbances, (2) investigate
the role of salinity and disturbance in species dominance patterns in salt marsh
vegetation. A series of field and greenhouse experiments will be employed. %%%
Detailed knowledge of mechanisms affecting regeneration of vegetation is crucial
to out ability to predict the responses of plant communities in coastal marshes
to global sea level rise. This research will contribute significantly to the
growing body of knowledge regarding the effects of sea level rise on coastal
wetlands, as well as further understanding of the role of changing environmental
conditions in plant community dynamics. ***
