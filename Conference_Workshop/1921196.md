The "Moving Towards Action" workshop to improve the culture and climate in the
mathematical sciences will take place in conjunction with the 2020 Joint
Mathematics Meeting (JMM) in Denver, Colorado on Tuesday, January 14, 2020. When
members of the mathematics community are made to feel unwelcome in our
profession, the success of mathematics as a whole is put into jeopardy. This
workshop is focused on understanding and creating welcoming environments--
providing actionable information and process change plans to mathematics
department interested in driving cultural change at their respective
institutions--so as to invite more people to enter and persist in STEM
disciplines. The approach proposed through this workshop will (1) establish the
impacts of sexual harassment, how climate and policies can affect the prevalence
of sexual harassment, and the recommendations for improving climate and
institutional structures, based on the NASEM's Sexual Harassment of Women
report; (2) provide guidance to define a desired workplace climate from an
interpersonal perspective, and actions towards achieving awareness and adoption;
(3) supply tools, techniques and training to respond to behaviors that undermine
a welcoming environment; (4) present guidance in identifying gaps in university
policies that drive unwanted behaviors and provide a recommended structure for
responding when such issues are discovered; (5) initiate guided development of
individual action plans for implementing change at participant's home
institutions. These objectives will be reached through a variety of activities,
including speakers, a panel, interactive bystander intervention training, and an
optional poster presentation by the participants. In particular, speakers will
include experts in organizational development and sexual harassment,
professionals knowledgeable about best practices in policy implementation in
academia, and an expert in defining and creating inclusive work environments.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
