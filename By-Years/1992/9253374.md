This project will produce and evaluate a pilot program with supplementary print
material for a half-hour science radio series for Children. The series will
target children 8 to 10 years old, but will be designed to include the entire
family. Each program will consist of educational songs, interviews, stories,
call-in questions and "hands-on" experiments. The support material will provide
additional science activities that may appropriately be conducted in the home
and in classrooms. The budget for this pilot phase is $266,521 of which $215,940
is being provided by the NSF. The full series, once produced, is planned to be
broadcast through the Children's Radio Network. The AAAS will be responsible for
development and management of the outreach component of the project.//
