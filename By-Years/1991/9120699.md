A stable genetic mechanism for sex determination is a prerequisite for the
maintenance of separate sexes in a species. This in turn requires that those
genes promoting or suppressing female and male expression be located on the same
chromosome. Chromosomal sex determination, uncommon in plants, is widespread in
animals and is almost invariably accompanies by morphological differentiation of
the X and Y chromosomes. The relatively recent origin of sex chromosomes in
plants means that, in many cases, closely related species which lack sex
chromosomes, also exist. The existence of variation in sex chromosome
differentiation within a closely related group of plants provide a model system
for the study of the origin of sex chromosomes. The Y chromosomes in Silene will
be studied as a test of theoretical predictions concerning their structure,
function, and evolutionary development. To trace the evolutionary history of the
Y, a collection DNA-based genetic markers will be generated from Y chromosomes
isolated using flow cytometry and subsequently digested using restriction
enzymes. The resulting Y-specific DNA probes will be cross-hybridized with
metaphase chromosomes of S. latifolia as well as related species with and
without separate sexes the expectation is that the Y chromosome will have some
regions of similarity with the X . Auras of non-homology serve to prevent
recombination that would disrupt the 'active Y' sex determination of S.
latifolia. Second, the Y chromosome in S. latifolia is believed to be partially
dysfunctional. A quantitative genetic analysis of Y chromosome effects on floral
phenotypes will be using performed regressions over a range of degrees of
relationship (e.g. parent: offspring, grandparent:grand-offspring, half-sib,
etc.). This study will integrate diverse approaches, from molecular cytogenetics
to quantitative genetics, and will greatly enhance our understanding of the
genetic events involved in sex differentiation.
