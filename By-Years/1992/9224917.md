Whereas the fact that Genetic Algorithms are massively parallel positions them
to solve difficult problems by effectively exploiting modern computing
technology, the future of genetic search is unclear. Fundamental question
concerning GA response remain unanswered, partially because it is not apparent
from a theoretical vantage point what GAs are. Recent developments in their
formalization via probabilistic techniques are beginning to change this
situation. This project is directed at broadening the coherent group of results
which forms the most recent and complete theoretical underpinnings of simple GAs
to date. Specific objectives include characterizing the emergent behavior of the
simple GA as an evolutionary system, utilizing recent probabilistic
formalizations to analyze the behavior of evolutionary trajectories in
quantitative terms, and developing predictive relationships and principle
governing the direction of genetic search.//
