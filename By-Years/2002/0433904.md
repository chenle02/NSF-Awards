Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This first American-German conference
on changing Earth and its impact on human habitat is designed to provide a high-
level platform for transnational interdisciplinary exchange, cooperation and
joint research projects. The conference will establish networks and intensify
already existing contacts for junior scientists from both countries in the
geosciences and related fields. The organizers believe that this meeting will
stimulate discussion on future challenges and research directions in Earth
System Science. In particular, the conference will explore the couplings between
geosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere and atmosphere and their impact on earth
surface processes and the human habitat. Keynote lectures and poster
presentations will provide the basis for group discussions and informal
presentations. After the meeting the German Research Council encourages
participants to submit proposals for joint projects and future meetings of
research groups. The conference will cover three general topics which all relate
to the interactions between components of the earth system: 1. Earth and Fire:
Internal and external earth processes and relations to human habitats 2. Water
and Life: Organismic control of water cycle and water quality 3. Air and earth,
water, life: Changing climate. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will be held
in Washington, DC in April, 2004.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
