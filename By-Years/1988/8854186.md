Rochester Institute of Technology will operate a Faculty Development Workshop
in Software Engineering for approximately 30 undergraduate faculty during the
summer of 1988. Its objectives are (1) to broaden their awareness and
understanding of software engineering and (2) to provide a forum where issues
related to undergraduate instruction in software engineering can be presented
and discussed. Workshop sessions will be conducted jointly by professors and
industry participants. Staff from the Federally funded Software Engineering
Institute will also participate. Ample laboratory time will be available for
attendees to gain direct experience with new software engineering teaching and
research tools. A two and one-half year computer conference dedicated to
undergraduate instruction in software engineering will begin immediately after
the Workshop. The significance of this project lies in the eventual increase in
the numbers of undergraduate students who are able to receive effective and
contemporary instruction in a field of vital national interest. In addition to
the NSF funds, participants' institutions will contribute about 15% in travel
costs to the operation of the project.
