Natural convection is generally a weak mode of heat transfer. The thrust of
this proposal is to alter the mechanisms by which heat is transferred in natural
convection in order to enhance the rate of heat transfer. In a flow channel
whose walls are grooved transverse to the flow direction, the flowing fluid is
unable to follow the contour of the wall and separates from it. The separated
flow which, prior to separation, had been adjacent to the wall, is called a
shear layer. It is the destabilization of the shear layer that enhances the heat
transfer. The proposed research will investigate techniques to destabilize the
shear layer.
