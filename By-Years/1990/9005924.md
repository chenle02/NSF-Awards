This is a grant under the Scientific Computing Research Equipment for the
Mathematical Sciences program of the Division of Mathematical Sciences of the
National Science Foundation. This program supports the purchase of special
purpose computing equipment dedicated to the conduct of research in the
mathematical sciences. This equipment is required for several research projects
and would be difficult to justify for one project alone. Support from the
National Science Foundation is coupled with discounts and contributions from
manufacturers and with substantial cost-sharing from the institutions submitting
the proposal. This program is an example of academic, corporate, and government
cooperation in the support of the basic research in the mathematical sciences.
This equipment will be used to support four research projects in the Department
of Mathematics of Cornell University. The names of the investigators and the
titles of their projects follow: Bernd Sturmfels, Computational Invariant
Theory; Moss Sweedler, Determination of Adjacency of Semi-algebraic Sets; Louis
Billera, Groebner Basis Methods for Multivariate Splines; and Moss Sweedler,
Groebner Basis Optimization.
