This project dealing with the use of electrochemical techniques in organic
synthesis is being supported by the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry
Program. Linear molecules containing two or more distal functional groups are
being subjected to electrolysis to generate a radical anion at one site which
will react by carbon-carbon bond formation at the other functional group
resulting in the formation of ring-containing compounds. This research is
centered on an attempt to understand the various factors which govern the
cyclization process. Electroreductive cyclization reactions are being studied in
detail with a special emphasis placed upon an examination of the following
items: A. 1. Can substituents positioned at "strategically important locations"
on the tether be used as stereocontrol elements allowing for the regulation of
both relative and absolute stereochemistry? 2. Can proton donor surrogates
(e.g., Me3SiCl) and/or captodative effects be used to facilitate cyclization at
the expense of the unwanted C-C pi bond hydrogenation which occasionally
accompanies electroreductive cyclizations involving ketones? 3. Can
electroreductive cyclizations be conducted using a substrate wherein the alpha,
beta-unsaturated ester unit is tethered to an ester (a lactone), an acid
anhydride, or an acid halide? 4. Can the results of these investigations be used
to design and implement a rational synthesis of the biologically important and
architecturally interesting phorbol esters? B. Can mediators such as vitamin B12
or cobaloxime be used in electroreductive cyclization reactions and, if so, can
the reactions be conducted catalytically? The results of these studies are being
applied to model studies directed toward construction of bicyclo?5.3.O!undecane
framework common to a host of natural products. C. Finally, the synthetic
utility of electroreductive cyclization reactions involving systems containing
the carbon-carbon triple bond (e.g., alkynones and alkynoates) linked to an
easily reduced alkylidene malonate or an alkylidene Meldrum's acid subunit is
being examined. In this way, the initially formed alpha, beta-unsaturated
carbonyl compound should be inert to the conditions under which the reduction is
conducted and will consequently be available for further elaboration. Additional
studies focusing upon the use of a cyclopropyl Meldrum's acid subunit (a
spiroacylal) are being carried out.
