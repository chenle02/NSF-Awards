9314808 Conti It has not been possible to observe the most massive stars shortly
after their births because they are shrouded in the dust and gas clouds from
which they formed. However these clouds can be penetrated using infrared
radiation. Infrared spectra (near a wavelength of 2 microns) will be obtained
for obscured objects in star forming regions to identify the newly formed
massive stars. This will provide insights into the process of star formation and
help to understand star burst galaxies. ***
