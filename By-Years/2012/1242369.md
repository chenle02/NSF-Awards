In this EAGER proposal, the investigator proposes to conduct exploratory
research into threshold concepts in graduate student learning of biology. These
are concepts that are hypothesized to be transformative and critical in the
progression of a student as primarily a learner to a producer of knowledge. The
investigator and students will attempt to identify the skills and competencies
that are needed for students to succeed in their doctoral education and the
extent to which these might represent affirmation of the threshold concept
hypothesis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers will interview graduate
students and faculty as identified through a number of professional societies in
biology. Focus groups will also be conducted. The study represents among the
first studies of graduate learning and cognition in STEM fields. The research is
therefore exploratory and high risk. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this
research could have longer-term transformative effects on graduate education.
Identifying core competencies of how student learning and skills development
succeeds in biology could be used in improving the way in which graduate
students are taught and enhancing the productivity of learning.
