Diatoms are planktonic algae whose siliceous skeletons are commonly found in
the marine and freshwater fossil record. Principal Investigator Eugene Stoermer
proposes to continue his research into the evolutionary origins of freshwater
diatoms, and the ancestor-descendant relationships among living species of the
cymbelloid and gomphonemod diatoms. Light and scanning electron microscopy will
be used to study ultrastructure, cytology and valve morphology. Cladistic
methods will be used to reconstruct evolutionary relationships of living groups,
which will then be compared with the sequence of their appearances in the fossil
record. The proposed work has implications beyond the discipline of diatom
systematics. Diatoms are widely used as environmental indicators in lakes, and
the proposed work will improve their classification and identification criteria.
A better understanding of the tempo and mode of diatom evolution will emerge,
and the project will serve as a model for other researchers attempting to do
integrated research on modern and fossil species.
