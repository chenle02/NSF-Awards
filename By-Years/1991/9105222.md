This award provides 50% partial funding for the acquisition of a thermal
ionization mass spectrometer to be installed and operated in the Department of
Geology at the University of Maryland. The University is committed to providing
the remaining funds. The instrument is to be used primarily in the conduct of
research on the chemical evolution of the Earth's crust and mantle and in
investigations of the origin of noble metal ores. The isotopic systems to be
analyzed by mass spectrometry include rhenium-osmium, samarium-neodymium,
uranium-lead-thorium, rubidium- strontium, lithium, and boron.
