9753086 Figueroa The active population distribution of nitrifying bacteria is
difficult to study using traditional cultivation techniques such as most
probable number and selective plating. This is partially because nitrifying
bacteria grow very slowly - replicating once every eight hours under optimal
conditions compared to E. coli which replicates once every twenty minutes.
Culturing techniques also require the disruption of the biofilm structure and a
loss of spatial distribution information. One relatively new microbiological
technique that can be applied to an intact biofilm sample is Fluorescent In-Situ
Hybridization (FISH). The application of FISH to full-scale wastewater treatment
systems is limited. This could yield important information that can be
correlated with performance and then used to quantify the active population for
process modeling and optimization. Other techniques such as confocal microscopy
and microprobes may be applicable to intact biofilm samples collected from full-
scale trickling filters and may provide additional information for process
control. The main research objective is to investigate the application of
relatively new microbiological and biofilm techniques to characterize intact
biofilm samples and determine whether this information can be used to improve
process modeling and optimization. Secondary objectives are to develop new
skills and collaborative relationships to increase competitiveness for the use
of these novel techniques to quantify phenotypes and their distribution in full-
scale biofilm processes. ***
