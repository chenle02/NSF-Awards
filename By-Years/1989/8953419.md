This project expands the highly successful East Los Angeles College/Garfield
High School Advanced Placement Calcumlus Program to include additional
mathematics programs, and teacher enhancement programs for teachers of physics,
chemistry, and computer science. In all, twenty-seven K-12 teachers will be
instructed in the course design methods and teaching techniques of acclaimed
master teacher Jaime Escalante. The project continues the efforts in motivating
inner-city minority students towards serious involvement with mathematics and
science. The program will be for three years, and, in addition to the teachers,
will involve approximately 400 students. East Los Angeles College and the ARCO
Foundation are providing cost- sharing equal to 204% of the NSF funding.
