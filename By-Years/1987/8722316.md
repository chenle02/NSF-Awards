This proposal addresses the fundamental engineering issues of swallowing. This
is a "High Risk - High Gain" type of proposal. With the continuing increase in
the geriatric population, swallowing is becoming a significantly greater
societal problem. This PI has addressed the fundamental engineering issues of
swallowing in such a way that if the goals of the proposal are met, a new food
processing technology can be introduced that has the potential to alleviate the
swallowing deficiency and to create new markets for U.S. manufacturing.
