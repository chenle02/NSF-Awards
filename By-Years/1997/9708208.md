9705733 Fogel/Tuross Understanding the Earth's history in terms of climate,
environment, and biodiversity, relies on the chemical and isotopic analyses of
the ancient biota. The changes that occur in chemical structures and isotopic
signatures of organic macromolecules as they pass from the biological realm to
the geological environment will affect the way in which we are able to
deconvolute these signals for paleo-interpretations. The work defined in this
proposal bridges the gap between geochemical and ecological studies and the
field of molecular paleontology. In this project, we will measure the
disappearance of the CO2 fixing enzyme, Rubisco, and the gene encoding the
Rubisco protein, while searching for spectroscopic evidence of alterations in
residual plant material. Techniques for studying transformed biological material
will be developed to determine whether a larger, broader project is feasible.
