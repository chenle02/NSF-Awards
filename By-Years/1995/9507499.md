9507499 Rapid exchange of heat across the gills prevents most fish from being
warmer than the water in which they swim. The scombroid fish (mackerels, tunas,
marlins and swordfish) are a group of about 100 species in which endothermy, the
ability to keep some tissues (muscles, brain, eyes, digestive systems) warmer
than the surrounding sea water, has evolved several times. This research will
examine the mechanisms and adaptive significance of such endothermy in these
fish at levels ranging from molecular analyses to oceanographic studies at sea.
The biochemistry of changes in skeletal muscle that increase its ability to
generate heat will be determined. Laboratory and field measurements of free-
swimming warm-bodied tunas and closely related fish that are not endothermic
will test hypotheses about the advantages of endothermy. The physiological and
ecological significance of having warm body muscles or a "brain heater" will be
studied by examining the movements and thermal ecology of free-swimming
endothermic fish. These data will show how endothermy influences muscular
performance, locomotor capabilities and ecological diversity in scombroid fish.
It will contribute to understanding of the advantages of increasing the
temperature at which tissues and organs operate. The multidisciplinary approach
integrates information from molecular, cellular, ecological and evolutionary
studies. It will lead to a better understanding of the advantages of endothermy,
its ecological importance, and its impact on the ecological diversity of marine
fish.
