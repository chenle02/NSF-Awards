Under traditional assumptions, estimators converge at root n rates and have
asymptotic normal distributions when suitably standardized. The project will
study problems where such asymptotics fail, or where the traditional smoothness-
based methods of analysis are unable to handle unusual features of particular
problems. Work has already begun on examples where the failure is due to a near
lack of identifiability, or to the effects of boundaries of parameter spaces, or
to the effects of infinite dimensional nuisance parameters. Mixture problems, in
which all these difficulties arise naturally, will be the motivating examples
against which the new methods will be tested. The project will concentrate on
asymptotic problems in statistics and econometrics where the standard methods
fail. The PI has long been involved in the development of probability tools in
the area known as empirical process theory--an area that cuts across the fields
of statistics, econometrics, and computer science. The main aim of the project
is to adapt those tools, and invent new methods, to apply to currently
intractable asymptotic problems.
