This study of the 'shape' of STEM educational assessment data will exploit
recent advances in computational topology, machine learning and cognitive
science. Applications of computational topology to learning theory are both new
and innovative. It is anticipated that these new tools will provide critical
insights into student learning of Calculus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funded by NSF's
Research on Education and Learning (REAL) program, this early concept grant for
exploratory research will apply advanced topological, geometric, and Bayesian
methods to analyze the shape of data generated by students taking Calculus via a
massive open online course (MOOC) system (and other data sources). This project
will link data analyses from three leading learning platforms in the service of
better understanding student learning of Calculus. One potential high payoff is
the deployment of richer analyses of test and performance data to support a
recommendation system to support to students reaching their learning goals.
Further, the project will seed a new community of researchers across disciplines
that typically do not interact. The proposed line of work has the potential to
fundamentally change the way we think about assessment data in support of
mathematics learning and perhaps other STEM content.
