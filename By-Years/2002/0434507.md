With this Chemical Bonding Center (CBC) Phase I, Step II award, the Division of
Chemistry and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities of the Mathematical and
Physical Sciences Directorate jointly support the research of Jack W. Szostak,
of Massachusetts General Hospital, Steven A. Benner, of the University of
Florida, and Gerald F. Joyce, of the Scripps Research Institute. This CBC will
pursue the long-term goal of synthesizing artificial chemical systems that will
exhibit Darwinian evolution. In phase I of the project, a combination of
molecular design and laboratory selection will be used to generate RNA-like
structures that undergo self-reproduction with heritable mutation. The CBC will
utilize the synthetic organic skills of Benner, the expertise in RNA-like
systems of Joyce, and the experience of Szostak in the design of in vitro
evolution experiments in this highly collaborative endeavor. The synthesis of
Darwinian chemical systems will form the basis of a synthetic biology that has
the potential of constructing self-replicating systems using the tools of
preparative chemistry. This program at the interface of chemistry and biology
will provide broad interdisciplinary training for students and is expected to
capture the imagination of the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chemical Bonding
Centers are designed to focus innovative collaborative efforts that address a
"big problem" which will lead to a major advance in chemistry or at the
interface of chemistry and other sciences and will have the potential to attract
broad scientific and public interest.&lt;br/&gt;
