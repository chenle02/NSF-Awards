9624396 Huang A Shared distributed Facility for Multimedia Signal Processing
and Visualization with Applications to Human Computer Intelligent Interaction.
This Infrastructure award supports the acquisition of computational, networking,
and human interface equipment for multimedia laboratory for the investigation of
human centered information systems. The facility will connect three institutes:
the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology; the Coordinated
Science Laboratory; and the Digital Computer Laboratory. The research supported
by this laboratory will include research in multimodal human computer
interaction, multimodal imaging and visualization, multiresolution
representation and processing, and multimedia storage, networking, and
communication.
