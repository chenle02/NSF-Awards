The principal investigator proposes to continue the study of the classification
of Projective Varieties in Birational Geometry. The Minimal Model Program,
started by Mori around the 1970's, aims to generalize the classification of
projective surfaces to higher dimensional varieties. This Program was
successfully carried out in the 1980's for projective three-folds. The principal
investigator plans to carry out the Minimal Model Program in higher dimension,
aiming to complete the classification of complex projective varieties.Moroever,
the principal investigator plans to extend the Minimal Model Program to a
broader class of varieties defined in positive characteristic. Although the
techniques involved in this program are very different, he expect to obtain
results that are as strong as in the classical Minimal Model Program. Quite
apart from its own interest, it is hoped that this study will be very useful in
completing the classification of complex projective varieties. Finally, the
principal investigator intends to continue his study of the Kahler-Ricci flow on
a wide range of projective varieties, by translating Mori's work into an
analytic language.

Mathematical tools and concepts have been extensively applied in a wide range of
sciences such as physics, engineering and economics. In particular, birational
geometry has proven to be a very useful tool in theoretical physics, especially
in string theory. Cascini's recent work has already inspired several important
conferences. In particular, the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute
organized a one-week workshop entitled "Hot Topics: Minimal and Canonical Models
in Algebraic Geometry" to discuss the aforementioned results obtained by Cascini
and his collaborators. At the same time, seminars on the same topics were
organized in many departments of Mathematics in this country.
