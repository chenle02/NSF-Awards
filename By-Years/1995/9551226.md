The university has identified the need to provide real-life field experiences
using modern data gathering equipment for the Biology and Environmental Physical
Science classes. This project adds a global positioning system (GPS) component
to the laboratory sections of seven classes that have a field component. The
classes team Plant Taxonomy/Agrostology students with Ecology students for
vegetation identification and mapping exercises. Environmental Geology,
Environmental Geochemistry, and Hydrogeology students compile geologic and
hydrologic data to map potential land use and to determine sources and movements
of pollutants. Students present their results at joint poster sessions at the
conclusion of the semester. Selected students present their results at regional
meetings or at the Council on Undergraduate Research meeting. Field sites are
being chosen in conjunction with the U.S. Forest Service; the South Dakota Game,
Fish, and Parks Department; and The Nature Conservancy. Field data generated by
the classes are being shared with these and any other interested institutions.
