Professor Margaret E. Kastner and other members of the Chemistry Department at
Bucknell University are being supported to conduct a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry. For the period 1991-93, eleven
undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in a
variety of research projects. Two of these students will also continue their
research during the academic year. Projects involve synthesis of organic
compounds or metal complexes, structure determination by spectroscopic and
crystallographic methods, liquid chromatography and mass spectroscopy studies,
and enzyme purification and characterization. Students will present their work
at a poster session at the end of the program and will attend a lecture series
by a distinguised invited scientist.
