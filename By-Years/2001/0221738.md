0221738&lt;br/&gt;Eisenberg&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 12 month
project submitted by Dr. Robert Eisenberg, Rush-Presbyterian St. Luke's Medical
Center to request funds for 12 U.S. participants to attend a five-day U.S.-China
workshop on introduction of physicists and chemists to ions in protein channels,
to be held in Nanjing and Chongqing October 12-18, 2002. This is an
interdisciplinary workshop to introduce physicists and chemists to relevant
problems in biology. Bringing these scientists together to focus on problems in
a different discipline, with their counterpart researchers from East Asia is a
laudable goal. The NSF provides partial support to the U.S. participants to
attend this conference. The National Science Foundation of China, Nanjing
University of Chemical Technology, the Hong Kong University, and the University
of Utah also provide support to this workshop.
