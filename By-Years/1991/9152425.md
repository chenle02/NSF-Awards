The project proposes equipping the psychology department's laboratories with 14
Macintosh computers and related hardware as a practical and flexible way to
support our experimentally oriented courses. With emphasis on teaching,
providing a solid foundation in traditional areas of the discipline, and
involving undergraduate majors in significant research experiences, psychology
is a relatively strong undergraduate department. At the center of our curriculum
is a core of three courses in experimental areas that lead majors through
content and methodological issues to a final senior research project. A deficit
of equipment places a severe constraint on our ability to provide laboratory
support for these core courses. Macintosh computers with HyperCard software
would permit us to include laboratory experiments in perception, learning,
memory, and cognition along with opportunities for undergraduates to design
their own programs for use in senior research projects. A computer-based
laboratory would be the most practical and effective way to meet our most
pressing need.
