With this proposal we respectfully request NSF funding to support the
organization of a workshop entitled ?Collaborative Research Opportunities in
Telecommunications Technologies,? to be held Nv.1-2, 2011, in Dublin, Ireland.
The objective of the workshop is to stimulate discussion, encourage
interactions, and help establish research ties between leading researchers in
the US and Ireland. Research focus will be on various areas of
telecommunications in both the optical fibers and the wireless technologies. It
is expected that through detailed presentations by researchers from both
countries that the group will be able to share knowledge on emerging
technologies, identify bottlenecks, and discuss collaborative avenues for
collaborations. It is hoped that as a result of the workshop several joint
proposals will be submitted by not only the participating group but also by
their colleagues at their institutions.&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will be for two
days, with the first day focused on presentations by researchers from both side,
while the second day will focus on interactive sessions and panel discussions to
help enhance the cooperation and initiate more activities to capitalize on the
presence of US scientists in Dublin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual
Merit:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on the proposed workshop presentations that
will be made by leading researchers from both countries, and through discussions
on potential future research opportunities during panel sessions, significant
progress will be made towards identifying innovative research ideas in the
telecommunications area and hopefully avenues for enabling next generation of
this technology will be jointly pursued by the participating groups and their
institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
workshop will lead to establishing ties between researchers in both countries.
It is hoped that this will lead to joint proposals and collaborative
interactions between telecommunication researchers both in Ireland and the US.
