&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Animal Impulsivity: Discounting or Ecological
Rationality&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;David W. Stephens&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Animals
often prefer a small-immediate food item, even when waiting for a more delayed
alternative could produce more food in the long-run. This impulsiveness is
theoretically and practically important. For example, impulsiveness is thought
to play a role in addiction and cooperation. The conventional explanation of
animal impulsivity is that economic processes reduce or discount the value of
delayed benefits. Yet, it has proven difficult to construct a plausible
discounting model that explains animal impulsivity. This research program
develops an alternative explanation based on ecological rationality The
ecological rationality approach hypothesizes that impulsive choice mechanisms
exist, not because immediacy is fundamentally valuable, but because choice rules
based on immediacy offer advantages in natural choice situations, even if they
do poorly in typical experimental situations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
objective of this research program is to assess the ecological rationality
hypothesis. Experiments, using captive blue jays (Cyanocitta cristata), will
explore the difference between binary and sequential choice situations.
Preliminary evidence suggests that blue jays achieve higher long-term rates of
food gain in the sequential situation. Extending this idea, experiments will
compare the sensitivity of choice behavior to differences in long-term
consequences in both situations. Further experiments will test the effect of
experimental interruptions on impulsiveness, which is long-standing claim of the
discounting hypothesis. In addition, computational techniques will be used to
expand the predictions of the ecological rationality
approach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
