9452141 Sweeney The Mathematics Department at Russell Sage College is
establishing a computer equipped combination classroom/laboratory for improving
instruction and learning in the lower division major mathematics sequence. The
equipment is necessary for the complete revision of the calculus, linear
algebra, and differential equations curriculum and makes the computer the tool
of first choice in problem-solving and mathematical investigations. The revised
curriculum requires that problem solving, problem formulation, concepts and
insight replace the tedious and repetitive manipulations common in current
curriculum. The equipment and revised curriculum aid this all- woman institution
to encourage more women to attempt the study of calculus and better assist those
who do. The laboratory requires 16 Macintosh Centris 650's each equipped with 12
megabytes of main memory, 120 byte hard-drive, color monitor, and MATHEMATICA.
The laboratory also contains 4 Apple Laser Pro 630's and a Centris 660AV which
networks the computers together
