Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:
EPS-0814103&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: RII: Enhancing Alabama?s
Research Capacity in Nano/Bio Science and Sensors
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Alabama A&amp;M
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goals: This Research Infrastructure Improvement
award will facilitate the creation of a statewide partnership among Alabama core
research institutions to enhance R&amp;D competitiveness in the emerging area of
nano/bio science and molecular sensors. This partnership is designed to foster
collaborative research, and to stimulate multidisciplinary education through
four centers. Each center is designed to support and train new faculty, staff,
and students in key nano- and biotechnology innovation areas aligned with the
state?s economic development priorities outlined in the governor?s ?Plan
2010?.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project Major Foci: The Tuskegee University led
center will develop and characterize new biodegradable nanostructured materials;
the Auburn University led center will use organismal models to identify
mechanisms of adaptation to natural and man-made environmental challenges; the
University of Alabama in Birmingham led center will develop new optical and
molecular sensing technologies; and the Alabama A&amp;M University led center
will use nanopatterning and nanofabrication techniques to control structure-
property relationships in order to tailor materials properties for specific
applications. An additional role of this center will be the integration of the
findings of each center to catalyze innovation based economic development.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The centers will ensure
reciprocal transfer of information and technology between the life sciences and
engineering to catalyze novel research in both fields. Biological discovery will
elucidate structural and functional principles in living systems that can serve
as templates for pioneering the design and synthesis of nanomaterials. Likewise,
advances in nanoscale detection, quantification, and nanoengineering will open
new frontiers in the life sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The centers will establish statewide infrastructure that will
foster collaboration, build partnerships, develop future STEM-enabled workforce,
improve scientific literacy, and develop new economic opportunities. The centers
research will likely have a major impact on the environment, homeland security,
and industrial process control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
