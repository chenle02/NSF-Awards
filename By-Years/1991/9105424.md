In this project research will be focused on differential equation models
studying the effects of spatial heterogeneity and indirect nutrient consumption
on microbial growth. The model equations for two competing species generate a
strongly monotone dynamical system, and steady state coexistence has been shown
to be possible. Using various techniques in nonlinear analysis and numerical
simulations, the investigator will study the choice of parameters for
coexistence, the effect of microbial mobility on coexistence, and the maximum
number of coexisting species. Research on indirect nutrient consumption will
focus on models of both extracellular and intracellular conversion of the
nutrient to an intermediate product which is assimilated for growth. The goal is
to compare the efficiency of the different consumption processes, and to study
the possibility of coexistence of species with different mechanisms of nutrient
assimilation. This project is concerned with the study of mathematical models of
microbial growth and competition in continuous culture, a commonly used
laboratory technique in microbiology. Microorganisms play very important roles
in natural ecological systems, and their activities have numerous industrial
applications, e.g., waste water treatment, production of food, drugs and various
other chemicals, bacterial control, etc. Competition between different species
is an important feature in many ecological systems, and the design of many
industrial processes, e.g., use of biological agents in bacterial control or
waste disposal, is based on the competitiveness of different species.
Experimental study of microbial activities in laboratory environments are
especially amenable to mathe matical modeling by differential equations.
Analysis of the model equations gives better understanding of the underlying
principles of microbial behaviors, and often leads to new experimental designs.
