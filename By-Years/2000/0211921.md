Ethylene is an unique plant signaling molecule. The hydrocarbon gas, known as
the fruit ripening hormone, controls many aspects of plant growth and
development. It is biosynthesized from methionine via a three-step enzymatic
process:

SAM ACC ACC Methionine SAM ACC C2H4. Synthase synthase oxidase

Its synthesis is highly regulated. Experimental evidence accumulated over the
last 10 years indicates that one of the key enzymes in the ethylene biosynthetic
pathway, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) synthase (ACS), is encoded
by a highly divergent multigene family in various mono- and dicotyledonous
plants. The completion of the Arabidopsis genome sequence reveals the presence
of 10 putative ACS genes (ACS2, 4-12) and two pseudogenes (ACS1, ACS3).
Expression studies reveal that the family members are differentially regulated
by various inducers and developmental stages Studies on the regulation of the
ACS genes in Arabidopsis are proposed here to gain insight into the details of
the signaling machinery involved primarily in the regulation of the ACS gene by
auxin and ethylene. Further studies are proposed to obtain knowledge regarding
the structure and the biochemical properties of the ACS isoenzymes. The proposed
molecular and biochemical experimental approaches attempt to answer the
following question: why are there 10 ACC synthase isoenzymes in Arabidopsis for
the synthesis of the ethylene precursor ACC? While all of them have the same
biochemical function, the question arises whether they have distinct or
redundant biological function. The findings have the potential to allow a
fundamental understanding of the role of multigene families in plants, a
hallmark finding of the Arabidopsis Genome Sequencing project.
