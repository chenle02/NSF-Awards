This project concerns the connection between fundamental problems in number
theory, zeros of arithmetic L-functions, and random matrix theory. Recent
developments have placed the confluence of these fields at the center of a great
deal of important work that combines activity and interest from researchers
previously working in completely different areas. The study of zeros of
arithmetic Dirichlet series, or L-functions, occupies a central position in
number theory and includes within its realm both the Riemann Hypothesis and the
Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture. The theory of eigenvalues of random
matrices is a subject begun nearly 50 years ago by physicists interested in the
statistics of energy levels of excited particles. The connection between these
two fields was revealed for the first time in 1974 in the paper ``The pair
correlation of the zeros of the zeta-function'' by H. L. Montgomery. This
project will involve both number theorists and mathematical physicists to
develop a comprehensive new model for families of L-functions in order to gain
insights into a number of fundamental open problems about L-functions. For
example, by combining random matrix theory and number theory appropriately, the
principal investigator and his colleagues intend to (i) find all of the terms in
asymptotic formulae for moments of families of L-functions, (ii) determine
precisely how large the extreme-most values of L-functions can be, and (iii)
analyze the vanishing at the central critical point for families of L-functions.

In 1859 Bernhard Riemann made a conjecture about an important function known as
the zeta-function. Riemann's hypothesis is still unproven and is widely regarded
as the most important unsolved problem in mathematics. It has long been known
that the solution of this problem would have significant applications to
cryptography, coding theory, and the study of prime numbers. Recently, it has
also been realized that the zeta-function and the closely related L-functions
provide models for the behavior of fundamental particles in physics. The project
`L-functions: symmetry and zeros' will bring mathematicians and physicists
together to explore this amazing connection more deeply through the use of a
statistical tool called `random matrix theory.'
