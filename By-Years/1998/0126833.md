Project Summary&lt;br/&gt;This proof of concept project develops a set of
instructional materials for teaching fundamental programming concepts using an
exciting simulation and visualization package. This package provides an
environment that supports the creation of 3-dimensional, interactive, animated
virtual worlds (which can be easily built by novices!). It is expected that this
approach will strengthen and enhance student skills as well as provide
sufficient programming experience to improve student performance and retention
in introductory computer science (CS 1) and beyond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
results of this project will be the creation of a set of instructional
materials: textbook, laboratory exercises, lecture and demonstration slides, and
a reference for the animation software, and the collection and analysis of
preliminary data on the use of these materials. All curricular materials will be
freely available and disseminated online. &lt;br/&gt;
