The goal of this project is to effectively integrate geographic information
systems (GIS) instruction into the environmental biology curriculum, including
required undergraduate research, at Saint Mary's College of Minnesota.
Laboratories in spatial and temporal modeling techniques will employ GIS
technology throughout the environmental curriculum, each building on previous
activities. A new junior-level course in ecological spatial and temporal
analysis and modeling will integrate and extensively build on earlier topics,
and prepare students to use GIS in their ecological research. This approach to
ecological data analysis is rapidly becoming an essential component of studies
ranging from human ecology to ecosystem analysis and management.
