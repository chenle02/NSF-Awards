A microscopic theory is proposed for the rheology of complex fluids containing
polymers, micellar suspensions and polymeric liquid crystals. The theory
incorporates the coupling of particle Brownian motion to solvent hydrodynamics,
the kinetic Langevin model for polymer motion, and the polymer internal
friction. The micellar system model consider the modification of micellar sizes
by flow. The proposed approach for the rheology of fluids with specific
microstructures has application in the production and use of polymer solutions,
micellar systems, liquid crystalline polymers and living biopolymers.
