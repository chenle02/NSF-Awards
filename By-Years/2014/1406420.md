Algebraic curves are subsets of the plane defined by the vanishing of a
polynomial of two variables. They are important in geometry, physics and number
theory. Moduli spaces of curves parametrize all curves of a given topological
type. This type is classified by a whole number called the genus of the curve.
Some questions about moduli spaces of curves of all genera can be resolved by
answering the the questions in genus zero and one. This proposal focuses on
understanding the interaction between the topology of moduli spaces of curves,
especially in genus one and the "arithmetic symmetries" of topological
invariants of the moduli spaces. Resolving such basic questions is important in
advancing our understanding of whole numbers and of the topological symmetries
of zero sets of polynomials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goal of this
project is to understand motivic aspects of completions of fundamental groups
and path torsors of moduli spaces of curves in all genera $\ge 0$. Although
motivic structures on path torsors of moduli spaces of genus 0 curves are
reasonably well understood (work of Deligne-Goncharov and Brown), fundamental
problems remain, such as determining the Zariski closure of the image of the
absolute Galois group in the automorphism group of the unipotent fundamental
group of the thrice punctured projective line (a de~Rham version of the
Grothendieck-Teichmuller program), and understanding why and how classical cusp
forms impose relations in the associated graded of its depth filtration. Much of
the PI's attention will be focused on the genus one case as it is the most
central and also because of its connection to the theory of classical modular
forms. It influences the genus 0 case by degeneration to the nodal cubic and
should help explain why modular forms impose conditions on the Galois action on
the unipotent fundamental group of the thrice punctured projective line. The
higher genus cases can be reduced to the genus zero and one cases by results in
topology that go back to Harer. This project will also clarify Manin's work on
iterated Shimura integrals and arithmetic aspects of the elliptic KZB equation,
which arose in physics, but plays a special role in this project.
