This proposal is to investigate energetic particle injections (electrons
50keV,ions 100 keV) associated with geomagnetic storms and substorms in an
attempt to understand the change of the magnetic and electric fields in the tail
and inner magnetosphere during these events. Investigations will focus upon
impulsive injections associated with isolated substorms and the resulting drift
echoes observed in the inner magnetosphere. Drift echoes can provide information
about changes in the magnetic and electric fields in both time and space, which
can be utilized in models of the fields that govern the particle motions. Test
particle tracing techniques will be utilized and the simulation results will be
compared with observations.
