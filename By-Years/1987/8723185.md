This project in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program involves the
development and application of new methods for determination of electron binding
energies. A computer program will be devised to implement new methods for
theoretical calculations that will be more accurate than have hitherto been
possible for all but very small molecules. Applications will be made to systems
of current chemical interest, including transition metal carbonyls, anion-
neutral complexes and organometallic compounds. The method is based on electron
propogator theory, which focuses directly on the binding energy. Current methods
will be augmented by inclusion of nondiagonal third order self energies, fourth
order quasiparticle calculations and third order one-electron reduced density
matrices. Gradients of the binding energies will also be obtained to facilitate
geometry optimizations.
