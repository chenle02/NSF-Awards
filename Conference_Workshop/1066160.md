This project is to support a Binghamton University Graduate Conference in
Algebra and Topology(BUGCAT) which is a venue for algebra and topology graduate
students in all stages of their research to present their work and meet other
mathematicians with related research interests. This year it will be a two-day
conference on the Binghamton University campus during November 6-7, 2010.
Participants will include graduate students at all levels, postdocs, and
professors. Approximately 150 participants are expected, with about 100 of them
traveling from outside of a one-hour-driving radius from Binghamton. The aim of
the conference is to provide a comfortable environment for graduate students
from a diversity of backgrounds and schools to share their research. Graduate
students will have the priority for talk space. In addition, Moon Duchin from
the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor and Richard Foote from the University of
Vermont at Burlington will serve as keynote speakers at the conference.
Participation from all areas of topology and algebra is encouraged.

The conference strives to strengthen the sense of academic community among
mathematics graduate students. Besides giving exposure to the research of
advanced graduate students, the conference is an invaluable opportunity for
students who have not chosen a research area yet to explore what topics are
currently being fruitfully studied. The faculty members who attend serve an
essential role in both providing new ideas as well as probing the ideas of
graduate students, suggesting ideas for future study, and encouraging students
to meet and work with people interested in their areas of research. Graduate
students who attend the BUGCAT are better equipped to find academic positions
and continue research and collaboration. The conference also promotes diversity
in the mathematical sciences, both by encouraging women and minorities to attend
and by encouraging participation from a broad range of graduate programs. The
conference organizing committee, all graduate students, is remarkably diverse in
gender, ethnicity, and background, and hence is well positioned to encourage
participation by women and minorities.
