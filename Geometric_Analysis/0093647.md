Abstract

Award: DMS-0093647 Principal Investigator: Christopher T. Woodward

The principal investigator plans to develop the theory of group actions on
symplectic manifolds and geometric invariant theory, and extend applications to
certain 2d conformal field theories and algebraic combinatorics. In particular,
he will investigate the theory of loop group actions, group-valued moment maps,
and relations to the Wess-Zumino-Witten model in conformal field theory and
cohomology pairings on moduli spaces of flat connections; the asymptotic limit
of the quantum 6j symbols; and decomposition of products of conjugacy classes in
disconnected compact groups and twisted forms of quantum cohomology. He will
integrate his research with a variety of educational projects, such as dynamical
systems in the calculus and linear algebra sequence at Rutgers; strengthening
the joint major with computer science; laboratory activities in the
undergraduate curriculum and evaluation of their effectiveness.

Symplectic geometry is the mathematical framework for the study of classical
mechanics, and in particular Hamiltonian dynamical systems. Woodward will
undertake a number of projects to develop the field and its role in the
undergraduate and graduate curriculum. He will seek to understand symmetries,
especially of infinite dimension, in this setting. Possible applications outside
of mathematics are the development of new computational techniques in conformal
field theory, an important topic in recent high-energy theoretical physics, and
improvement of the efficiency of wireless communication, via the construction of
better packings in the unitary group.
