The investigator will continue her study of multi-particle Hamiltonian, with
emphasis on those for atomic and molecular systems. She will consider problems
related to the monotonicity of energy differences and the variation in the
number of bound states with parameters such as the nuclear charge. In addition,
she will try to use ideas from wavelet theory to construct a set of orthogonal
functions whose kinetic energy is bounded above by a semi-classical functional
of the one-particle density. The work in this project is of considerable
practical importance since it provides the mathematical foundation for
theoretical atomic and molecular physics, and some is relevant to practical
computations on atomic and molecular systems. The project furthers VPW program
objectives to provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in
science or engineering through research, and to encourage other women to pursue
careers in these areas through the investigators' enhanced visibility as role
models on the host campuses. In this project, the proposed activities which
contribute to the second objective include: teaching an upper division course,
participating in the mathematical physics seminar, and engaging in other
activities intended to encourage women students at Michigan to pursue careers in
the mathematical sciences.
