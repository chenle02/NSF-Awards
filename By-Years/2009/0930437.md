This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project seeks to prepare
textile fibers containing two metal electrodes embedded in a polymer
electrolyte. These fibers will be formed with a multi-crucible pultrusion
system. Ion flows within the electrolyte on deformation will cause the fibers to
produce a voltage and act as strain sensors. An applied voltage will cause the
fibers to deform by bending and work as fiber actuators. The process for such
50-micron scale electrically activated fibers comparable in properties to
natural muscle fibers and muscle spindles (strain sensors) will be produced.

The broader impact/commercial potential will be the development of sensors that
are incorporated into systems in the way that nerves are incorporated into skin.
Optical fiber sensors have this potential but their fragility and the complexity
of the readout equipment have prevented their widespread use. This project will
make available a versatile platform for adding sensing to soft structures,
especially for safety-related applications; and the development of an actuator
material that could be readily employed by designers of military, medical,
rehabilitative and robotic equipment. The proposed fibers could be woven into
textiles, attached to sheet materials or molded into polymers and would permit
widespread sensing of stress, environmental variables or chemicals as part of
clothing or equipment. Subsequent deployment of these fibers as artificial
muscles could have military or medical use. Long-term the societal impact of
sensing machines and muscle-like motion will be great.
