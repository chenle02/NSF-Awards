9222486 Pearson This proposal is concerned with developing theory and
computational tools that will aid in the design of hybrid systems
(e.g.,continuous-time plants, discrete-time compensators). In particular it is
concerned with problems in which the objectives will be to minimize maximum
error magnitudes and rates of change, when input signals have bounded magnitudes
and rates of change. In addition to developing methods for nominal optimization
problems, the proposal is also concerned with developing efficient methods to
treat robust design, i.e. optimization under plant uncertainty. ***
