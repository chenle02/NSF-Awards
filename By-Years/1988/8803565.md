This project is mathematical research in the representation theory of Lie
groups. A suitable example of the latter is the group of rotations of a sphere.
Groups like this are important because they occur in many areas of mathematics (
e.g. geometry, differential equations, algebraic number theory, mathematical
physics ) as groups of symmetries. Representation theory allows one to take
advantage of symmetries in solving problems. The work of Professor Mirkovic will
have a high degree of contact with algebra, number theory, and geometry.
Specifically, he will investigate representations of reductive groups defined
over finite fields, or the real numbers, or global fields of positive
characteristic, using techniques of D-modules and perverse sheaves.
