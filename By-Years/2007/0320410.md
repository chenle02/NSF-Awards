This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses the need for
compact, low cost thermal packaging to cool high power and high-density
electronics. This project will develop an automated freeform fabrication process
based on stereolithography to fabricate the high performance thermal packages.
The research objectives include demonstrating that the fabrication approach can
produce the thermal substrates with dimensional tolerances comparable to current
substrates and much higher heat flux capacity. Prototype packages will be
fabricated and laboratory tested to measure heat flux. The anticipated results
will show heat flux capacity of several hundred W/cm2, with the ultimate goal of
1,000 W/cm2 achieved through development of improved materials and package
designs. Target applications of this low cost and reliable thermal packaging
approach are high heat load electronics devices including high density
microelectronics and power electronics such as T/R modules, power conditioning
components for electric vehicles, high density CPUs for compact computers and
high power laser diodes. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts from this
technology will be a thermal packaging approach which would offer a low cost and
compact solution for thermal management of high heat load electronics including
radar T/R modules, high power laser diodes, power conditioning electronics for
electric vehicles and shipboard electric propulsion, high density CPUs for
compact computers, and space-based electronics where compact heat rejection
designs are critical. The solution is particularly attractive for devices based
on the advanced capabilities of wide bandgap (WBG) semiconductors such as SiC
and GaN. These devices offer much higher maximum temperature capabilities and
can handle higher current loads and faster switching speeds. All of these
attributes result in a 10x. 100x higher thermal load on the packaging making
conventional packaging approaches that utilize heat spreaders and heat sinks
obsolete. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
