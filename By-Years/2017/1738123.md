The Office of Polar Programs has been funding substantial scientific activities
at Summit Station, Greenland (72°N 38°W, 3250 meters above sea level), for over
twenty years. Summit is the only high-elevation, free-tropospheric, inland
environmental observatory in the Arctic which is currently manned throughout the
year. Understanding the current and developing Arctic science questions and how
research conducted at Summit Station can address those questions plays an
important role in determining science program priorities and operational plans
for Summit Station. Goals for this 1.5-day workshop include; A) elucidating the
current state of Summit Station measurements, B) illustrating the current uses
of the data, C) defining the utility of the year-round data that is collected in
the context of Arctic science, and D) determining the variability of wintertime
parameters and the accuracy to which they must be monitored for scientific
analysis.

The workshop will be held at NSF and bring together various stakeholders and
potential scientific users of data collected at Summit Station, as well as
broader Arctic Scientists, to consider Summit Station?s future role in Arctic
research. The intellectual merit of the proposal will be realized in defining
the important science questions that can be addressed by research at Summit
Station and defining the measurements and accuracies needed for year-round
measurements to answer those questions. Broader impacts will be realized through
the workshop report on the current state and applications of Summit Station data
that will include community-based recommendations on future science goals and
measurements for Summit Station.
