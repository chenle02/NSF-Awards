9506677 Bilham The PIs will measure the rate of convergence of India towards
Asia, and determine the style of elastic and inelastic deformation resulting
from this continent-continent collision. They will measure both the partitioning
of deformation among the various elements of the plate collision zone, and also
the detailed pattern of deformation associated with most of the significant
elements. The PIs will reoccupy about 80 GPS sites that were surveyed precisely
either 4 years (Nepal and southern Tibet) or 3 years (northern India) ago. They
will also install a few new sites. This occupation will permit a measure of the
relative velocities of the sites, permitting the first measurement of the
tectonic motions across the entire plate boundary. These measurements will
improve our understanding of the rate of vertical deformation that sustains the
Himalaya and the Tibetan Plateau, and indirectly controls global atmospheric
circulation. ****
