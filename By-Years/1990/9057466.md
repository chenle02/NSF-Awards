Zakhor This research incorporates signal and image representation, synthesis and
restoration, and issues related to the applicability of multiresolution
decompositions to various classes of signals and signal processing algorithms.
These include fractal-type signals to which traditional wavelet analysis
applies, and those which are best represented by different filters at different
resolutions. For the latter class of signals, an adaptive subband coding
algorithm is being developed that affects the multiresolution decompositions.
