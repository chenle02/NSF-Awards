9317372 Valentine PIs will document Neogene molluscan patterns in order to test
hypotheses on how origination and extinction vary along environmental gradients
at the species level, and, by comparison to earlier results, across the
taxonomic hierarchy and from background to mass extincttion. Latitudinal and
bathymetric patterns will be examined, using databases.
