This proposal was received in response to the Nanoscale Science and Engineering
initiative, NSF 02-148, category NIRT. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent advances in
microwave synthesis that promise to revolutionize the time required to fabricate
catalysts at the nanoscale. Zeolites, mixed metal oxides and mesoporous
molecular sieves typically can require extended synthesis times because of slow
nucleation and growth of ordered structures. This project promises to greatly
reduce the time required for preparing an array of materials, and it will also
fundamentally advance our understanding of nanoporous crystalline materials
synthesis. A multidisciplinary team having an excellent track record in the
proposed area of research, will address synthesis, characterization and
theoretical aspects of catalysis by these materials. Graduate students will
clearly benefit from the interdiscplinary environment, and there will be strong
participation in the on-going Northeast Alliance REU program involving minority
students. The research program will forge ties with industry also. &lt;br/&gt;
