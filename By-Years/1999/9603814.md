9603814 He During co-evolution of plants and their pathogens, plants have
developed specific detection systems to detect pathogen presence by recognizing
factors, products of co-called avr genes, whose recognition by the plant leads
to responses. The model for Avr proteins often assumes that they are
extracellular ligands and that the plants defense gene products are cell surface
receptors. However, the model is not sufficiently supported by data. The work
will address the recognition problem. Pseudomonas AvrB expressed inside a plant
cell can trigger the pathogen response. Experiments will identify the
intracellular receptor to which AvrB binds, and identify the low-molecular
weight elicitor which is produced by the action of AvrB in transgenic plants.
