This project involves the dissertation research of an anthropology student from
Rutgers University, studying how participation by tribal people in conservation
projects in Papua New Guinea affects people's identity. Using a controlled
measure of participants and non-participants in the conservation project (the
Crater Mountain Wildlife Management Area), the study will examine local ideas
and understandings of what it means to be `modern`; local identity politics; and
specific environmental actions and events. The hypothesis to be tested is that
participation in certain practices (learning the regional Pidgin language,
desiring an airstrip-there are no roads in the area, participating in a
`revival` movement, and consideration of mining ventures) is tied to an image of
`modernity` which has become part of local cultural identity. Methods include
survey questionnaires to about 500 individuals in each of three villages
impacted by the project, an open-ended questionnaire interview with about 300
persons from the set of villages, and general ethnographic participant
observation. By documenting and analyzing the relationship between identity and
participation in the conservation project in Papua New Guinea, the research will
contribute to theories of conservation practice and to the contemporary
ethnography of Melanesia. The project will advance our understanding of how
development projects appear to local people who are most impacted by them. This
knowledge will help conservation planners and politicians design projects that
protect the environment while at the same time garner the understanding and
support of local populations.
