This project covers one year of support and related administrative expenses for
the U.S. National Committee of the International Union of Radio Scienctists
(URSI). URSI covers numerous areas of interest within the radio science
discipline, including radio astronomy, materials science, physics, remote
sensing, geosciences, and space sciences. The U.S. National Committee organizes
a yearly conference in the U.S., and oversees the U.S. participation in
international URSI activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;URSI activities, both within
the U.S. and worldwide, support the development and training of students and
postdocs in numerous radio science activities in science and engineering.
