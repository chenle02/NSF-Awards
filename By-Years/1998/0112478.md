During the austral spring, diatom species and the colonial prymnesiophyte
Phaeocystis antarctica form large blooms in the Ross Sea. The diatom blooms are
typically localized in the western Ross Sea while the P. antarctica blooms
typically develop in the southeastern and south central regions of the Ross Sea.
Recent data suggest that the dominance of non-siliceous phytoplankton organisms,
such as P. antarctica may be responsible for the drawdown in atmospheric CO2
that occurred during the last glacial maximum. The proposed project would focus
on developing a new method to test whether the algal sterol, brassicasterol,
could be a useful sediment biomarker for delineating the relative abundance of
P. antarctica in over-lying waters. Sediment samples from each of these regions
will be analyzed to test whether a compound-specific d13C method could be used
to determine the relative abundance of Phaeocystis antarctica from over-lying
waters. Specifically, laboratory cultures and core materials would be used to
look for a depleted d13C sediment brassicasterol signal. If the method proves
valid in the Ross Sea, then it could provide some definitive answers regarding
the potential role of P. antarctica during the glacial/interglacial boundary.
Positive results would be potentially important to a diverse array of scientists
including: biogeochemists, biological oceanographers, paleoceanographers, and
global climate modelers.
