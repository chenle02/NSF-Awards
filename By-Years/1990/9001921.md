The International Union for Pure and Applied Biophysics will hold its 10th
International Biophysics Congress and General Assembly in Vancouver, Canada,
July 29 to August 3, 1990. The meeting offers a broad program of symposia on
topics of current biophysical interest such as: 1) membrane organization and
function; 2) macromolecular structure function recognition; 3) biophysical
techniques; and 4) cell and bioenergetics. Scientists of international
reputation have been selected to serve as invited participants. In addition,
poster sessions will provide for the latest research results to be discussed in
detail. This meeting provides the opportunity for U.S. scientists to meet
outstanding foreign scientists, to present their work to an international
audience and to, perhaps, begin important international collaborations.
