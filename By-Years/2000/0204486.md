118/0204486&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Motion, like shape, is one of the fundamental
modalities to be modeled in order to represent and manipulate the phys-ical
world in a computer. As such, motion representations and the algorithms that
operate on them are central to all computational disciplines dealing with
physical objects: computer graphics, computer vision, robotics, etc. Mod-eling
motion is also crucial for other disciplines dealing with temporally varying
data, including mobile networks, temporal databases, etc. Motion algorithms
require com-putational&lt;br/&gt;resources, and frequently sensing and commu-
nication resources as well, in order to accomplish their&lt;br/&gt;task. Despite
the prominent position that motion plays in so many computer disciplines, little
has been done to date to provide a clean conceptual framework for representing
motion, describing algorithms on moving objects, and an-alyzing their behavior
and performance. It is the goal of this proposal to push the frontiers of the
computer sci-ence representations and algorithms that deal with motion in its
various manifestations. The aim is to create a firm algorithmic theory for the
processes of acquiring, model-ing, reasoning about, planning, manipulating, or
executing motion and their relevant complexity measures.
