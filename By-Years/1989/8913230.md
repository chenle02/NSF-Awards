Understand the dynamics and energetics associated with the ionosphere
surrounding the earth requires the development of sophisticated models that
synthesize observations and theoretical calculations. This program is a
continuation of theoretical studies of the effects that plasma transport
processes have on the ionosphere and thermosphere. The focus on the research is
the development of numerical models in support of national and international
observational programs. Much of this work will involve direct comparison of
observations with the model output using simultaneous data acquired from
stations distributed around the globe.
