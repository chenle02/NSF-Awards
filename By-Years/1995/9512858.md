9512858 Iglesia The proposed research will establish a working collaboration
between a catalysis research group at UC Berkeley, headed by Enrique Iglesia,
and a solid-state synthesis research group at the Universidad Nacional del
Litoral in Santa Fe, Argentina under Carlos Apesteguia. The research will focus
on understanding the problems in catalytic approaches for the synthesis of
isobutanol from synthesis gas. The mechanism of the process will be analyzed and
various catalysts will be evaluated in order to find a method which works
effectively under lower temperatures and pressures than currently known methods.
The research group in Argentina is recognized for research in the synthesis and
structural characterization of new materials, while the U.S. group complements
this expertise with emphasis on the kinetics and mechanisms of organic reactions
at catalytic surfaces. The project leaders will also involve graduate students
and a post doctoral scientist as integral parts of the project. ****
