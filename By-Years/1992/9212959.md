This research project involves the development of a laboratory facility to
investigate the complex interactions between noise, stability and nonlinear
dynamics inherent in mechanical systems. Specifically, the research work
consists of conducting dynamics experiments on the behavior of two nonlinear
mechanical models. One deals with the transverse vibrations of a rotating shaft
under pulsating axial loads, and the other is the dynamics and control of
coupled torsional and bending vibrations of a thin beam under nonconservative
forces. Experimental measurements include data leading to statistics such as
mean square responses and power spectral densities; Lyapunov exponents, fractal
dimensions and correlation functions of the response coordinates; and
probability density and distribution functions. The laboratory meets the needs
of enhancing the experimental skills of graduate students in the areas of
dynamics and control.***//
