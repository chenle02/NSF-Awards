Objective: &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The objective of this program is to develop a
comprehensive set of communication tools for the design and implementation of a
very dense sensor network within a building
infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: &lt;br/&gt; The
intellectual merit is to lay the foundations for the design of lightweight
communication protocols to robustly collect data from a heterogeneous sensor
network with both regular and event-driven traffic patterns. We will use diverse
techniques from communication theory, sensor design methodologies, distributed
algorithms and engineering implementation guidelines in our study. The end
result will be design guidelines, distributed algorithms and a practical
implementation in the context of the Y2E2 building (at Stanford) and
&lt;br/&gt;the upcoming new zero-energy ECE building (at UIUC).
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: &lt;br/&gt;The broader impact is via the
development and distribution of a prototype sensor network platform that will
enable energy efficient building and also be useful in effective traffic
monitoring and real-time monitoring of structural health for infrastructures.
