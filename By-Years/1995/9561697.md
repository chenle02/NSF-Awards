This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will explore an
automated design, analysis, and manufacturing (ADAM) system specific to an
advanced spray cooling technology. The system will incorporate the most recent
advances in parametric design, finite element analysis (FEA), database
management, and dynamic data exchange, coupled to principles of design for
manufacturability and assembly, agile and just-in-time manufacturing, and
virtual corporations. Phase I will demonstrate key feasibility issues.
Specifically, an `intelligent` interface will access customer input of multi-
chip module (MCM) geometry and operational constraints to automate the
generation of a 3-dimensional solid model of an optimized spray cooled MCM.
Integration tools will transfer this model to FEA for performance predictions
and generate the appropriate machine code for automatic fabrication of a
prototype. The ADAM system will be applied to advanced spray cooling for
electronics manufacture. However specific to spray cooling, the techniques and
methodologies developed here will be widely applicable to other mechanical
systems. As an `enabling` technology, it will be applied to supercomputers,
advanced servers, MCMs, power electronics, radar, and avionics. This range of
design requirements necessitates a general strategy in Phase I, which is
expected to be widely useful in the research field of agile manufacturing. Once
fully developed, turn key ADAM systems can be supplied to many commercial users.
