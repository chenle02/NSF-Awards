This proposal will deploy the Aerospace CCD camera to make spectral measurements
of the temperature and intensity of the OH Meinel and O2 band emissions. The
instrument will also produce the bands' images, which will be used for studying
the two dimensional horizontal wave number spectrum of atmospheric gravity
waves, and the frequency of breaking gravity waves. In addition, these data will
be used in conjunction with the colocated lidar or radar instruments to
completely characterize the spectral properties of all observed waves. Finally,
the investigator will analyze data obtained in the ALOHA-93 campaign during the
first year of this project.
