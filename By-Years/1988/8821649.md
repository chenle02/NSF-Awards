This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in the
general area of analytical chemistry and in the subfield of molecular
spectroscopy. The goal of this activity is to develop a sensitive, stable,
spectroscopic technique for the detection and quantification of gas phase
molecular species. Gallium Arsenide Laser Line-Locked Absorption Spectroscopy
(GALLS) uses a near infrared laser-diode which is actively locked to a molecular
absorption line to monitor the concentration of that molecular species in a gas
sample. This technique is species selective, sensitive, and can be used to
monitor a large number of molecular species. During the tenure of Phase I
research under NSF grant ISI-8760819, the principal investigator demonstrated
continuous monitoring of atmospheric water vapor with a detection sensitivity of
ten microabsorbance units and a dynamic range in excess of four orders of
magnitude. Research in Phase II will lead to the production of a laboratory
prototype instrument having improved sensitivity and stability. This device will
be used to measure detailed spectrometric constants for water vapor and to
demonstrate the sensitivity, accuracy, and precision of GALLS sensors for
various monitoring applications. This research should lead to the development of
a new class of remote sensors for the real-time monitoring of gas phase species
concentrations in hostile environments.
