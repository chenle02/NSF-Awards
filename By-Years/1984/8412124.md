This research upgrades the state-of-the-art of seismic analysis procedures by
combining the probability predictions of seismic events with the probabilistic
assessments of the performance of dams. The results of this study, therefore,
will provide information critically needed to assess the seismic hazard and the
consequent risk of damage to earth dams, for site specific conditions. This
study will be made by first developing a seismic performance analysis method to
identify the different modes of dam failure and establishing the damage
probabilities based on the dam performance. The analysis results will then be
combined with site specific seismic hazard evaluations to provide a methodology
for estimating the eventual risk factors for dam failures.
