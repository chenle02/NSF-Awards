This fellowship supports training in science and technology studies and research
on the science of greenhouse gases and its relationship with national and
international politics. The fellowship recipient is an electrical engineer whose
work has focused on the science of greenhouse gases. With this award, he will
take coursework and directed readings under the guidance of a scholar on the
comparative politics of science and technology. This assistance will continue as
he undertakes field studies and document analysis exploring the science of
greenhouse gases in three contexts: measurements of methane emissions from
agricultural sources by academic scientists, estimation of a national inventory
of U.S. agricultural methane emissions by Environmental Protection Agency
scientists, and the standardization of an international methodology for
compiling methane inventories by scientists working with the UN
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The fellowship will address the
influence of politics on the science of greenhouse gas emissions, the role of
greenhouse gas scientists in international climate change negotiations, and the
role of scientific knowledge in shaping our understandings of the global
environment. This fellowship will help the investigator to integrate science and
technology studies scholarship into his future scientific and engineering
research and teaching, to incorporate social and environmental issues into
engineering curricula, and to improve the ability of non-technical people to
make informed public policy decisions regarding science and technology.
