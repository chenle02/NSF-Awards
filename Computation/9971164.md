It is the purpose of this project to study various acceleration techniques for
continuous and discrete waveform relaxation iterations. These techniques include
exponential, polynomial or Toeplitz preconditioning and/or overlapping
components of the system. We will also study the construction and implementation
of novel numerical methods for ordinary differential equations which are special
cases of general linear methods. Such methods are appropriate for nonstiff or
stiff differential systems in a sequential or parallel computing environment.
These methods have also higher potential to preserve qualitative properties of
the solution than classical methods. This potential will be exploited to
integrate wave propagation problems with absorbing boundary conditions.

The research supported by this proposal will lead to the development of modern
software for the solution of many problems in science and engineering which are
governed by large differential systems. This software will be based on novel
numerical methods developed in the past few years by the principal investigator
and his coworkers and will utilize modern computer architecture by splitting the
underlying large problem into smaller subsystems or subproblems which can then
be solved in parallel by allocating them to different processors. Numerical
experiments on many problems, for example, acoustic wave propagation, chemical
reactions, movements of a plate under the load of a car passing through it,
catastrophe model for the nerve impulse mechanism, model that describes the
dynamics of a system with large number of particles which can form clusters, and
reaction-diffusion systems, indicate that these novel methods are more efficient
and robust and better suited to take advantage of the state-of-the-art computer
architecture than the methods which are currently in use for these problems.
