Much is understood about how empires grow, but far less is known about how and
why the effects of their growth persist among local populations from one regime
to the next. Understanding the long-term economic, ecological, and health
impacts of imperial expansions requires concerted attention to moments of
transition between regimes, when both imperial powers and local populations
adopt, reject, and/or reorganize existing infrastructure and resources. A team
of researchers are employing strategies from archaeology, osteology, and
biogeochemistry study how transitions between imperial regimes shape long-term
trajectories in household economies, diet, and health and how they continue to
have substantial legacy effects on the global distribution of wealth, political
power, and health outcomes. The project provides critical training opportunities
for students and enhances international understanding of an emerging heritage
destination that provides substantial economic opportunities to local
communities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project focuses on these transitions
across two empires. The situation offers an excellent context for studying these
processes because the empires had variable effects on local communities. By
comparing indicators of household economic activity, diet, and health at sites,
the project employs multidisciplinary perspectives to examine how changes in the
organization of resources, infrastructure, and populations under one empire
shaped pathways of development under the next and how Indigenous strategies of
resilience responded to these successive challenges. The research contributes to
a new theoretical framework for studying imperial
transitions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
