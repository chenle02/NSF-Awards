This award will enable Dr. Charles Han of the National Bureau of Standards to
conduct collaborative research with Professors Mitsuro Nagasawa and Ichiro Noda
of Nagoya University, Japan. They will use electron microscopy, small angle
x-ray scattering and small angle neutron scattering techniques to characterize
the morphology and conformations of deuterium - labeled block copolymers. This
study will advance our knowledge of chain behavior in polymers, a scientifically
and commercially important class of substances. Dr. Han's skills with the small
angle neutron scattering work at the National Bureau of Standards and with block
copolymer chain conformations are well established, as are the synthetic skills
and sample preparation abilities of the Nagoya researchers.
