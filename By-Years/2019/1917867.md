When prisoners return home to American cities, they may find that their
neighborhoods have changed due to gentrification and demographic turnover. This
study explores how gentrification and neighborhood change shape the
reintegration trajectories of formerly incarcerated men, drawing from interviews
with 75 formerly incarcerated men in a city that has gentrified extensively.
This project will help us understand the extent to which gentrified and diverse
neighborhoods help or hinder returning prisoners' reintegration. Findings will
allow us to inform decision-makers on best practices for reintegrating this
large and growing population, which will make it less likely that they return to
prison.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The interviews are evenly divided between three
kinds of neighborhoods: 1) neighborhoods that have experienced demographic
change alongside an increase in average income; 2) neighborhoods that have
experienced demographic change without changes in average income; and 3)
neighborhoods with little demographic or average income change since 1990.
Interviews with formerly incarcerated men from these three types of
neighborhoods will allow for a comparison of reintegration trajectories across
neighborhoods that have experienced different levels and kinds of turnover.
These interviews are recorded, transcribed verbatim, and then coded to assess
common themes across the interviews.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
