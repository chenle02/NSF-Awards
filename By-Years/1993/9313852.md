Proposal No: 9312852 This project will develop a new measurement technology for
low-frequency NMR and NQR measurements in which a SQUID detector functions as a
high-sensitivity broadband detection system for stochastic NMR measurements. The
inherent sensitivity of a SQUID sensor and its wide bandwidth make it the ideal
detection device for low-frequency magnetic resonance experiments. The bandwidth
of the SQUID system also offers a unique match to the broadband nature of the rf
excitation used in stochastic NMR. In addition, experiments at the University of
California, Berkeley and Phase I measurements have shown that SQUID systems can
be used in low-frequency pulsed experiments. The combination of both wideband
and pulsed measurement capabilities in a single instrument offers the promise of
a unique and powerful new tool in NMR and NQR studies of modern materials.
Potential applications for this measurement technology include NQR and zero-
field NMR studies of amorphous and polycrystalline solids, NQR measurements of
deuterium for studies of solid organic compounds and polymers, and the
investigation of a wide variety of biologically-significant molecules through
NQR measurements on 14 {superscript}N. By providing highly resolved spectra in
polycrystalline and other disordered systems, it is likely that such a system
will become a research tool in a variety of scientific disciplines.
