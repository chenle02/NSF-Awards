The long-term goals of this research program are to understand how sensory
information is coded and processed in the brain and how neural networks have
been modified during evolution to produce new behaviors. More specifically, a
primary objective is to understand the functional significance of "laminar"
organization in the brain, i.e. many layers of cells. The human cortex is an
example of such laminar organization. To learn whether neurons of particular
layers have different functional roles, their selectivities for specific sensory
information and morphology must be determined. Electric fish are well-suited for
obtaining such information since behavioral studies have already provided
insights into this sensory system and electric signals are easily produced in
the laboratory. Electrosensory information processing occurs within laminated
regions of their brains and microelectrodes can be inserted into neurons within
these layers. Such information will have general significance to understanding
how sensory information is processed in laminated structures within more complex
brains, as well.
