Crucial and critical needs of security and trust requirements are growing in all
classes of applications such as in automobiles and for wearable devices.
Traditional cryptographic primitives are computation-intensive and rely on
secrecy of shared or session keys, applicable on large systems like servers and
secure databases. This is unsuitable for embedded devices with fewer resources
for realizing sufficiently strong security. This research addresses new
hardware-oriented capabilities and mechanisms for protecting Internet of Things
(IoT) devices. This research has the potential to significantly enhance the
security capability of today and emerging applications, particularly those that
can benefit from reliable authentication using hardware features.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project concerns a hardware-based authentication
framework using strong physical unclonable functions (PUFs) for enhanced
security for Internet of Things (IOT) devices. It focuses on new authentication
techniques, incorporating lightweight cryptographic primitives with PUFs, and
novel pre-boot authentication and storage encryption functions for trusted
platform modules (TPM). The project will evaluate the proposed techniques
against a threat model, including model-building, replay, and probing attacks.
