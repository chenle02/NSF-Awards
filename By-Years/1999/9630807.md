9630807 Hicks In contrast to the completely divided heart of birds and mammals,
the heart of non-crocodilian reptiles (turtles, snakes and lizards) is made up
of a single ventricle. This anatomical arrangement results in the mixing of
oxygen-rich and oxygen-poor blood within the heart (cardiac shunting).
Historically, this was viewed as an intermediate evolutionary step that was
thought to be inferior compared to the circulation of birds and mammals. This
perception changed in the later half of this century when studies showed that
the amount of cardiac shunting is probably regulated and that cardiac shunts may
provide several unique physiological advantages to reptiles. However, this
notion of the reptilian circulation is based on a relatively small number of
observations during specific types of behaviors or physiological states, for
example during breathing. Utilizing technological advances in miniature blood
flow measuring devices and computer assisted data collection systems, this
research will measure a variety of physiological states including terrestrial
locomotion, swimming, digestion and during periods of rest. This research
provides an unprecedented opportunity to determine cardiac shunting patterns in
reptiles during a variety of behaviors and physiological challenges and will
make significant advancement towards understanding their unique cardiovascular
"design".
