Most animals experience large fluctuations in environmental conditions across
the seasons of the year. Consequently, many animals display seasonal changes in
physiology and behavior which allow them to cope with seasonal changes. Day
length is the main environmental cue used by animals to coordinate seasonal
behavioral and physiological responses. For example, animals living in long
"summer-like" day lengths will maintain high levels of the hormone testosterone
and thus will continue to breed, whereas animals housed on short "winter-like"
days will inhibit their breeding due to low testosterone. In addition, it has
recently been demonstrated that rodents housed in short days display increased
aggression compared with animals housed on long days, despite lower levels of
testosterone. This finding is particularly interesting given the traditional
belief that testosterone regulates aggression. The goal of this project is to
investigate the hormone mechanisms regulating seasonal changes in aggression in
rodents. Specifically, animals will be housed in long or short days in the lab
and levels of specific hormones, including the androgen DHEA and melatonin, will
be examined. Aggression will then be videotaped and quantified using a computer-
based video analysis system. Based on previous research, it is predicted that
the short days will increase aggression and that both DHEA and melatonin play a
role in mediating seasonal aggression. These experiments challenge the simple
notion that all forms of aggression are testosterone-dependent and have
important implications for the study of how hormones act on the brain to
regulate social behaviors and how these behaviors may be altered by the
environment. Collectively, these studies will help identify important and novel
mechanisms of hormonal control of aggression. Importantly, these studies will
provide excellent opportunities for both graduate and undergraduate students,
including under-represented minorities, to gain hands-on experience and to allow
them to develop important scientific skills by conducting, presenting and
publishing scientific research.
