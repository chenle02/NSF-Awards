This project focuses on two climate issues: 1) interactions between the East-
Asia monsoon and the west Pacific Ocean and 2) Variability in total ozone.
Diagnostic analysis will be carried out to understand (a) the role of seasonal
and interannual variations of the East-Asia monsoon in developing, maintaining
and strengthening of westerly anomalies in the western and central Pacific, and
(b) changes of the trade winds in the western Pacific induced by variations of
Tibetan heating and cooling. Recent data on vertical distribution of ozone will
be used to estimate changes in radiative heating rates and changes in solar
energy received at ground level due to variations in ozone. This work will
enhance our understanding of interannual Variability of the climate system.
