This work will explore two fundamental questions about multicellularity. First,
are the early stages of development necessarily the hardest to change? This
seems true in animals, but the project will test whether this pattern is
general, using genomic data in a very different multicellular system, a social
amoeba in which is normally a single-celled eukaryote, but upon starvation
aggregates and differentiates into a structure with reproductive spores and
sterile stalk cells. The second question is, how do multicellular organisms
protect themselves from mutant cell lineages that replicate too fast? The
project will use the novel strategy of constructing pseudo-organisms with
artificial life cycles. By allowing these to evolve and monitoring cellular
cooperation, the project will isolate factors that maintain multicellularity.

The most advanced organisms on earth, including people, animals, and plants,
are all multicellular. Yet there is much that we do not understand about how and
why multicellularity works. By focusing an unusual developmental system, the
project will test how events at one time or place in development affect and
constrain events at other times and places. They will also conduct the first
rigorous tests of what life cycles protect against conflict among cells - cancer
being a prominent example. The project will contribute to scientific training
and will reach out to the public via websites, science cafes, and events for
K-12 students.
