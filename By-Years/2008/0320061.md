This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I proposal considers new
innovations in wireless communication and local positioning capabilities for
pervasive computing hardware nodes. There are no suitable off-the-shelf hardware
that can be used to deploy a pervasive application for use in real time remote
sensing. The Phase I effort will focus on two specific innovations that would
alleviate some of those limitations: Multi-modal wireless communications,
including the simultaneous use of multiple radio frequency (RF) and non-RF
techniques, to enable redundant transmissions and error recovery while closely
guarding the system's power consumption and overall cost. Local positioning and
tracking, so that when numerous sensors are placed in close proximity in a
remote location (for example, within a few inches to yards of each other), their
precise locations are automatically determined and broadcast. Tracking is an
issue if any of the nodes are mobile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are vast
markets for pervasive computing hardware technology. In most cases, desired or
necessary applications don't exist because deployment is either too expensive or
not possible using existing off-the-shelf hardware and software. Some examples
of such markets are inventory tracking and asset management, human physiological
monitoring, machine health and diagnostics, battle theatre intelligence,
telecommunications, and environmental monitoring.&lt;br/&gt;
