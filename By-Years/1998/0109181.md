This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the
need for cost effective water treatment. Ultraviolet (UV) light treatment for
chemical contaminants in water is attractive because contaminants are destroyed,
unlike adsorption techniques that transfer the contaminant to a different media.
However, the use of UV is limited by electricity costs for lamp power. This
project uses a newly developed Surface Discharge (SD) UV lamp with UV efficiency
three times higher than the industry standard mercury UV lamp, which will reduce
electricity costs. Furthermore, the shorter wavelength UV spectrum of the SD
lamp can both increase destruction rate and reduce the amount of chemical
oxidant additive. Project objectives are to optimize lamp operation, to
demonstrate the advantages of the SD lamp to treat atrazine and
nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), two contaminants of national concern, and to
establish commercial feasibility. A successful Phase I will establish the
feasibility of a water treatment process based on the SD lamp, and will lead in
Phase II to a prototype system and to commercialization in Phase III.

The near term commercial applications of this project will be in the large
water treatment market that includes groundwater, industrial and municipal
wastewater, drinking water and general disinfection
