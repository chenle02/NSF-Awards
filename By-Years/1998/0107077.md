This research will describe the neural and cognitive components of learning by
observing, producing, and by imitating physical representations in the human
brain. This will allow developing new learning tools and pedagogical approaches
that may enhance education at all levels. It will use functional magnetic
resonance imaging of the brain to define the involvement of the
observation/execution matching system in different aspects of learning by
observation, production, and imitation. Specifically, the research will:

- Describe mental representations underlying knowledge acquisition through
representation, observation and imitation in neural and cognitive terms

- Investigate the mechanisms of individual learning in relation to social and
societal influences

- The definition of psychological and physiological mechanisms of speech
perception

The findings of this research are also relevant to brain development and the
relation between cognitive skill and developmental strategies.
