8905936 Shivaji and Castro This project is concerned with questions of existence
and multiplicity of solutions to nonlinear elliptic partial differential
equations. The particular problems under investigation represent extensions of
previous studies by mathematicians world-wide which have lead to fundamental
advances in nonlinear functional analysis and applications. These mathematical
problems arise in many areas of science and engineering. Examples include the
study of enzyme systems, heat generation, solid mechanics, stellar structure,
and chemical reaction theory.
