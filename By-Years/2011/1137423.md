This award will support an NSF/CMBS regional conference to be held at the
University of Massachusetts Boston in the summer of 2012 on the topic of unitary
representations of reductive groups. The principal speaker will be Professor
David Vogan from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This award will
support 30 participants at different stages of their careers.

The conference will provide a forum for discussing the latest advances in the
field, including a new algorithmic approach that has the potential to give
results for the largest exceptional group E_8. The conference will attract a
wide range of researchers and advanced graduate students who will be exposed to
sophisticated software and computational techniques that will enhance their
capacity to investigate conjectures and carry out complex simulations.
