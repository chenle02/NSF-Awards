Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Title: Comparative Physiology at the XXXV IUPS
Conference&lt;br/&gt;PI: Martin Frank, American Physiological
Society&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a request for funds ($25,000) is
to support the participation of young scientists, particularly women and under-
represented minorities to travel to the 23rd International Congress of
Physiological Sciences in San Diego, California from March 31-April 5, 2005. The
goal of the proposal is to develop a travel award program designed to encourage
US scientists to attend the Congress. The Congress is innovative and covers a
wide-range of physiology and pathophysiology, from the fields of genomic to
molecular biology. Evaluation of applications for travel grants will be made by
a selection subcommittee of USNC (US National Committee) and IUPS and will be
used to support younger scientists with particular attention to younger
scientists, women and underrepresented minorities. The funds will be used to
provide partial support for a minimum of 25 comparative physiologists to attend
the conference at approximately $1000 per recipient.&lt;br/&gt;
