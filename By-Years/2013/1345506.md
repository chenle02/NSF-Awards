This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate
the applicability of a flow measurement technology to the development of a low-
cost, closed loop infusion pump. Despite decades of industry research into flow
measurement technology, today?s infusion systems run entirely open loop, with no
capability to measure the flow they deliver, and this shortcoming compromises
pump safety and increases costs. The objective of this SBIR is to demonstrate
the feasibility of a flow sensor for drug delivery by demonstrating its
reliability in the presence of several medications. The program will provide
data to show that the industry?s requirements for the accuracy and reliability
of a flow sensor is met , and can be applied to next generation closed loop drug
delivery systems.

The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the release of a new
generation of low-cost, high accuracy pumps. This technology will make it
possible to delivery hospital-level infusion accuracy with the cost model of a
disposable pump, enabling infusions to move from the hospital to the home
setting. Flow measurement will further enable these infusions to be monitored
remotely by nurses, and will enable trends in infusion therapy outcomes to be
identified by collecting data which is simply not available today. The
technology will result in a substantial reduction in the costs associated with
medical infusion by reducing hospital stays, reducing equipment and capital
costs, reducing nurse hours dedicated to infusion by automating data collection,
and improving outcomes. Flow monitoring will create a new standard of care for
medical infusion, and in the future infusions will always be performed with this
integral safety and data collection technology.
