State-of-the-art high-performance analog circuits try to correct inherent
mismatching, inaccuracy, and randomness of analog devices by employing signal
processing methods known as error correction or tuning techniques. In these
techniques, compact on-chip zero-droop sample-and-hold (S/H) amplifiers improve
tuning performance by memorizing tuning information between tuning intervals in
a stable and accurate way. A compact and stable zero-droop S/H amplifier is
being studied and will be integrated in a standard CMOS technology. A systematic
study of this class of algorithms will also be undertaken with the purpose of
addressing stability, speed, and convergence questions.
