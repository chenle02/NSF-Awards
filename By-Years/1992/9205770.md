This research addresses the integration of source coding, channel coding, and
modulation. The first part of the problem is to map the samples of the source
into a code that minimizes the distortion and tries to maximize the minimum
distance between code words. The second part of the problem is to find a
suitable modulation scheme that is matched to the code and uses the bandwidth
efficiently. Performance measures that reflect the performance of an overall
system are developed. The performance of combined source and channel code using
permutation codes, which have been used independently for source coding and for
channel coding, will be considered. Initially permutation modulation is
considered in the design and analysis of the combined system. Next two
approaches are considered for coded modulation: signal sets derived from
generalized (optimal constant weight codes), and the use of combinatorial and
geometric structures to generate signal sets enabling the realization of multi-
dimensional modulation schemes through frequency, phase, and amplitude shift
keying, or combinations.
