The vast collections of fragile art objects and artifacts held by museums in
moderate and high seismic risk regions of the country are vulnerable to damage
or destruction should a significant earthquake occur. The museum community is
beginning to address the problem of seismic protection of fragile artifacts on
exhibit and in shortage. There are very few publications that provide guidance
to museum professionals that take into consideration the special requirements
for dealing with seismic risks. Research work has been completed to identify
existing protection methods and to develop new and improved methods that meet
the criteria of the museum community for protection from seismic events. Work
was done to determine the advantages, disadvantages, relative effectiveness, and
limitations of the different protection methods. This research project will
complete research necessary to establish guidelines for protecting museum
artifacts from earthquake damage and prepare documentation that can be used for
a guide useful to the museum community. Methods will be developed and tested
that protect artifacts on display and in storage from earthquake damage.
Dissemination of the research results will be done in cooperation with the user
community. An award is recommended for this one year complete research project.
The principal investigator is highly qualified to conduct the research and the
institution provides excellent support facilities.
