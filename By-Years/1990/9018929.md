Spatial and temporal variations in strain path and shear sense associated with
emplacement will be documented for the Papoose flat pluton of eastern
California. This pluton has been considered a classic example of forceful
emplacement in a coaxial strain field on the basis of earlier petrographic
studies of the pluton's marginal facies and its surrounding country rocks.
Recent reevaluation of the published petrofabric data from the pluton shows,
however, that a uniform sense of asymmetry exists in the fabric diagrams that is
consistent with pluton emplacement during large scale non-coaxial shearing.
Microstructural and crystallographic fabric criteria will be used with data from
rotated porphyroblasts and contract metamorphic mineral assemblages to determine
the strain path, temperature and shear sense during pluton emplacement. The
kinematic and deformation processes operative will thus be determined and these
data will constrain the possible mechanisms of pluton emplacement. The results
of this study will greatly improve our understanding of pluton emplacement
mechanisms in general, and will also provide a much needed link between
naturally produced deformation microstructives and those produced experimentally
and by computer simulation studies.
