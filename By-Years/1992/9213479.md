This award provides renewed support for the Natural Hazards Research and
Applications Information Center at the University of Colorado in Boulder. The
Center monitors and disseminates hazards research information to multiple users
--administrators, practitioners, policy makers, scientists and engineers. The
Center publishes and distributes the NATURAL HAZARDS OBSERVER to over 10,000
subscribers six times a year; operates an electronic newsletter, DISASTER
RESEARCH ; and publishes monographs, working papers, bibliographies and special
publications. It holds an annual workshop involving users and producers of
hazards research, and it provides information on a day- to-day basis in response
to inquiries. The Center conducts modest research activities relating to
societal response to natural hazards and supports researchers throughout the
nation as they carry out "quick response" studies of specific hazard events.
Inaddition to NSF, several other agencies are also supporting this activity.
