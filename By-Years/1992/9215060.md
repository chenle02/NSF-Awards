This proposal requests support for a one day symposium to be held at the annual
meeting of the American Society of Zoologists in Vancouver, Canada in December,
1992. This meeting is co- sponsored with the Canadian Society of Zoologists. The
symposium consists of eleven 30-minute presentations. The speakers take a
multidisciplinary approach that cuts across taxonomic and conceptual lines,
namely mammals, lower vertebrates, and invertebrates; empirical versus
theoretical studies; individual level versus population level studies.
Interactions among such a diverse group of researchers should: 1) lead to an
assessment of knowledge on the evolution of intraspecific predation and its
impact on a species' population dynamics and its role in its community 2)
identify information gaps 3) delineate new directions for future research and 4)
facilitate the transfer of conceptual and technical information from one sub-
discipline to another. A one day symposium together with contributed paper and
poster session is planned; this is an ideal time frame for assessing progress in
a developing area of inquiry.
