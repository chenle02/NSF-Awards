ABSTRACT R. O. Narayanan University of Florida CTS-9500393 The Department of
Chemical Engineering and the Center for Surface Science at the University of
Florida will purchase an Infra Red (IR) Thermal Imagine system. The equipment
will be used for several projects. The IR Thermal Imaging system will be used to
map out the thermal fields at a liquid gas interface in flow systems which are
driven by interfacial convection and in static systems where the temperature and
heat transport is affected by surfactant monolayers.
