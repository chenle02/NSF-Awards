The focus of this research is the preparation of silaallenes, silynes,
borasilenes and diborenes. Attempts will be made to prepare fullerenes
containing one or more silicon atoms in the cage and to construct polymers
containing fullerene clusters linked by siloxane or polysilane moieties. %%%
With this renewal award the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research
of Dr. Robert West of the Department of Chemistry at the University of
Wisconsin, Madison. Professor West will focus his work on the synthesis of
multiply-bonded silicon and boron compounds, the preparation of silicon
derivatives of the fullerenes and polymers containing fullerene clusters.
