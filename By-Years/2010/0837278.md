Physics(13) Faculty from George Washington University's departments of physics,
biology and computer science are developing a novel introductory physics course
that extends the NSF-supported SCALE-UP (Student-Centered Active Learning
Environment for Undergraduate Programs) curriculum to investigations of
biological systems. For this calculus-based introductory mechanics course, the
biological applications drive the introduction of the physics principles rather
than being mere sidebars. The project is producing in-class activities, problem
sets, and computation exercises using biologically-inspired alternatives. The
course is using microbial motion and molecular dynamics as central motivating
examples, while simultaneously introducing students to grand challenge problems.
Additional important course elements include student-created videos, student
self-reflections, and career planning. Materials provided by this project will
enable physics departments interested in increasing enrollments to develop a new
and innovative interdisciplinary course with a minimum of effort.
