The CEDAR ( Coupling, Energetics and Dynamics of Atmospheric Regions ) program
has as part of its major goals the understanding of the mesosphere/lower
thermosphere region of the atmosphere. One of the most powerful techniques used
to study this region is optical lidar and the CEDAR program has led in the
development of sensitive state of the art rayleigh and resonance lidar systems.
This project is another step forward in this area with the installation of a
temperature measurement lidar system for that region of the atmosphere. This
will be only the second such system capable of routine temperature measurements
in the world and will be the most advanced system. This coupled with the
simultaneous measurements with other lidar systems and radar systems at the
Urbana,Illinois field station will provide significant new incite into the
dynamics of the mesosphere and lower thermosphere.
