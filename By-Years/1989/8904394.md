The goals of this proposal follow two parallel developments in the application
of thermodynamics to problems of protein unfolding. One addresses fundamental
issues associated with thermodynamics of solvent-induced and thermal unfolding
of proteins and the other involves the use of thermodynamic techniques in
studies of the unfolding of oxidized and reduced thioredoxin and mutant
thioredoxin species. Thioredoxin is a protein in which a change in protein
stability is an integral aspect of it function. Thermodynamic studies of the
unfolding of thioredoxin and site-specific mutant forms of this protein can be
used to establish the ground rules and constraints to which mechanistic studies
of thioredoxin folding must conform. Historically, there have been two major
approaches to the problem of protein folding. One, largely thermodynamic in
emphasis, is concerned with the stability of protein species and attempts to
understand the forces which lead to stabilization of the native (folded) state.
The other approach, which uses kinetic studies to a large extent, focuses on
mechanisms of folding with the goal of understanding the molecular events which
ultimately lead to the folding native protein. Both of these approaches have
contributed to the present day understanding of protein folding.
