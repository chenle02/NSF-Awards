Professor Candela will measure the transport of spin and magnetization in the
Fermi liquids 3He and 3He-4He mixtures when a significant fraction of the 3He
spins have been polarized along some direction. Due to quantum statistics obeyed
by 3He atoms, the polarization is expected to have a profound effect upon many
properties of the liquids, including the spin transport. Pulsed nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) spectroscopy will be used to probe liquid samples in a large
magnetic field of 10 Tesla and at low temperatures, less than 10 milliKelvin.
Theories of non-linear waves in bounded media will be compared with the results.
There are predictions that non-linear spin waves including solitons and more
complicated quasiperiodic modes, should be detectable in these liquids under the
experimental conditions to be used. Spin transport in highly polarized 3He
liquid will be studied with the pulsed NMR technique.
