This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses an
immediate need for a real-time means for measuring vapor phase water mass flux
in pharmaceutical and biotechnology manufacturing. The specific innovation is
the combination of low-pressure vapor phase water concentration and gas velocity
measurements to provide a determination of vapor phase mass flux rates. During
the Phase I effort critical sensor hardware will be designed, fabricated and
tested on commercially available manufacturing equipment. The sensor development
targets a new initiative by the Food and Drug Administration and the
pharmaceutical industry to use process analytical technology for on-line process
control to improve drug manufacturing quality, drug availability, industry
competitiveness, and prescription drug costs. The Phase I program will verify
the technical and commercial feasibility of the mass flux monitor.

The commercial application of this project is to improve quality control in the
pharmaceutical manufacturing industry. The vapor phase mass flux monitor will
provide the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries with a sensor for real-
time mass flux measurements, enabling improved drug manufacturing process
efficiency and quality. The project advances research and education via
collaborations with pharmaceutical scientists at the University of Connecticut
and Purdue University.
