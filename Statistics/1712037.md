This project considers the modeling of ranking and categorical data that are
strongly dependent in nature. Typical examples of dependent ranking data arise
when one ranks students in a class based on exam scores, or when people rank
movies on a website. Typical examples of dependent categorical data arise when
one studies how the behavioral patterns of people in a social network (say
smoking or voting preference) are influenced by their friends. Both types of
data have become increasingly common. This project studies modeling schemes for
such data aimed at capturing its dependence, which is not assumed to be well
understood. The research develops a rigorous understanding of the behavior of
these models, which will aid in statistical inferences from data sets of these
types.

For the ranking work, the project will study the Mallows model of rankings and
its generalizations. Most existing research concentrates on one particular such
model, namely the Mallows model with Kendall's tau. This project instead puts
forth a general framework based on permutation limit theory to understand the
behavior of Mallows models and permutation models in general. For modeling
dependent or categorical data, the focus is on Ising models, which originated in
statistical physics and have received significant recent attention in statistics
and machine learning. The main goal of the research is to develop inference for
Ising model parameters that are not computationally prohibitive.
