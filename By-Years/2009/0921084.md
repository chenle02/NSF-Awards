The University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) is a consortium
of sixty-one U.S. academic institutions with research and educational programs
in the ocean sciences and dedication to the major shared-use facilities that
support these programs. These institutions support a broad array of facilities,
which include research vessels, submersibles, remotely operated vehicles,
autonomous underwater vehicles, aircraft, icebreakers, major instrumentation,
and national facilities. The institution or the supporting federal agencies own
these shared-use assets and it is through the UNOLS system that the community is
able to access them. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI's request funding to host the
UNOLS Office beginning in May 2009. As one of the founding institutions of
UNOLS, GSO has a long tradition and deep experience with this organization and
with the federal agencies that fund it. Since its inception in 1971, UNOLS has
played an increasingly important role in coordinating and improving the
operations of the nation's academic research fleet. Because the organization
functions largely through the voluntary efforts of scientists and professionals
from across the country, it is essential that the UNOLS Office be staffed by
people who thoroughly understand UNOLS and are committed to its success.
