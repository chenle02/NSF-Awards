This award will support collaborative research between Dr. Robert C. Liebermann
of the State University of New York at Stony Brook and Dr. Ian Jackson of the
Australian National University. This research is to investigate the elastic
properties of the high-pressure phases of mantle minerals. Specifically, the
project will synthesize polycrystalline specimens of the high-pressure phases of
olivine (a silicate of magnesium and iron) in the large-volume, split-sphere
apparatus at Stony Brook and determine the pressure dependence of the elastic
wave velocities of these specimens in the ultrasonics laboratory at the
Australian National University. The project represents excellent collaboration
between the Australian group with its unique ultrasonics laboratory and the
equally unique Liebermann high-pressure apparatus at Stony Brook. This is
important fundamental work to achieve better understanding of the elastic
properties of the high- pressure phases of mantle minerals. In addition, the new
data will be utilized to construct improved models of velocity depth profiles in
the Earth's mantle for comparison with seismological measurements.
