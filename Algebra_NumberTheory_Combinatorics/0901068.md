Harmonic weak Maass forms are the subject of much current interest. A harmonic
weak Maass form of weight k is a smooth function of the upper half-plane which
transforms with respect to a subgroup of the modular group, is annhilated by the
hyperbolic Laplacian in weight k, and has at most linear exponential growth at
cusps. Such forms decompose into holomorphic and non-holomorphic parts. Non-
holomorphic parts are related to period integrals of elliptic cusp forms. The
holomorphic parts, sometimes called mock modular forms, appear in a variety of
mathematical contexts. In the 1970s, Zagier showed that the generating function
for Hurwitz class numbers is a mock modular form. More recently, Bringmann, Ono,
and Zwegers showed that Ramanujan's mock theta functions are mock modular forms.
Subsequent works applied the theory of harmonic weak Maass forms to geometry,
mathematical physics, and probability theory, and to topics more closely allied
to number theory such as partitions and q-series, elliptic modular forms, traces
of singular moduli, Borcherds products, and modular L-functions. Motivated by
these connections, this proposal addresses questions concerning the holomorphic
parts of harmonic weak Maass forms. In particular, the PI intends to study
problems requiring interplay between harmonic weak Maass forms and elliptic
modular forms.

The PI's research interest is in number theory. The topics in this proposal
originate in work of the legendary mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan in the
early twentieth century. An important part of Ramanujan's legacy concerns the
large quantity of aesthetic formulas he discovered involving functions called
q-series. Toward the end of his life, he discovered a particular family of
q-series which he called "mock theta functions". Though these functions share
many properties with modular forms, a class of functions central to modern
number theory, the mock theta functions are not modular forms. Recent works of
Bringmann, Ono, and Zwegers finally settled the question, as to the precise
relationship between the mock theta functions and the theory of automorphic
forms, a theory which subsumes the theory of modular forms. This question had
been outstanding for roughly eighty years. We now know that a mock theta
function is "part" or "half" of a certain automorphic form called a harmonic
weak Maass form. This discovery motivates the study of a broader class of
functions, called mock modular forms, which arise as "parts" of harmonic weak
Maass forms. These functions have applications not only to number theory, but to
other areas of mathematics such as geometry, topology, and probability, and to
mathematical physics.
