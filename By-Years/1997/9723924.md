9723924 Mirkin This research will focus on the role of DNA triplexes in DNA
replication. In previous studies, we found that DNA triplexes formed prior to or
during in vitro DNA polymerization severely block this process. The mechanism of
this phenomenon lies in DNA polymerase's inability to untangle triplex regions
in DNA templates, while being perfectly capable of untangling the corresponding
duplex regions. Thus, DNA triplexes can form a stable barrier to DNA polymerases
under physiological conditions. We hypothesize, that DNA triplexes might also
inhibit DNA replication in vivo. Supporting this hypothesis, we recently found
that a particular triplex-forming DNA sequence, d(G)n(d(C)n, blocks replication
fork movement in E. coli cells. This effect depends on the length of the
repeated sequence and its orientation relative to the replication origin, and is
not abolished by a protein synthesis inhibitor. These results are very
suggestive of an unusual structure formed by d(G)n(d(C)n in vivo that may be
responsible for the replication arrest. The specific aim of this research is to
obtain direct proof that the triplex structure of the d(G)n(d(C)n repeated
sequence causes replication arrest, and to expand these studies to include
different triplex-forming repeats. We will accomplish detailed mutational
analysis of the d(G)n(d(C)n repeat combined with analysis of replication
intermediates to distinguish between the numerous structural opportunities known
for this sequence. To provide direct insight on the structure formed by this
repeated sequence in vivo, we will carry out chemical probing of
(G)n(d(C)n-containing plasmids in E. coli cells using the structure-specific
chemical chloroacetaldehyde. We will also analyze the effects of triplex-forming
repeated sequences of various length and composition on plasmid DNA replication
in E. coli cells using two-dimensional electrophoresis of replication
intermediates. The long term goal of this research is to understand how triplex-
forming DNA repeated sequences affect the regulation of DNA replication in vivo.
