A request is made to fund Oceanographic Instrumentation on R/V Atlantic
Explorer, a 168â€™ general purpose research vessel owned and operated by Bermuda
Institute of Ocean Science (BIOS) as part of the United States Academic Research
Fleet (ARF). BIOS is a U.S. 501 (c) 3 and 509 (a) not-for-profit research and
educational institution incorporated in the state of New York, and
geographically located on the Island of Bermuda. The mission of the ship is to
support funded science research throughout the Central Atlantic but specifically
work in support of the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series (BATS) program.

With this proposal, BIOS provides technical descriptions and rationale for the
acquisition of the following Instrumentation: 1) CTD Carousel Water Sampling
Frame $24,365 2) Seapoint Fluorometer Migration $22,934 3) 3.5kHz Transducers
$14,600 IDC $10,894 $72,793

Broader Impacts The principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit
Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 19-602). It provides
infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use
instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects
(which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of
NSF). The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation
allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working,
calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research,
and expanding the base of potential researchers.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
