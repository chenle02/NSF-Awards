This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes to develop a
glass fiber capable of transmitting high peak power laser radiation in the
region of 3 microns. Numerous medical and dental applications are presently
stymied by the lack of such a fiber or attempting to use awkward articulated
mirrors which severely limit their surgical precision. This 3 micron region is
of interest because hydroxyapatite, the major constituent of bone and enamel
absorbs at 2.94 microns. This wavelength, centered at the major absorption of
water (-OH) is non-ionizing, permitting laser surgery without charring. It
follows therefore, that the glass fiber must be free of the -OH absorption also.
Such fibers have been developed for communications (anhydrous ZBLANS), but these
fibers are brittle and so far, break under high power irradiation. KIGRE, Inc.,
proposes to chemically modify germanium-based glasses to reduce the 3 micron
absorption to acceptable levels while retaining their strong silicate-like
physical characteristics.
