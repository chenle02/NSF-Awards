This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I research proposal will
demonstrate a family of high efficiency and high power density actuators
utilizing Parallel Magnetic Circuit (PMC) technology. This magnetic force
control technology will be applicable to any electromagnetic device. Unlike
"conventional" electro-magnetic motors and actuators, which use series magnetic
circuits limited by the force of the most powerful single magnet element, PMC
moves flux from multiple permanent magnets and field coils into a coherent and
additive geometry, dramatically increasing both efficiency and power density.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact will be that in addition to being four
to six times as efficient and producing a minimum of four times as much torque
as an equivalent standard motor, PMC actuators also allow greater continuous
torque, are lighter to comparable actuators, require no active liquid cooling,
and are highly reliable with reduced maintenance costs. This actuator technology
has the potential to have a significant impact in robotics, conventional
vehicles, and hybrid-electric, or electric vehicles. &lt;br/&gt;
