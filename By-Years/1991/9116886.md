In this project, the PI's will use the global XBT data set over the 10-year
period, 1979-1988 to map the thermal structure over the globe and study seasonal
and interannual variability. Of particular interest are the sea surface
temperature and vertically averaged temperature over the upper 400 meters, the
latter addressing variability of heat content and steric sea level. An expected
result is the identification of global teleconnections in the interannual
variability of both sea surface temperature and vertically averaged temperature
associated with El Nino and Southern Oscillation. Cross correlation with
seasonal atmospheric pressure fields will allow the study of coupled modes of
global variability.
