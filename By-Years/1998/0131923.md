Integrating Information and Institutions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will
support the initial development of a social, political, and policy research
center on the topic of government enabled by information technologies. Initial
research will begin in two areas: i) institutional analysis (how information
technologies are brought into government and affect the organization and its
modes of operation, in particular across multiple agencies), and ii) policy
networks as informational and deliberative structures.&lt;br/&gt;Other elements
of the award will support the center aspects of the proposal to draw in and
support the formation of a research community. These elements include a Doctoral
Fellows program, support for graduate students, seminars, workshops, and other
forms of outreach.
