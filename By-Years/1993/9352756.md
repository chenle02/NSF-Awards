9352756 Lilly This project proposes to address the need for more active learning
techniques through an experimental undergraduate economics laboratory. The
laboratory itself consists of a local area network connecting a dedicated file
server with desktop computers. This lab also allows the use of software to
simulate a number of market environments, and thereby run a wide variety of
experiments which were previously impossible. These computerized experiments
have a number of advantages over current noncomputerized ones. They are faster,
data collection and data storage are much easier, and more experimental control
can be exerted. It is also expected that students using the lab will be able to
access several statistical packages, including graphics and other computer
routines. ***
