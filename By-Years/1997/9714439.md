9714439 Gaffney Characterizing the population structure of important Antarctic
species is essential to an improved understanding of Antarctic ecology, and the
successful management of this ecosystem. The British Antarctic Survey (BAS) has
initiated a collaborative international effort (Project Gene Flow) aimed at
delineating population structure in several key species (fish, squid and krill).
A one-month cruise in the Scotia Sea to obtain biological specimens and
oceanographic data is scheduled for November 1977, and this represents a unique
opportunity to apply both established and novel molecular techniques to an
important problem in Antarctic resource management. Four commercially and/or
ecologically important species will be the primary targets of the research:
mackerel icefish, Patagonian Toothfish, Antarctic Krill and the Seven Star
Flying Squid. A variety of molecular genetic techniques, including some that are
well-established and others that are novel but extremely promising, will be
applied to delineate genetic population structure in these species. This
research will provide information on the whether separate "stocks" or
genetically different populations of these species exist in Antarctic waters.
This information will be useful in the management of these species.
