The purpose of the proposed research is to identify and characterize persistent
IR spectral effects in a variety of crystalline and disordered solids. The
technique provides a high resolution window into defect dynamics and the local
environment, measures the excited vibrational state dephasing time and probes
the low lying non-equilibrium elastic configurations in both crystalline and
disordered solids. Four different types of systems will be explored: 1) glass-
like crystals will provide a new approach for studying low lying states in
glasses; 2) the apparent strong interaction between persistent photodarkening
and persistent IR hole burning in chalcogenide glasses; 3) whether glassy
behavior in polymers translates into persistent spectroscopic effects; 4)
whether the impurity-induced far IR spectrum associated with heavy metal
impurities in alkali halides is persistent.
