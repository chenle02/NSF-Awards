The project addresses open problems in noncommutative analysis, mathematical
physics, noncommutative geometry, and operator theory in the operator algebras
framework. One of the objectives is to advance recent powerful results on
multiple operator integrals and spectral shift functions that have been obtained
jointly with D. Potapov and F. Sukochev. New noncommutative analysis techniques
will be developed and applied to various problems of perturbation theory that
have arisen in the areas mentioned above. Another objective is to make progress
in understanding structure of important operators affiliated with von Neumann
algebras, continuing investigation started jointly with K. Dykema.

The proposed research is expected to strengthen connections between several
areas of mathematics and to make a link to modern studies in physics. Many of
the projects are accessible to students, at both graduate and undergraduate
levels. The investigator proposes to contribute to general education in the
respective areas of mathematics as well as involve students into specific
projects. The results of the proposed research will be disseminated to the
worldwide scientific community through publications and talks. This will include
writing expository articles and delivering talks to students. The investigator
will continue organizing conferences and popularizing careers in mathematics
among youth and underrepresented groups.
