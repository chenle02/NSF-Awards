This renewal award is made in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic
Chemistry Program to Clemson University in support of the research of Dr. Joseph
W. Kolis. The thrusts of the research will be: (1) the synthesis and
characterization of transition metal chalcogenide carbonyls, (2) the synthesis
and characterization of mixed main group anion clusters prepared from transition
metal carbonyls and arsenic and phosphorous sulfides and selenides, and (3) the
synthesis under kinetically-controlled conditions of solid-state materials based
on the above chemistry. The use of molten salts and supercritical solvents will
be employed to prepare solid-state clusters in a mid-temperature regime where
decomposition to thermodynamically stable products does not occur. %%% An
investigation into the coordination chemistry of novel main group anions will
provide new transition metal chalcogenides, new mixed main group anion clusters
and new solid-state materials. Possible applications are catalysis, lubrication,
battery components and semiconductors.
