In this award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry
Program, Edward R. Grant of Purdue University will extend and expand his current
investigations on the chemistry of gas phase organometallic compounds. The
purpose of the work is to characterize the kinetics and energetics of important
elementary reactions of these molecules in the gas phase. Pulsed laser radiation
will be used to initiate the reactions. Transient infrared and nuclear magnetic
resonance spectroscopic detection methods that span the range of time scales
from nanoseconds to hours, will be used to monitor the progress of the
reactions. The understanding of these elementary reaction processes will also
contribute to the science of catalysis and to the development of potentially
useful catalysts. The type reactions to be studied include: (1) elementary dis-
sociation and recombination reactions of organometallic com- pounds with two
electron ligands, including unsaturated hydrocarbons and carbon momoxide; (2)
two-coordinate inter- actions of unsaturated metal centers with sigma-(H-H) and
(C-H) bonds; (3) gas phase transformations of metal-oxo complexes; and (4) early
transition metal electroplilic carbon-hydrogen activation reactions.
