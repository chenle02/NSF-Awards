This research project deals with an analytical and experimental study of
friction in machine tools. The experimental aspects include the design and
fabrication of a double-shear friction apparatus for active control of both
sliding velocity and normal force, and the collection of data at the friction
interface for a variety of materials and lubricants. The analytical component of
the research project utilizes the test data for developing history- dependent
friction models. There models are used to study the design and analysis of
controllers for high-fidelity motion, including the development of stability
criteria, and design of model-based and adaptive compensators. These models are
applied to the design and performance evaluation of passive and active friction
dampers and structural joints. Analytical techniques such as perturbation theory
and nonlinear dynamical system theory are used. The results of this research
lead to a better understanding of low-velocity motion control such as required
for high-precision machines in manufacturing, and improvements in the
performance of friction dampers used in turbo machinery and damping joints used
in flexible structures.*** //
