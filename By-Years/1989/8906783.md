A combined numerical and analytic investigation of the solution properties of
conjugated polymers will be carried out. The focus will be on the interplay
between conformational and electronic degrees of freedom. The model is based on
the Huckel theory for the pi electrons with explicit dependence of the resonance
integrals on bond rotation angles. It is planned to carry out exact
diagonalizations of the electronic Hamiltonian, including the statistical
freedom in the rotation angles, using Monte Carlo methods. Subsequent studies
will include side-group interactions, elastic energies, and Coulomb correlations
as well as external fields (electric and hydrodynamic). The numerical studies
will be augmented by various analytic methods for limiting cases; these include
high-temperature expansions, RG calculations, boson representations, etc. A goal
is to confront such experimental quantities as optical absorption, frequency
dependent dielectric function, neutron and light scattering structure factors,
and viscoelastic properties.//
