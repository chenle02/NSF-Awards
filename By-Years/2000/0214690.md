EIA-0214690&lt;br/&gt;Margaret L. Hedstrom&lt;br/&gt;University of
Michigan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Digital Government: Proposal for a Workshop to
Develop a Research Agenda on Digital Archiving and
Preservation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Archiving of digital records in the Federal
government is rapidly outstripping the need for archiving of physical objects -
for example, it is expected that in the next year or so, the National Archive
and Records Administration (NARA) must be prepared to accept, index, and make
searchable over 20 million Federal emails.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Few agencies are
thinking beyond the next 2-3 years, though many, such as NARA, will be required
to maintain electronic records in perpetuity. Many issues arise, such as the
natural 3-5 year obsolescence cycle of computintg systems, and the perhaps
longer cycle of operating systems and applications and associated file formats.
Research in this area is clearly needed - the question is one of identifying
topic areas in detail, and assigning some priority. That is what this workshop
is intended to accomplish. Several other agencies will actively participate in
this workshop: the National Library of Medicine, the Library of Congress and the
National Agricultural Library.
