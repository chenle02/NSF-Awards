This is a program to study isostasy, subsurface thermal and crustal structure
and morphology at the a superfast segment of the EPR and the transform bounding
it. The project is built around a detailed gravity and multibeam bathymetric
survey of a 185 km long section of the southern EPR axis anf flank located
between 7 40 S and 9 20 S which includes the Wilkes transform. This will be the
first detailed examination of the off-axis ridge flank and of a transform on the
superfast southern EPR using the modern generation of swath mapping and
precision gravimeters. This data will allow the PIs to examine the ridge crest
and ridge flank isostasy in three dimensions and to address a number of
fundamental problems related to the thermal structure, crustal structure,
segmentation and evolution of ridge flank morphology along MORs and transforms.
