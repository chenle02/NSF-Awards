During the last decades, long memory statistical models have become an important
part of theoretical and applied time series analysis. These models are
characterized by slowly decaying correlation functions at infinity, or by
spectral densities possessing singularities (poles or zeros) at the origin.
These features change in an essential way the statistical estimation and
prediction procedures, and as a consequence, many of the methods and results
used for analyzing short-memory time series models are no longer appropriate.
The main objective of the proposal is to develop rigorous estimation and
prediction procedures for a broad class of time series models that possess
various types of memory structures. The PIs will study estimation and prediction
problems for second order discrete or continuous time stationary random
processes with spectral density functions that may have singularities, and the
related analytical problems from Toeplitz operators theory, which serve as tools
both in the discrete and continuous time case. In the estimation problem, the
PIs will investigate the statistical properties of various estimators of the
unknown parameters of the model, which depend on the memory structure and the
smoothness of the spectral density. In the prediction problem the PIs will study
the rate of decrease of the relative prediction error as the length of observed
past increases.

In many practical applications (for instance, economics, finance, computer
science, hydrology), the data is well described by time series exhibiting both
long memory and seasonality, or by some functions of such time series. The
proposed model captures all these as special cases, and provides a sensible way
to analyze certain macroeconomic time series (inflation and interest rates,
monetary aggregates, revenue series, etc.), financial time series (volatility of
financial asset returns, forward exchange market premia, etc.) as well as time
series which arise in the analysis of computer traffic networks.
