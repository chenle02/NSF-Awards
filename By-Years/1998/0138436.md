0138436&lt;br/&gt;Cutkosky&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This six-month award will
support a dissertation enhancement project of Sean Bailey, a student in the
Department of Mechanical Engineering at Stanford University. He will work with
Prof. Paolo Dario at the ARTS Laboratory at the Scuola Superiore Santa Anna
(SSSA), in Pisa, Italy. The objective of Mr. Bailey's research is to extend the
layered manufacturing approach of Shape Deposition Manufacturing (SDM) to
mesoscale robotic devices. The researchers at SSSA are experts in the design of
small medical devices. While at SSSA, Mr. Bailey will become familiar with
state-of-the-art small-scale processing machines. He will then develop SDM
techniques using these machines for mesoscale robots and demonstrate these new
techniques by producing a highly sensorized mesoscale probe. A particular goal
is to formalize the process planning constraints that apply in this specialized
variation on SDM.&lt;br/&gt;
