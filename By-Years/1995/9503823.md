Abstract ATM-9503823 Anderson, Roger Y. University of New Mexico Title: Science
Coordinating Meeting for Western North America Segment of Polar-Equator-Pole
Transect for Past Global Changes This award supports a workshop and coordinating
meeting for a segment of the PEP 1 (Pole-Equator-Pole) transect in order to
facilitate efforts by the science community to meet objectives of Past Global
Changes (PAGES). The segment selected for coordination is Western North America
(WNA), including the marine continental margin. Invitees and participants will
be asked to follow an agenda that seeks to identify climate-related problems and
sites amenable to investigation in WNA, to encourage cross-disciplinary
collaborative research, and to provide a framework for communicating results and
coordinating efforts to provide quantitative information about past climate
change and responses to climate changes in WNA. The three-day meeting will be
held on 19- 21 January, 1995 in Albuquerque, NM.
