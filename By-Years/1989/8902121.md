8902121 Meyer/Plemmons This project involves the investigation of several
problems in numerical linear algebra, with special emphasis on the topics of
parallel algorithms for recursive least squares and the computation of
stationary distributions for large scale Markov chains. Recursive least squares
computations, including updating and downdating algorithms are especially
important in signal processing and control. Markov chains have wide
applicability as models for many problems in engineering and in the mathematical
and physical sciences. Additional efforts will be made in the study of stability
and conditioning problems associated with recursive least squares and Markov
chain computations and more general eigenvector problems. An architectural
aspect of this research will involve the identification of those features of
contemporary and proposed multiprocessors which are best suited for implementing
the algorithms under investigation. The goals of this research are to
investigate the theoretical aspects of these computations as well as to develop
new technologies for solving large scale problems in an efficient and stable
way.
