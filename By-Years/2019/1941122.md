Infants need frequent periods of rest or sleep for their physical and emotional
well-being. Sleep also plays a very important role in learning and memory. Sleep
helps babies to solidify newly learned information in their memories, a process
known as consolidation. The goal of this project is to study the role of sleep
in motor learning — acquiring a new skill involving physical coordination of
movement. The results will provide important insights into how the quality and
timing of infants’ sleep influences their ability to process new information and
consolidate new motor problem-solving abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
proposed work bridges three areas of research: cognitive development, motor
development, and sleep. Infants who have just begun to sit independently will
learn to solve a novel reaching task. Following the task, infants will
experience a delay that includes an enhanced motor training after which some
will nap and others will not. The impact of napping will be assessed. A home
video baby monitoring system that documents characteristics of infants’ sleep
via computer-vision technology will provide “video from the crib” and will be
employed to assess individual differences in quality of sleep and how they
relate to solving the novel motor problem. Measuring sleep prior to training and
the following night will permit investigation of the unique contributions of day
and night sleep to learning in infancy. A comparison group of infants born pre-
term will allow for the investigation into whether the relation between sleep
and learning is compromised in infants at risk for sleep disorders, for reduced
capacity for focused attention, and for motor delay. The proposed research
should ultimately provide guidelines for balancing enriched learning
experiences, interventions for at-risk populations, and a protective environment
that promotes rest and regulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
