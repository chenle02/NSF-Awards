The role of margin-parallel translations of accreted oceanic terranes is of
current interest in transpressional orogens. This is an interdisciplinary
investigation of deformed and metamorphosed oceanic rocks on islands off Baja
California Sur, Mexico. The islands contain island arc assemblages, ophiolitic
rocks, blueschist-facies subduction-related rocks and sparse cover, the ages of
which are unknown but thought to be Mesozoic. This study will determine the ages
of crystallization, coding, and metamorphism of the igneous rocks and will
obtain geochemical, biostratigraphic, structural and paleomagnetic data. The
results will be used to correlate tectonic terranes in western and southern
Mexico and to determine the timing and magnitude of margin-parallel
displacements. These findings will place important constraints on the tectonic
evolution of the southern Cordillera of the western North American plate.
