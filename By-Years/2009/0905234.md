The design of computational systems that support group decisions, allocate
resources to distributed tasks, or mediate social interactions is fundamentally
different from the corresponding design problem serving individual or
centralized users. When multiple parties, or agents, are involved, the
designer's objectives are complicated by the fact that the interests of these
parties are rarely, if ever, perfectly aligned. The field of mechanism design
offers a theoretical framework that directly addresses the issue of incentives
as it relates to the design of multiagent systems. However, this purely
analytical approach carries with it inherent practical limitations. The
investigators introduce a new approach, empirical mechanism design (EMD), whose
premise is to extend the basic foundation of mechanism design with empirical
methods such as simulation and statistical analysis. These extensions promise to
dramatically expand the scope of mechanism design beyond the small-scale,
stylized, or idealized domains to which it has been predominantly limited to
date.

The project will investigate several concrete EMD problems, within the general
theme of market design. Improved market design has significant implications for
the public and private sectors. In public policy, market-based approaches are
likely to play a major role in, for example, instituting measures to cope with
climate change, banking reform and regulation, and adoption of new energy
sources. In the commercial domain, new markets for advertising placement,
computational services, and other goods will also entail significant mechanism
design efforts. Regardless of the sector, design outcomes bear on important
social objectives including efficiency, transparency, and stability (e.g., of
financial relationships). An empirical basis for evaluating candidate mechanisms
will complement existing theoretical perspectives, enriching the tools available
to designers and other stakeholders.
