This action funds Christine Offerman of Tufts University to conduct a research
project, entitled "A formula regarding the averages of functions over spheres in
a symmetric space," during the summer of 2012 at Okayama University in Okayama,
Okayama Prefecture. The host scientist is Prof. Tomoyuki Kakehi.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to prove a generalization in
harmonic analysis and integral geometry on symmetric spaces with the intent to
prove a generalization of the √Åsgiersson Mean Value Theorem. Proving this
theorem admits solutions to the multi-temporal wave equation and other
interesting partial differential equations.

The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-
hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science,
science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
