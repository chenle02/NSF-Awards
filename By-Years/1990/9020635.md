Computer equipment will be purchased to enhance the existing UNIDA TA program
within the Atmospheric Science Department at Cornell University. This award will
allow the acquisition of a powerful UNIX based workstation and a 386 based PC.
This equipment will be used primarily for data ingest and analysis. The UNIDATA
suite of software will provide the Department with easy access to station data,
satellite images and gridded analysis and forecasts from numerical models. These
data are used extensively in research and instruction within the Department and
as input to an interactive access and display system, known as CLIMOD (CLimate
Information for Management and Operational Decisions). In addition to enhancing
the Department's capabilities, there is a need to reconfigure existing equipment
and to acquire new equipment because UNIDATA will no longer support or will
continue to develop its software for the VMS operating system. The VMS operating
system is the primary operating system used in the Department today. Also, an
older PC is being replaced by a faster and more capable PC to allow the more
effective use of McIDAS which is a UNIDATA supported software package.
