9353801 Graham "Integrating a Multi-Interface, Multi-Access Online
Communications And Information System" , submitted under the program for Small
Grants for Experimental Research (SGER), is a project which attempts to provide
a mechanism to incorporate a client-server conferencing capability to Internet
interfacing software for the science and mathematics education community. To
accomplish this task, it is necessary to perform research and experimentation on
several graphical client-servers and to investigate methods of integrating the
software across the DOS, Windows, and Macintosh platforms. The major outcome of
this project will be a body of research which software developers can refer to
in their attempts to build effective Internet conferencing tools. ***
