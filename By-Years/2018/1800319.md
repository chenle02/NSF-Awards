The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project relates to the
development of cellular products with therapeutic value. Human cells extracted
from a donor can be grown in a dish, reprogrammed to gain new functionalities,
and injected into a patient to replace or repair damaged and diseased tissues.
This therapeutic approach can be used in a variety of organ regeneration and
wound healing procedures. For instance, cultured cells can be transplanted into
patients undergoing cancer chemotherapy so as to replenish their bone marrow.
Cells can also be injected into the heart of patients who have suffered a heart
attack so as to repair scarred tissue. Moreover, patients who have suffered a
spinal cord injury may regain mobility upon injection of cultured nerve cells at
the site of damage. Additionally, this approach provides the means to generate
large supplies of blood for transfusions, thereby diminishing reliance on
donors.

This I-Corps project is based on a technology that can help generate human cells
that are safer for clinical use than the cells currently available. In
particular, many clinical applications currently require cells to be genetically
modified. The core technology of this I-Corps project allows the manipulation of
cells without the need for genetic modifications, thereby opening the full
commercial potential of cellular products. This technology relies on a cell
delivery approach that allows the introduction of molecules inside cells that,
until now, could not enter cells. With this innovative technology, and by using
new cell-reprogramming molecules, the conventional use of DNA-modifying
approaches can be circumvented. Therefore, cells can now be manipulated in a
novel manner to achieve improved therapeutic capabilities while avoiding genetic
modifications and minimizing safety risks.
