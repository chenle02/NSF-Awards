Autism presents major public health concerns. Almost one in every hundred
children born today has an autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Most research has
been directed to causation and treatment of ASDs in childhood, although much
remains. However, little is known about these children as adults: how they
adapt; their social, legal, and medical needs; their challenges and successes.
As they become adults, persons with ASD may face many different concerns,
including employment discrimination, independent living, educational needs,
health insurance, medical treatment and capacity to consent, risks of
exploitation in business dealings, guardianship and conservatorship, and more.
The affective disabilities characteristic of ASD also may affect work
performance, relationships, community living, social and recreational
opportunities, abilities to access governmental services, encounters with law
enforcement, and other legal needs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of
Utah's postdoctoral fellow in Law and Social Science will develop an
understanding of the experiences of adults with ASD and their legal needs.
Unique data resources are available at the University of Utah, including
families involved in long-term genetics research in the Utah Autism Research
Program and the extensive family and other data in the Utah Population Database.
Individuals in these families will also be able to provide valuable insight into
attitudes about the growing number of genetic tests becoming available for ASD.
From these data, the fellow will identify issues facing adults with ASD,
research the experiences and needs of adults with ASDs, and explore unmet legal
needs of these adults and their families. Mentoring the fellow are law faculty
at the S.J. Quinney College of Law, social scientists, physicians, and lawyers
representing persons with disabilities at the Utah Disability Law Center. A
planned outcome of the project is the identification and recommendation of legal
proposals that may be critical across the life cycle of people with ASD.
