This grant supports a week-long summer school on Cognitive Robotics to be held
in Boston, Ma in July 2018. The summer school will be a combination of invited
talks and tutorials, which are designed to introduce researchers to issues in
planning and execution from perspectives of both Robotics and Cognitive
Artificial Intelligence, and daily labs, which are designed to give students
hands-on experience with robotic hardware and state-of-the-art software tools
for developing robotic behaviors. The summer school will help expose graduate
students to cutting-edge ideas at the intersection of Robotics and Cognitive
Systems and will help to form a new community of researchers in this
interdisciplinary area. The hands-on experience with, and open-source release
of, the Enterprise Executive Architecture will facilitate the formation of this
collaborative community. The summer school concludes with a grand challenge
using robot hardware that combines what the students have learned during the
week.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
