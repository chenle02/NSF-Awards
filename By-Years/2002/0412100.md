This award supports the Gordon Research Conference on "Biogenic Hydrocarbons and
the Atmosphere" in Il Ciocco, Barga, Italy on May 2-7, 2004. This Gordon
Research Conference is one of the major meetings in this field, bringing
together plant physiologists, ecophysiologists and tropospheric atmospheric
chemists to discuss plant emissions of hydrocarbons and their influence on the
atmosphere. The meeting will be attended by a diverse community, including both
established researchers and early career scientists, and provide invaluable
opportunities for professional interactions in a focused and productive forum.
Travel support under this award will facilitate attendance by a number of early
career scientists from U.S. institutions.
