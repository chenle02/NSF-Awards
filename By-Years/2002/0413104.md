The proposed planning grant will be used to address the inadequacies of thermal
modeling of MEMS devices at elevated temperatures. Thermal transport properties
at elevated tempeatures and their dependence on mmicrostructural evolution are
unknown for most materials used in MEMS manufacturing. During this one-year
planning period, pilot studies will be performed to address the challenges in
thermal conduction, while research collaborations will be formed to address
microscale radiation transport. The PI hopes to measure the thermal conductivity
of thin films between 100 and 5000 nm for temperatures up to 1000 C. Additional
materials characterization experiments will be conducted on thin films of
polycrystalline Si, diamond, and SiC. The experimental study will form the basis
for a parallel modeling effort. This study should lead to the submission of
several research proposals to federal funding agencies, including the National
Science Foundation, and could eventually help to address the design and
reliabil9ity of thermal MEMS devices, especially at elevated temperatures.

The award has been funded by the Thermal Transport and Thermal Processing
Program of the Chemical and Transport Systems Division.
