In the summers of 2003, 2004 and 2005, the University of Tennessee Mathematics
Department will sponsor a "Research Experiences for Undergraduates" program.
Each summer, ten undergraduate students&lt;br/&gt;will spend 8 weeks in this
program, working on research projects with faculty members. Our approach is
based on "one student with one advisor." Two of the students will work at Oak
Ridge National Laboratory for their projects. There will be two short courses
and a faculty seminar for the students, in addition to the research projects.
The students will give practice talks and as a finale, talks at the end of the
program on their projects. This site is supported by the Department of Defense
in partnership with the NSF REU program.
