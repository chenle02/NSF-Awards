9725445 Metzner Jim Metzner Productions is producing a national radio designed
to reach a diverse audience with compelling, current information about our
environment, the science which underlies it, and the people who explore and
explain it. The short-format series consists of 780 daily, 2-minute programs
designed for commercial and public radio stations and delivers timely
information on a full spectrum of seasonal natural phenomena, drawing supportive
scientific background from biology, earth science, astronomy, and cultural
anthropology. The series will make extensive use of ambient sound and interviews
with scientists and knowledgeable spokespersons to present a "daily almanac" of
events taking place on the day of broadcast. The series will be developed and
produced by Jim with additional production support from the American Museum of
Natural History. The Science content Director will be Michael Templeton and an
advisory committee of eleven scientists and educators will assist in selecting
specific topics for the daily programs and assure the scientific accuracy of
program content.
