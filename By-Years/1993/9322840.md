Barton 9322840 The award is for research involving the use of multivariate
process measurements to identify most likely causes of variations in product
characteristics by linking symmetry patterns in the multivariate data with
symmetry patterns associated with certain kinds of production problems. Process
measurement vectors will be represented using a process oriented basis that
would be developed by process engineers. The representation of multivariate bias
will identify a small set of potential causes. The basis developed during this
research can also be used to assess impact of changes in process control
variables. Such information may be useful in real-time feedforward correction of
production problems in multi-stage production lines. Such a development would
complement current efforts to combine process monitoring and automatic control.
