This project involves mathematical studies of large highly interconnected
circuits. These neural network models may lead to faster and more efficient
computers and may also lead to a better understanding of the workings of the
brain. An energy function is used to determine the stable states of this type of
network. In addition, the complexity and types of functions which are computable
is to be determined. The mathematics involved in this study includes a mix of
combinatorics, probability, statistical mechanics and graph theory.
