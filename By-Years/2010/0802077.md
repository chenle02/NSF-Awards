ECS-0802077,"Dynamic Monitoring and Sensing with Single Molecule
Nanoelectronics"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;The
objective of this research is to study electronic fluctuations arising in single
molecule circuits. The approach is to implement real-time processing algorithms
that can identify and interpret reproducible electronic signals that could lead
towards practical sensor applications. The underlying experimental platform is
comprised of a single-walled carbon nanotube circuit, to which a single molecule
has been covalently attached. The experimental approach is to acquire and
characterize electronic signals arising from these devices as the attached
molecule probes, recognizes, or binds to partners in the surrounding
environment.&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project is its effective
use of recent discoveries to push molecular-scale electronics in a direction of
immediate practicality. The merit includes the principle that signals from
molecular devices, with appropriate processing, can be used to quantitatively
measure and illuminate complex chemical processes.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact
of this project includes the development of exquisitely sensitive devices for
chemical sensing or low cost biosensing, providing new diagnostic and research
capabilities. All of the work will be completed by graduate and undergraduate
students in a training environment designed to expose junior researchers to
problems and techniques relevant to future careers in science.
