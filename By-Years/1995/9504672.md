Dr. Daniel L. Feldheim has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship
in Chemistry. Dr. Feldheim received his doctoral degree from Colorado State
University under the supervision of Professor Michael Elliott. Dr. Feldheim will
continue research at Pennsylvania State University under the sponsorship of
Professor Thomas Mallouk. His postdoctoral research will target tailoring metal-
support interactions for the oxidation of methanol in mobile fuel cell power
plants. The study seeks to understand the effect of the catalyst support on
methanol electrooxidation. The work is important to the development of
alternative energy sources. The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry
Program is viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to broaden
the knowledge and experience of new Ph. D.s and attract them into meaningful
careers in contemporary chemical research and teaching.
