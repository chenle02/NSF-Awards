The RIDGE office will provide the focal point and the necessary coordination as
the RIDGE global change initiative makes the transition from the planning phase
into its research phase. The purpose of the office is to maintain the momentum
of the RIDGE program during the transition between the early planning phase and
active implementation of field, laboratory, and theoretical efforts, and to
coordinate the groundwork required to make themost efficient and valuable use of
RIDGE funding. Primary efforts in the coming two years will involve
implementation of long lead time activities, including instrument development
and data management; initiation of special field programs; coordination of
research activities supported by a variety of agencies; convening the first
RIDGE Summer Institute designed to foster rapid progress in theoretical
development; pursuit of international cooperative research efforts at bilateral
and multilateral level; continued development and refinement of the RIDGE
Science Implementation Plan; publication and distribution of all planning
results; implementation of the capability to respond quickly and effectively to
transient ridge-crest events; analysis of material-properties research required
to support RIDGE field and theoretical efforts; and a periodic newletter.
