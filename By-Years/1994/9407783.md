9407783 Murphy This project involves the collaborative research of a US
cultural anthropologist and student and a Mexican Anthropologist and student,
studying the development of the potable water system for the city of Oaxaca. The
project will examine documents in the city archives to trace the social history
of the water system in this developing city, which is the state capital of the
state of Oaxaca, a relatively poor, backwards state in southern Mexico. The
project will document the historical development of the water system, focusing
on the political and economic aspects of the decisions to construct the first
modern water plant in the 1930s, and trace the demographic processes that have
led to the current situation of water crisis in terms of quality (prior studies
have shown that the "best" water delivered for potable uses by the current
municipal system would be too polluted to be used in swimming pools in developed
countries) and quantity (the annual dry seasons bring shortages and service
interruptions each year). This project is important because understanding the
patterns of development of the basic municipal service of potable water in
depth, in one place, is valuable to understand patterns of grown in municipal
services in the developing world in general. In addition this project involves
international collaboration between US and Mexican scholars which will
strengthen ties between the two countries.
