This award is the starter grant increment of Dr. Ellman's Postdoctoral
Fellowship in Chemistry. The work will develop methods of combinatorial
synthesis of organic compounds which may have physiological activity. The
approach of combinatorial sythesis is important because it can lead to very many
more compounds than the current "one at a time" methods. This becomes
particularly useful when systematically related derivatives are desired. The
work to be done will lead to benzodiazepines from the acylation or alkylation of
amino benzophenones in microtiter plates. Methods will be developed to produce
libraries of more complex products. %%% Currently, synthetic methods are limited
by the fact that they produce one compound at a time. This work will lead to the
simultaneous production of many related compounds. Development of the methods to
be studied can lead to much more efficient and less expensive approaches to
important drugs for human diseases.
