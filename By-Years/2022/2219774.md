Faculty beginning their independent careers often find the process of writing
their first grant proposals to be challenging. Professors Steven Lopez of
Northeastern University and Christina Li of Purdue University are organizing a
workshop that seeks to provide new chemistry faculty insight into the proposal
writing and reviewing process so that they can identify and develop strong
research, education and outreach activities. Participants have the opportunity
to network with each other as well as successful grant recipients and federal
program officers from a variety of agencies. The participants engage in mock
panels, research presentations, and other activities designed to provide them
with a better understanding of how to put together a research plan that is
ambitious, yet realistic and compelling. Broader impact criteria are also
discussed in terms of educational activities, outreach, and technical
applications to societal problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2022 Chemistry Early
Career Investigator Workshop, supported by the Division of Chemistry will be
held on June 6-7, 2022 in Alexandria, Virginia. This workshop will bring
together up to 100 junior faculty from a broad range of institutions and
demographics to discuss steps in strategically crafting research ideas, planning
educational and outreach activities, and assessing and evaluating project
aims.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
