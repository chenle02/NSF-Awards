9405601 El Zarki The goal of this research is to propose/recommend enhanced
service options for high bit rate video applications to improve their
transmission over ATM-based BISDN. To do that the researchers will study the
encoding process in detail to understand better the underlying characteristics
of the service. The focus is on the newly emerging standard MPEG II. MPEG II
encompasses a very complex encoding process that incorporates several different
options. The impact of these options on the transmission of video data over an
ATM network has not yet been studied. The research plan involves studying these
different encoding options in detail and then investigating network access and
control schemes for the transmission of packetized video data. The research will
include 1) the investigation of different coding and error recovery options for
high bit rate video services and 2) the study of the source characteristics and
investigation of network control and access schemes for a variety of video
services for transport over ATM-based networks. ***
