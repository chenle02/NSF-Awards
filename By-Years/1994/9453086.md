Our goal is to develop both a theoretical and practical foundation for teacher
professional development -- with particular relevance to teachers of culturally
and linguistically diverse children -- that combines ongoing teacher inquiry in
science with classroom-based inquiry on learning and teaching. The research will
consist of analysis of a corpus of videotapes of a teacher research group and
the teachers' classrooms collected over the past three years as part of our
prior RTL project on the interplay between scientific and everyday discourses in
Haitian Creole and Spanish bilingual classorooms. Interatively applying methods
of discourse analysis to this courpus, we will develop two studies of teacher
learning, one in evolution and one in experimentation and argumentation, in
order to characterize what and how the teachers are learning about science,
student learning, and classroom practice. in a final monograph, we will set
forth a model of professional development based on our findings.
