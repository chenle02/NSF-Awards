In recent years, numerous studies of superconductivity in two- dimensional
disordered films have been reported. The metals include Sn, Al, Ga, Pb and Bi;
it has been suggested that the destruction of superconductivity in these films,
both with and without a magnetic field, represents universal behavior. We
propose a study of superconductivity in ultrathin, highly- disordered films of
transition metals.
