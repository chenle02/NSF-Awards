Dr. McSwain is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship
to carry out a program of research and education at Yale University in New
Haven, Connecticut. Recent stellar models show that the evolution of massive
stars is dependent not only on their initial mass and heavy metal content, but
also on their rotation. Models also show that rotational mixing causes
significant abundance changes at the stellar surface, especially among He and
the CNO elements, well before the convective zone deepens during the red
supergiant phase. However, the rotating stellar models are not yet fully
constrained, and observational evidence of such abundance changes is limited. In
this study, Dr. McSwain will perform a spectroscopic and photometric study of
the OB populations of 20 open clusters. For each cluster member, its age,
rotational velocity, and He/CNO abundances will be measured. This investigation
will form the backbone of observations of rotational mixing in massive stars,
and the results will provide important constraints that will improve
evolutionary models of massive stars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To promote astronomy
education in the inner-city public schools of New Haven, Dr. McSwain will
develop several 6-week long astronomy laboratory units for grades K-4, 5-8, and
9-12 in coordination with the educational program at the Peabody Museum of
Natural History. Each unit will culminate with an observing session at the Yale
Student Observatory where students will be able to apply their classroom lessons
to first-hand observations of the night sky.&lt;br/&gt;
