This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of
2021 (Public Law 117-2). PI Biji Wong is awarded a National Science Foundation
Mathematical and Physical Sciences Ascending Postdoctoral Research Fellowship
(NSF MPS-Ascend) to conduct a program of research and activities related to
broadening participation by groups underrepresented in STEM. This fellowship to
Dr. Wong supports the research project entitled "MPS-Ascend: Topics in Low-
Dimensional Topology and Heegaard Floer Theory," under the mentorship of a
sponsoring scientist. The host institution for the fellowship is Duke
University, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Adam
Levine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Building on her prior research, the PI plans to use
bordered Floer theory to study sliceness of satellite knots as well as
categorification of invariants of three-orbifolds. Other projects include using
Heegaard Floer homology to understand double covers of the three-sphere branched
over links and generalization of the slice-ribbon conjecture in the setting of
links. To broaden participation, the PI plans to collaboratively set up virtual
Directed Reading Programs at HBCUs, including North Carolina Central University,
help organize a mentoring cluster for minority women mathematicians in the North
Carolina area, and form partnerships with the Math Alliance network as well as
R1 mathematics departments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
