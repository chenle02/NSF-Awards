This award supports participation in the conference "Finite Simple Groups:
Thirty Years of the Atlas and Beyond" taking place November 2-5, 2015, at
Princeton University in Princeton, NJ. The concept of a group in mathematics
grew out of the notion of symmetry. The symmetries of an object in nature or
science are encoded by a group, and this group carries important information
about the structure of the object itself. Group theory has had many important
applications in physics and chemistry, particularly in quantum mechanics and in
the theory of elementary particles. The main theme of the conference will be the
interaction between theory and computation, and applications of group theory to
other areas of mathematics. The list of invited participants features senior and
junior researchers from across these fields and thus will foster further
interaction and collaboration between them, during and after the conference.
Conference activities will include informal working groups organized by experts
in the field to discuss current and future research directions during the
conference; a poster session; a webpage; and a wiki. The proceedings of the
conference will be published.

The classification of finite simple groups, one of the most monumental
accomplishments of the modern mathematics, was announced to be completed in
1983. Since then, it has opened up a new and powerful strategy to approach and
resolve many, previously inaccessible problems in group theory, number theory,
combinatorics, coding theory, algebraic geometry, and other areas of
mathematics. This strategy utilizes information about finite simple groups, some
of which is catalogued in the "Atlas of Finite Groups" and "An Atlas of Brauer
Characters." It is impossible to overestimate the roles of the atlases and the
related computer algebra systems in everyday life of researchers in many areas
of contemporary mathematics. The conference will bring together a diverse group
of researchers in group theory, representation theory, and computational group
theory. The objective of the conference is to discuss numerous applications of
the Atlases and to explore recent developments and future directions of
research.
