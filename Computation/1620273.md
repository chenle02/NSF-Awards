Variational inequalities appear in areas that involve differential equations and
optimization. They are fundamental tools for the modeling of phenomena in
science, engineering and finance that involve inequality constraints. The goal
of this project is to design, analyze and implement reliable and efficient
numerical algorithms for variational inequalities that involve higher order
differential equations, with applications to optimal control and materials
science.

Novel finite element methods for higher order elliptic and parabolic variational
inequalities will be developed together with fast solution techniques (adaptive,
parallel and multilevel) for the resulting discrete problems. The emphasis is
for problems on nonsmooth and nonconvex domains where the regularity of the
solutions of the variational inequalities is much more subtle, and for problems
on three dimensional domains where numerical computations are much more
demanding. An important application is to optimal control problems constrained
by elliptic partial differential equations. By reformulating these optimal
control problems as fourth order variational inequalities for the state
variable, various finite element methodologies(classical conforming and
nonconforming finite element methods, discontinuous Galerkin methods, partition
of unity methods, mixed finite element methods, etc.) and techniques (error
estimators, local mesh refinements, inclusion of singularities in local
approximation spaces, etc.) can be employed in their numerical solutions. The
new numerical methods designed from this approach will be fundamentally
different from the ones obtained by the traditional approach where the emphasis
is on the control variable.
