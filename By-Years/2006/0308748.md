This project adds to an existing major international program designed to
quantify atmospheric emissions and to understand and improve air quality in a
developing mega-city, the Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA). In Spring 2003
an intensive field campaign will be undertaken in the MCMA involving advanced
instrumentation deployed aboard both a mobile laboratory and at a major surface
site. Specifically, the surface site will be enhanced for the intensive by the
addition of research grade visible/near ultraviolet Differential Optical
Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) and LIght Detection And Ranging (LIDAR)
instruments. The currently available mobile laboratory will be enhanced by
integrating new instruments to measure key reactive nitrogen species, including
gas-phase ammonia and nitric acid, upgrading the current Proton Transfer
Reaction Mass Spectrometer (PTR-MS) to allow real-time measurements of selected
aromatic and oxygenated hydrocarbons, and developing and deploying an automated
sampling system allowing real-time trace gas and fine particle measurements of
transient emissions. The investigators will undertake experiments to gain
insight into the quantity and identity of gaseous pollutants driving
photochemical oxidants and secondary fine aerosol particle production as well as
the emission, composition and temporal evolution of the fine aerosol burden. The
resulting data sets will be analyzed and integrated into the larger project data
archive as well as into ongoing North American Strategy for Tropospheric Ozone
(NARSTO) assessment, modeling and policy development activities. Insofar as
Mexico City is perhaps representative of other large urban centers this project
affords some insight as to air quality of mega-cities in developing countries.
The educational and capacity building impacts include extensive and substantive
collaborations between Mexican and U.S. researchers in the field, and Mexican
student exchange with U.S. institutions during the data analysis phase.
