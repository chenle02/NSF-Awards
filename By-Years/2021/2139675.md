The Computing Alliance of Hispanic-Serving Institutions, a national alliance
composed of academic institutions, nonprofits, industry leaders, and government
entities, has a mission to grow and sustain a networked community committed to
recruiting, retaining, and accelerating the progress of Hispanics in computing.
One of CAHSIâ€™s strongest partnerships has been with the Great Minds in STEM
(GMiS) organization that has worked for decades to highlight the breadth of
talent in STEM among minoritized groups. For the last 6 years, CAHSI has
partnered with GMiS to incorporate the CAHSI Summit within the GMiS annual
conference. The CAHSI Summit and GMiS conference is a central component of
student development and support. The funding will support student and faculty
travel to the CAHSI Summit - Great Minds in STEM
Conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The programming at the CAHSI Summit and GMiS
conference includes (i) student professional development in the areas of
cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, and data analytics through workshops,
hackathons, and challenges, which involve industry partners in collaboration
with CAHSI faculty; (ii) Latina leadership sessions involving industry leaders
and faculty; and (iii) networking opportunities with industry partners and
researchers. Students who attend the conference build a network of contacts that
include students from other STEM disciplines who will learn about the offerings
in computing. The funding will also allow CAHSI to increase the number of female
students who attend the summit and conference, which will allow CAHSI to extend
the programming needed to support women of color in tech and attract them to
graduate studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
