This cooperative project between George Rapp, University of Minnesota, and Chen
Tiemei, Peking University, will analyze potsherds from the Early Bronze Age site
of Jingnanshi in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River valley. Using neutron
activation, sherds selected by Chinese archaeologists will be analyzed at the
University of Wisconsin reactor facility. This analysis will provide
quantitative information on interaction spheres of the communities along the
river system from the most critical time of development of civilized society in
east Asia. Archaeological science in China is in its formative stages. This
collaboration will contribute to advancing this science through application of
new techniques not yet widely used in China. Through this cooperation, US
scientists will also gain access to important archaeological sites, and to
future discoveries anticipated in China. Results of this research may shed light
on the complex interactions and trade relations in a period of early Chinese
civilization dating from the mid- to early second millennium BC.
