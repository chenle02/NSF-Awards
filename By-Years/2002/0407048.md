This Nanotechnology in Undergraduate Education (NUE) award to the University of
Colorado at Boulder supports Professors Conrad R. Stoldt (Mechanical
Engineering), Kenneth A. Gall (Mechanical Engineering), and Roop L. Mahajan
(Mechanical Engineering) to enable the College of Engineering and Applied
Science (CEAS) to integrate nanoscale science and engineering into its curricula
at both the freshman and sophomore levels. A collaborative effort with the
Integrated Teaching and Learning Laboratory (ITLL) in the CEAS will be
cultivated to develop and integrate multiple nanotechnology-based learning
modules into the first year General Engineering and Mechanical Engineering (ME)
curriculum. Concurrently, a second-year physical science course will be
developed and introduced in ME to provide undergraduate students with an in-
depth introduction to nanoscale science and engineering.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The success of this first- and second-year educational
plan will be evaluated in part by monitoring individual student enrollment in
existing upper-division ME nanotechnology courses and independent research
projects. Additionally, there will be active collaboration with the Women in
Engineering Program (WIEP) and Multicultural Engineering Program (MEP) in the
CEAS to encourage strong underrepresented student participation in the proposed
nanotechnology education initiative.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal for this
award was received in response to the Nanoscale Science and Engineering
Education announcement, NSF 03-444, category NUE and was jointly funded by the
Division of Civil and Mechanical Systems (CMS) and the Division of Engineering
Education and Centers (EEC) in the Directorate for
Engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
