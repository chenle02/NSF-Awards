This proposal seeks to make two advances in the dynamics of elasto- plastic
structural mechanics: (1) to extend new methods of nonlinear dynamics and chaos
to the fields of inelastic structural mechanics, especially using new
experimental techniques such as Poincare maps and fractal mathematics, as well
as explore spatial- temporal chaos in some applications of solid mechanics. (2)
To develop radically new computational tools for analysis of nonlinear
vibrations by inventing a way to put the computation on a chip using nonlinear
cellular networks, as well as using both existing supercomputers.
