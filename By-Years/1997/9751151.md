This project is developing an integrated course employing realistic techniques
and procedures needed to affect Phase I and II property assessments of
Brownfields. Brownfields are previously used industrial sites that are presently
not being used because of an uncertailty regarding long-term costs. Through
actions taken by the Ohio EPA, a property owner may have the contaminants on a
property assessed, prepare the land for eventual use, and receive a "covenant
not to sue" from the EPA. Once received, the covenant will limit the liability
faced by a property owner. The Phase II property assessment requires the
integration of sampling, sample preparation, and analytical procedures with
quality control, quality assurance, and good laboratory practices. There is data
that suggest that an integrated approach may provide students of environmental
studies, chemistry, civil and environmental engineering, biology, and geology,
with an increased appreciation of what is often presented as independent
functions. The dependence of an analysis protocol on size and type of sample
collected, type of container and preservatives, collection procedure, and the
method of sample preparation is being presented in an integrated format. The new
microwave oven is permitting reproducible and safe preparation of samples
collected at local Brownfield sites and enabling students to experience
analytical method development on instrumentation encountered in a working
laboratory. Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption and Gas Chromatograph-Mass
Spectrometers are necessary instruments to affect a Brownfield site
investigation. They are being networked, through the Internet, to a series of
existing data stations, permitting the analysis and data processing of
Brownfields samples in the laboratory courses.
