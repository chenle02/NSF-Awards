This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of
2021 (Public Law 117-2).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To better prepare a data-savvy
workforce, universities are increasingly incorporating principles of data
science throughout STEM curricula. Emerging teaching practices that encourage
students to take a genuine interest in the subject matter and understand the
material on a level where they can problem solve can be particularly effective
for broadening participation in computing. This partnership between Loyola
University, Arrupe College, and the Chicago youth learning organization,
MAPSCorps aims to design a data science pathway in Chicago for scholars from
underrepresented groups. Through research, training, and mentorship
opportunities, undergraduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and faculty will
address challenging data science research questions while mentoring the next
cohort of scholars. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Incorporating principles of
computational/data science in STEM curriculums has become more prevalent.
Through the programming at the Institute for Racial Justice (IRJ) at Loyola
University Chicago, students will be immersed in hands-on experiences throughout
the calendar year as well as complemented by an intensive undergraduate summer
internship program. As part of IRJâ€™s pedagogical approach of near-peer mentoring
design, the project will recruit undergraduate students to work directly with
high school students overseen by an IRJ (Postdoctoral) Fellow in Chicago. In a
collaborative effort with the data science programming of the Chicago youth
learning organization, MAPSCorps, the project will be centered on experiential
STEM learning through structured guidance. The primary objectives of this BPC
demonstration project are to 1) create an experience for successful STEM
research and learning methods through internships, symposium, and online
coursework, providing training opportunities, and seeding research activities,
and 2) generate a pipeline of students, particularly underrepresented students
from Chicago, who are well prepared for the workforce and will choose to
continue their education and training in STEM related disciplines. As a result
of the programming with MAPSCorps, this programming will also strengthen the
existing informatics and computational science outreach programs in the
Chicagoland are by utilizing a group of well-trained faculty and undergraduate
researchers with broad expertise as research mentors and
instructors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
