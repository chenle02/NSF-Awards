Mosses, liverworts and hornworts (bryophytes) are modern representatives of the
earliest plants that colonized land approximately 500 million years ago; they
remain key components of modern ecosystems. Scientists from two biological
disciplines approach the study of bryophytes in very different ways, with
evolutionary biologists focusing on understanding diversity of all bryophytes
and plant genomicists focusing on a single genetic model species within
bryophytes to better understand gene function. Cross-disciplinary efforts are
challenging yet they lead to a synthetic understanding of the evolution of both
genes and species, greatly advancing our understanding of the origins of
biodiversity. This award supports student participation in a joint conference on
the evolution and genomics of bryophytes, and will engage early career
scientists in activities that lay the groundwork for future cross-disciplinary
collaborations. Additionally, it will engage teachers of grades 4-12 in a
professional development day, and provide them with expertise and tools to
advance the understanding of biology in their students.
