9725449 Apsell The NOVA Large-format Film unit of the WGBH Educational
Foundation, in conjunction with the New England Aquarium, is producing a large
format film about Cocos Island, a small, uninhabited island off the coast of
Costa Rica that has not yet been affected by human activity. The waters around
Cocos Island contain an extraordinary abundance of sharks, rays, tuna, marlins,
swordfish, and other pelagic fishes, thanks to nearby upwellings of cold,
nutrient-rich water that create a rich food source. The film will focus on the
physical oceanography and behavioral marine ecology of Cocos Island,
highlighting the animal behavior and interactions of the wide diversity of
marine life. Executive Producer will be Paula Apsell, head of the WGBH science
unit and Executive Producer of NOVA. Susanne Simpson, executive producer for

format medium as producer/directors of Into the Deep. Joseph Levine, a marine
biologist who has written both science textbooks and television scripts, will be
the writer. William Spitzer, Associate Director for Education at the New England
Aquarium, will be responsible for the educational outreach materials.
