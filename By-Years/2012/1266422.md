In this award, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms
(CSDM-A) Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Martin T. Zanni of the
University of Wisconsin - Madison and his graduate and undergraduate research
students are investigating the chemical structures of molecules at interfaces.
They do this using heterodyne detected, two-dimensional, sum-frequency
generation spectroscopy. Specific molecules to be studied include small
organometallic species and biomolecules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ultimate goal
of the work by Professor Zanni and his group is to develop powerful new methods
to probe the structure and behavior of complex molecules at interfaces.
Interfaces are ubiquitous in nature, including the surfaces of cells. The
development of experimental methods that are only sensitive to chemical species
at the surface has been important in developing a better understanding of the
chemistry in this unique milieu. Along the way, Prof. Zanni will build a strong,
interdisciplinary program in physical chemistry and will train a new generation
of researchers for the technological workforce.
