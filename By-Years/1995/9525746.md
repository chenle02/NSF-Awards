Alexander/Abstract The objective of this research is the structure and
propagation of gravity waves between the (tropical) troposphere And the middle
atmosphere whose horizontal scales are less than100km and whose periods are less
than one hour. A recently developed technique for evaluating vertical fluxes of
momentum will be applied to recent observations taken by a NASA aircraft (ER-2)
in the lower stratosphere. A particular emphasis will be convective sources of
gravity waves.
