Peptides are biological polymers made of amino acids which have several
potential uses, primarily as hormones and drugs. Measurements of rates of solid
phase peptides synthesis reactions for the production of several common
peptides, in particular, Bradykinins, Angiotensisn, and Endorphins, are being
made. The results of these experiments will focus on theimportant variables in
peptides synthesis and allow for improved design and operation of potential
large scale facilities.
