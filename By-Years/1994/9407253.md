9407253 Westneat This project explores the engineering design and evolution of
swimming in fishes. This research asks two general questions: What is the
engineering design of propulsion systems in fishes in terms of the skeleton,
muscles, and tendons? And what patterns of change have occurred in the design of
fishes' bodies throughout evolutionary history? The approach used to address
these questions is a combination of anatomy, video analysis, computer modeling,
and modern techniques of studying evolution. This combined approach will reveal
the mechanics and history of two locomotor systems in fishes: side-to-side
locomotion by the tail and the rowing mode of propulsion with the paired fins.
The fishes to be studied in this project are fishes of the family Labridae,
which are one of the most diverse species radiations in the oceans of the world.
Labrid fishes use multiple locomotor strategies, and they vary in their use of
drag-based and lift-based fin locomotion. A central goal of this research is to
develop and test computer models of the mechanics (transmission of force and
motion) of the swimming behavior of fishes. Computer models will use data on
anatomical design to establish the geometric relations between muscle
contractions and transmission of force to the fins that cause forward thrust.
These prediction are tested by measuring swimming in live fishes using high-
speed video analysis. The significance of this research is that it will design
features of aquatic locomotion for which no complete mechanical understanding
exists. Mechanical testing of fish swimming may provide practical information
for application to bio-engineering. Labrid fishes are indicators of biodiversity
on tropical coral reefs, and further understanding of their behavior and
function will contribute to our knowledge of high diversity ecosystems. this
project will culminate by tracing the evolutionary changes in locomotor
mechanics onto hypotheses of labrid evolutio n. ***
