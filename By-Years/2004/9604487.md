9604487 DonCarlos Testosterone plays a fundamental role in the development of
the vertebrate nervous system. Exposure to this hormone during sensitive periods
influences the morphology, connectivity, and chemistry of the central nervous
system. These early developmental effects of testosterone set the stage for
adult sex differences in physiological and behavioral functions. Brain regions
that are known to be sexually differentiated in the presence of perinatal
testosterone include areas involved in the control of reproductive physiology
and behavior, learning and memory, cognition, play and social behavior, and
aggression. While testosterone is the major hormone of the perinatal testes,
this steroid can be converted enzymatically to estrogen and to other androgens
in the brain. Thus, it became widely believed that most, if not all, of the
effects of testosterone during the sensitive periods of development resulted
from its metabolism. Indeed estrogen and estrogen receptors are known to be
present in the brain during development and to participate in the
differentiation process. More and more evidence is accumulating, however, that
suggests testosterone itself plays an important role. Since androgen receptors
are believed to be an integral component of its action, Dr. DonCarlos will use
in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry to identify when, where, and in
what cell types androgen receptor is being expressed in the developing brain.
She will also determine whether there are sex differences in androgen receptor
expression, and, if so, when such differences are evident. The results from
these studies will contribute to our understanding of the normal developmental
process of sexual differentiation of brain function, and will also provide more
general insights into how intrinsic properties of neural development are
modified by exposure to external signals.
