The aim of the project is to enable the Department of Political Science to offer
a creative and engaging capstone course, Policy Perspectives, to all majors,
which can become a model for political science departments in other universities
interested in developing such an integrative experience. The courses goals are
twofold: to provide students an opportunity to apply the methodological skills
and substantive knowledge which they have acquired in previous coursework in the
discipline and to hone their analytical and critical skills, so that they can
compete more effectively for seats in graduate school and positions in the
private and public sector. A key audience of the course is African-American
students, who presently comprise 20% of the majors.
