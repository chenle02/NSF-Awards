In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, George Ewing of
Indiana University, Bloomington, will study the spectroscopy, dynamics, and
reactivities of diatomic and polyatomic molecules adsorbed on ionic insulator
surfaces. Infrared spectroscopic techniques will be used to explore molecular
structures and motions, energy transfer mechanisms between the adlayer and the
substrate, and bonding within the adlayer and between the adlayer and substrate.
Using pulsed ultraviolet laser excitation, photochemical reactions on the
surface will be initiated and monitored by fluorescence. Systems to be
investigated include hydrogen, sulfur dioxide, and methane on lithium fluoride,
sodium chloride, and potassium bromide. A major objective of this research is to
influence current theoretical models of monolayer photochemistry and energy
transfer, and to observe and understand chemical reactions which are unique to
surface environments. Surfaces can influence chemical reactions in a variety of
ways, including energy transfer to or from the surface, changing the strength of
chemical bonds, and altering the energetics of chemical reactions. Professor
Ewing's work will clarify some of the issues involving energetics and chemical
reactions on relatively inert substrates such as sodium chloride and potassium
bromide. The study of these systems will also contribute to our theoretical
understanding of more complex systems.
