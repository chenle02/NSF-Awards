The research objective of this award is to develop guidelines for clinicians
providing implanted cardiac device follow-up care for a variety of diverse
classes of patients. Over 650,000 people in the United States currently rely on
an implanted cardiac device for defibrillation and/or pacing, and this number is
growing exponentially. Because these devices require such considerable follow-up
care after implementation, many physicians are, or soon will be, unable to cope
with this explosive volume. Remote monitoring technologies can serve to
alleviate the follow-up burden for both patients and providers by reducing the
need for time consuming office visits. However, clinicians are not permitted to
control the devices remotely and do not obtain as much information from a remote
follow-up as they would from an in-office visit. Moreover, remote monitoring can
also contribute to the provider's burden by generating vast amounts of data that
must be reviewed and possibly acted upon in a timely fashion, which can be very
difficult in this workforce constrained environment. The research approach is to
formulate and rigorously analyze novel mathematical decision models. Expected
outcomes include decision rules for clinicians to use in determining the
frequency with which to perform remote and in-office follow-ups for a panel of
patients, which may include patients with devices under manufacturer-issued
advisories and pacer-dependent patients with batteries near their end of
life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results established through this research will
significantly impact society by informing clinical practice, reducing health
care expenditures and improving patient safety. Dissemination will include
multiple journal publications and invited presentations to academic audiences at
universities and international conferences. The educational impacts of this
proposal will be experienced by graduate and undergraduate students as well as
medical researchers through courses taught at various levels, mentoring and
direct involvement in the research.
