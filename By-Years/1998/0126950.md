The technique, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight
(MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry has become a foundational tool in chemical and
biochemical research. Using MALDI-TOF one can quickly and accurately determine
masses of proteins, nucleic acids, and other polymers well in excess of 100,000
and, just as importantly, resolve and analyze complex mixtures of smaller
peptides and oligonucleotides. We are introducing this powerful new technique
into the undergraduate curriculum by implementing MALDI-based experiments in
five laboratory courses and by incorporating MALDI in ongoing student-faculty
research projects. Our goal is to have students gain experience with MALDI-TOF
technique and develop an appreciation for the applicability of the technique to
a wide range of problems. In the instrumental analysis course students are using
the MALDI-TOF technique to identify unknown proteins through peptide mapping,
they synthesize polystyrene in organic chemistry and determine its molecular
mass distribution, they restriction map a multiple cloning site in molecular
biology, they create a profile of cysteine residues for a protein in
biochemistry, and they identify unknown bacteria in microbiology. These new
experiments, adapted from the educational and scientific literature, are
enhancing the laboratory experience of our students by involving them in the
cutting-edge mass spectroscopic tools needed to address many challenging
problems encountered in the chemical and biochemical research laboratories.
