This grant covers experimental Elementary Particle Physics Research by a large
group at the University of Washington in collaboration with other NSF and DOE
supported scientists. The group will continue studying the detailed predictions
of the Standard Model of Quarks and Leptons. They have a broad program studying
the production and decays of the charmed quark, the heaviest lepton, the tau
lepton, and the heaviest boson, the Z0 neutral boson. They also collaborate on
studies of very high energy cosmic rays.
