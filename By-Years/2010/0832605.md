Professors Shaowei Chen and Joseph P. Konopelski of the University of California
Santa Cruz and Haobin Wan of New Mexico State University are supported by the
Collaborative Research in Chemistry Program to unravel the fundamental mechanism
of nanoparticle-mediated electronic communication. Such behavior is typically
observed in multinuclear complexes with a conjugated chemical bridge and
recognized by the intervalence transfer phenomenon. This phenomenon has been
largely unexplored (unseen) in nanoparticles. This study utilizes carbene-
functionalized ruthenium nanoparticles as the model system. The technical
innovations are applicable to the microelectronics industry as it becomes
necessary to reduce feature sizes to the nanometer-size regime.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research activities are closely integrated with
outreach programs for underrepresented, minority, women, and disadvantaged
undergraduate/community college students through university programs such as the
UC Leadership Excellence through Advanced Degree Program, Summer Undergraduate
Research Fellowships and the NIH-Bridges to the Future Programs.
