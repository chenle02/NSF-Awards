North Carolina State University (NCSU) will establish the Learning Analytics in
STEM Education Research (LASER) Institute to build learning analytics capacity
in STEM education research. The institute will provide professional development
for early and mid-career STEM education researchers in learning analytics, a
computational research methodology. The goal of the institute is to increase the
capacity of researchers to understand and improve STEM learning and learning
environments through the use of new sources of data and analytical approaches.
The institute will be anchored by a week-long intensive training program
consisting of hands-on learning labs, presentations from experts in the field,
support for research planning and data analyses, and opportunities for
networking and collaboration. In addition, follow up support will occur
throughout the year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The institute will prepare STEM
education research scholars to: 1) understand the methodologies, applications,
and ethical issues of learning analytics as these relate to understanding and
improving STEM education, 2) gain proficiency in R, a free software environment
applied to computational analysis techniques (e.g., network analysis, text
mining, machine learning, and data dashboards) using real-world STEM education
data, and 3) expand professional networks in support of STEM education research
efforts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research institute is funded by ECR (the
core research program of the Education and Human Resources directorate) and
attends specifically to critical aspects in research capacity
building.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
