This Leadership Activities project provides continued development and
enhancement of 25 to 35 Biology teachers per year in western New York through
participation in two week summer workshops focusing on cell biology, chemistry,
and comparative anatomy and physiology. New developments and techniques in the
field are stressed and teachers develop materials to incorporate this knowledge
into the high school biology curriculum. In addition to the summer workshop.
monthly interactive sessions are held during the academic year with teachers,
college staff, and a scientist with expertise in a certain relevant area. Field
site visits to appropriate scientific centers or industries are also scheduled.
Two secondary teachers also participate each summer in a one to one research
experience with a college staff member. The second major component of this
proposal provides content and process background in natural and physical science
to 30 elementary teachers per year in the same region. Materials are also
developed to assist them in teaching science in their classrooms. Selected
teachers involved in the high school workshops serve as teachers of the courses
for elementary/ junior high school teachers and also serve as their mentors when
both groups return to their school districts. The elementary/junior high
teachers also meet several times during the year and participate in certain
field experiences. This proposal results from a successful honors workshop for
biology teachers developed and administered by the PI, Kisailus. The current
project strengthens and extends the honors workshop, with the elementary/middle
school teacher component. The staff of the project are qualified both in
background and experience. Leader secondary teachers are used during the
workshop and in the schools to support those with less background and expertise
in the middle and elementary schools. The college staff involves members of the
biology, chemistry, physics, education and English departments.
