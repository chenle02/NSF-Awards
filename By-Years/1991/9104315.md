In this project the principal investigator will derive uniform asymptotic
approximations for the solutions of second- order linear ordinary differential
equations that contain a large parameter. The approximations would be uniformly
valid in a domain of the complex plane that contains a coalescing turning point
and a simple pole. In the beginning of the project the principal investigator
will concentrate his efforts on approximating solutions of Mathieu's equation,
including constructing realistic and explicit error bounds. He then hopes to
extend his techniques and results to more general equations with turning points.
Linear, second-order ordinary differential equations are in a real sense the
building blocks for many complex theories in mathematical physics and asymptotic
analysis. The solutions of such equations are useful in their own right as the
solutions of interesting and important physical problems and equally as
paradigms for more complicated phenomena. In this project the principal
investigator will seek to find accurate approximate solutions of such an
equation, known as Mathieu's equation, that arises in a number of applied
contexts. Its solutions are known eponymously as Mathieu functions, and their
properties are representative of asymptotic properties of solutions of more
general equations involving turning-points.
