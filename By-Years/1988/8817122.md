This is a Minority Research Inititation (MRI) Planning Grant proposal. The
purpose of this planning grant proposal is to plan and develop several studies
of interrelated areas which are associated with identity development in
adolescence. Some of these areas include self-esteem, school based achievement,
motivation, and identity-based cognitive structures and information processing.
Various types of data will be collected by the questionnaire method from
students and parents and analyzed by multiple regression. During the planning
period the principal investigator will complete a review of the literature,
identify a pool of participants, and complete the development and pretesting of
research instruments. Planning grant funds will provide support for a well-
trained minority investigator to conduct these activities in preparation of a
competitive proposal for submission to the MRI research initiation component.
