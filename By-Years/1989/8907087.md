The objective of the proposed workshop is to define the critical technology
needed for the delineation of ore reserves and recovery of the identified
commodities in usable form. Initial focus will be upon technology for
development of the particular metals discussed above, but the workshop format
will be flexible enough to permit consideration of other strategic and critical
materials in response to the participant input. Position papers will be
presented by experts to an invited audience of professionals in the fields of
minerals technology and marine engineering. The workshop will be organized so
that the position papers can be evaluated and discussed in detail by the
attendees with all relevant critiques and corrections accurately recorded.
