Professor Berger will carry out a program of computational research on classical
and quantum gravitation. Although Einstein's general theory of relativity is an
experimentally verified description of observed gravitational phenomena, its
classical equations generically develop singularities from regular initial data
and are inconsistent with the principles of quantum mechanics. In the context of
the early Universe, studies of the quantum mechanics of cosmologies and of the
properties of the most general cosmological spacetimes might suggest how to
overcome these intrinsic limitations of general relativity. Quantum cosmology
serves as a theoretical laboratory within which to test both approaches to
quantum gravity and possible quantum gravitational effects in the early
Universe. The application of standard quantum Monte Carlo simulation methods to
quantum cosmology (and ultimately to quantum gravity) allows realistic universes
with many degrees of freedom to be studied. ***
