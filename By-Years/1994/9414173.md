9414173 Walker The objective of this work is to provide computer engineering
students with a current background in algorithms and software for computer-aided
design (CAD) and test of integrated systems. An integrated set of courseware and
lecture notes is used in two senior-level courses on CAD and test. The
courseware consists of small, modular CAD and test programs with facilities for
algorithm visualization. The software is designed so that students can easily
modify it and observe its internal operation, to gain insight into the
algorithms and data structures. Technology transfer to other universities is
achieved through cooperation with sister institutions and teaching workshops. An
electronic users group provides continuous shared learning for instructors and
students. The courseware and lecture notes are implemented for easy deployment
and modification, and are suitable for in-class demonstrations. The outcome is
graduating computer engineers who have the knowledge and skills to understand
the operation, capabilities, and limitations of the latest CAD and test tools,
to have the background to sensibly use such tools and to develop new tools. Such
students can immediately begin productive work in the electronics and design
automation industries, and keep up with their rapid advances. ***
