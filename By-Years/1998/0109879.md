&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;QGene is a popular, free software package for exploration
and analysis of quantitative genetic (QTL, or quantitative trait locus) mapping
data. It is unique among such packages in offering a richly graphical,
interactive user interface and fast exploratory analysis with large datasets
from a dozen mating designs. It sets a standard in a genre where human-interface
design is often neglected. Converting the software to the C++ language while
brining it to the state-of-the-science in statistical analysis algorithms and
porting it to the Windows operating system will make the package more
accessible. In addition, using a modular architecture will give it the power to
share data and functionality with other packages and to communicate with various
genome databases. Overall, the mapping community will have much more complete
QTL software power than now available.&lt;br/&gt;
