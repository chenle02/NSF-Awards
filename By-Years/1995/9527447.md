Abstract: EEC-9527447, University of Michigan, PI-Dr. Elijah Kannatey-Asibu:
This award provides funding to The University of Michigan for support of a
Combined Research Curriculum Development Program entitled, "Flexible Power
System Control." The CRCD program emphasizes the need to incorporate exciting
research advances in important technology areas into the upper level
undergraduate and graduate engineering curricula and stimulates faculty
researchers to place renewed, equal value on quality education and curriculum
development. This three year program under the direction of Dr. Elijah Kannatey
Asibu will create two new courses on the subject of lasers in manufacturing that
will combine the study of basic principles of the laser and newly developed
theory in laser materials processing with experimental laboratory projects. The
project will provide advanced undergraduate and first year graduate students
greater insight into the physical phenomena of beam material interaction. It
will also provide an effective forum for transfer of the new technology to
industry.
