The investigator studies stability of solutions of some reaction-diffusion
equations that lck compactness or Liapunov functionals. Here specific issues
include optimal conditions on the initial value for global existence of a
solution, limiting sets of global solutions, and topologies in which equilibria
or traveling waves are stable. He also studies point-concentration phenomena of
solutions of elliptic equations in unbounded domains. The rates and locations of
concentration are among the main questions. All the equations studied are model
equations from biology, chemistry, or mathematical physics. Better understanding
of these important equations provides insight into the underlying scientific
questions. But a thorough study of the equations is difficult because of a lack
of general tools to deal with nonlinear equations. Hence the problems and
techniques for solving them are of intrinsic mathematical interest also.
