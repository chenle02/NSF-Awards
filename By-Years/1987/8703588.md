This research project is designed to study aging in rural China. The researcher
will focus on the impact of China's new economic system on the lives of the
elderly and their families in two villages which have proposered differently
under modernization programs. This project offers a rare opportunity to test
current gerontological theories by examining aging in a non.Western society in
the first phase of a massive program of economic modernization. It will provide
base line data for future studies in Asia and information on the rural elderly
who are often overlooked in scholarly studies. Population pressures in Asia are
a world.wide concern. Asia will be the next area of the world to have large
populations of elderly. China's political remedies of limiting family size will
have unexpected and far.reaching side effects. This research will investigate
one such effect by helping us gage whether a new underclass of impoverished
elderly is being created. This research will provide information necessary to
determing China's success in addressing the needs of its rapidly expanding
elderly population.
