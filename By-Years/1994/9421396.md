We do not understand well the mechanisms underlying the tactile perception of
surface texture and object shape. The human fingertip is exceptionally good at
such discriminations, particularly when it is actively moved over surfaces. This
project utilizes a novel material called a "shape-memory-alloy" which is a metal
that can rapidly be deformed into patterns by brief electrical heat pulses. The
stimulator built with units of this material is used to deliver highly
quantified spatial and temporal patterns to an array of 30 elements on the
fingertip, to simulate surface roughness and edge detection as though the finger
were sweeping across a surface. Manipulation of frequency, intensity, and
spatial distribution will allow quantitative evaluation of perceptual
discrimination, identification, and similarity ratings by subjects, comparing
simulated surfaces with actual ones. Results will be important to relate to
physiologically-based models of mechanoreceptor function in touch sensation, and
the perception of texture and form. The potential impact extends beyond
mechanosensory neuroscience into the areas of aids for the handicapped, and
tactile feedback for telerobotic and virtual environment applications.
