9309426 Lutchen The goal of this study is to develop a unified approach for
applying linear and nonlinear systems identification techniques to study
physiological systems at low frequencies. Nonlinear procedures, including kernel
and block structure identification techniques, will be used. The investigators
will also develop statistical and sensitivity analyses procedures to determine
the reliability of the approaches. The proposed study is an extension of the
previously supported research that found limitations in use of standard
ventilator waveforms for studying the respiratory system. This research is
important in order to advance the understanding of nonlinear systems that
operate at low frequencies; namely, the respiratory and the cardiovascular
systems. The research could potentially lead to the development of noninvasive
methods to evaluate the mechanics of respiration of ventilator dependent
patients. ***
