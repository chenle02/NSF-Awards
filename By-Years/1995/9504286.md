Kim 9504286 The objective of this proposal is to shape recognition between
objects in a viscous fluid as it is an important attribute of many important
physicochemical and biological processes. Examples range from fluidic self-
assembly of GaAs devices on Silicon substrate, to protein-DNA interactions
during the implementation of the genetic code for assembly of proteins from
amino acids. This project offers the applicant outstanding opportunities to
complement previous laboratory training in protein chemistry, enzymology, and
structure-function analysis, through rigorous computation of physical forces
governing structure-function relationships. The training program will examine
hydrodynamic steering starting from the simpler geometries, then end with the
complex geometries as archived in the Brookhaven Protein Databank.
