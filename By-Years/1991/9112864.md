The Ninth Southwestern Developmental Biology Conference will be held March
21-23, 1991 in College Station, Texas. The meeting is sponsored by the Society
for Developmental Biology, which states in its guidelines: "Regional meetings
are an important activity of the Society...The function of the Regional
Conference is to provide a more informal opportunity than national meetings for
the exchange of information on development. participation by graduate students,
postdoctorals and junior faculty is particularly encouraged..." The meeting will
adhere to this goal. This will be achieved by inviting three prominent speakers
to present different aspects of "Epigenesis". In addition, developmental
biologists from the Southwestern region will be encouraged to present recent and
preliminary findings from their laboratories. Such an arrangement will give the
students in the Southwest an opportunity to give a talk, meet investigators from
a specialized discipline, and to increase their knowledge about the range of
research projects pursued in their own geographic region.
