The presence of regenerating tissue in a larval insect inhibits the endocrine
system from initiating molting or metamorphosis until the regeneration is
complete, but the nature of the inhibitory signal is unknown. A similar effect
of growing peripheral tissues on the endocrine system is thought to be
responsible for the dramatically prolonged larval life which is associated with
continuously growing imaginal discs in lethal imaginal-disc overgrowth mutants
of Drosophila. Dr. Bryant proposes to test the latter idea by investigating the
endocrinology of these mutants. He will complete his measurements of ecdysteroid
titers in mutant larvae and on wild type larvae containing regenerating imaginal
disc, and he will determine whether there are changes in the ratio between C-27
and C-28 ecdysteroids. Using in vitro culture of imaginal discs and ring glands,
he will investigate whether the reduced ecdysteroid titer that he has documented
in the mutants is due to increased utilization or degradation of ecdysteroids by
the imaginal discs or to inhibition of ecdysteroid release by the ring gland.
The preliminary results already show a reduction of ring gland output in tow of
the mutants. Dr. Bryant will investigate whether such effects are ring gland
autonomous or are indirect effects due to the presence of growing imaginal
discs. The effect on the endocrine system will be investigated by measuring the
production of prothoracicotropic hormone by mutant nervous systems. %%% This
study will provide new evidence on an important but little understood link in
the chain of events that control developmental timing in insects.
