The ocean is a large sink of anthropogenic carbon from the atmosphere. Thus,
calculating the movement of carbon into the oceans is important to understand
future atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. Ocean climate models are a
powerful tool to understand the processes that control carbon cycling. However,
large discrepancies exist among data estimates and an ocean circulation inverse
model (OCIM) that models carbon isotopes in the ocean. This project will use
data obtained from proxy archives to perform a model-proxy data comparison as an
independent test of the model-simulated carbon isotopes. The research would
provide the first proxy data â€“ model output comparison of carbon isotope records
from marine carbonates and simulations from OCIMs to better understand carbon
cycling in the coastal regions of the North Atlantic and North Pacific Oceans.
The comparison would address offsets and timing differences due to proxy archive
and model biases related to seasonality, air-sea gas exchange, proxy archive
chronological uncertainty, and broader environmental/climatic processes not
constrained in the model. This project will analyze discrepancies between model
output and proxy data to better constrain the carbon cycling processes critical
to understanding the removal of anthropogenic carbon dioxide from the atmosphere
and into the oceans. Thus, this work will contribute to societally relevant
understanding of the processes that mitigate ongoing climate change. The project
will support a mid-career researcher at a primary undergraduate institution. At
the interface of societally relevant climate science and numerical modeling,
this project will train undergraduate students through research experiences and
will incorporate content into the curriculum of the new science department, thus
providing an investment in workforce capabilities that will extend beyond the
project duration.
