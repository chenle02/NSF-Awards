WordNet is an important lexical resource for research in areas including NLP and
AI. This project initiates the development of a radically enhanced version of
WordNet. Constructing WordNet+ involves a novel combination of empirical
methods: human annotation, corpus analysis, and machine learning. WordNet+
specifically addresses some of WordNet's limited ability to identify word
senses, stemming from the sparsity of Boolean arcs among sets of synonymous
words ("synsets"). First, quantified, oriented arcs are to be added among a core
set of 5,000 synsets. These arcs reflect evocation--the extent to which the
meaning of one synset brings to mind another. Following the selection of the
core synsets, a random subset of 250,000 arcs are to be elicited from
annotators. The annotators, trained and tested for inter- and intra-reliability,
record the strength of their mental associations using a specially designed and
tested interface. The remaining arcs are to be extrapolated from the manually
obtained arcs using machine learning algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All
results will be made available to the research community: the core concepts, the
indirect co-occurrence matrices, and all available ratings. Given WordNet's past
contributions to a number of diverse disciplines, the initial stages of the
construction of this research tool should stimulate great interest and have a
significant impact on related work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
