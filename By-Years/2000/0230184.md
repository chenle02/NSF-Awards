The primary goal of this research is to investigate basin-scale mechanisms that
regulate freshwater content in the Arctic Ocean, and particularly in the
Beaufort Gyre. The research addresses the hypothesis that the Gyre accumulates
fresh water from various sources during periods of anticyclonic (clockwise) wind
forcing the then releases this fresh water when the wind forcing weakens or
reverses to a cyclonic (anticlockwise) direction. It is further hypothesized
that this accumulation and release mechanism is responsible for observed
salinity anomalies in the North Atlantic ocean, and for an observed decadal
variability of the Arctic system. The research will collect new field data and
will synthesize these with historical data and model results to test these
hypotheses. Expected results include identification of links among fresh water
accumulation, atmospheric, hydrologic, cryospheric and oceanographic processes,
quantification of the relevant fresh water fluxes, and assessment of the
controlling factors under global warming conditions. As an integrating
mechanism, freshwater content of the Beaufort Gyre is expected to be a primary
indicator of the Arctic Ocean response to climate change.
