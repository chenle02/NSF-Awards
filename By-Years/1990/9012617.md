This proposal seeks to provide fundamental insight into how, in the phytochrome
photoreceptor (the plant growth and photoresponse control agent) and
bacteriorhodopsin ( a light driven proton pump), protein structure relates to
protein function and reactivity. The overall goal of this research is to study,
using time-resolved infrared spectroscopy from picosecond to kilosecond time
regimes, light-induced conformational changes and kinetic intermediates by
following the dynamics of the protein amide I and II regions, carboxylic groups,
specific amino acid (i.e. tryptophan and tyrosine) and protein
photointermediates. In addition to the dynamic understanding of the interaction
between light and the photosensitive bilitriene phytochrome, the investigatior
will determine a) orientation and strenght of possible hydrogen bonds between
the imine hydrogen and a nearby counter ion; and b) effects of a positive or
negative charge near the C=N frequency shift upon protonation of both the
bilitriene chromophore and the retinal Schiff's base chromophore. This proposal
is also aimed at learning how the reversible photocontrol properties of
phytochrome and bacteriorhodopsin can be used to produce light biosensors or
photodevices.
