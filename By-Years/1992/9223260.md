Professor Reed of the University of Southern California will conduct studies on
synthetic inorganic chemistry with funding from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and
Organometallic program. He will investigate the coordination chemistry of weakly
coordinating anions, such as BC11H12- and its derivatives. These anions should
allow the preparation of highly-reactive cationic species, including the
silicenium cation and transition-metal complexes of very weak donors, such as
xenon and hydrocarbons. He will also develop a "magnetochemical series", by
investigating the nature of spin-admixed intermediate spin state somplexes of
the type Fe(III)Y(porphyrin). A third area of investigation will be in fulleride
chemistry, where he will examine species such as C60n-, C70n-, and BC59-. %%%
Research in synthetic inorganic chemistry presents many opportunities. Professor
Reed of USC will investigate several sub-areas, with a focus of large anions
that have a very low tendency to bind to cations. This property will allow
unusual cations to be synthesized, cations that would normally be strongly bound
to whatever anions were available. Potential applications of such unusual
cations would be in catalysis and the development of new reagents for synthesis
of organic substances. Additional studies will focus on new ways to describe the
bonding between metal cations and other atomic groups.
