Tucker 0107242 The investigator studies the effects of errors imposed by
numerical computations carried out in most applied environments (e.g. commercial
computers). He focuses on rigorous control of errors in the numerical solution
of systems of ordinary differential equations, particularly chaotic dynamical
systems. The goal is to provide accurate estimates of the errors of the actual
calculations, and to introduce an accurate means of dealing with
rounding/truncation errors. Auto-validating methods for the numerical solution
of mathematical problems or of mathematical models of science and engineering
problems, especially chaotic dynamical systems, is becoming increasingly
important. Rigorous error estimates, valuable for any computational model, are
especially important in chaotic systems, which arise in modeling weather, neural
networks, and so on. The investigator
