9318043 Kassam-Adams The proposed project's primary objective is to create a
multi- campus network, to be referred to as MedNet, based on the INTERNET and
connecting clinicians, librarians, educators, students, researchers, and
administrators working at several regional care centers and hospitals in the
central Virginia region. Connecting these patient care providing institutions to
the INTERNET will provide them easier access to the information services
available at the University of Virginia (UVA) Health Sciences Center along with
the many resources available through the INTERNET. This project will also be the
basis for a demonstration proto-type for connecting isolated, rural health care
centers to regional hospitals via an existing network (INTERNET) in order to
facilitate clinical consultations, patient care, and continued education. As a
result, the project will serve as a limited test of a larger, more robust,
regional health information network. The project's goals can be achieved by
connecting the various regional health care centers and hospitals to the
INTERNET and by building an easy-to-use, menu driven, system to coordinate
access to the services offered by the University of Virginia Health Sciences
Center and other institutions linked to the INTERNET. The University of Virginia
Health Sciences Center will purchase and install all the necessary hardware and
software to connect upto five (5) regional care centers and hospitals to the
INTERNET. UVA will also develop an INTERNET accessible MedNet Information Center
that provides electronic mail-boxes, bulletin board services, electronic
conferencing, and an events calendar for use by MedNet participants.
