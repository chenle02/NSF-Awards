9525786 Semazzi and Scroggs Under their last award, the principal investigators
developed a non-hydrostatic, semi-implicit, semi-Lagrangian global atmospheric
model. The two main objectives that will be pursued under this award are: (1) to
incorporate bottom topography in their non-hydrostatic model and test the model
performance in the presence of topography at resolutions at which the
hydrostatic approximation is valid and (2) to study the sensitivity of the model
solutions to resolution and to quantify the non-hydrostatic effects at regional
and global scales using a high resolution version of the model. Because
simulation of non-hydrostatic circulations can be realized only at very high
resolution requiring access to extremely large amounts of computer memory,
carrying out the latter task will require the development of a version of the
model based on parallel processing. As global atmospheric models move to ever
higher resolutions in order to effectively capture the interactions of local
circulations and the synoptic and planetary scale flows, it will be imperative
to be able to adequately represent non-hydrostatic effects. This research
project will contribute significantly towards that goal.
