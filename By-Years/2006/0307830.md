Recent observations have shed new light on the star formation history of the
solar neighborhood. One of the most significant is the recognition of several
associations of very young and nearby stars. These observations suggest there
may be previously unrecognized pre-main sequence stars near Earth, either in a
distributed population or in loose associations that are no longer associated
with molecular gas from which they formed. If they can be found, such stars
would be very useful in constraining both the star formation history in the
solar neighborhood and models of the evolution of protoplanetary disks. The PI
here is continuing a survey for nearby young stars that are not members of known
star forming regions. This research has already yielded discovery of dozens of
previously unknown young stars, some of which are quite near Earth. The aims of
this survey are: (1) to search for young stars in a way that is not biased
toward or against stars with circumstellar disks; and (2) to use the stars
discovered as laboratories to study disk evolution at ages when planet formation
around them should be occurring.

Broader impacts. The PI involves a significant number of undergraduate student
researchers in all aspects of the scientific process, including proposal
writing, observations at the telescope, archival data research, data reduction
and analysis, and presentation of results at meetings and in the literature. The
high quality spectroscopic data obtained during this observational program will
be made available to the astronomical community for other investigations of
these stars' properties. Finally, understanding how planets form (and possibly
discovering new planets) is of great popular interest. The PI draws on this
interest and uses results from this research program to motivate his
undergraduate students at all levels to learn more fundamental science and to
become informed citizens. The PI also presents regular popular-level talks about
this research to spread the results of NSF-supported science to a larger
audience.
