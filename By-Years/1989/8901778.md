This project concerns research on division algebras, Brauer groups, and field
theory. There are two parts to the research. The first is to study local Brauer
groups in dimensions greater than two, and the second is to express a class in
the Brauer group as a product of cyclic algebras in an explicit way. The
research supported is in the general area of field theory. Fields are algebraic
structures similar to the rational numbers, the real numbers, and the complex
numbers in that each nonzero element has an inverse with respect to
multiplication. Field theory is a rich and deep subject with its historical
roots arising from the early attempts to systematically describe the zeros of
polynomials.
