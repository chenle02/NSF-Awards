Under the direction of Dr. Alan Kolata, Professor of Anthropology at the
University of Chicago, Mr. Martin Giesso will collect data for his doctoral
dissertation. He will analyze lithic materials derived from the Bolivian site of
Tiwanaku. In past work he has collected surface artifacts from many areas of
this large site. With National Science Foundation support he will continue this
work and conduct limited excavation at a locale believed to be a lithics
production workshop. He will also analyze the large sample already collected. He
will collect data on variations in areal density, raw materials and types of
stone implements represented. He will also reconstruct the production process to
determine the degree of standardization. This will permit him to examine the
issue of craft specialization and through it the degree of economic
specialization at the site. Mr. Giesso will also conduct a geological survey to
locate raw material sources and then use neutron activation to tie worked
material to point of origin. These latter data also will shed light on economic
organization. Tiwanaku is a large archaeological site located in the Lake
Titicaca Basin of Bolivia. Given its size, monumental architecture and broad
influence it may defined as a "State" and as such is the earliest one known in
South America. It's origins may be traced to ca. 300 B.C. While archaeologists
know that states arose at about this time in many parts of the world, they still
do not understand in the detail the economic and political processes involved.
For example it is not clear whether craft specialization played either a causal
role or was a result of such centralization. Mr. Giesso's research will help to
answer this question. This research is important for several reasons. It will
produce data of interest to many archaeologists. It will increase our
understanding of how complex societies such as our own arose and were maintained
and will assist in the training of a promising young scientist.
