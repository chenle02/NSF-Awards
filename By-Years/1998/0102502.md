CHICOS (California HIgh school Cosmic ray ObServatory) is
a&lt;br/&gt;collaborative project involving Caltech, Cal State Northridge,
and&lt;br/&gt;local high school physics teachers to site an array of
particle&lt;br/&gt;detectors at high schools in the Los Angeles area. The array
will&lt;br/&gt;operate as a coordinated network and will be capable of
detecting&lt;br/&gt;and characterizing a sample of the highest energy
elementary&lt;br/&gt;particles ever observed. The project will offer students
and&lt;br/&gt;teachers in local high schools a unique opportunity to
collaborate&lt;br/&gt;with researchers at Caltech and address fundamental issues
at the&lt;br/&gt;forefront of present-day astrophysics and particle
physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
