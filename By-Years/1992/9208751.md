The importance of atmospheric frontal boundaries to general weather patterns
has been known for some time and has been the subject of many studies.
Typically, frontal structures are several hundreds of kilometers long and tens
of kilometers wide. Imbedded within the larger frontal structures are features
that range from a few to approximately ten kilometers in scale. Understanding of
these substructures is considered important to furthering our knowledge of the
atmospheric factors that determine the exact location, timing and magnitude of
mesoscale meteorological phenomena such as locally heavy precipitation events.
Using numerical models the Principal Investigator will investigate two important
mesoscale aspects of frontal structures. The first is to explain the phenomenon
of the collapse of a frontal surface to a very small scale. This process is not
well understood, but is important to understanding frontal structures and
evolution. A second avenue of research is the effects of topography on fronts.
Again, this is an important area of research for understanding frontal
evolutions. The Principal Investigator will continue his research as to how
fronts are effected by mountains under certain synoptic meteorological
environments.
