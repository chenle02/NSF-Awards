It has been demonstrated that supplemental damping can be an effective means for
reducing forces and displacements of structures during earthquakes in both the
elastic and inelastic ranges of structural response. In prior investigations on
the subject the mechanical characteristics of several supplemental damping
devices have been established and verified by static and dynamic experiments.
The main objective of this project is to establish an engineering basis for
identification of supplemental damping characteristics which could provide cost
effective improvement in earthquake response performance of buildings above that
currently provided by traditional design. This will be accomplished by (1)
comparing building cost and earthquake response using supplemental dampers with
those using current code designs and (2) assessing the significance of damper
distribution throughout the building on performance and consequently on the ease
of designing buildings with added damping. Successful research achievement under
this project will ensure acceptance of supplemental damping as a viable
alternative to traditional designs.
