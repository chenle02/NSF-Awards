9318766 Clauer This project is a joint U.S.-Russian effort to investigate the
structure of electric polar cap currents produced through the interaction of the
solar wind and the Earth's magnetic field. The integrated effect of these
currents can be observed at the surface with relatively simple and robust
magnetometers. The Russian Antarctic Program operates two unattended remote
magnetometers along the traverse route between Mirny and Vostok, as well as
attended instruments at the two stations. The data acquisition mode of these
instruments will be converted from analog to digital, and the existing Russian
data base, going back to 1978 for some instruments, will be digitized. The
digitized data will be analyzed in conjunction with supporting satellite data
and conjugate observations from the northern hemisphere to interpret the three-
dimensional convection patterns produced by various orientations of the Earth's
magnetic field. ***
