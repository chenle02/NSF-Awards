The concept of tomography was first introduced around 1979 by the principal
investigator, K.T. Smith. It was introduced formally in the mathematical
literature in 1985 by F. Keinert and K.T. Smith and independently (with a
different implementation) by E.I. Vainberg and M.L. Faingois. Local tomography
allows the reconstruction of a function closely related to the attenuation
coefficient of an object, within a region, from the attenuation along lines
meeting that region, while standard tomography requires the attenuation along
all lines meeting the full object. This has significant implications in regard
to x-ray dose, resolution, the required dynamic range of the x-ray sensors,
demands on the x-ray tube, scatter, compression distortions, scanner size, the
size of the object to which tomography can be applied, the number of numerical
computations, and the volume of data that must be collected, stored, and
processed. While local tomography has been performed very successfully in a
number of interesting cases, many problems remain in the area of a proper
mathematical understanding of how it should be implemented. The objective of
this project is to acquire that understanding, to write sound and effective
numerical algorithms for local tomography, and to make them available to
practitioners and researchers.
