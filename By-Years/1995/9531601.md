Abstract: A Research Experience for Undergraduates Site at the Geophysical
Institute of the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, will support 8 undergraduate
researchers in solid earth geophysics for each of the next two years. The
program will give undergraduates majoring in the Geosciences and related
disciplines experience in the types of research conducted at the Institute. The
objective is to engage students in the exciting research opportunities in
seismology, volcanology, geochronology, geochemistry, paleomagnetics, geodesy,
tectonics, glaciers and sea ice, and remote sensing, and encourage them to
pursue graduate studies in these or other scientific areas. Recruiting is
focused at small liberal arts colleges where research exposure is less
available. Students get an accurate perspective on graduate student life by
interacting with faculty, and graduate students, attending seminars and thesis
defenses, and working closely with existing research groups. Weekly lectures and
field trips expose the students to fields of research `eyond their own projects.
A survey will be conducted to measure the impact of the REU program on
educational and career choices of former participants.
