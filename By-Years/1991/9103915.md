Oxidation of metal hydride compounds will be used as a method for the systematic
synthesis of coordinated dihydrogen. Both one- and two-electron oxidations are
anticipated, both in non- coordinating solvents and in the presence of potential
ligands. For transient products, chemical oxidation will be complemented with
rapid scan electrochemical studies using microelectrodes. As an alternative
source of dihydrogen formation or facile creation of unsaturation in a
polyhydride compound, the intro- duction into the coordination sphere of a
strong pi-donor ligand (alkoxide) will be explored. Preliminary results with an
iridium compound support the utility of this concept. Finally, a method for
combining hydride and alkoxide ligands in the coordination sphere of an
early/late transition metal heterobimetallic compound will be investigated. %%%
In this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organo- metallic Program of
the Chemistry Division, Dr. Kenneth G. Caulton of Indiana University will
explore ways to create coordinated dihydrogen and determine its chemical
reactivity. These studies should have important implications for how various
catalysts function in hydrogenation reactions, one of the most important
industrial processes currently in use.
