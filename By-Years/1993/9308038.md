Hayes 9308038 This applicant will study the relationship between steroid
hormones and growth and development in tadpoles. Specifically, he will take
advantage of the variation in susceptibility to steroid influences between
different developmental stages and between species at these stages to examine
the role of specific steroid receptors at the cell surface. Comparisons will be
made of the levels and binding affinity of receptors in species exhibiting
steroidal effects and those lacking such effects. This work will be conducted in
the laboratory of Dr. Gary Firestone at the University of California at
Berkeley. ***
