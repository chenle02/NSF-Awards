With support from the Division of Materials Research Materials Research (DMR),
Professors Margaret Gardel (University of Chicago), Nicholas Abbott (Cornell
University), and Chinedum Osuji (University of Pennsylvania), are organizing a
workshop to identify the critical gaps, essential needs, and emerging
opportunities in instrumentation and infrastructure required to keep the United
States at the forefront of Soft Materials, Polymers and Biomaterials research in
the next decade and beyond. The workshop will consist of a mix of talks and
panel discussion by a select group of invited experts and leaders. The workshop
will be open for online participation to engage with the broader research
community and other potential stakeholders. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop
is one of three in a planned series entitled “From Atoms to Matter –
Instrumentation and Infrastructure to Accelerate the Materials Development
Continuum,” sponsored by the NSF Division of Materials Research (DMR) in support
of Materials Genome Initiative (https://www.mgi.gov). The workshop will engage a
modest number of thought-leaders, representing a broad cross-section of the soft
materials, polymers, and biomaterials community from the academic, industrial,
and governmental sectors. Participants will identify current limitations in
instrumentations, new opportunities and frame a roadmap for the future
infrastructure and instruments that will advance the state of knowledge in these
materials systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
