With machine vision proliferating in the U.S. as an affordable tool for
automation and quality assurance, it is becoming increasingly important that
engineering technology colleges produce technicians and technologists capable of
designing and integrating machine vision applications. Unfortunately, the
machine vision application process is not taught at any engineering or
engineering technology program in the country, since most programs that include
machine vision prefer to concentrate on vision theory and processing algorithm
development. This project addresses this critical need through the acquisition
and integration of industrial quality machine vision equipment for an Automated
Manufacturing Systems (AMS) laboratory and through the development od laboratory
exercises aimed at teaching the process of applying machine vision and lighting
technologies for real industrial projects. Acquiring the needed equipment -
including an Application Lighting Investigation System (ALIS) - through this
project corrects this problem and creates a truly unique teaching laboratory
that fulfills industry's need for automation technicians and technologists. The
potential impact of this project is as widespread as is industrial automation.
In the university immediate area, there are at least five companies that are
using or are considering using machine vision, and nationwide there are
certainly hundreds.
