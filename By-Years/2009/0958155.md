Engineering - Other (59)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is supporting a
workshop to begin organizing an undergraduate curriculum around the National
Academy of Engineering's Grand Challenges by creating a Grand Challenges
Scholars Program (GCSP). The goal of the workshop is to develop a critical mass
of no fewer than ten engineering schools with active GCSPs that are educating
undergraduate students by Fall 2010. This is being accomplished by inviting
teams from the seventeen engineering schools that have expressed interest along
with several other schools to increase the diversity of the participants. The
workshop's agenda includes discussion of the objectives for an institutional
GCSP for engineering undergraduates; the merits of and challenges in developing
a GCSP from the perspective of academic and business leaders; fund raising
strategies; an outline for vetting, revising, and submitting a plan to the
national GCSP steering committee; and implementing a program. The workshop
organizer are planning to present sessions on the workshop at the FIE and ASEE
meetings to share their ideas and results with the broader community.
