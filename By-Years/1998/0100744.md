Starting with the work of Katz and Serre and developed by Hida one has seen that
modular forms naturally live in families and that this point of view has vast
arithmetic applications. In particular, these ideas have been applied by Wiles
and Taylor toward a proof Fermat's Last Theorem and by Buzzard and Taylor toward
new cases of Artin's conjecture. They instigated Mazur's theory of deformation
spaces of residual representations which was pivotal in the aforementioned work
of Taylor-Wiles. We have shown with Mazur that there is a natural curve called
the eigencurve of finite slope forms whose properties have already shed light on
some of the previous topics. This curve maps into the above deformation space
but its image is still very mysterious. With William Stein we have shown that
some points in the deformation space associated to modular forms of infinite
slope are in the topological closure of the image of the eigencurve and some are
not. Our research is directed at a better understanding of the image of the
eigencurve.

This is a proposal in the area of mathematics called arithmetic algebraic
geometry; this is where the techniques and questions of number theory merge with
the techniques and questions of algebraic geometry. The main focus of this
research is to better understand a particular special kind of algebraic
geometric curve, called the "eigencurve," which is intimately and directly
connected with a continuously varying collection of deep and important number
theoretic data. Understanding the link between the eigencurve and its
corresponding number theoretic data will advance the field of number theory,
which in turn provides the underpinning for most of modern cryptography and
digital security.
