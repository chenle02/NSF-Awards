This program is based on the use of alkali atoms excited by lasers to specific
high-lying (Rydberg) states, to several classes of problems: 1) The study of the
velocity dependence of Rydberg atom collision processes; 2) the study of
electron-molecule interactions at very low electron energies; 3) the
characterization of properties of Rydberg atoms in specific states with very
large principal quantum numbers (100 < n< 500); and 4) to study the response of
Rydberg atoms to perturbations by the fields existing at a solid surface
(<1Mev). These investigations involve innovative laser and optical techniques to
achieve well defined populations of Rydberg atoms, and it explores innovative
approaches to these several problems which may lead to important physical
understanding not otherwise available.
