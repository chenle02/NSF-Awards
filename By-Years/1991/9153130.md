This project establishes a holographic non-destructive testing laboratory.
Students measure the stress, strain, deformation and vibrational characteristics
of objects using laser technology. The laboratory enrichs the laser electro-
optics program, and students' experience, which better prepares them to continue
their studies at the university level and/or to pursue their technical careers
in the private or government sectors.
