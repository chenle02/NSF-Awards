The Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County is committed to establishing a
multi-user facility for biochemical and molecular systematic research. the
Museum has (1) approved construction of a new laboratory that will provide over
1,730 square feet of space, (2) has agreed to provide salary for a full time
manager for the laboratory, (3) is identifying funds to purchase 30% of the
equipment to be used in the laboratory, and (4) has identified over $1,000,000
of endowment monies for long-term maintenance of the laboratory. This proposal
requests funds to purchase major pieces of equipment to be shared by all major
users of the facility. The requested equipment will be used in a variety of
research projects by staff members of the Museum, by graduate students and
postdoctoral fellows under the direction of Museum staff members, and by other
members of the academic community under direction of a Museum committee.
