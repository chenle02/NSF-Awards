This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP) award from the
Research Facilities Office provides funds to Rocky Mountain Biological
Laboratory, an independent nonprofit field station, for replacement of Barclay
Teaching Laboratory which houses experimentally-oriented, high-altitude field
biological research and research training activities. This building was
constructed in 1967 and has never been previously renovated. Its replacement is
fully justified and cost-effective. The ARFMP grant of $100,000 and $115,137
provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used to modernize these research
and research training facilities which will enhance the laboratory component of
field projects carried out at Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory and remove
some of the seasonal constraints on the conduct of research. This project will
address the need to improve the current research infrastructure by utilizing the
foundation of the original building for the construction of another building of
better design. This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by
providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and for the
training of quality students and faculty. The large number of students from many
institutions who are currently trained in field biology by outstanding
biologists at Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory, in spite of the adverse
conditions that prevail, is exemplary. The proposed improvements will ensure
that continued growth in the already successful faculty research program will
proceed and that additional emphasis will be placed on student research and
research training.
