9731059 Chalmers The objective of this project is to develop an analytical
device in which the degree to which a cell is immunologically labeled is
quantified on a cell-by-cell basis. The fundamental basis of this device is the
ability to quantify the position and velocity of a large number of
immunomagnetically labeled cells in a well characterized magnetic field
gradient. This project is to have both fundamental and applied applications for
the quantification of the degree to which a cell is immunologically labeled.
This is to assist in the optimization of immunomagnetic labels and separation
devices. ***
