Stochastic models are widely used to analyze and optimize healthcare,
communication, large-scale computing, and transportation systems. Existing
theory has tended to focus on easier-to-analyze homogeneous models that assume
that service requirements are identical for all users. Recent technological
trends have made it possible to collect large amounts of data that show that
users' requirements are often heterogeneous. Thus, a theory of nonhomogeneous
stochastic models is needed. The goal of this project is develop a theory of
'transitory stochastic models' that explicitly incorporates users' inhomogeneity
and, concomitantly, considers the optimization and control of these models. If
successful, this project will contribute to the theoretical understanding of
nonhomogeneous stochastic systems, and the application of the theoretical
results can potentially result in significant performance gains in the
operational management of many service systems. Furthermore, ideas from this
project will be incorporated into a new stochastic modeling course for
undergraduates that integrates theory, data modeling and optimization. The PI
will also leverage summer research programs to facilitate research experiences
for minority and female undergraduate students.

The theoretical objective of this research is to develop stochastic process and
analytical approximations for the performance analysis and optimization of
transitory stochastic models. The models considered include systems with many
servers, queueing networks, and systems with heavy-tailed service times and non-
stationary, correlated traffic. The systems are transitory in the sense that we
are interested in predictions over a finite, but operationally significant time
horizon, and the models require a purely transient analysis, which is non-
trivial even in the simpler cases. The research has twin related foci: first,
this effort will identify novel scaling regimes in which "universal" stochastic
process approximations to the traffic and workload processes can be established,
in the form of functional central limit theorems, strong approximations and
conditioned limit theorems. Second, the research will also consider the
identification of optimal controls for the underlying systems using these
stochastic process approximations. The focus here will be on developing
analytical approximations to the expected cost functions and identifying an
accompanying notion of asymptotic optimality of controls.
