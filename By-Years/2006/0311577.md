As users and companies begin to rely heavily on the Internet for day-to-day
operations, issues such as security and privacy become ever more important in
the areas of computer communications and&lt;br/&gt;networking. Secure group
communications (SGC) refers to a setting in which a group of participants can
send and receive messages in a way that outsiders are unable to glean any
information even when they are&lt;br/&gt;able to intercept the messages.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Group key management (GKM) is the most important issue in
SGC. This project will focus on SGC GKM in wired networks as well as in wireless
environments. In particular, new, scalable, fault-tolerant, block-free, and
burst-efficient GKM protocols will be designed and tested. Theoretical analysis
of complexities (time, space, and communication) and experimental simulations
for GKM protocols will be performed. Prototype SGC systems and SGC Application
Programming Interfaces (APIs) which can be used by industry and SGC application
developers will be implemented. The multi-disciplinary research conducted in
this project will have a broad impact on graduate and undergraduate education in
the areas of information security, cryptography, computational complexity
theory, computer networking and&lt;br/&gt;telecommunications. The research
results from this project will be integrated into regular Computer Science and
Engineering (CSE) and Information Technology (IT) curricula and findings and
software&lt;br/&gt;resulting from this project will be
disseminated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
