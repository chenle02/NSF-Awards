Models of production and inventory systems are frequently employed in the design
and performance studies of manufacturing systems. Despite their potential
applicability, their use is not widespread. This is mainly due to the absence of
comprehensive tools for analyzing manufacturing systems. The proposed research
aims at rectifying this situation by carrying out the following three tasks: 1)
Devise exact and approximate procedures for analyzing networks of
production/inventory systems with finite work-in-process inventories. 2) Develop
exact algorithms to study single-stage, multi-item production/inventory systems
with (R,r) inventory control policies and switch-over rules. 3) Incorporate the
algorithms developed in Part 2 into the approximation algorithms of Part 1 to be
able to study multi-stage, multi-item projection/ inventory systems.
