This program is in the Mechanical Engineering Department at Tuskegee University.
Twelve minority engineering students at the end of their junior year are
recruited to have the research experience. The duration of the research activity
for each student is expected to be one academic year (one summer and two
semesters). Each undergraduate is paired with a graduate student in an on-going
funded research program under the leadership of six faculty mentors. The funded
research areas are in composite materials, fatigue, fracture mechanics,
robotics, electric propulsion and hypersonic flow. Students participating in
this program are required to register for a three-credit hour Research course
which is used as a technical elective. A technical report and an oral
presentation of the research work are required. Biweekly meetings during the
regular semesters and weekly meetings during the summer provide the forum for
progress reports and exchange of information.
