Oxygen is necessary for life on earth because it drives crucial aerobic life
processes. Ostensibly, oxygen also imposes universal toxicity as its reactions
in living cells generate hydrogen peroxide and highly reactive free radicals of
oxygen. These toxic by-products of oxygen metabolism are responsible for many
deleterious processes such as peroxidation of essential lipids, alterations in
genes, impaired protein synthesis and enzyme inactivation, aging and decrease in
energy productions. Mammalian toxicologists have shown that several antioxidant
enzymes are crucial for cell viability and organismal health, because they
efficiently remove toxic oxygen products. Herbivorous insects constitute about
half of the three- quarters of a million described species, and they are subject
to both endogenous and exogenous sources of oxygen toxicity. The sources for
exogenous oxygen toxicity are the pro-oxidant plant- defensive compounds called
allelochemicals. A unique pattern of antioxidant enzymes has been discovered in
recent years in insects. The proposed studies are designed to elucidate the role
of these enzymes in protecting insects against oxygen toxicity derived from pro-
oxidant allelochemicals. The long-term goal of this research is to gain the
necessary basic information on the interaction of insects with plants, such that
environmentally compatible insect pest control techniques can be developed.
