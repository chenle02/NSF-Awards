CTS-9308569 Carnegie Mellon University Robert D. Tilton ABSTRACT The objective
of this research is to determine the mechanism of adsorption of block copolymers
to the surface of self-assembled lipids at the vapor-water interface. Scanning
angle reflectometry will be used to measure time-resolved layer thicknesses and
refractive indexes as the block copolymers adsorb. Additional experiments in a
Langmuir trough focus on determining the effect of the copolymer on -A
isotherms. Kinetic and equilibrium results from these and other measurements
will be used to help understand the interaction between the block copolymer
molecules and the lipid aggregate. The presence of block copolymer amphiphiles
can improve many existing and emerging technologies which support a variety of
consumer products. They help to inhibit lysis of red blood cells, to reduce
rupture of eucaryotic cells in cultures, and to stabilize emulsions.
