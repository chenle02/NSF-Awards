9632547 Thurber This project involves short-term earthquake prediction on the
San Andreas Fault (SAF) in California. In central California there is a section
of the fault which creeps, i.e. the fault moves aseismically. In this region,
there appears to be a strong apparent temporal relationship between creep events
and earthquakes. For example, since April 1995, there have been six earthquakes
of magnitude between 3.4 and 5.0 which were preceded by creep events. This
situation presents a unique opportunity to carry out an earthquake prediction
experiment along the creeping section of the SAF. The principal investigator has
demonstrated the potential for success in using creep data to predict the
occurrence of an earthquake. This award will enable him to continue the effort
to predict additional moderate earthquakes in this area and to service several
string motion seismic instruments at regular intervals for several more months,
including initial data processing and quality control. ***
