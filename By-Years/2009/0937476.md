The International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA) is a premier forum
for presenting, discussing and debating new and innovative architectural ideas
and techniques for advanced computing and communication systems. This symposium
brings together researchers in fields related to processor architecture,
compilers, chips and systems, for technical exchange on current areas of
architectural challenge. This proposal aims to support this highly regarded
conference by obtaining travel support for students in order to defray the costs
of attending and participating in the ISCA conference in June, 2009 in Austin,
TX.

The PIs propose to provide travel support in the approximate amount of $15,000
for around 40 U.S.-based student (at least $300 each). The vast majority of the
awards will be granted to Ph.D. students. Priority will be granted to students
who have authored papers accepted for presentation at the conference or its
joint workshops, in particular those students without existing travel support.
