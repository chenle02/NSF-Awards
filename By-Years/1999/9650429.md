The primary objective of this proposal is to incorporate modern cell imaging
techniques into an advanced cell biology course. Students enrolled in this
course are preparing for professional careers, with immediate preparation for
graduate school. The imaging capabilities of this proposal will allow those
students to complete projects using appropriate visual presentations and with
complete digital analysis of the images collected. A secondary objective is to
accumulate educational images that can be added to the world wide web site for
cell biology located at Gustavus Adolphus College. This collection will
significantly add to the images available for undergraduate education throughout
the United States and abroad.
