There are many variables that affect the physical and mechanical properties of
crystalline polymers through the processing and fabrication stages of
manufacture. Four of the most important are temperature, pressure, molecular
weight, and chain microstructure. In this project, the synergistic effects of
all four are being investigated for a series of polymers. Several recent
important developments in crystallization theory will be investigated for
homopolymers and copolymers based principally on polyethylene, polypropylene,
and cis-polyisoprene. The research will enable quantitative analysis to be made
of crystallization theories. It will help unravel the complicated synergisms of
the variables referred to above.
