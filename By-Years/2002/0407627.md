This award provides supplemental support to an AFOSR research project to support
the research into an interactive, collaborative design and manufacture
computational framework for multifunctional materials design and product
realization. With this supplemental funding, graduate student support will be
provided to investigate the fundamental question regarding how information about
materials, that includes simulation, properties, and uncertainty aspects, can be
represented in a computer interpretable manner to support design in the context
of the large collaborative DFM Framework. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is expected
that the software tools that result from this project will be set up as a web-
based education and dissemination module. This development of a materials
framework for designing novel products that are customized, robust,
multifunctional, and manufacturable, should contribute to improve cycle times
for the development and insertion of a broad range of new materials and
products. This will have broad impact on a range of innovative products that
include many classes of materials such as cellular foams and nickel-based
superalloys.&lt;br/&gt;
