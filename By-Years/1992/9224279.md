This award is made as the starter grant increment of Dr. Omar Yaghi's
Postdoctoral Fellowship in Chemistry Award in support of his research at Arizona
State University. The theme of the research is the development of synthetic
strategies for the rational synthesis of solid state metal oxides and sulfides.
Part of the work entails aggregating clusters using heteroatoms or organic
molecules capable of binding selectively to the face or edge of a cluster. The
remainder of the work involves hydrothermal synthesis of microporous sulfides
using molecular metal sulfides known to be stable to hydrolysis. %%% The
development of new methods for the preparation of solid state materials can lead
to the discovery of compounds which may have novel electrical and mechanical
properties. These substances may have commercial significance in the chemical
industry.
