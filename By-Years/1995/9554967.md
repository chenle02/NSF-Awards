This project is based on the premise that for many learners, statistical
concepts can be conveyed visually and that computers can be used in new ways to
motivate, interest and engage students. Learning modules will be developed that
use high quality color computer graphics to help learners visualize statistical
concepts at the level of a second semester introductory statistics class. Each
learning module will consist of computer software, student learning exercises,
and instructor notes. The software will be used by instructors to support them
in teaching concepts and by students to reinforce classroom instruction by
active self-discovery learning. The software modules will enhance deductive
learning and promote inductive learning through experimentation using scenarios,
animation, and real data. Modules will use easily created data with known
characteristics or real, relevant databases. Written exercises will involve
students in active learning by posing questions that students must investigate
using the software modules. Students who use the proposed learning modules
should: have more confidence in using statistical techniques and computers; have
strengthened belief in the importance of statistics; perform better on defined
learning tasks; and be more adept at critical thinking and original problem-
solving.
