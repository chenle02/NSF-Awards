Funds are provided for participant support for the 4th annual Snowbird Workshop
on Particle Astrophysics, Astronomy, and Cosmology (SnowPAC 2012), organized by
the Department of Physics and Astronomy of The University of Utah. The award
will support participation (via lodging cost subsidy) by 20 individuals who
would otherwise be unable to attend the meeting, with a particular emphasis on
broadening participation by junior researchers and groups traditionally
underrepresented in astronomy and astrophysics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SnowPAC
workshop is an international meeting that reviews recent developments in
particle astrophysics, dark matter, dark energy, astronomy, and cosmology. It
seeks to establish new connections between these disciplines and establish new
collaborative ties between individuals working in these research
areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main SnowPAC 2012 meeting will be a topical
conference on "gravitational lensing in the age of survey science". This year's
meeting will also incorporate a smaller workshop on dark-matter observations
through gamma rays (titled "SnowDOG").
