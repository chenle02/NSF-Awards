The Center for Multisensory Learning of the Lawrence Hall of Science, with this
Full Option Science System (FOSS), will provide, for grades 3- 6, a collection
of multisensory, laboratory-based science activities. Some of these will be
products of new development, and some will be from the 1986 FOSS Pilot project,
which received National Science Foundation funding. The FOSS Project will
produce five products that will be developed with the cooperation of Ohaus Scale
Corporation, who will bring the FOSS Program to the market after the third
project year. The products will include sixteen modules of laboratory
activities; a Materials Assembly Procedures document (to help teachers gather
equipment for the activities); a set of correlation tables to assist with the
integration of FOSS activities into frameworks, with textbooks, and with other
hands-on resources; student laboratory equipment; and student worksheets and
instruction sheets. Lawrence F. Lowery, the Principal Investigator, will have
the support of his Lawrence Hall of Science staff, and will work closely with
local school districts (including Mount Diablo and Vallejo Unified School
Districts), and with the nationally-established Ohaus Scale Corporation. Ohaus
Scale Corporation and other participants in the project will provide matching
support in the amount of $2,396,395. This proposal was submitted in response to
the Program Solicitation, "Programs for Elementary School Science Instruction
II," which encourages "troika" partnerships among publishers, school systems,
and scientists/science educators.
