If a linear theory of gravitation were correct, then colliding plane
gravitational waves in a vacuum would pass through one another without any
alterations in their shapes or intensities. However, according to the nonlinear
theory of gravitation due to Einstein, two colliding plane gravitational waves
in a vacuum interact and thereby produce a scattered wave which is not a plane
wave and which differs markedly from the original plane waves. The principal
objective of this research is to find systematic methods of determining the
scattered wave when the two colliding plane waves are given, i.e., methods of
solving the initial value problem for colliding plane gravitational waves. A
related objective is to seek the answers to certain important questions
concerning such collisions. One of these questions is whether the study of
colliding plane gravitational waves can tell us anything significant about real
colliding gravitational waves (which are not planar). The research, which begins
with a reformulation of the initial value problem into a certain new kind of
Riemann-Hilbert problem, involves the analysis of this Riemann-Hilbert problem,
the study of the existence and properties of its solutions, and the discovery of
practical methods of solving the problem.
