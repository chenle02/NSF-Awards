This project is supported under the Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER,
Brochure NSF-89-85) Program. Due to their high tensile strength, durability, and
superior fatigue behavior, composite materials have been increasingly applied in
civil engineering constructions. One of such applications involves the use of
fiber-glass reinforcement, sheets, or wires for seismic repair or strengthening
of existing structures. Some success of such techniques has been demonstrated in
several case applications around the world. The use of glass-fiber reinforced
techniques have been successfully tested in strengthening of reinforced concrete
structural members such as beams and bridge-column piers. However, the
feasibility of such similar applications to unreinforced masonry (URM) buildings
--one of the nation's most vulnerable existing building stocks to seismic hazard
--has not been seriously explored. This project ventures into such a new
research area where there is a potential to develop a technically-sound and
cost-effective engineering measure to strengthen existing URM buildings in the
nation's seismic regions. The objective of this exploratory research project is
to demonstrate the feasibility of seismic strengthening of URM structures by
epoxy-bonding composite fibers to the exterior surfaces of the structure. The
focus of the study are: (a) to determine the bond behavior of composite fabrics
to masonry, and (b) to study the effectiveness of glass fibers as low- cost
reinforcement materials.
