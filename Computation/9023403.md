The main focus of this research will be the numerical generation of orthogonal
polynomials, specifically the computation of their coefficients. Two new classes
of orthogonal polynomials are to be investigated from this constructive point of
view. One involves a novel weight function that contains the square of an
orthogonal polynomial as a factor. The other relates to an inner product
containing derivatives. Orthogonal polynomials are a useful tool in applied
analysis: they serve as basic elements for approximating functions and they are
used to develop quadrature schemes for difficult integrals. In this project the
principal investigator will study special orthogonal polynomials of interest in
quantum chemistry.//
