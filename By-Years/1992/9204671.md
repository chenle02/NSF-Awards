Part 1 of this research is a field-analytical and experimental study of the
behavior of tungsten, molybdenum, and other selected ore and trace elements in
titanite-melt systems. Experiments on the partitioning of ore metals between
titanite and melt as a function of oxygen will allow the PIs to: 1) test
hypotheses concerning ore metal behavior that results from SRXF analyses of
natural titanites and other studies; 2) model the effect of varying igneous
titanite/ilmenite ratios on the efficiency of Mo and W partitioning from melts
into ore- forming fluids. Part 2 is on the partitioning of elements between
silicate melts and aqueous fluids. Part 3 is a study of the halogen chemistry
fO2 and depth of formation of the igneous rocks of the Lachlan Fold Belt (LFB)
as the start of a larger study of their theoretical ore-potential. This study
represents a start in the evaluation of the ore-potential, from first
principles, in one of the best-studied belts of granitic rocks in the world.
