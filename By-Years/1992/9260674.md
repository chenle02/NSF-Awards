This SBIR Phase I research addresses the feasibility of a web optical scanner
for manufacturing process control. The concept uses on-line diffuse reflectance
and transmittance measurements. A fiber optic coupler, which is an essential
modular component of such an on-line reflectance/transmittance, system will be
designed and fabricated in Phase I. This will be the basis for coupling
ultraviolet, visible, and near infrared illumination to a sheet and from a high
density, 200-per-meter, linear pixel array, to a single photodetector. The fiber
optic coupler will be integrated with a shutter mechanism to provide serial
readout in a line across the web. The cross web scan of commercial devices will
be 100 milliseconds for an entire sheet width. A reflectance scanner assembly
can be compact, noncontacting, and adaptable to a range of illumination and
detection angles. High resolution (1 millimeter) machine and cross directional
profiles will be possible on constituent concentrations and variations over a
range of machine-direction surface lengths from 10 meters to 1 millimeter.
Reflectance/transmittance spectroscopy permits measurement of average coatweight
and high spatial resolution variance of coatweight, as well as similar
determination such as color, moisture, binder concentration, gloss, and
fluorescence factors. This scanner technology is thought to hold advantages in
coatweight measurements over the widely applied technology of traversing, beta-
ray measurements, with its use of radioisotopes.
