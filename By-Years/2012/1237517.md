The Florida Coastal Everglades (FCE) Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) site
seeks to understand how global climate change and shifting approaches to water
management impact the Florida Everglades and the 6 million residents in the
region. By conducting extended-duration research in freshwater wetlands,
mangrove swamps and shallow seagrass communities of Florida Bay, the FCE LTER
employs long-term datasets to determine how the amount and quality of fresh
water flowing through the Everglades influences ecological processes in the
coastal zone. These key processes include rehydration of the freshwater aquifer,
which supplies the Everglades and Floridians with potable water, and carbon
accretion, which buffers coastal systems from sea level rise and storm damage.
Coupled socio-economic studies reveal how decisions about Everglades restoration
influence - and are influenced by - the human history of dependence on local
natural resources. The project will also address the sustainability of these
resources in the face of sea level rise. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The FCE LTER is
dedicated to partnerships with federal, state and local government agencies,
creating a critical hub for Everglades restoration science and a global example
for the successful conveyance of science into restoration policy. The program is
similarly dedicated to educating all levels of the public via a web portal,
videos, presentations and publications; by training graduate students to be
professional scientists; and through K-12 education programs in the south
Florida majority-minority community. The FCE LTER collaborates internationally
to understand the Everglades in the context of other large wetlands, and to
examine the dynamics and properties of emergent socio-ecological systems under
complex conditions of change.
