This award is a planning grant for the Spectrum Innovation Initiative: National
Center for Wireless Spectrum Research (SII-Center). The focus of a spectrum
research SII-Center goes beyond 5G, IoT, and other existing or forthcoming
systems and technologies to chart out a trajectory to ensure United States
leadership in future wireless technologies, systems, and applications in science
and engineering through the efficient use and sharing of the radio spectrum.
This project, led by Dr. Kumar at Texas A&amp;M Engineering Experiment Station,
includes a diverse set of research topics and collaborative opportunities and a
clearly articulated set of milestones for planning activities leading to the
establishment of a national center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project includes
six key study topics as part of planning activities for the eventual
establishment of a National Center for Wireless Spectrum Research: (i) platform,
(ii) policies and technologies for dynamic spectrum access, (iii) coexistence of
passive and active spectrum users, (iv) enhancing broadband wireless access for
humans and machines, (v) cross-stack hardware and software reconfigurability,
and (vi) data-driven radio circuits and services. By bringing together diverse
communities related to spectrum usage, the PIs plan to identify the key
challenges, and outline a road map for technology innovations along with policy
prescriptions, that would lead to transformative ideas for spectrum
usage/sharing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
