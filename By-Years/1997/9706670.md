9706670 This grant is to support a conference on Probability Theory, Ergodic
Theory, and Analysis, to be held at Northwestern University in October, 1997. It
will be an extension of the Midwest Probability Colloquium that has been held
annually at Northwestern during the past 18 years. The conference will focus on
topics from probability theory and ergodic theory that relate to almost
everywhere convergence. This is an area that has been very active in the last
several years, with a large increase generated by Bourgain's solution of the
convergence of ergodic averages along the sequence of squares. Many important
physical phenomena, as varied as the behavior of the stock market, lines in the
supermarket, and data being received from a distant transmission source, exhibit
locally erratic behavior which can be understood better by looking at the long
term average behavior instead. The study of such stochastic processes and their
connections with one another, as well as their connections in terms of their
fine structure with other less random processes, is a central one in modern
mathematics. It is only through such studies that we will be able to understand
better and thus be able to control or predict the evolution of the physical
phenomena which this mathematics can model.
