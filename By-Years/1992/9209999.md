This proposal is to study the process of fusion between cells and Herpes
simplex virus (HSV). This is a pH-independent mechanism and is different from
pH-dependent endocytosis. The cells to be used are human embryonic lung (HEL)
cells, which are highly susceptible to HSV infection, and X cells Ä±mammalian,
non-human primary epithelial cells!, which produce low yields of infectious HSV.
It is postulated that two types of attachment by the virus to the cell may be
necessary for successful fusion. Heparan sulfate has been shown to be important
in attachment and infection of HSV; its presence in X cells will be determined.
HEL cells may contain another molecule necessary for fusion which is lacking in
X cells; fusions will be made at various cell ratios to see whether levels of
infectivity are altered. Additionally, genomic DNA from HEL cells will be
transfected into X cells along with a selectible marker, to see if the X cells
then become susceptible to HSV. Antibodies which inhibit infection of human
cells by HSV will also be prepared. %%% Herpes simplex virus is a human
pathogen; other members of the same family are major animal pathogens. Not all
cell types are equally susceptible to HSV infection. This proposal is to study
the mechanism by which HSV and cells undergo fusion and allow the virus to enter
and infect the cells. Two types of attachment sites may be needed for the virus
to infect successfully. One component (heparan sulfate) is known to be important
in cell-virus attachment; its presence on a cell type which is not very
sensitive to the virus will be determined. If a second type of molecule is
present on susceptible cells and not on resistant cells, it should be possible
to fuse these cells in different ratios by known techniques, then see what level
of HSV infection results. DNA from susceptible cells will be inserted into
resistant cells, to see whether they become susceptible to infection. Antibodies
which block HSV entry into cells will also be prepared. The information will add
to knowledge of the general properties which allow membranes to fuse in many
cellular processes.
