*** 9709909 Because of the world-wide nature of modern science and engineering,
it has become essential for U.S. scientists and engineers, as well as their
professional organizations, to remain in close touch with the activities and
plans of their foreign counterparts, in part as a means to facilitate the
development of collaborative programs. Additionally, gaining a better
understanding of many important problems, such as those associated with the
global environment, data quality and access, and the training and utilization of
research personnel, require cooperative efforts on a multilateral basis. An
increasing number of such problems either cut across, or transcend, individual
scientific disciplines. The oldest and most extensive mechanism for facilitating
world-wide communication between U.S. scientists and engineers and their foreign
counterparts is the array of non-governmental international disciplinary unions
and cross-disciplinary committees that together comprise the International
Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU), a multilateral organization comprised of
non-governmental adhering organizations in over 90 countries. This award will
permit the National Academy of Sciences to continue to manage U.S. participation
in the ICSU complex. It provides dues payments to ICSU and 20 international
disciplinary unions, and funds to support the activities of the 21 committees of
U.S. scientists and engineers who represent U.S. interests in ICSU and its
disciplinary unions.
