The establishment of natural parks in eastern Africa provided protected
habitats for endangered wildlife but displaced thousands of persons. Despite
criminal penalties, many residents of areas near the parks now regularly move
into parklands to gather firewood, graze livestock, and hunt game. This doctoral
dissertation project will explore the historical and geographical evolution of
conflicts between local residents and conservationists around Arusha National
Park in Tanzania. Documentary and archival research, aerial photographic
interpretation, land-use surveys, and formal interviews will be used to trace
the historic roots of current conflicts, to identify how regional patterns of
land use affect the use of park resources, to determine how different economic
situations among nearby villages affects the use of park resources, and to
assess the degree to which illegal incursions into the park are forms of
political protest. This project will provide valuable information about the
specific nature of land-use conflicts in the study region, and it will also
present more general insights into the ways in which conservation policies
affect local populations. This project also will provide an excellent
opportunity for a promising young scholar to continue to develop independent
research skills.
