With this award, the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the Chemistry
Division is funding Professor Isiah Warner and colleagues at Louisiana State
University to develop novel composite materials derived from a Group of Uniform
Materials Based on Organic Salts (GUMBOS) in combination with select polymers
for detection and molecular weight determination of volatile organic compounds
(VOCs) using a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM). These GUMBOS-based composites
are designed to provide selectivity for a general class of compounds or for a
small group of closely related compounds. These composite materials have
distinct advantages for rapid and sensitive sensing of compounds such as
benzene, methanol, and other compounds important to environmental measurements.
The broader impacts of this work are addressed scientifically in that the
further development of the QCM will advance its use in many other fields where
both molecular weight and chemical property information is desired. In addition,
the research team is known for its recruitment, retention, and mentoring of STEM
students and professionals that represent diverse populations, many of whom come
from groups that are underrepresented in STEM fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
research is based on the discovery that by use of certain viscoelastic materials
as sensors, the ratio of two parameters (delta-f/delta-R) simultaneously
acquired during QCM Measurements can provide molecular weight estimates of
absorbed molecules. The research is divided into three distinct areas: 1)
examination of the detailed characteristics of the composite materials such that
this information will be used to design and develop pure ionic liquids, GUMBOS,
and composites for selective determination of certain classes or structures of
analytes; 2) detailed studies of sensor arrays which will allow comprehensive
characterization of mixtures of volatile organic compounds (VOCs); and 3)
development of the QCM for detection and analyses of VOCs separated by use of
gas chromatographs and a novel portable QCM.
