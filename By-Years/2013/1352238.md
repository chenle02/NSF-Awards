Moving Target defense (MTD) is a new Cybersecurity paradigm for deterring and
disturbing attacks proactively in order to counter the ?asymmetry? phenomena in
cyber warfare. A number of moving target techniques have been recently proposed
to inverse this asymmetry by randomizing systems? attributes (e.g.,
configuration) and exhibiting non-determinism to attackers. However, due to
potential inter-dependency between various MTD mechanisms, an ad hoc combination
of MTD techniques can cause profoundly detrimental effect on security,
performance and the operational integrity of the system. This project is
investigating novel and transformative approaches to formulate a prescriptive
framework to instantiate new MTD strategies that are correct-by-construction,
from an arbitrary list of MTD mechanisms. The proposed framework enables
integrating MTD mechanisms vertically, or horizontally, while balancing the
benefit and cost of the synthesized integrated MTD strategy. As a case study,
two main classes of MTD mechanisms, namely, Host Configuration Mutation and
Network Configuration Mutation, are integrated to create a cohesive and more
powerful composite MTD mechanism. To this end, the results of this research
enable new theoretical foundations and transformative approaches in the science
of moving target defense by contributing to the understanding of automated
reasoning for moving target defense synthesis and evaluation. As this far-
forward looking EAGER proposal exhibits high-risk, it also entails high-value
that is to be always many steps ahead of attackers. Through the development of a
framework for reasoning about MTD, MTD course modules will be developed. The
software artifacts permit for further experimentation and progress in this area.
