Much of the debate surrounding the LDC-debt crisis involves asking and answering
the question of who will pay for the costs associated with settling these debts.
This question can be best addressed in a context which accounts for the
strategic nature of many of the decisions involved. The purpose of this project
is to construct and develop game-theoretic models that will help us better
understand the debt crisis and the impact of various proposals designed to deal
with it. Two areas of research will be addressed: (1) Sovereign-debt
renegotiations, and (2) The strategic interactions among debtor countries. The
first part will focus on developing models which recognize that a kind of
bargaining game exists between a sovereign debtor and a creditor, insofar as the
latter cannot commit to punishing (or not rewarding) the former unless the
entire debt is repaid. These models will shed light on how LDC governments'
policies may affect the bargaining equilibrium and how different proposals
impinge upon this equilibrium. The second part of the study will consider how
the presence of other debtor countries affects the bargaining problem between
debtor and creditor. In particular, the avenues by which a country's bargaining
strategy may influence another's will be analyzed as well as the scope for
collusive behavior among the debtor countries.
