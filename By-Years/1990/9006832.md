Planning for an idealized mobile robot includes planning physical actions and
planning to acquire knowledge by perception. For human beings, natural language
is an additional means of acquiring knowledge. This work will investigate how a
robot can use language to acquire useful knowledge, and subsequently will test
the results of the investigation by simulating a robot that can ask questions of
a user. The robot uses a coordinate system defined by its own body - a self-
centered coordinate system. For example, it might use a polar coordinate system
in which the robot is always at the origin. To grasp an object, the robot must
know the coordinates of that object. Natural language has words like "left",
"right", and "behind" to describe self- centered coordinates. Gestures are also
used- such as pointing ad a door and saying "Go through that door". Thus a user
can give a robot the information it needs in order to find objects. This work
will develop a tool that will ultimately be useful to robots. It will also
investigate how the meaning of an utterance depends on the physical environment
in which it occurs.
