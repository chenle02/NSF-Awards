This research focuses on attempts by Mayan peoples in Guatemala to create a
civil, multicultural, and all encompassing state in the context of 35 year civil
war. Recently there has been an increase in the number of Mayan groups who are
attempting to define themselves in the context of a multicultural state and, at
the same, time maintain some sense of ethnic identity. The key issue the PI
hopes to illuminate is the fact that states consist of a variety of interest
groups which compete and cooperate as they struggle to articulate some form of a
national identity. This process will be examined by interviewing leaders in
government, business, military, and ethnic sectors and analyzing their
statements presented i the media, at festivals, tourism literature, and
political rallies.
