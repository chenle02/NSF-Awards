Little is known about the distribution and functional importance of nematodes in
the snow-free dry valleys of Antarctica. The dry valleys have been compared with
other desert regions of the world. Adaptations to low moisture availability and
extremes of temperature are required of organisms attempting to function in
stressful desert ecosystems. This project will examine and compare the structure
of nematode communities in the dry valleys of Antarctica with those of better
studied desert ecosystems. The distribution and trophic structure of nematode
communities will be determined for three dry valleys at the peak of the austral
summer. Nematode distribution, abundance, and species composition will be
related to soil physical and chemical properties including organic C, nitrogen,
salinity, pH, and microbial number and biomass. The energy supply of soil will
be augmented with sugar to determine if nematode numbers are energy limited or
are limited by abiotic factors influencing survival. Nematode adaptations to low
soil moisture (anhydrobiosis) and to low temperature (cryptobiosis) will be
studied under controlled laboratory conditions. Wind dispersed nematodes will be
studied in Wright Valley by trapping wind dispersed nematodes along the axis of
the valley.
