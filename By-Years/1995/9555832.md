9555832 Nair This project proposes to complete a manuscript of a "Field Guide to
Women in Science and Engineering." These "Voices from the Field" are personal
stories of women scientists and engineers aimed at a large and diverse audience
of middle school and high school girls, through undergraduate and graduate
students, and professional women. The book is based on interviews--conducted by
telephone or in person--with these women. In choosing the scientists and
engineers to be interviewed, we have tried to include a spectrum of women with
respect to ethnic heritage as well as types of career path and achievement. We
believe that this book can provide a unique resource for girls and women by
conveying the real and diverse pathways to and experiences in a career in
science or engineering. The Sloan Foundation funded the first year of this
effort. Attachment 1 includes six of the profiles completed. Each profile charts
the woman's life as related by her, narrating personal and professional
aspirations, difficulties, milestones, and achievements. In addition, several of
them draw lessons from her life to guide young women who wish to work in science
and engineering. ***
