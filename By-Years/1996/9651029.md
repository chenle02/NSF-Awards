The aim of this project is to facilitate the establishment of an Undergraduate
ASIC Computer-Aided Design Laboratory in the Department of Electrical
Engineering and Physics at the University of Detroit Mercy that will result in a
significant enhancement in the manner in which digital system design is taught.
The area of digital design is one in which the teaching of theory is intertwined
with, and as important as, the teaching of practice. The availability of the
proposed laboratory would make it possible to formulate realistic design
projects, that would be comprehensive in scope and enable the complete design
cycle to be exercised, from initial specifications to final product. The
students will have the opportunity to see the conceived model as working
hardware. While the proposed laboratory will strengthen junior and senior level
offerings in the EE program in general the availability of state-of-the-alt
digital design automation tools will have special impact on the Digital Logic I,
Microprocessors, Advanced Microprocessors, and Digital Logic II: VHDL courses.
In all cases, a well planned sequence of laboratory assignments and projects
involving analysis, design, and simulation will provide students with strong
hands-on experience. In this proposal we are requesting four modern
workstations, license fees for software, and FPGA interface and programming
hardware. The justification for requesting each of these items is outlined in
the proposal. Given the number and diversity of the students who will utilize
this laboratory, we are confident that the impact of this laboratory improvement
will be significant.
