In this collaborative project faculty at a number of institutions are working
together to develop and implement information technological solutions aimed at
enhancing the interoperability of both collections and services for the NSDL. A
particular emphasis is on exploring the requirements for supporting "tightly
federated" collections, that feature close adherence to particular metadata
frameworks so as to enable federated search services to be built. In this
collaborative effort a team from the University of California - Berkeley is
working primarily on collection interoperability while a team from the
University of Missouri - Columbia is focusing its efforts on enhancing the
interoperability of services (see DUE 0127580).&lt;br/&gt;
