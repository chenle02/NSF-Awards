EIA-0302353&lt;br/&gt;Hsinchun Chen&lt;br/&gt;University of
Arizona&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DGPort: Intelligent Web Searching for Digital
Government Research&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Grant for Exploratory
Research will support exploration of the use of automated agents, or spiders, to
gather web material related to the topic of digital government, and to explore
the results of the agent's efforts in new ways to support analysis and knowledge
discovery. Since the topic of digital government is quite broad, this work
presents a stiff challenge, but with a potentially large payoff. The PI will
work with several current grantees of the NSF Digital Government Research
Program.
