With National Science Foundation support, the University of Hawaii Manoa - Maui
Community College will conduct a comprehensive self-assessment of current and
planned science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) programs. The
assessment includes a review of the existing STEM instructional infrastructure,
curriculum, faculty professional development opportunities, technology used for
instruction, high school to college transition programs, community service, and
Native Hawaiian student retention and success in STEM
fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Assessment outcomes will support the development of
a strategic plan to strengthen Maui Community College STEM programs to better
meet the needs of the community and specifically, the Native Hawaiian
population. &lt;br/&gt;
