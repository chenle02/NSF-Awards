This contextual IERI project will explore how to effectively scale Hands-On
Virtual Physics (HOV), a tested model of distance learning with a hands-on
inquiry approach to middle school physical science. The project is based on
prior work that developed several units on important physical science topics
through a FIPSE grant. The key objective of this project is to assess whether
students learning science in classrooms of teachers who have completed HOV
Physics better meet state and national science goals and standards than do
students who studied under the same teacher before the teacher completed this
course, and to complete the development of additional units. The distance
learning component combines virtual courses for teachers with a hands-on,
inquiry-based approach.
