In 1988, a two-year field program was completed to study the circulation and
chemistry of the Helium-3 plume emanating from the East Pacific Rise. In this
project, the P.I. will complete the processing and analysis of CTD data in hand,
and the processing and analysis of RAFOS float data as the floats come to the
surface and report the data through ARGOS communication satellites. Results will
be combined with those of Riser at the University of Washington and Lupton at
the University of California in Santa Barbara, to synthesize the physical and
chemical description of the Helium-3 plume and westward deep circulation in the
south Pacific.
