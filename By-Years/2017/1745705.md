Changes in the rate at which glaciers flow into the ocean are a source of
uncertainty in estimates of future sea level rise. Surges are brief events
during which these rates increase up to 100 times greater than the normal flow
rate. Surges, which typically last between a few months and a few years on any
given glacier, occur at intervals of decades to centuries. Therefore, few
detailed observations of surges are available for study. Negribreen, one of the
largest glaciers in Svalbard, has started to surge last summer. This project
will collect different data sets that will be used with satellite data to
characterize the surging glacier. The project will contribute to STEM workforce
development by supporting the training of a graduate student and an
undergraduate student. Observations from this project will be added to an
existing website and to develop presentations for the K-12
community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A combination of observations (laser altimetry,
video, GPS data, photographs from small aircraft, and satellite data) and
recently developed analysis approaches will be used to develop an understanding
of glacier response (deformation, crevassing, acceleration, surge progression in
the glacier system, elevation change and mass transfer) to surge dynamics. The
principal investigator has been studying the 2011-2013 and 1993-1995 surges of
the Bering-Bagley Glacier System, Alaska, using similar techniques and numerical
modeling. Bering Glacier is a warm-based glacier and Negribreen a cold-based
glacier. Results from the two systems will be compared and contrasted. It is
anticipated that characteristics of surges common to different climate
conditions may be isolated from those dependent upon specific environmental
conditions.
