0340259&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I
research project will develop near-field&lt;br/&gt;scanning optical microscopy
(NSOM) probes with dramatically increased transmission efficiency&lt;br/&gt;that
will lead to increased spatial resolution and higher scan speed. High
transmission&lt;br/&gt;efficiency will be achieved by incorporation of newly
discovered near-field surface&lt;br/&gt;plasmon affects. NSOM probes using
surface plasmon enhancement will have 2-3 orders of&lt;br/&gt;magnitude higher
transmission than existing probes, allowing faster scanning speeds
as&lt;br/&gt;well as better spatial resolution. A combination of first
principles modeling and nanofabrication&lt;br/&gt;of test structures in Phase I
will provide proof of concept as well as a guide&lt;br/&gt;for Phase II
optimization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program will push the fundamental
scientific understanding of near-field&lt;br/&gt;optics while simultaneously
enhancing the capabilities of commercial NSOM metrology&lt;br/&gt;instruments,
which have wide applicability in nanotechnology development, lithography and
metrology.&lt;br/&gt;Plasmon optics have potential applications to a broad range
of areas where high efficiency and subwavelength sizes are required including
the integration of optics with microelectronics, spatial and
spectral&lt;br/&gt;optical multiplexing, and data storage applications.
