9452680 Stevens Boston University seeks to initiate a Young Scholars program,
called Program in Mathematics for Young Scientists, PROMYS, consisting of an
intensive six week residential summer program for an ambitious group of 60
students who have completed grades 9 through 11. PROMYS serves 45 first year
students and 15 returning students. Students are advised by 18 mathematically
experienced college-aged counselors and 10 faculty members. The heart of the
program is the experience gained by students through their individual and
collective efforts to solve an assortment of challenging problems in Number
Theory. In 1995, students will also study Abstract Algebra, Geometric Topology,
and Combinatorics. Diverse weekly guest lecturers introduce participants to
related scientific fields, philosophical and ethical questions and career
options in mathematics and science. Follow-up activities include an Open-Door
Problem Set, Suggested Reading List, student presentations in their own schools,
and the PROMYS newsletter. ***
