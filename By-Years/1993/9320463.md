9320463 Langton This award will provide support for a workshop on artificial
life and evolutionary biology, to be held at the Santa Fe Institute, Santa Fe,
NM, on February 18-20, 1994. The workshop will explore how artificial life
techniques (i.e. computational techniques) can most effectively be used to
address problems in evolutionary and population biology. The results of the
workshop will be published in technical reports and in articles to journals. ***
