This EArly-concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER) grant provides
funding for feasibility studies for the laser manufacturing of 3D silicon
photonic crystals for large area solar cells. Both electrodynamic computations
and experiments will be performed to explore the feasibility of nanophotonic
light trapping in 3D photonic crystal photoactive regions for enhanced
efficiencies in solar cells. A scalable laser manufacturing method will be
developed to demonstrate preliminary results on low-cost 3D silicon photonic
structures. The proposed process involves the use of laser interference
lithography, chemical vapor deposition and template infiltration. This process
has been simulated but not yet demonstrated for 3D silicon
crystals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will
demonstrate the proof-of-concept for a new photonic crystal solar cell structure
that exhibits enhanced efficiencies and that can be manufactured at production
scale and low cost. The long term goal of the research effort is to determine
process-structure-property relationships for the optical absorption of laser
manufactured 3D photonic crystals. The preliminary data generated here will
serve as the foundation for a future study.
