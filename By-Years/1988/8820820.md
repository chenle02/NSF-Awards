Several topics in relativistic quantum field theory and elementary particle
physics will be examined. The techniques of unified gauge theories and
superstring theories will be used to explore physics beyond the standard model.
Major areas of study include: (1) properties of neutrinos in grand unified
theories and superstring models and their cosmological implications; (2) quark-
lepton physics from superstrings; (3) phenomenological search for physics beyond
the standard model; (4) phenomenology of a possible small violation of the Pauli
exclusion principal. it is also planned to: (5) use dispersion theory to study
long range forces between charged particles arising from two photon exchange;
(6) improve calculations of energy levels of helium- like ions; (7) study
methods for calculation of virtual pair and radiative effects in heavy atoms;
(8) investigate new possibilities for detecting violations of time-reversal
invariance.
