This project will provide undergraduate students at Quinnipiac College
opportunities to use NMR spectrometry in a number of chemistry courses and in
research projects. A 60-MHz NMR spectrometer with lock/decoupler and variable
temperature accessories will be used by students in organic, analytical, and
physical chemistry laboratories for a variety of applications, such as
elucidating molecular structure, analyzing mixtures, and investigating chemical
kinetics. The instrumentation will provide experimental capabilities not
previously available, and will strengthen the chemistry education of students in
a number of science programs.
