This award will fund a combined theoretical and observational study to address
the origins of Type Ia supernovae. Dr. Di Stefano and her collaborators will
create extensive population synthesis simulations that employ observations to
compute the appearance of supernovae at two stages of evolution: during an epoch
when a white dwarf gains mass and during a possible second epoch, when the white
dwarf may need to spin down before it can explode. This group will compute the
expected signatures in, and mine existing large data sets for, supernova
progenitors in recent large surveys to identify the locations some of the
thousands of progenitors that inhabit the Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In recent years, astronomers have proposed that these
stellar explosions may have come from a variety of situations involving compact
stellar remnants such as white dwarfs. Understanding the origins of supernovae
is viewed as a key issue in improving studies of the history of the expansion of
the universe. Dr. Di Stefano will also continue her efforts in public education
and outreach, and will include students at many different levels (high school
through graduate school) in this project.
