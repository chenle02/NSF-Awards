Understanding the value of campus-based cyberinfrastructure (CI) to the
institutions that invest in such CI is intrinsically difficult. Given today's
financial pressure, administrative support for campus-based CI centers offering
resources to local campus users is under constant budgetary pressure. This is
partly due to the difficulty in obtaining quantitative metrics that clearly
demonstrate the utility of investment in campus CI centers in enhancing
scientific research and the financial aspects of enhanced competitive ability in
seeking funding for research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks to
implement a set of highly experimental modules to be added to the existing CI
metrics tool eXtreme Data Metrics on Demand (XDMoD). These modules are intended
to provide a means for assessing campus-based CI investment in scientific terms,
as measured in publications, and in financial terms, as measured in grant income
from researchers who use CI as compared to those who do not. The modules,
tentatively called Open XDMoD Value Analytics, will present a view of financial,
collaboration, and publication data, showing "return-on-investment" metrics in
relation to CI usage. The goal of the work is to generalize these modules to
work with a variety of funding and publication information sources, and
incorporate them into the open source distribution of Open XDMoD.
