9723172 Bender The work will study tryptophan biosynthesis in Arabidopsis.
Genes for this pathway are induced by starvation, wounding, pathogen attack and
this results in the increased production of the amino acid and, eventually,
secondary metabolites which are important to adjusting development or preventing
damage by pathogens. The goal of the work is to characterize the molecular
factors that control tryptophan gene expression. Most experiments will focus on
regulation of the first gene/ enzyme in the pathway, ASA1. Mutants (ATR) that
affect ASA1 expression have been isolated which will be characterized in an
attempt to identify regulatory genetic loci. Other experiments will use
biochemical techniques and transgenic reporter gene expression for the study of
transcriptional and translational control. The characterization of ATR1 will
elucidate the role of this factor in connecting environmental signals with
control of tryptophan gene expression.
