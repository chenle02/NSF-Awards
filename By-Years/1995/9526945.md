provide a key to understanding the nature of deformation in rocks. They depend
for their existence on the presence of layering or a planar fabric, and their
form depends on rheological properties, initial layer configuration, and on the
history and intensity of deformation. Planar anisotropy is an important property
of rocks, and it arises from preferred alignment of grains or crystallographic
fabric, or from the alternation of isotropic layers of unlike viscosity. This
project focuses on the role of anisotropy in the development of folds, in
particular their shape and associated strain pattern, with various starting
configurations and kinematic conditions of the deformation in which folds form
in rocks. The ultimate objective is to use the information gained using
numerical models to determine the range of possible rheological properties and
kinematic conditions under which natural folds form in rocks, and thus to better
understand crustal deformation. ; Oh +' 0 $ H l S u m m a r y I n f o r m a t i
