We propose an interdisciplinary training program, based on student recruiting
in chemistry, physics and engineering, focused on the application of high
performance computing to scientific research. The research focus of this program
- molecular dynamics simulations which seek to characterize the behavior of
complex systems of many interacting "particles" (ranging from atoms in proteins
to stars in the galaxy) - is an important unifying theme in applying high
performance computing to several critical areas of science and technology. Our
program builds on the strengths of the Center for Computational Science at
Boston University which has served as a focal point for interdisciplinary
research collaboration of the PI's. Since 1988, we have pioneered the
development of massively parallel supercomputing in an academic context on our
Connection Machine. The GRT program will provide an organized framework of
seminars, discussions and facilities which will bring graduate students from
different disciplines together to focus on common computational themes which
arise in the effective exploitation of high performance computing in science.
The training program will include teaching and internship options.
