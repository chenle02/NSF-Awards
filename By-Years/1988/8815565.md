The area of expert system application to power system problems is fairly new.
Some interesting applications and methodologies have been developed over the
last several years: for example, power system fault location, alarm
interpretation and reduction, operation and control, etc. Implementation of
expert systems in the real-world control centers is being performed in Japan and
the U.S. The area of expert systems was one of the ten critical areas selected
for discussion in the NSF Power System Workshop in Tempe, Arizona, in April
1987. Although progress has been made in the field, many fundamental issues
remain to be investigated. The Symposium is organized by the Royal Institute of
Technology, Sweden, with University of Tokyo, Japan, and University of
Washington, Seattle, U.S.A. as co-organizers. The International Advisory
Committee of the Symposium is chaired by Professor Y. Sekine. C. C. Liu, the
proposer, is serving as a vice- chairman and the U.S. representative on the
committee. According to the preliminary program a total of 89 papers will be
presented in 18 sessions. The authors come form 21 countries throughout the
world. Besides the U.S. papers there is an enthusiastic participation from other
countries: Japan (17), Scandinavia (14), United Kingdom (5), Holland (4), France
(1), Germany (1), etc. The Symposium covers various aspects of expert system
related to power systems: from basic methodolgies to expert systems for specific
functions in power system planning and operation. Both industry and universities
are well represented according to latest registration figures.
