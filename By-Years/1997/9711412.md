This project will establish the timing (phase) of global climate change relative
to changes in the Earth's orbit about the Sun for the period between 1 and 5
million years ago. Emphasis will be upon using an assumption of constant phase
relative to tilt of the Earth's axis, rather than the more-common approach of
constant phase relative to orbital precession. Iterative experiments will be
done using different age models and filters on four independent data sets. In
addition to producing a master age model which can be used by others for
detailed comparisons of globally distributed climate records, the project will
assess the sensitivity of these techniques to various assumptions, and provide
insight into mechanisms of past climate change.
