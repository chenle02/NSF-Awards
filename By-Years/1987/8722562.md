This study compares patterns of molecular evolution in a number of
phylogenetically unrelated groups of freshwater fishes that show common
speciation patterns along the northern Gulf Coast of the United States. These
speciation patterns are correlated with the most recent of four geological
events that have affected this region since the Miocene (approximately 4 million
years ago). These speciation patterns follow certain phylogenetic and
biogeographic patterns predicted by theoretical models previously developed by
the investigators. Certain unique speciation patterns, that imply different
histories in the same region, will also be studied to provide contrasting data.
