The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development of a new class of smart fire protection blankets (SFPB) to protect
citizens and firefighters from wildfires and/or sustaining dangerous exposures
to excessive heat. Wildfires, now more common, can cause death from entrapment,
burns, or asphyxiation; these mortalities have increased continuously since
2011. With the proposed technology, once the firefighter or first responder is
exposed to moderate temperatures, the blanket undergoes a phase transformation
and begins expanding, generating an air pocket. This reduces the heat flow from
the fire to the firefighterâ€™s skin, reducing burn
injuries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the development
of a new class of smart fire protection blankets utilizing shape memory
elements. Layers of aluminum foil, fiberglass, Kevlar, fire-retardant sheets and
a backing of silica weave will be interwoven with the shape memory elements. The
fast actuation phase transformation characteristics are activated when excessive
thermal exposures are detected. Once activated, the shape memory elements will
expand and introduce air pockets inside the blanket that will reduce their
thermal conductivity and also lower the risk of burns. The proposed smart
garment will have self-tuning characteristics to adjust the thickness of the air
pockets according to the ambient temperature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
