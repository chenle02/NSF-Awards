Substantial progress has been achieved towards reducing the cost of DNA
sequencing, resulting in generation and availability of large amounts of genomic
data. Public availability of this data and sharing of genomic databases between
institutions are vital to paving the way towards personalized medicine. However,
there are significant risks in sharing genomic data, which carries a lot of
sensitive information about its owner, such as his/her disease predispositions
(e.g., for Alzheimer's), ancestry, and physical attributes. This threat to
genomic privacy is magnified by the fact that a person's genome is correlated to
his/her family members' genomes, thus leading to interdependent privacy risks.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, the main research objective is to develop
privacy-preserving techniques for sharing genomic databases (and statistics
about genomic databases) under diverse settings that include the following: (i)
when a database owner (researcher) shares statistics about its database; (ii)
when a database owner shares its entire database (e.g., after data use
agreements) with a client; and (iii) when database owners outsource the storage
and processing of their databases to a third-party cloud server. The project
will also address important and challenging issues, such as, verification of
shared statistics by a client, liability of shared databases in case of their
unauthorized sharing, and maximizing the utility of shared data. For all
developed techniques, the project team will evaluate/quantify privacy using
state-of-the-art genomic privacy quantification
algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
