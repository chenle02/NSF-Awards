SoD: Synthiszizing Device Drivers

The goal of this project is develop a framework for designing software-intensive
systems based on recent work on multi-stage programming languages. Our thesis is
that the concept of staging, originally developed to support program
optimization, is a fundamental technique in the emerging science of design of
software-intensive systems. We believe that many software-intensive systems can
be designed more effectively using a linguistic framework that reflects the
staging distinctions separating high-level software designs from their
implementations on particular platforms.

In earlier work, we helped develop the conceptual foundations of multi-stage
programming including the construction of core calculi and type systems that
support staging and the development of a realistic language incorporating
staging called MetaOCaml. In this project, we intend to show how staging can be
used to improve the process of designing software in industry where the phase
distinction between program designs and deployed implementations is acute. We
will focus on the design of device drivers because the deployed code for
controlling a device varies greatly depending on the vagaries of the device
interface and the hardware platform to which it is attached. In this context, we
must extend staging techniques to handle event-driven computation, concurrency,
and strict limitations on resources.
