9309668 Thevanayagam The objective of this research is to develop a fundamental
understanding of the relationship between the macroscopic response of soils upon
an excitation by an alternating current and micro-structural soil parameters and
the geo-environment in which it is present. A fundamental model will be
developed aimed at quantitatively linking the observed electrical response to
the basic soil compositional, micro-structural and environmental factors. The
basic driving force behind this research is related to the idea that all the
factors that affect the electric response of soils affect its mechanical and
flow behavior properties. A technology of predicting the basic soil parameters
will have various applications. If one could invert the observed electric
response of soils to predict these basic parameters then it will be possible to
forecast macroscopic engineering behavior parameters for geotechnical and geo-
environmental applications. *** ~ @ j 0> BIRTHDAYCAL p 9309668 Thevanayagam The
