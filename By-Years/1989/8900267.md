Object recognition requires the selection of related image features for
consideration by subsequent visual processing stages. This grant will support
theoretical and experimental studies of image feature selection and linking in
human and machine vision. Mathematical, psychophysical, and computational
studies will be carried on in parallel the first year, with selection algorithms
implemented in Lisp code that can be shared with other institutions. Further
development, including implementation and testing on a Connection Machine, is
planned for a second-year continuation. A third year of effort will integrate
research results with those of synergistic projects funded by DARPA and ONR.
