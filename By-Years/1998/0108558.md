The Calumet Region in Chicago provides a unique opportunity to explore
redevelopment options that marry environmental and economic development
concerns. Several apparently competing options have been proposed but no formal
economic assessment has been provided. The proposed research will develop a
user-friendly PC-based software system to enable analysis of the anticipated
benefits from a set of 5-10 development options. Care will be taken to integrate
economic and environmental concerns by combining qualitative and quantitative
information. The system will be field-tested with various environmental and
economic development organizations who represent the major stakeholders in the
region. A unique feature of the project is the cooperation among a diverse group
of University of Illinois scholars, the City of Chicago Department of the
Environment and the Chicago Academy of Sciences.
