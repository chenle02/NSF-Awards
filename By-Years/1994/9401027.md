9401027 Sundberg Richter and Sundberg will investigate the invariant sbspace
lattices of the operator of multiplication by an analytic function on Banach or
Hilbert spaces of analytic functions. The spaces that will be investigated
include the Dirichlet and Bergman spaces on the open unit disc, as well as Hardy
spaces of more general domains in the complex plane. These invariant subspace
problems are related naturally to questions from classical analysis, such as
questions about zero sets and sets of uniqueness. The new technique involved in
these investigation will be that of "extremal functions" in invariant subspaces.
Operator theory is that branch of mathematics that treats objects that are
infinite generalizations of finite matrices. Frequently, these operators can be
given realization as mutiplications on certain collections of functions. In this
form the invariant subspace and classification problem are related to natural
function existence and interpolation questions. This project will contribute to
both the classification problem and the related concrete function existence
problems. ***
