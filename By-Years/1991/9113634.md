With this grant in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Professor Hall will use ab initio full-gradient geometry
optimization techniques, including multiconfiguration self-consistent-field and
configuration interaction methods to solve problems of current interest in
inorganic and organometallic chemistry. He will continue methods development in
three areas. To improve the time to solution on multiprocessing computers, he
will continue working on parallel code of which the gradient section is now
complete. In order to handle large numbers of electrons and orbitals, he will
implement a modification of the complete active space multiconfiguration self-
consistent-field technique. Lastly, he will continue the use of and improve the
understanding of the topological method of analysis due to Bader. The systems to
be studied are related to three fundamental steps in catalysis: oxidative-
addition, substitution, and migratory-insertion. Specifically, he will examine
several important questions about the nature of the C-H activation. The methods
to be utilized will allow him to draw conclusions about a group of closely
related molecules with modest basis sets and a moderate degree of electron
correlation. %%% Professor Hall will perform theoretical compuations that will
aid in understanding the elementary steps in a number of chemical reactions that
are important in catalytic processes.
