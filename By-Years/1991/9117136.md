Recent research has demonstrated that the nebulosity surrounding the familiar
Pleiades star cluster results from an accidental encounter between the cluster
and an interstellar cloud. Data from the Infrared Astronomical Satellite have
revealed the wake of the Pleiades in the ambient interstellar medium, and have
indicated the existence of a bow shock where heated gas near the cluster
compresses the upstream material. Dr. White's research has the following aims:
to trace the motions of the interstellar gas observed toward the Pleiades,
particularly in the cluster-cloud interaction region; to explore the physical
conditions that prevail in the gas and infer the spatial relationships among the
stars and the nearby gas; to characterize interstellar processes in the cluster,
particularly the dominant process of gas heating by photoelectrons emitted from
dust grains and the poorly understood formation process of the CH+ molecule. The
means to these ends will be analysis of interstellar absorption lines in high
resolution, high sensitivity spectra of cluster and background stars to be
obtained at Kitt Peak National Observatory. This award is made under the
Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) program.
