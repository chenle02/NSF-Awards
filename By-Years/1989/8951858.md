A special laboratory room is being equipped for teaching introductory and
service oriented Computer Science courses that will greatly enhance efforts to
introduce a laboratory component across the lower-divisional curricula.
Interacting with the students in the laboratory, the instructor observes and
assists students in the entire programming process from design through
implementation and debugging. The microcomputer-based laboratory, linked by a
Local Area Network, permits students to gain a better appreciation of the often
non-linear nature of program development from conception to design to working
program through an iterative process that is difficult to impart in traditional
classroom settings. This award is being matched by an equal sum from the
grantee.
