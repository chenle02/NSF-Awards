Homotopy theory is the study of topological phenomena that remain invariant
under fairly flexible sorts of continuous deformations. Most basically, we seek
to compute and to understand homotopy classes of maps between finite simplicial
or CW complexes, perhaps after some sort of stabilization. Computation and
understanding are not the same: we have forty or more years of computations, but
only lately have we begun to have the language to in which to make a coherent
theory out of the data we have. This project is, therefore, as much about
exploring and refining the language as it is about calculations -- although
there will be a mixture of both. The entry point is the observation that any
cohomology theory with a good theory of Chern classes gives rise to a formal
group law and, hence, a formal group. Conversely, given a formal group we can
ask whether there is an associated cohomology theory. These cohomology theories
then delineate the finer structure of stable homotopy theory.

This is the chromatic picture of stable homotopy: we seek to use the algebraic
geometry of formal groups to organize and direct investigations into the deeper
structure of computations and theory. This project seeks to develop this point
of view in two directions, one local and one global. The first, or local,
direction is an investigation into K(n)-local homotopy theory in general and
into the K(n)-local sphere in particular. The second, or more global, direction,
would be to make systematic our knowledge of structured ring spectra using
stacks and the moduli stack of formal groups as the basic parametrizing device.
