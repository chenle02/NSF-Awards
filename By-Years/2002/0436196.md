All cloud droplets and many ice crystals form on suspended particles in the
atmosphere. This laboratory investigation will study key aspects of these
"nucleation" processes. The study emphasizes the nucleating properties of
organic material (including pure organic species and the organic material in
soils) and mineral dust because they have not been studied extensively before
and there is an increasing body of evidence that points to their importance in
the atmosphere. Three different kinds of laboratory measurement will be made:
water uptake on particles in subsaturated conditions, activity of particles as
cloud-condensation nuclei (CCN), and ice nucleation of pure solution droplets or
caused by undissolved particles. Samples of soil from regions that are
significant sources of desert dust will be collected and re-suspended for these
analyses. A key hypothesis to be tested is that the characteristics of dust from
different arid regions of the world have similar characteristics and so might be
represented by common parameterizations. Other objectives of this project will
be to examine particles of known mixed composition and to develop and test
parametric representations of the results. The expected result is new
characterization of the nucleating properties of some key constituents of the
atmospheric aerosol and the development of new ways of representing those
characteristics that can be used in weather and climate models of those
processes. This has potential to influence future forecasts of precipitation and
representations of the important radiative properties of clouds in climate
models.
