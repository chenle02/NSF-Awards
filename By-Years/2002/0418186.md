This doctoral dissertation examines the impacts of two categories of factors on
the environmental compliance behavior of small firms (SFs). The first category
concerns internal motivations that drive SFs' decisions to comply or not comply
with a formal environmental regulation. The other comprises external factors
that affect formation of SFs' perspectives on rule compliance. The regulatory
programs in Massachusetts and southern California targeting the dry cleaning
industry are excellent cases through which to evaluate the central issues of
SFs' compliance. The two programs are comparable in that they are equally
strict; formal sanctions are equally severe; and regulated groups are similar in
cultural background and other sectoral aspects (i.e., firm size, operating
costs, and profit margins). A notable difference is that there was a sudden rise
in compliance rates in Massachusetts as compared to southern California. The
comparative case study draws on ethnographic analysis and structural equation
modeling (SEM), based on in-depth interview data and surveys. The study will
contribute to knowledge of how formal regulatory enforcement can alter SFs'
willingness, opportunity, and capacity to comply, as well as broader insights
about regulatory compliance in general.
