9508538 Pohm This SBIR Phase II is for research on the commercialization of
memories based on giant magnetoresistive materials. Test arrays of a small,
high-output memory cell will be fabricated and evaluated for defect statistics
and performance. Using the defect statistics, suitable redundancy and sparing
strategies will be developed. Test structures for evaluating power and data
busses will also be built and will be used to measure operating characteristics
of the bus designs. Finally, a subsection of a 16 Megabit die will be fabricated
for evaluation.
