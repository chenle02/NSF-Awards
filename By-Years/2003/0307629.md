AST-0307629&lt;br/&gt;Aller&lt;br/&gt;The link between the black hole and
accretion disk at the heart of active galactic nuclei (AGN), and the radio jets
commonly observed in these sources and apparently emanating from the central
engine, remains an unanswered question. Past work has successfully treated the
radio jets as hydrodynamical flows with passive magnetic fields, even though the
magnetic energy must be high. This research will explore the connection between
these regimes, using multi-frequency radio polarimetry observations to measure
directly the magnetic field strength and orientation. Both single dish and
interferometric observations of linear and circular polarization at multiple
frequencies, over timescales of weeks to decades, are necessary and will be
obtained, and interpreted using associated modeling. A valuable by-product will
be information on particle composition and particle energy distribution,
fundamental jet properties which remain unknown. The database of unique
measurements will be made readily available, and the research will help maintain
one of the few radio telescopes available in the US for hands-on student
training.&lt;br/&gt;***
