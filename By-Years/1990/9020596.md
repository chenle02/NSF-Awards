This award enables establishment of a statewide academic/research network for
Arkansas. A confederation of 19 colleges and universities, representing over 86
percent of the State's student enrollment, has been formed to administer the
network (ARKnet). The network extends full service to each school, regardless of
size, via 56,000 bit per second leased lines, and each school is working toward
ubiquity of service on its campus. A training program has been established to
ensure that all potential users of the network have knowledge appropriate to
their purposes. This award builds on a 1987 grant to the University of Arkansas,
Fayetteville, which provided connection to MIDNET, a mid-level network covering
eight midwestern states. This connection will provide access for ARKnet to
MIDNET and the NSFNET.
