1153340(Cortes-Caminero). AIChE will co-host, with EPA and NSF, a workshop that
is intended to catalyze the advancement of the design of sustainable supply
chains nationwide. The workshop will be held at NSF on September 12-13, 2011.
This workshop will bring together government leaders, industry representatives,
and academic experts to chart the way forward on design of sustainable supply
chains. It will provide a forum for university, federal agency and industry
thought leaders to share their vision for sustainable supply chain design,
outlining challenges, knowledge gaps, and research needs. This workshop will
foster partnerships necessary to develop and propagate sustainable supply chain
design. The workshop program, presentations and related resources will be placed
on the Internet for the public at large. In addition, a final report will be
issued that contains recommendations on areas in need of research. The report
will identify the greatest opportunities for, and the obstacles that might
hinder the creation of sustainable supply chains.
