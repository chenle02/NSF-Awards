Carrie Stoffel, Western Washington University, is a Discovery Corps Postdoctoral
Fellow for the 2004-2005 and 2005-2006 academic years. Stoffel will organize a
series of after-school science clubs in eight middle schools in demographically
diverse Western Washington. She will also recruit and train pre-service teachers
and chemistry majors to lead these science clubs. This Discovery Corps
Postdoctoral Fellowship is supported by the Division of Chemistry and the MPS
Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.

The Discovery Corps Fellowship Program is a pilot program seeking new
postdoctoral and professional development models that combine research expertise
with professional service. Discovery Corps Fellows leverage their research
expertise through projects that address areas of national need. Their projects
enhance research capacity and infrastructure and contribute to workforce
development and job creation. The Discovery Corps Program supports both
Postdoctoral Fellows and Senior Fellows.
