The proposed research will involve theoretical studies of a variety of
different kinds of reaction between fluid and rock. It will include: 1.
Gravitational instabilities ranging from situations of rapid melt segregation to
cases in which segregation is slow or negligible 2. Chemical exchange balanced
by diffusion in the fluid phase: An application of this regime is the exchange
of Sr between carbonates and their contained porewaters. 3 Exchange limited by
diffusion in the solid phase. The thermal history in the vicinity of the conduit
at Inyo Domes is sufficiently well known that it should be possible to determine
the diffusion parameters of feldspars in their natural setting, and compare it
to laboratory diffusion data to test the key assumption of thermochronometry
that laboratory data can indeed be extrapolated to give geologically relevant
diffusion rates.
