This software capitalization project is to fund the reformatting of the online
text data, which exists as part of the Association for Computational Linguistics
Data Encoding Initiative, into a common SGML-based format and make it available
to the research community at low cost and with minimal restrictions. This is the
first of several collections which are being re-formatted. The project enables
scaling up of natural language research so that more realistic problems can be
studied. This is particularly relevant for applications in the recognition and
analysis of text and speech. Existing generally-available text databases are too
small. It is expensive and time consuming to obtain sufficient text and to make
it usable for research. For individual researchers to duplicate this effort is
wasteful. A common database will permit published results to be replicated or
extended. There is joint funding for this project with other NSF offices and
with DARPA.
