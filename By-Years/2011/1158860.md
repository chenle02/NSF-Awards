Many policies and curricula have been designed in recent years to help teachers
understand and improve their teaching of elementary mathematics. The challenge
for teachers is to develop strategies for using standards-based curriculum
materials in ways that construct coherence across various policy and
accountability messages and support students' learning. The goal of Phase 1 of
this research is to develop a data-driven conceptual framework for understanding
the resources, understandings, and contexts that frame teachers' uses of
curriculum materials. This research will contribute to the field's understanding
of teachers' use of standards-based curriculum materials by situating teachers'
curriculum use strategies in multiple curricular, policy, and developmental
contexts and by linking these strategies to student achievement. In Phase 2, the
goal is to design a pre-service teacher learning tool based on this conceptual
framework and document the effects of this tool on pre-service teachers' beliefs
and practices with respect to curriculum materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
central research activities include multiple classroom observations and
interviews with 3rd and 4th-grade teachers over two years, focused on the ways
in which teachers notice, read, evaluate, adapt, and integrate curriculum
materials and other instructional resources in interactions with students. The
central educational activities include involving students from a graduate
curriculum course in the design of the pre-service teacher learning tool and
then implementing this tool with two cohorts of undergraduate elementary
mathematics methods students at Iowa State University. Educational materials
developed during this project will be accessible and relevant to pre-service
teachers and teacher educators in a variety of settings; the digital nature of
the materials will allow for broad dissemination. &lt;br/&gt;
