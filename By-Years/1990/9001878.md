This award supports the research in automorphic forms of Professor Don Blasius
of the University of California at Los Angeles. Dr. Blasius's project is to
complete the construction of Galois representations for Maass forms of Galois
type by extending to coherent cohomology certain methods of interpre- tation
that have been established for holomorphic forms; to stabilize the Trace Formula
for GSp(4), beginning with the Fundamental Lemma; and to study certain lifting
problems involving Abelian varieties, in the setting of Shimura varieties,
applying his work on p-adic properties of Hodge classes. Non-Euclidean plane
geometry began in the early nineteenth century as a mathematical curiosity, but
by the end of that century, mathematicians had realized that many objects of
fundamental importance are non-Euclidean in their basic nature. The detailed
study of non-Euclidean plane geometries has given rise to several branches of
modern mathematics, of which the study of modular and automorphic forms is one
of the most active. This field is principally concerned with questions about the
whole numbers, but in its use of geometry and analysis, it retains connection to
its historical roots.
