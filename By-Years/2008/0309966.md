0309966&lt;br/&gt;Taylor&lt;br/&gt;This 3-year award to University of Hawaii at
Manoa (UHM) provides support for technical services during NSF-funded programs
on R/V Kilo Moana, a 185' general purpose research vessel operated as part of
the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. Support
is also provided for selected cruises on R/V Ka'imikai O Kanaloa, a non-UNOLS
research vessel owned by the State of Hawaii. UHM will provide two shipboard
technicians on each cruise of R/V Kilo Moana to support seagoing research
projects and to maintain, calibrate and provide for qualified users items from
their pool of shared-use research instrumentation. As specialized services, they
will maintain and operate the multibeam sonar systems on R/V Kilo Moana, as well
as provide other seafloor mapping services when required in support of NSF-
funded projects. The technical support and instrument maintenance provided via
this award enables shared-use operation of this oceanographic facility by
qualified researchers from throughout the US, and it enables efficient use of
the vessel for federally-funded oceanographic research. Budgets for technical
support are evaluated annually, and the cost is based on the proportion of
vessel use by each sponsoring agency.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
