CTS-9313913 University of Iowa David G. Rethwisch ABSTRACT The enhanced
capabilities of NMR with a pulsed field gradient NMR probe will permit the
measurement of solute mobility as well as solubility in polymers. Direct
comparison of measurements for polymer samples from different physical
processing methods will be made for better understanding of structure function
relationships. Particular applications will be aimed at the improvement of non-
porous polymeric membranes for gas separations. Gases currently used in the
production of foams contribute to the destruction of the ozone layer and to
global warming so that alternative gases or processes must be identified.
Membrane-based gas separation methods offer promise as a lower energy, more
economical approach to the production of commercially and medically important
gases. .N T" AUTOEXECBAT X J BURKA PRE dP #zs SAVERS j " ICONS j " LM Y
