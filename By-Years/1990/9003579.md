This is a post Loma Prieta earthquake (Oct. 1989) investigation project in
learning from this damaging event. The focus of this project is to study the
effects of pounding of adjacent structures against each other based on the
actual damage observations. The objectives are: (1) to survey the frequency and
types of pounding that occurred, (2) to evaluate analytically the effects of
pounding on several buildings that had observed structural damage from pounding,
(3) to investigate the adverse effects of pounding, and (4) to provide engineers
with guidance to mitigate the damage from pounding. The expected research
results: a summary of observed damage due to pounding, and analytical
investigation to correlate with actual observed pounding damage, a proposed
modeling procedure and a design method for buildings subjected to pounding, and
a method of mitigating pounding damage on existing adjacent buildings. This
study will lead to a better understanding of the phenomena and proper ways to
mitigate the damages in connection with pounding.
