This research on the political campaign leading up to the Spanish election in
June of 1993 is part of a large cross-national study on the manner in which
citizens obtain information during political campaigns. It focuses on the roles
played by secondary organizations and personal contacts with friends, co-workers
and family as well as the impact of the mass media on the channeling and
structuring of political information to potential voters. This study, as part of
the larger Comparative National Elections Project, will enhance our
understanding of the flow of information in campaigns. The effectiveness of this
communications process is vital to citizens making informed judgements in their
voting decisions and is, therefore, critical to the health of the democratic
process. The funding will be used to expand the sample size of the surveys so
that conclusions drawn on the basis of these data will be more reliable. The
researchers will archive campaign materials, especially the media broadcasts
that appear to play such a major role in modern campaigns, so that the flow of
information can be accurately assessed after the campaign. These data would not
be retrievable without immediate support for the project.
