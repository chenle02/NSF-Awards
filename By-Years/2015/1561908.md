This workshop will bring together, for the first time, all of the PIs of the NSF
BIGDATA program, at a venue in the Washington DC/Northern Virginia area. The
goals of the NSF BIGDATA program are to "develop new methods for deriving
knowledge from data; construct new infrastructure to manage, curate and serve
data to communities; and forge new approaches for associated education and
training." Given the range of possible activities, there is a need and
opportunity to introduce the funded project PI's to the breadth of work funded
under the Big Data Research Initiative and to new potential research partners.
The workshop is by invitation, and open to researchers who are currently funded
through the NSF BIGDATA program. The goal of this two-day workshop is to bring
together PIs/co-PIs with government and industry invitees to discuss current
research, as well as identify and elaborate on new, emerging challenges, and
future directions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will bring together
experts in different disciplines comprising the Big Data community, funded by
NSF. The meeting will identify gaps, needs, resources, and barriers related to
Big Data research, and also develop a forward-looking research agenda that will
identify future directions in this area. The workshop will provide current PIs
with opportunities to showcase and discuss their current work; establish new
collaborations; develop knowledge of available research and infrastructure
resources; and gain insight into new areas of research. The broader impact of
this meeting will be the ability to more broadly share research results in the
foundational as well as application aspects of big data in society.
