The study of political institutions has recently experienced a renaissance in
political economy and comparative politics. An interesting class of political
institutions are multi-party parliamentary democracies, where the executive
derives its mandate from and is politically responsible to the legislature.
Parliamentary democracies differ with respect to the specific rules in their
constitutions that prescribe how their governments form and terminate.
Parliamentary democracies also differ systematically with respect to the
observed duration of their government formation processes, the type (i.e.,
minority, minimum winning, or surplus) and size of the government coalitions
that result from these processes, and the relative durability of their
governments. These observations raise the following important questions: Can
constitutional features account for these observed differences? And, if so,
which institutions are quantitatively most important for the type and the
stability of coalition governments? Providing answers to these questions is very
important for the design (or redesign) of constitutions in modern parliamentary
democracies and has significant economic implications.

The goal of our research is to develop a unified theoretical and empirical
framework to investigate the effects of a large class of institutions on the
behavior of coalition governments in parliamentary democracies. Our approach
consists of specifying a bargaining model of government formation and
dissolution, estimating the model's parameters, assessing the ability of the
model to account for key features of the data, and then using the estimated
structural model to conduct experiments of comparative constitutional design. In
particular, our proposed research will focus on the structure of parliament and,
in particular, bicameralism and on government policy and, in particular, the
budget process.
