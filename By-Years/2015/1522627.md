Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) and thalassemia trait (TT) are two common anemia
types whose clinical presentation is similar, but with different treatments. IDA
is treated with iron supplementation, while TT is left without treatment. In
areas such as Mediterranean regions and SE Asia, the incidence of TT can exceed
10% of the population. The reason for this high incidence is because TT offers
some protection against malaria. Treating patients suffering from TT with iron
supplementation significantly increases their risk of malaria infection19, in
addition to toxic iron overload and other negative consequences of iron over
supplementation. Many patients live in low-resource regions and their access to
centralized healthcare is limited, leading to under-diagnosis, under-treatment,
and mis-treatment. The development of a portable diagnostic tool will have
significant impact on society by increasing access to anemia diagnosis and,
therefore, improve targeted treatments such as iron therapy.

Elastic light scattering is a well-validated metrology technique to measure size
distributions of particles in a polydisperse suspension with nanometer-scale
precision. It has a long history of use in biology to study cell size, with most
modern flow cytometers offering forward- and side-scattering channels. The
proposed device will measure elastic scattering patterns for a simply prepared
suspension of red cells in a single shot. Through the use of a pupil-plane
imaging system and two-color illumination, the device will simultaneously
determine size and refractive index parameters from cell distributions with
better than 15nm accuracy in cell size, despite using consumer-grade components
in its construction, well beyond what can be obtained by other low-cost devices
such as portable microscopy.
