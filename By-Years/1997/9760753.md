9760753 Mancevski This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
addresses research to demonstrate the feasibility of a new generation of Six
Degree-of-Freedom (Six-DOF) Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) tools for use in
microelectronics manufacturing that overcome limitations inherent in the sensing
and control system architectures of existing lower degree-of-freedom AFMs. This
will be achieved by merging elements of current AFM technology with a Six-DOF
sensing system invented and patented by the University of Texas-Austin. This
Six-DOF sensing system is capable of measuring all six absolute degrees of
freedom of a body of space, such as a deflecting AFM cantilever. XIDEX calls the
resulting new generation of tools "6D-AFM" tools. 6D-AFMs will be used for
material characterization, chemical-mechanical planarization monitoring,
precision surface profiling and critical dimension metrology. The sensing system
of a 6D-AFM will be completely decoupled from the actuator, enabling it to
measure at even better resolutions than the actuator itself, and do so while the
actuator is in motion. XIDEX will develop, manufacture and sell 6D-AFM tools to
the semiconductor industry for material characterization, critical dimension
metrology, and precision surface profiling and to other attractive market
segments and niches such as lithography, biological sampling, and nanoprobe
research instrumentation.
