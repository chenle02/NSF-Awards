The morphological differentiation of commissural and associational neurons in
the rat embryo spinal cord will be studied. Single and double labeling using the
lipid soluble dyes, DiI and DiA, will be applied to classify neurons according
to origin, migration and dendritic arborization, as well as to determine which
classes are innervated by dorsal root afferents. In addition to standard
fluorescent methods at the light microscopic level, confocal microscopy and
electron microscopy following photoconversion of the fluorescent dyes to
electron dense products also will be used. In addition, the role of nerve growth
factor (NGF) on the differentiation of specific types of neurons will be
assessed following treatment of embryos in utero with antiserum against NGF.
These studies are fundamental to understanding how synaptic specificity develops
in the mammalian spinal cord.
