Abstract ATM-9322768 Retelle, Michael J. Bates College Title: Laminated Lake
Sediments from the Canadian High Arctic: Understanding the Climatic Signal for
Paleoclimatic Reconstruction Synopsis. Ice core and other paleoclimatic records
from the High Arctic suggest that summer temperatures reached minimum levels for
the entire Holocene during the last 500 years, but underwent a dramatic reversal
in the last 100 years. This award, under the Paleoclimate from Arctic Lakes and
Estuaries (PALE) program is designed to study lake sediments from a number of
sites to determine if this hypothesis is supported by the sedimentary record. To
better understand the paleoclimatic signal in the sediments, a three year
process-based study is planned to determine the primary controls on sediments
flux and varved sediment formation in Sophia Lake, a High Arctic hypersaline,
meromictic lake. Sophia Lake provides a simple topographic environment, which
will facilitate efforts to isolate the primary climatic forcing. Sediments from
lakes on the margin of Agassiz Ice Cap will also be recovered in order to link
the paleoclimatic record of ice cores from the ice cap to sedimentary records
from the glacier margin,
