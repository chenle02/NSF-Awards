This research concerns the Shimura curve associated to an indefinite rational
quaternion division algebra. The rational structure of these curves have been
understood for a long time, however there are many important questions to be
answered concerning their integral structure. Drinfeld gave the description as a
course moduli scheme and this research will investigate their Hecke structure.
This research is in one of the most erudite areas of arithmetic algebraic
geometry, that subject which blends algebraic and geometric (and in this case
analytic) techniques to answer questions in number theory. This research has
already been a crucial ingredient in solving one of the big problems settled
this year and will continue in the same direction during the tenure of this
award. Much of great interest will be accomplished.
