This Noyce Capacity Building Project will bring together faculty and staff from
the University of Georgia (UGA) and local educators to develop plans to recruit,
train, and support more qualified secondary mathematics and science teachers in
Northeast Georgia. The plan represents a first step in addressing the shortage
of qualified STEM teachers in the region. The overall motivational goal of the
project team is to increase STEM talent in the region's workforce by better
preparing teachers to work with diverse and under-represented
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To develop the recruitment, preparation, and
support plans, the PI and Co-PI will create two teams, the Core and Advisory
Teams, from the University of Georgia community. Together these teams will work
to 1) assess the need for science and mathematics teachers in the region; 2)
determine if STEM professionals exist in the community who could potentially
enter the teaching workforce; 3) determine how well University of Georgia
science and mathematics teacher preparation programs prepare and support
students to meet national and state standards; and 4) strengthen ties between
University of Georgia education and STEM faculty and staff. The collected data
will inform the emerging plan, which will be written by the Core Team and
critiqued by the Advisory Team. The final plan will be based on a process of
evidence-based decision making, which will be shared with other institutions.
With it in hand, the Core Team will be able to efficiently work towards
increasing the number of high-quality secondary mathematics and science teachers
produced at UGA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
