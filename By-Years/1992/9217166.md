Funds are provided for a study of Quaternary cores for the Ontong- Java Plateau
ODP sites. The approach will be to eliminate the productivity effect which has a
compensating effect on preservation. This will provide a "corrected" signal for
preservation as a difference between shallow and deep records. Paleoproductivity
signal will be obtained through the study of benthic formainifera. Ontong-Java
is an ideal area for this study as productivity variations as minimal here. The
study will interglacial variations in atmospheric CO2 and on the nature of
acoustic reflectors in deep sea carbonates.
