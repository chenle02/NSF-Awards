This project will involve two basic topics of combinatorial geometry, namely
polyhedra and configurations. The principal investigator will study a general
theory for polyhedra in 3- dimensional space including self-intersecting
polyhedra and those with self-intersecting faces. He will also analyze polyhedra
without self-intersections which have faces which are equivalent under
symmetries of the polyhedron. Examples of convex polyhedra in three-dimensional
space include boxes, pyramids, and the shapes of most buildings. These are
convex if they have no indentations and always protrude outward. When a convex
building has windows, one cannot see the outside of the building through any of
these. For many decades mathematicians have studied convex polyhedra and their
many applications. The principal investigator will extend many of the results of
this earlier work to polyhedra which are not convex.
