Moss Landing Marine Laboratories (MLML) and San Jose State University has been
awarded funding to conduct a feasibility study for an academic village that will
improve the capacity for researchers, graduate and undergraduate students, STEM
education, and resource managers in marine science. MLML serves as the graduate
program in Marine Science for a consortium of seven California State
Universities in central California. MLML does not have available resources for
visiting researchers/students or meeting/lab space for non-MLML researchers. The
collegial and academic mission of MLML suffers from this ability to provide a
dynamic location where collaboration, discussion, and interaction can occur. To
seek information on the needed resources from the community of potential
stakeholders (central California Universities and marine institutions, resource
managers, precollege educational institutions) we will develop a task force,
conduct interviews with stakeholders, and develop a list of infrastructural
needs to accomplish our goal. The primary goal is a clear vision of the
resources needed to provide access to visiting researchers and all levels of
students within and beyond the MLML consortium. This conceptual blueprint for
the academic village will inform decisions on space and institutional resources
as a basis for architectural and program plans. The plans will culminate in
construction of laboratories, classrooms, activity centers, and conference rooms
after fund raising. For more information about MLML please see our website:
