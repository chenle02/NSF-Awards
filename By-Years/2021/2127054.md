The broader impact of this SBIR Phase II project will be a reduction in the time
for food safety laboratories to test meat for human consumption. The project
seeks to reduce food waste and food-borne illnesses resulting from contaminated
meat, as well to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) produced as a result of
refrigeration and storage of spoiled meat products. This project aims to develop
a technology ready for accreditation and commercialization that will detect
harmful bacteria in meat products. This project may allow for the implementation
of food safety monitoring tests at a lower cost. It may create an improvement in
food safety, saving billions of dollars in recalls and reducing holding costs of
food production. The ability to get ground beef to retailersâ€™ shelves a day
earlier can reduce food waste in ground beef by 50%. As beef is energy-intensive
to produce, this waste reduction could save trillions of gallons of water and
prevent the release of billions of pounds of methane and greenhouse gases every
year. The US total addressable market for pathogen testing is estimated at
nearly $10 billion, with a compound annual growth rate of 6%.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to reduce the time it takes for food
safety laboratories to test beef trimmings for pathogenic bacteria. The
objective for this research and development Phase II project is to streamline
the rapid pathogen enrichment technology developed in Phase I and to integrate
new instrumentation and tools to create a high-throughput laboratory setting.
The mechanical microfiltration methods and incubation procedures will be
optimized, enzymatic treatments will be explored further, and the ease of
physical operation and consistency of the method will be streamlined for
commercial use. A low-cost, Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC)
accredited process capable of reliably detecting 1 colony forming unit (CFU) of
pathogenic bacteria in 375 g of trim within 6 hours will be created - saving 12
or more hours over current state-of-the-art methods. Once accredited, the
enrichment technology may be sold to high-throughput meat producers, who need
results within a single 8-hour shift to streamline logistics, reducing cold
storage, and lessening food pathogen outbreak risks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
