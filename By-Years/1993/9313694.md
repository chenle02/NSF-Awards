9313694 Shambaugh In the melt blowing process, a fine polymeric stream is
extruded into a high-velocity gas stream. The force of the gas rapidly
attenuates the polymer stream to diameters as fine as one micrometer or less.
Melt blown fibers are used commercially in insulation, absorbent material, and
filters. Based on fundamental momentum, continuity, and energy balance
considerations, the research will develop a comprehensive model that describes
the complex process of melt blowing. The objectives of the work are to (1)
verify the model and use the model for optimization studies, (2) model and test
oscillating melt blowing jets, and (3) model and test cold quench. The model,
the jet oscillation technique, and the cold quench technique have applications
beyond melt blowing. Many of the hundreds of commercial nonwoven processes--from
papermaking to geotextile fabrication to the production of carpet backing--could
benefit from the knowledge base developed in the work.
