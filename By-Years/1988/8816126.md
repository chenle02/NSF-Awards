Theoretical studies will be performed with new theoretical/computational
capabilities which have been developed for investigating the electronic
structure and properties of complex solids and surfaces within local density
functional theory. Our total energy full potential linearized augmented plane
wave (FLAPW) approach for thin films and bulk solids will be applied to (i) the
study of the structural, electronic and magnetic properties of transition metal
and rare-earth metal surfaces and (ii) the determination of the electronic
structure and properties of the high temperature superconductors. These latter
results will be used as a starting point for developing a quantitative theory of
excitonic superconductivity. The studies in (i) and (ii) will be undertaken in
collaboration with (and support of) the research efforts being carried out by a
number of experimental groups. In addition, they propose to employ the formal
properties of a Hamiltonian with periodic potential which they have recently
obtained to develop a practical computational method (based on a reformulation
of the variable phase method in terms of the Coulomb functions) to be used in
band calculations for bulk solids and to treat impurities, surface and phonons.
