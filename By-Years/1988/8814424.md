This award will support a seminar, "Marine Bioinorganic Chemistry", organized
jointly by Prof. Kenneth L. Raymond of the University of California, Berkeley,
and Prof. Clifford Hawkins of the University of Queensland, Australia.
Participants will meet on Heron Island, Australia in June 1989 to conduct joint
field experiments and plan collaborative projects in this new field.
Bioinorganic chemistry is the study of biological processes involving metal ions
as key components. As yet, in this rapidly growing field, the bioinorganic
chemistry of the sea has not been studied, although the discipline should be of
great importance due to the concentration and transport of metal ions across
concentration gradients, from seawater to organisms. The Heron Island Marine
Research Station, the largest and best-equipped on an Australian island, is an
ideal location for a seminar intended to stimulate research in this important
field. This research could lead to new discoveries in the biology of terrestrial
and marine inver- tebrates, and possibly eventually to the development of new
therapeutic compounds for humans.
