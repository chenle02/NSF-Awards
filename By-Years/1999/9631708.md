9631708 Conrad The goal of this research planning grant is to provide the
investigator with knowledge of the operation of the High Resolution Low Energy
Electron Diffraction (HRLEED) instrument and the analysis of the diffraction
line shape to determine the long range order and defect morphology of both metal
and insulating surfaces. Preliminary study of diamond and stepped tungsten
surfaces will carried out. %%% The goal of this research planning grant is to
