Abstract 9531578 Messerschmitt The Department of Electrical Engineering at the
University of California, Berkeley is conducting an REU Site focusing on the
topic of multimedia networking. The overall goal of the research is to
demonstrate new architectural solutions for the converged information and
communication networks of the next century. Six students will be recruited for
this REU each summer with an emphasis on electrical engineering students from
underrepresented groups.
