This grant is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the
subfield of electroanalytical chemistry. Professor Fawcett will study the
fundamental steps in the deposition of metals on electrodes using a variety of
electrochemical methods together with reflection infrared absorption
spectroscopy. This research will examine the details of underpotential
deposition of metals on mercury and gold electrodes. By measuring the kinetics
and thermodynamics of these reactions using spectroelectrochemical methods the
mechanisms that describe these basic reactions will be elucidated. This
information is relevant to important technological problems in electrocatalysis
and corrosion.
