AST-0204771&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI Baron&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Supernovae have
become exceedingly interesting astrophysical objects in recent years owing to
their use as cosmological probes (standard candles visible at great distances)
to determine expansion of the universe and to measure the dark energy of the
universe, and also due to their possible association with mysterious gamma-ray
bursts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main work in this project will focus on the
comparison of observed data with theoretical models in order to clarify the
connection between specific classes of supernovae and stellar evolution models
of the progenitor star. The principle investigator will study effects such as
the metallicity dependence of the progenitor on its observed spectrum and light
curve, and extend to every type of supernovae consideration of their use as
distance indicators. Three central questions that are to be addressed concern
the progenitor systems of each type of supernova, the consistency between
stellar evolution hydrodynamical models for supernovae and observations of them,
the values of the cosmological parameters when they are calculated using the
detailed spectral models of the Spectral-fitting Expanding Atmosphere Method
applied to high redshift Type II supernovae, and finally, the statistical and
systematic uncertainties associated with these values.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
