The grant is for the PI to participate in an experiment at Fermilab in which
protons and anti protons are accelerated and allowed to collide at the highest
energy possible anywhere in the World. The reaction products of these collisions
are measured in a large detector, fabricated and operated by a collaboration of
over 250 physicists from 31 institutions from around the World. A primary goal
of the experiment is to observe fundamental particles, not seen before, such as
the top quark, and also decays of particles such as b quarks which have been
seen. The investigator also will participate in an even larger experiment at
higher energy at the Superconducting Super Collider (SSC) when it is built a few
years from now.
