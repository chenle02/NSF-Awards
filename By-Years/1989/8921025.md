The proposed work includes basic studies of nucleon and nuclear structure, and
nuclear reactions, including the study of nuclear fragmentation and the equation
of state of nuclear matter by heavy ion collisions, and studies of hadronization
and the quark gluon plasma in ultra relativistic collisions. Electronic
screening in astrophysical reactions, and the application of Monte Carlo studies
to bound state problems will also be pursued.
