AST 0307686&lt;br/&gt;PI Bjorkman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New high-resolution
observations of circumstellar environments are beginning to provide a wealth of
detail about the nature of the physical processes occurring in stellar
envelopes. These observations dramatically demonstrate that both axisymmetric
and clumpy structures are ubiquitous, occurring in a diverse range of
astrophysical systems, such as young stellar objects, outflows from highly
evolved stars, and the explosive eruptions seen, for example, in novae, and
supernovae. However to fulfill the promise of using these data to uncover the
underlying physical mechanisms governing these phenomena, adequate theoretical
techniques must be developed for investigating the transfer of radiation through
matter with complex geometries. In this research 2- and 3-dimensional Monte
Carlo simulations of the radiation transfer in these environments will be
carried out. The geometries investigated primarily are the axisymmetric, disk-
like structures produced around young stellar objects, highly evolved objects,
and rotating stellar winds. Additional studies will investigate asymmetries in
these environments, such as the clumpy winds of hot stars and spiral density
waves in circumstellar disks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact. This work
supports both a post-doctoral researcher and a graduate student, and hence
directly contributes to the training of future researchers. In addition to
graduate students, the principle investigator regularly works with
undergraduates and exchange students leading to on-going collaborations with
researchers in Brazil. To help enrich the local community, public lectures on
this research are given, as well as teacher training workshops to K-12 teachers
to help train the teachers in the practical use of hands-on activities for their
classroom. Finally, this research is developing new parallel computing
algorithms, which ultimately will benefit other researchers interested in multi-
dimensional radiation transfer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
