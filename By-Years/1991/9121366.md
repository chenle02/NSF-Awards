A central problem in developmental neuroscience is how individual neurons
acquire a constellation of idiosyncratic properties, such as their location,
shape, function and synaptic connections, that define their uniqueness. This
issue will be addressed in the nervous system of the leech embryo, a species
that offers the advantages of having relatively few, stereotyped cells that are
easily accessible to experimental manipulation. The mechanisms by which
segmentally repeated patterns of neuronal development are modulated
differentially among the 32 body segments to provide for the specialized
functions of the various body regions, such as the head, the reproductive organs
and the tail, will be studied. The hypothesis to be tested is that the segment-
specific modulation of the developmental pathway is the consequence of an
intracellular subdivision of an early embryonic precursor cell into sectors that
are differentially labeled with indicators of the future longitudinal body axis
and are parcelled out in an orderly manner to the daughter cells that found
successive body segments. Cells in the embryo will be marked by intracellular
injections and marking of the cell surface with cell lineage tracers. Molecular
cell cloning technology will also be used to identify homeotic genes in the
leech that may be involved in specifying neurons to specific body segments. The
study of the mechanisms underlying neurogenesis in this simple nervous system
promise to provide insights of general relevance to the understanding of nervous
system development in more complex organisms.
