ABSTRACT CTS-9712702 D.T. Shaw SUNY Buffalo Partial travel support will be
provided to speakers at the ultrafine particle engineering meeting to be held on
May 12-13, 1997, at NSF. The purpose of the meeting is to bring together
selected NSF grantees, and invited guests from NIST and industry to evaluate
progress made, the state-of-the-art and research needs, and promote
collaborations among researchers from universities, NIST and industry. The focus
of the meeting will be on synthesis and processing of nanoparticles, their
characterization, applications. There will be about 25 technical presentations,
with time left for discussions on research trends and opportunities for
collaborations. The presentations will be published in proceedings, that will be
made available to the scientific and engineering community at large. This
conference will increase the dissemination of NSF results, promote
collaborations and interdisciplinary synergism paticularly between academic and
industrial researchers, and continue the NSF-NIST partnership in the area of
nanoparticles and nanostructured materials.
