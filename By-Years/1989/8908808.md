The objective of the proposed research is the direct numerical simulation of
heat transfer enhancement by resonant excitation of Tollmien-Schlichting
instabilities in flows such as those encountered in air cooling of electronic
equipment. The resonant excitation will be achieved by imposing an external
excitation at a frequency equal to the most unstable flow frequency, and by
spontaneously supercritical destabilization of the flow. The proposed research
will address the issues of buoyancy and three-dimensionality which are present
in electronic cooling configurations. In order to understand and quantify the
physics of supercritical and resonant heat transfer enhancement, it is proposed
to develop an efficient hydrodynamic-heat transfer numerical code based on the
direct simulation of the unaveraged three-dimensional energy and Navier-Stokes
equations using a spectral element-Fourier method. The numerical results from
direct simulations will permit to validate and further develop heat transfer
models, since computational modeling is still a fundamental tool of analysis in
engineering practice.
