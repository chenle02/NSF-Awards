This project is supported by the Science, Technology and Society program. Its
goal is to develop a conceptual reorientation of certain aspects of the
evolution of communication. Central to that reorientation is a close study of a
type of behavior which binds humans together with non-human species; namely,
expressive behavior.

The researchers maintain that expressive behavior does more than convey
information about an animal's emotion; it also points to aspects of the animal's
environment and has the biological function of eliciting appropriate audience
responses. Creatures capable of such behavior can engage in a distinctive form
of communication, expressive communication, which has the following
characteristics. It represents a object or situation in the world, shows an
affective or cognitive state of the communicator, and elicits (via emotional
contagion or empathy) an appropriate response to that object or situation in a
suitably attuned observer. These characteristics equip it to play a key role in
the lives of social creatures, whose survival depends on success in coordinating
action. Thus, properly analyzed, expressive communication emerges as a lynchpin
of social life, both in humans and in monkeys, great apes, canids, and most
likely many cetaceans. The researchers will argue that expressive communication
also emerges as a crucial but under-theorized stage in the evolutionary path to
linguistic communication as it is found in our own species.

Research for this project will use tools from evolutionary game theory, findings
from ethology, and conceptual analyses offered by philosophers of language and
mind. The researchers will organize a series of interdisciplinary workshops
focused on themes related to expressive behavior and communication culminating
in a published volume of essays related to this topic and/or a series of
independent journal articles. The result will be an enriched understanding of
the origins of one of our own species' crowning achievements, linguistic
communication.
