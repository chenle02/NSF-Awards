This engineering education research project seeks to define and understand the
concept of critical thinking in engineering, determine differences in how
engineering students and engineering faculty view and instantiate critical
thinking, and differentiate engineering's definition from those of other
disciplines. This work explores and will clarify foundational definitions within
engineering education that are common across many degree programs.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this project,
if successful, will be to help faculty and curriculum designers in supporting
the development of critical thinking in engineering degree programs.
Additionally the research technique that will be used may help engineering
educators understand how different groups define and enact critical thinking.
This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers
by making investments that lead to emerging new fields of engineering, or
shifting existing fields. Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is
enabled by creating results and research that are useful for society by
informing educational policy and practices.
