As part of a SAVI, researchers from the U.S. and from Finland will collaborate
on investigating the relationships between engagement and learning in STEM
transmedia games. The members of U.S. Team for this project come from TERC, WGBH
and Northern Illinois University. The project involves two intensive, 5 day
workshops to identify new measurement instruments to be integrated into each
other's research and development work. The major research question is to what
degree learners in the two cultures respond similarly or differently to the STEM
learning games.
