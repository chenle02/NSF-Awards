Abstract: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a battery-powered sensor network, energy and
communication bandwidth are both limited. Moreover, processing a sensor
measurement locally often requires orders of magnitude less energy than
communicating it to a distant node, yielding an interesting
communication/computation tradeoff: whenever possible, the network should reduce
the need for global communication at the expense of increased local processing
and communication. A promising approach for reducing global communication is to
perform signal processing to extract key information inside the sensor network
in a distributed fashion, thus dramatically reducing global communication
requirements without losing fidelity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to
develop a sensor network architecture whose communications hierarchy is aligned
with the information flow of its computations. In particular, the research
involves developing (1) a multi-overlay sensor network architecture that
supports both multi-scale and proximity communication and computation; (2) new
multiscale sensor data representations based on wavelet transforms; and (3)
network services for sychronization and localization of network nodes. The
research includes analysis, simulation, and a small-scale testbed of sensor
nodes on the Rice University campus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
