The objective is the acquisition of a large-format, ultraviolet- sensitive CCD
and an appropriate set of image quality filters that will enhance and extend the
imaging and spectroscopic capabilities of the Lowell Observatory. For direct
imaging, the detector will provide a field of view sixteen times that of the
largest available detector at a 1.07-m telescope in direct imaging mode. At the
Perkins 1.8-m telescope the field size will initially be increased only
slightly, but there will be an order-of-magnitude gain in UV sensitivity;
increased coverage will be achieved when a planned focal reducer or Newtonian
focus is implemented. By virtue of its increased areal and spectral coverage,
the new CCD will allow Lowell Observatory staff and visitors to undertake
research that cannot at present be attempted. Among the scientific goals are:
studying the blue stellar content and the interstellar medium of galaxies,
determining luminosity functions and dynamical properties of open clusters in
our own Galaxy, investigating properties of the interstellar medium by means of
high-resolution spectroscopy of early-type stars, investigating the large-scale
comatic and tail structure of comets using narrowband photometry, enhancing the
discovery rate of Earth-approaching asteroids and assessing their hazard to
Earth, and searching effectively for Kuiper belt objects.
