This grant provides partial support research in the study of interactions of
protons with antiprotons at 1800 GeV energy at the Fermilab Tevatron colliding
beams accelerator complex. Interaction products will be observed in the CDF
detector operated by a large international collaboration that includes the
Purdue group. The particular activity is participation in R&amp;D directed
toward the design and construction and installation in CDF of a silicon vertex
detector with enhanced capability. Sophisticated diagnostic instruments will be
purchased to outfit a silicon-detector laboratory. The new vertex detector will
aid in identification of B-meson decay products of Top quarks, whose discovery
is the subject of intense interest.
