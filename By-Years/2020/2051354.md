This SBIR Phase II project aims to address the problem of abuse and harassment
on social network sites by creating a new ad-free, anti-abuse social network
platform. Online abuse and harassment are rampant on existing social networks
sites, and is especially severe for women, people of color, and the LGBTQ
community. However, technical and design approaches that could curb such abuse
cannot be realistically implemented in advertisement-based business models, as
such anti-abuse approaches often limit advertisement impressions. The new social
platform has innovative anti-abuse technologies and a novel business model with
no advertisements. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this SBIR Phase II project, the
innovation uses novel deep learning techniques to provide a new and innovative
hybrid human-machine moderation system. This moderation system is able to learn
from moderation decisions and is grounded in the values of the online community.
In addition, the innovation uses applied theoretical concepts of consent to
provide groundbreaking design in how content is displayed and standards for how
users interact. The goal and scope of this research is to improve upon the
algorithmic efficiency, develop more moderation models, refine the moderation
API, develop user-driven retraining of the models, conduct co-design with target
end users, and develop the front-end of the product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
