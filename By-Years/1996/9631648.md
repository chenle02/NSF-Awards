9631648 Gottlieb This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project
addresses The need for stable sensors suitable for long term measurement of
dissolved oxygen in seawater. Measurement of the dissolved oxygen in seawater is
critical to understanding mixing processes and oceanic circulation as well as
for the description of water masses. At present there are no stable sensors
suitable for long-term monitoring of dissolved oxygen. A need exists for stable
long term sensors and the development of a reagentless optical oxygen sensor.
Commercial potential includes industrial applications such as monitoring boiler
water and bioreactors, automobile emissions testing, and environmental
applications such as monitoring waste water.
