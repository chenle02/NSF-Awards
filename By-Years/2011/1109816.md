This project thoroughly maps the spatial distribution of cold atomic hydrogen
gas (H I) in the molecular clouds in the interstellar medium of our Galaxy. The
formation of cold clouds from the warm ambient interstellar medium is thought to
be a vital step to make molecular clouds, without which star formation would not
occur. The PI has developed a method to extract detailed structure data of cold
HI clouds from existing high-resolution H I surveys using 21cm-line H I self-
absorption (HISA) 3-D shadows. The work provides a census of all cold atomic
clouds in the Galaxy that are detectable as HISA shadow clouds, and investigate
cloud spatial and velocity distribution, relationship to spiral structure,
statistical association with CO emission clouds, and other physical properties
(such as H2 molecule formation) in cold, quiescent regions that are
traditionally difficult to observe. In order to test competing theories of cloud
evolution, star formation, and Galactic structure. The observations are compared
to numerical simulations of HISA on scales ranging from small interstellar
clouds to whole spiral arms, as the HISA observations probe cloud evolution and
large-scale Galactic structure. The extracted HISA data cubes, maps, cloud
catalogs, and the analysis tools will be made available to the public at the end
of the project.
