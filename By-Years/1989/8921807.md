This award supports an investigation of the insect fossils, plant macrofossils
and pollen of known accumulations of organic sediment of the North Central
Alaska Range, addressing their paleoenvironmental and stratigraphic
significance. The mid-Wisconsin, Boutellier interval is an important time during
the late Pleistocene in eastern Beringia. Organic-rich sediments that date to
this interval are ubiquitous throughout unglaciated Alaska and the Yukon
Territory. The widespread occurrence of these deposits suggests regional
climatic amelioration and associated changes in biological communities. This
investigation will document these changes by developing a high-resolution record
of paleoenvironmental change through close-interval sampling and detailed
lithostratigraphic analysis of known deposits of Boutellier age. These
paleoecological studies will fill a regional gap in previous Boutellier
paleoenvironmental investigations in southwestern Alaska and the Alaskan
interior/Yukon regions. This data will contribute significantly to an
understanding of the role of Beringian paleoclimates in global climatic events.
