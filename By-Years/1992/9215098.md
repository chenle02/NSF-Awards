This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at Wesleyan University acquire a Pulsed Beam Fourier
Transform Microwave Spectrometer. The spectrometer will be used in the following
areas of research: 1. Rare Gas Dihalides 2. Complexes With NF3 and PF3 3. Free
Radicals and Free Radical Complexes 4. Very Low Torsional Barriers 5. Structures
of Dimer Complexes Containing NO 6. Structure of the Trimer Complex CO-H20-H20
7. Hydrogen Bonding With Ammonia Derivatives %%% Microwave spectroscopy is a
technique which measures pure rotational transitions in a moleculer that are
induced by radiation in the far infrared and microwave regions of the
electromagnetic spectrum. This technique requires that the material be in the
gaseous state and have a permanent dipole moment in the ground state. Useful
data, such as bond distance, bond angle and dipole moment are obtained from
microwave studies.
