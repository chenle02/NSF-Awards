This is an investigation of the structure, phylogeny, mode of activity, and
inactivation of transposable retroelements in the ancient asexual Class
Bdelloidea of the Phylum Rotifera. Bdelloid rotifers are small invertebrate
animals of worldwide distribution represented by approximately 360 described
species and found mainly in freshwater and moist terrestrial habitats. Their
importance stems from the fact that they are the only animal group for which
there is extensive morphological, cytogenetic, and molecular evidence for long-
term evolution without meiosis or sexual reproduction. Bdelloid rotifers
therefore provide an experimental system for investigation of the factors
responsible for the early extinction suffered by nearly all asexual populations
and for the ubiquity of meiosis and sex.&lt;br/&gt;A striking and fundamental
difference between bdelloid rotifers and all sexually-reproducing eukaryotes
that have been investigated is that bdelloids lack transposable genetic elements
of the major retrotransposon superfamilies. Such lack is consistent with the
theoretically-based prediction that these elements can be stably harbored in
sexually-reproducing species but that in asexuals such elements will eventually
either drive the host lineage to extinction or else be inactivated or lost.
Thus, a major factor responsible for the nearly universal prevalence of sexual
reproduction in eukaryotes may be the elimination, caused by deleterious
retrotransposons, of newly arising asexual lines. The investigator therefore
seeks to test the implication that deleterious retrotransposons were lost or
inactivated early in bdelloid evolution and that if any active retroelements are
present, they are not significantly deleterious.&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the
research will (i) characterize the structure, phylogeny, and activity status of
the highly unusual Penelope-like retroelement present in bdelloid genomes; (ii)
develop gonadal microinjection and microparticle bombardment methods applicable
to bdelloid and monogonont rotifers; and (iii) employ such methods to introduce
active LINE-like retroelements into bdelloid and monogonont genomes in order to
test for the existence of mechanisms specific to bdelloids that inactivate
retrotransposons.&lt;br/&gt;This project should help reveal why sexual
reproduction and meiosis are found in virtually all plants and animals. It will
also deepen our understanding of the evolution of this basic biological
phenomenon.&lt;br/&gt;
