This project builds on two years of investigation concerned with creation of
laboratory learning environments for undergraduate engineering education. The
general theme is how to improve undergraduate engineering laboratory education
by creating visually-oriented learning environments that combine computer-based
intelligent tutoring systems, interactive visualization systems and laboratory
instrumentation. The hypothesized pedagogical gain is the enhanced understanding
that students should receive from interactive computer visualization of
theoretical concepts that are directly linked to the same information provided
by laboratory instrumentation. The principal practical benefit of the project is
the creation of builder tools that permit instructors to rapidly construct new
laboratory curricula in significantly reduced time on commonly available
computer hardware. First, the capabilities of the current tutoring systems will
be expanded by combining concept visualization and intelligent tutorial systems
with laboratory instrumentation. Second, curriculum building tools, student
modeling methodologies, and seamless integration of common PC/MAC tools into the
systems will be explored. Third, specific laboratories will be implemented and
tested to demonstrate the utility of the tools constructed. Fourth, electronic
dissemination of the tutorials will be implemented. The long-term objective of
this proposed project is to integrate new software methods, laboratory
instrumentation, and intelligent tutoring system concepts to create new learning
environments for undergraduate engineering laboratories.
