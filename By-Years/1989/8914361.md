Antarctica has been a site of human activity for many years. With an increasing
emphasis on environmental health and safety issues, the United States Antarctic
Program is supporting research activity in these areas. This grant will
investigate the sewage effluent plume and the persistence of bacteria associated
with human wastes from McMurdo Station. Both chemical and biological indicators
will be used to determine the sewage plume characteristics. The persistence of
the bacteria will be investigated both in the field and laboratory experiments.
The information obtained from this investigation will provide baseline data as a
basis for assessing the impact of McMurdo Station's sewage effluent on the
environment, and to determine whether further microbiological studies are
necessary.
