In the study of geometry, one often gains insight into the nature of a
particular geometric object by studying all such objects simultaneously. For
instance, one might find the optimal configuration of robots in a factory by
studying the "space" of all such configurations of robots, as the geometry of
the latter can lend insight as to which particular configurations are
problematic in a given situation (such as when robotic arms might jam or
interfere with each other). Such "spaces" of geometric structures are called
moduli spaces. The investigator's project is dedicated to a study of moduli
spaces of surfaces, a key feature of the work being the interaction of geometry
and algebra in the study of moduli. Some of this work will be conducted with the
assistance of graduate students. The investigator will develop a graduate topics
course in moduli spaces to stimulate interaction between students working in
geometry and topology and those working in algebra. The investigator will also
run biennial workshops designed to foster the upward professional development of
graduate and undergraduate students working in fields related to moduli as well
as to stimulate interaction across barriers between these
disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator will study the moduli of
Riemann surfaces. The proposed research naturally falls into three projects. The
first is concerned with profinite aspects of mapping class groups of surfaces.
In particular, the investigator will further develop profinite Teichmueller
theory as initiated by Boggi, and will also pursue a study of centralizers in
profinite completions of mapping class groups. The second project concerns the
geometry of surface bundles and their relation to topology and algebra. In
particular, the investigator will study distinctions between a number of
geometric properties of subgroups of mapping class groups in analogy with more
classical work in Kleinian groups, and will also continue a search for atoroidal
surfaces bundles over surfaces. The third portion of the proposed work is
dedicated to a study of the deformation theory of hyperbolic 3-manifolds. In
particular, the investigator will continue study of certain analytic functions
between Teichmuller spaces introduced by Thurston in his approach to his
Geometrization conjecture, which come to bear on problems related to making
Geometrization effective, as well as toward understanding certain pathology in
the study of general deformation spaces of 3-manifolds.
