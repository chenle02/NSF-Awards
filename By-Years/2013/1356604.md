The Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Texas Tech University, Midland
College, Odessa College, and Mesalands Community College (Tucumcari, NM) are
establishing the South Plains Mathematics Fellows program, in which academically
talented students from underrepresented, low-income families receive
scholarships for undergraduate study leading to a degree in mathematics. Over
the five-year life of the program, 52 students will each receive scholarships of
up to $10,000 per year. Intense mentoring, focused coursework, and participation
in research opportunities are preparing the scholars for successful careers
and/or smooth transitions to graduate school. The program is being advertised
through websites and in regional high schools, with focused efforts to reach
underrepresented student populations. Intellectual merits of the program lie in
the comprehensive nature of the program that is supported with an effective
recruitement network. Retention strategies include a carefully mentored and
cohesive cohort, with new courses and projects to enrich the learning
experiences of the students. Mentoring practices are being studied and
publishable results should be beneficial to other institutions seeking
successful retention of underrepresented rural students. &lt;br/&gt;Participants
get a sense of the work of research mathematics, while students outside the
program benefit from new courses. Integration with regional partners is
developing a new pipeline for math students. The broader impacts are significant
regionally in providing exposure to STEM education to economically disadvantaged
groups and in geographically isolated regions with higher populations of
Hispanics and first generation college students.
