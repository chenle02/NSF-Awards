The Canada Basin of the Arctic Ocean remains one of the least known regions of
the earth, yet understanding it's evolution is important to understanding the
history of ocean circulation, climate generation, as well as the fact that the
Alaska margin of the Canada Basin contains one of the world's giant hydrocarbon
fields. In order to complete the aerogeophysical coverage of the Canada Basin
between the Alpha and Mendeleyev ridges and the Arctic Alaska/Canada and Far
Eastern Siberia margins, two seasons of aerogeophysics are proposed. The three
most important aspects of the proposed work are: 1) Collect reconnaissance
aerogeophysical data that will allow specific hypotheses to be formulated about
the tectonic evolution of the Canada Basin of the Arctic. 2) Combine the
aerogeophysical data collected offshore with a high-resolution aeromagnetics
survey of Arctic Alaska's continental shelf. Work with these two datasets should
definitely answer the question of the nature of the Ocean-Continent Boundary
along Arctic Alaska. 3) Survey in detail gravity over the Chukchi Plateau and
onto the continental margin of what should be the buried North Chukchi Basin to
allow insight into the evolution of this margin. Present data does not allow
reasonable interpretation of the evolution of this margin.
