This research is concerned with a variety of problems in the representation
theory of infinite dimensional Lie algebras. The principal investigator will
work on modular invariant representations, exceptional hierarchies of soliton
equations, reciprocity laws and infinite-dimensional groups, classification of
graded simple Lie super-algebras of growth 1, and quantum groups. Many different
algebraic objects can be represented as algebraic sets of transformations of
other algebraic objects. Through these representations their structure can be
determined. This project is concerned with the representation theory of infinite
dimensional Lie algebras. The study of these algebras has applications
throughout mathematics and mathematical physics.
