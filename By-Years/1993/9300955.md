The objective of the proposed study is to critically examine and analyze
architectural, foundation, and structural damage to ancient historic monuments
and related ground failure in Cairo, Egypt, caused by the moderate earthquake in
northern Egypt that occurred on October 12, 1992. This examination and the
subsequent report is expected to benefit not only the engineering design and
evaluation of structures, but also the ongoing NSF study, "Preserving Historic
Buildings of Major Importance."***//
