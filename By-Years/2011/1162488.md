/O on High-End Computing (HEC) machines is increasingly becoming the killing
performance bottleneck. However, conventional execution paradigms for HEC are
computing-centric and have inherent limitations in addressing critical I/O
issues of data-intensive applications. There is a great need for developing
unconventional execution paradigms to meet the growing I/O demand of high-end
computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, the PIs propose a decoupled
execution paradigm (DEP) to address I/O bottleneck issues. DEP is the first
paradigm enabling users to identify and handle data-intensive operations
separately. The objective of the proposed research is three-fold: 1)
understanding the execution paradigm requirement from the data-centric point of
view, 2) studying the feasibility of the proposed decoupled execution paradigm,
and 3) providing a partially implemented prototyping of DEP and its associated
system design to support the first two objectives. Several technical hurdles
have been identified, which include system architecture, programming model, and
runtime system. Solutions are proposed and detailed plans are provided to
evaluate the newly proposed decoupled execution paradigm.
