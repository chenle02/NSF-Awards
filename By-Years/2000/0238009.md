The goal of this research and education plan is to broaden the participation of
historically underserved groups in the information society by identifying
cultural patterns, social networks and other socio-cultural factors that
structure information technology access and use. The research approach will
involve long-term partnerships and continuous interaction with the Belmont
community in West Philadelphia, and will merge scholarship with ongoing programs
in the community. Through reciprocal learning and sharing of expertise,
researchers, university students, and community leaders will work together to
identify the particular problems to be addressed, to define researchable
questions, and to conduct research projects. Research findings and emergent
theory will then be translated into culturally based, theory driven
interventions aimed at increasing the technology capacity and sustainability of
the community based organizations to better serve their clientele. The research
results will also make broader scholarly contributions through the extension of
midrange theory that explains the socio-cultural influences, differential
impacts, and responses to information technology. In addition, the results will
make practical contributions through the development of interventions such as
educational opportunities and curricular resources, and recommendations for
public policy and future research.
