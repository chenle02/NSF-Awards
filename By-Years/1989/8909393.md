This Research Initiation Award is to develop a numerical method for analyzing
wave propagation problems. A propagating wave is first discretized in space and
time. The details of the propagation of this wave through its medium is then
simulated by applying an appropriate sequence of digital filters to the
discretized wave. It is hypothesized that the filter simulation can model wave
propagation more accurately then standard finite difference or model techniques.
