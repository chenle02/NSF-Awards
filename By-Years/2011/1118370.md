This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) supports the National Academy of
Sciences (Ana M. Ferreras, Principal Investigator) to sponsor 15 young American
crystallographers to attend the XXII Congress of the International Union of
Crystallography. Crystallographers from around the world will be meeting at this
Congress. Conferences like this give young scientists the opportunities to
network, develop new collaborations, and share the latest research results in
their field. The NAS will evaluate the impact of the award through a follow-up
survey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Young scientists need mentoring as they develop
their independent careers. The opportunity provided through this award will
allow 15 young crystallographers to interact with international leaders in their
field. Crystallography is the study of the structure of molecules and materials.
It is an important sub-discipline in chemistry, which provides scientists clues
about aspects of molecular bonding that influence chemical and physical
properties.
