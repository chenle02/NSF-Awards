The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award
is to develop methods for the modeling and optimization of smart mobility
services. Bike sharing programs, smart parking systems, and person-2-person car
sharing are the focus of the research program. The research will contribute to
the analysis of spatial nonstationary queueing networks. The research program
includes empirical analysis, analytic modeling, and simulation studies of the
aforementioned smart mobility services. The tangible products of this research
includes software and algorithms for the management of these smart mobility
services, documentation of research results, evaluation of pilot programs,
issues of an operations research graphic novel, and the development of
educational materials on smart mobility services.&lt;br/&gt;The results of this
research will encourage the further development and deployment of smart mobility
services. These services are accessible and energy efficient transportation
modes. Accessibility to transportation is a key employment, economic, and help
indicator, particularly in low income and minority communities. The wide
adoption of smart mobility services contributes to the U.S. policy goal of
dramatically reducing the amount of greenhouse gases that are generated by the
transportation sector. The investigator has partnerships with several
organizations to apply the research findings directly to the development of bike
sharing in Paris, smart parking in Pittsburgh, PA, and person-2-person car
sharing in Chicago. Furthermore, the research and education plan supports the
increased participation of African Americans in the mathematical sciences
through involvement in the Conference for African American Researchers in the
Mathematical Sciences (CAARMS). Additionally, the investigator writes a graphic
novel that introduces public audiences to operations research. The award
supports an expansion of this effort.
