This award is for the purchase of a Microcomputer Based Image Processing and
Geographic Information System by the Department of Civil and Environmental
Engineering, New Jersey Institute of Technology. This system will be used in
research as well as in teaching. It will upgrade the present system by which
interpretation of aerial and satellite is now done visually, and improve ongoing
and future research on analysis of natural resources and land evaluation. The
capabilities of professional staff and students will also benefit by having
available this digital image processing instrumentation.
