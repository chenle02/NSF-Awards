This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I research project involves the
development of inexpensive, reconfigurable force-reflective telerobotic
manipulators. Incorporating dexterous manipulators onto available mobile robotic
platforms greatly expands the capabilities and usefulness of the systems,
providing telerobotic operators the ability to safely touch, feel, and interact
with objects in remote, unknown, and possibly hazardous environments. Currently
available mobile robots and remote manipulation systems do not have the
dexterity and portability needed for many of these situations, nor the cost
effectiveness to be affordable by target users. These systems can break down
doors but cannot open them. They can pick up and transport objects, but cannot
easily open a door, trunk, or hood of a car. The proposed system will be a high
fidelity dexterous system that can perform these tasks. This proposal is a
unique application of existing technology with proposed innovations for improved
intersystem stiffness and force-reflection bandwidth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
development of the proposed technology will also promote faster deployment into
the field and enable applications supporting a broader spectrum of tasks,
providing telerobotic operators, from a safe distance, the ability to more
transparently sense and accurately control the interactive forces that are
experienced at the point of manipulation during the execution of a task.
Commercial potential for this technology lies in manufacturing and industrial
robotics, defusing and examining improvised explosive devices or bombs,
performing medical triage from a remote location, and tactile examination and
manipulation of dangerous or hazardous materials in remote environments for
military, homeland security and industrial
applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American
