This project involves the extension of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to
situations involving stochastic inputs. DEA is a techniques for combining
variables which differ in their scale properties in order to produce decision
functions. DEA has been applied to a wide range of processes including
manufacturing productivity, audit of managerial performance, choice and location
of unique facilities, hospital efficiency, branch bank management, financial
management, and marketing/sales efficiency. The stochastic extensions of DEA are
computationally intensive and computer software will be developed and tested to
enable practical application of the procedures.
