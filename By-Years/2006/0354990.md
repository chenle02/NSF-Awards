Rapid advances in observational cosmology have revealed a universe that provides
for some of our most speculative ideas about the early cosmos, while raising
entirely new questions about its late-time evolution.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Precision measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background
radiation (CMB) and type I a supernovae light curves demonstrate the universe to
be spatially flat with the majority of its matter being dark and the majority of
it energy dark energy with a strongly negative pressure, resulting in an
accelerating universe today. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A major component of this
proposal concerns the embryonic idea that cosmic acceleration may signal new
gravitational physics. The PI and collaborators have proposed a new modification
to the Einstein-Hilbert action that results in late time cosmic acceleration
without dark energy. Carrying out the exploration of a wider class of
gravitational origins for cosmic acceleration is a major research avenue of the
current proposal. &lt;br/&gt;
