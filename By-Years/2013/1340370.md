The proposed project seeks financial support for the participation of student,
underrepresented groups and young researchers in a conference to be held at the
Gaylord Hotel Convention Center, National Harbor, MD, from August 25 to 30,
2013.. The International Conference on Nitride Semiconductors ICNS10 will
address research areas in Wide bandgap group-III nitrides. This annual meeting
offers an important forum to review and identify all aspects of energy
efficiency electronics, infrared and solid state lighting. The topics are
divided into twelve sections and the committee has assembled a group of invited
speakers, experts in the field, for each section: Bulk and Template Growth,
Epitaxial Growth and Structural Properties, Nanostructures and Novel Nitride
Alloys, Light Emitting Diodes and Improving Efficiency, Lasing and Laser Diodes,
Power and High Frequency Devices, Optical and Magnetic Properties, Solar Cells
and Energy Harvesting, Device Fabrication and Reliability, InN and Related
Materials, Theory and Modeling of Materials and Devices, Sensors and
Photodetectors.
