9522730 Rashid This project is to study the formation of new free surfaces in
solid continua. Examples of such surfaces occur in fracture and fatigue, in
material removal processes in manufacturing and in tearing of thin sheets. A new
theoretical construct is proposed for study which seeks to overcome a weakness
in classical fracture mechanics. An "exclusion region" is proposed inside which
no conventional material response model applies. The conditions for the
advancement of the separation front is flexible in form and ideas on behavior at
the microscopic level attending rupture are naturally represented. ***
