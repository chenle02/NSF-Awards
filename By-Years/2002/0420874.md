With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at Florida International University will purchase an
inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS). This equipment will
enhance research in a number of areas including 1) optimization of analysis
protocols for materials such as glass and polymer surfaces; 2) applications of
ICP-MS in the areas of trace elements and organometallics in biological and
environmental systems; 3) characterization of sulfur sources in ore-forming
systems; 4) in-situ measurement of uranium and lead in metamorphic and igneous
zircons; and 5) measurement of major and trace element concentrations in
minerals and natural glasses in igeous rocks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mass
spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to probe intimate structural details and
to obtain the molecular compositions of a vast array of organic, bioorganic, and
organometallic molecules. This instrument will be used in advanced biochemistry
and instrumental undergraduate courses as well as undergraduate, graduate and
post-doctoral research. In addition, these studies will have a significant
impact in the earth sciences. &lt;br/&gt;
