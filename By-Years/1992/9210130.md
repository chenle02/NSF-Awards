ABSTRACT The Cariban languages spoken in northern Brazil are among the least
documented in the world, and many are in danger of extinction. This project will
collect documentary recordings of as many northern Brazilian Cariban languages
as possible and begin the process of transcribing word lists and grammatical
information from these recordings. The project will also provide support for the
Brazilian Cariban linguistics students to do intensive field work in three
different northern Brazilian Cariban language communities. The linguists will
use traditional field techniques, including recording, transcribing, and
translating word lists and tests; syntactic analysis will be via elicitation and
analysis of transcribed texts. For these three languages, the project will
produce analyses of phonology, morphology, basic syntax, and papers on
theoretically or typologically relevant issues. With these new data, the co-PI
will work towards a more reliable classification of the Cariban family and
reconstruction of Proto Cariban lexicon and morphosyntax. This project is a
collaborative effort, designed to help train new Brazilian linguists in basic
linguistic description and historical/typological/functional approaches to
linguistics. It will also be responsive to the needs of Cariban language
communities, offering help in preserving their unique languages and cultures.//
