In the petals of carnation flowers, the phytohormone ethylene is involved in
the initiation and regulation of petal senescence. Here Dr. Woodson aims to
investigate the molecular mechanisms involved in petal senescence, and determine
how ethylene acts to initiate this developmental program. His approach to the
problem is to clone genes that are expressed during carnation petal senescence
and study how the expression of these genes is regulated both during the
temporal development of senescence and by ethylene. He will use these cloned
cDNAs as hybridization probes to determine the relative abundance of the mRNAs
they represent during the senescence of petals and in response to ethylene
treatment. He will determine the spatial distribution of these senescence
specific mRNAs by in situ hybridization. Transcriptional regulation of
senescence specific genes will be assessed by nuclear run off experiments. He
will correlate senescence specific genes to gene products by in vitro
translation of hybrid selected mRNAs. Expression of antisense RNA will be used
to determine if these genes are essential for senescence. Selected cDNAs will be
used to isolate genomic cones for analysis of the cis elements which determine
the expression of these genes. Gene chimeras will be constructed that contain
the 5' flanking sequences of these genes and the coding sequence for the
reporter gene beta-glucuronidase (GUS). Following transformation of carnations
and petunias, the capacity for the promoters from senescence specific genes to
direct the developmental and/or hormonal regulation of gene expression will be
assessed by assaying for GUS activity. %%% Senescence represents the final stage
in the development of a whole plant, organ tissue or cell. The flower is often
the organ with the shortest life span, and as such provides a useful tissue for
studying the mechanisms underlying control of senescence.
