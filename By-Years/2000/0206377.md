The University of California, Berkeley is developing "Windows on Research," a
two-year experimental exhibit project at the Lawrence Hall of Science focused on
engaging and informing the public about current scientific research. The project
will develop and evaluate different media to translate the leading edge of
nanotechnology research for the science center audience by featuring live
demonstrations and presentations, physical- and technology-based exhibits, and
Internet-based exhibits. Formative evaluation of all products, including ongoing
public focus groups and surveys, will be used to establish which of the several
media, alone or combined, work best to communicate research content. The project
team also is developing new assessment tools to test usability and effectiveness
of the artificial intelligence and technology-based components in conveying
content. The results of this prototype effort to present ongoing research in a
museum setting will be disseminated to the informal science education
field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI, Marco Molinaro, and the team from the
Lawrence Hall of Science will work closely with scientists representing research
in a number of nanotechnology fields. These scientists bring expertise in the
areas of materials science, chemistry, education, bioengineering, mechanical
engineering, molecular and cell biology, geochronology and isotope geochemistry,
and psychology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
