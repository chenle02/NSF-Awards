The creation of Bose-Einstein condensates of hydrogen and the development of new
techniques for the spectroscopy of ultracold hydrogen have opened new
opportunities for basic studies in atomic physics. A new determination of the
Lamb Shift in hydrogen and Rydberg Constant of hydrogen will be carried out,
based on two-photon Doppler-free spectroscopy of the transition 2S-10n, where n
is in the range of 10-12. Such a measurement, combined with new studies to
determine the proton radius, could help resolve questions about possible
limitations to QED. Related studies include determinations of scattering lengths
for excited and ground state cold collisions in hydrogen, and photoassociation
spectroscopy. On the broader impact, the ultra-precise optical frequency
measurements proposed for hydrogen are loosely associated with the group's
investigations of hydrogen for a new type of optical frequency standard, which
has the potential of providing several orders of magnitude improvement in the
performance of atomic clocks.
