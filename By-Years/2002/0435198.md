In this project the Mathematical Association of America (MAA) is building on the
foundation of the current Mathematical Sciences Digital Library (MathDL) and
assuming stewardship for significant mathematical content and services of
particular importance to accessing and using educational resources for the
mathematical sciences. Through the Math Gateway learners of mathematics gain
access to the rich content in sites partnering with the MAA, and representing
some of the earliest and most important projects within the NSDL program.
Supporting services are also available through the Gateway for end users,
content developers, and the participating organizations. In making available to
the general user of mathematics the rich array of digital library collections
and services now on the Web and encouraging the development of new materials and
services, this project is advancing two central goals of NSDL. The project is
also expanding the features of MathDL that are of particular importance to the
members of the Association, thus anticipating a potential strategy for
sustainability. These features include MAA Reviews, an online continuation of
the current Telegraphic Reviews appearing in the American Mathematical Monthly,
and online access to the best of one hundred eleven years of Classroom Capsules.
