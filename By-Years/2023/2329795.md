The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation -
Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project consists of steps towards a more
effective and robust supply chain for our economy. Recent years have highlighted
the critical importance of the material handling industry to our national
economy: a snarled supply chain reverberates everywhere in society. The number
one challenge in this industry is that the difficult ergonomics and repetitive
nature make many tasks injury-prone and unsuitable for workers. Nevertheless,
automation has alleviated this problem only to a small degree: robotics has
achieved only small market penetration in material handling, and one of the key
reasons is the absence of critical technology pertaining to versatile and
dexterous robotic material handling. Currently, flexible robotic manipulators
able to handle dexterous tasks are largely lacking from the field. Developing
such manipulators would both enhance our scientific understanding of motor
control tasks and motor learning and have an immediate impact in increasing
supply chain efficiency.

The proposed project aims to develop and translate such technology to the
marketplace. We build on recent work from the principal investigatorâ€™s team,
which demonstrated complex robotic manipulation tasks, such as large in-hand
object reorientation with finger gaiting, while simultaneously securing the
manipulated object. This result was achieved by combining novel exploration
methods for deep reinforcement learning of motor skills with the optics-based
tactile fingers previously developed by the PFI team. The project aims to
further develop learning-based methods for extrinsic manipulation, where the
robot uses external surfaces to impart the desired movement, a strategy that
will help reduce the kinematic requirements on the hand itself. This will in
turn enable hands to be mounted on commercial robot arms, resulting in a
complete automation station. While the previous work informing the PFI project
relied exclusively on tactile and proprioceptive sensing to demonstrate
dexterity, deployment for complete tasks requires the addition of vision
sensors, and thus methods for learning multimodal, visuotactile control policies
for dexterous extrinsic manipulation. The PFI team will apply this research to
the concrete task of automating the sortation system induction process with
dexterous package re-orientation, a commonly found task in the distribution
centers that are the backbone of our supply chain.
