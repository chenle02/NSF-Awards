9632287 Dunbar This project will analyze oxygen and carbon stable isotopes and
trace elements (U, Ba) in corals from the Kenyan coast over the last few
centuries. The data will provide a long-term continous record of decade- to
century-scale variability in SST and river runoff (=rainfall) for a poorly-known
tropical region, and will contribute to understanding linkages between regional
monsoon variations and larger-scale features such as ENSO.
