This research deals with the generic problem of load modeling and model
validation. The theoretical effort includes investigation into the use of the
Hankel matrix of the autocorrelation function as a tool for constructing a
stochastic load model from system operational data. Load control algorithms are
to be generated by stochastic dynamic programming techniques. Experimental
verification techniques are proposed using the DOE Athens project as a data
source.
