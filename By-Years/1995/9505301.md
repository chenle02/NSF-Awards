9505301 Randolph This project is on research to better understand the mechanisms
for polymer-induced protein stabilization in solution during freezing and
drying. The research will focus on the thermodynamics and molecular interactions
of polymeric additives with proteins in aqueous solutions, frozen solutions, and
dried solids, and how these interactions dictate protein stability. In
particular this includes: (1) solution thermodynamics which involves phase
behavior and protein/polymer preferential interactions; and (2) experimental
measurements which include differential scanning calorimetry, electron
paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR) and resolution-enhanced Fourier
transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). This will be used to determine why
polymers work and why they fail as protein stabilizers. ***
