The performance and efficiency of a chemical reactor with respect of conversion
and selectivity depend on the intrinsic kinetics of the various chemical
reactions, and on physical rate processes such as intraphase mass and heat
transfer. The effects of these chemical and physical rate processes in turn
depend upon the non-ideal flow behavior of the various phases in the reactor.
Many gas-liquid reactions of industrial importance are carried out in bubble
column reactors including chlorination of organic compounds, ammination of fatty
acids, oxidation of molecular pollution abatement. Such reactors are simple and
inexpensive to operate, do not have any moving parts, and it is easy to vary
liquid residence time. Bubble columns are difficult to design because their
complex flow characteristics combined with the reaction kinetics result in a
system whose behavior can not be predicted a priori based on data from another
column of, for example, different size, flow regime, or gas holdup. One factor
that contributes to this problem is gas phase backmixing which results from
partial recycling of the gas phase which is in turn reflected in the residence
time distribution of the gas phase. In this work the PI will attempt to propose
and experimentally verify a new correlation to compute gas phase backmixing in
bubble column reactors. He plans to use a mass spectrometer to measure gas phase
dispersion in two separate columns of different diameters. Two reactions will be
run in each column which represent typical reacting systems carried out in
bubble column: (1) cobalt-catalyzed oxidation of sodium sulfite solutions by air
and (2) absorption of CO2 (diluted with air) in alkaline buffer solution. The
gas dispersion data will be utilized to create a comprehensive model
incorporating the effect of physical properties of the liquid, the diameter of
the column, and the superficial gas and liquid velocities in an equation for gas
phase mixing in bubble columns.
