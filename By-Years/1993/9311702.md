9311702 Weide Zweben Ogden This research addresses the technical problems
impeding the development of software systems as assemblages of off-the- shelf
reusable components. Substantial progress has been made in defining component
engineering principles and in developing a collection of interoperable
components. Each component is designed for maximal reusability and, before
inclusion in a component library, is subjected to quality control procedures by
which it is certified to have certain properties: correctness with respect to a
formal specification, freedom from storage leaks, an essential level of
efficiency, etc. The purpose of a component's certification is to give
prospective clients critical assurance that the component is truly suitable for
reuse. The primary goals of the work are to: * Identify specific properties for
which local certifiability is essential or advantageous to the process of
obtaining high-quality software systems from high-quality components. *
Determine and state precisely those characteristics that a client program and
the other components it employs must possess, in order that locally certified
components can be guaranteed to behave as advertised in that client's context. *
Investigate specific techniques for the local certification of various important
properties of software. ***
