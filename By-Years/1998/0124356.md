ABSTRACT

INTEGRATION OF CHRONOSTRATIGRAPHIC DATABASES FOR THE 21ST CENTURY

James G. Ogg and Paul J. Sikora EAR-0124356

This 3-day workshop will assemble quantitative stratigraphers and database
specialists from diverse research teams. The goals are to coordinate database
standards and compatibility; design strategies and tools for information
retrieval and analysis of all types of global and regional stratigraphic data;
and to discuss future directions for database integration and centralization of
currently distributed depositories. The workshop will (1) propose standards for
stratigraphic data storage, formatting, retrieval and conversions, (2) identify
key needs for data acquisition, accessibility and manipulation tools, and (3)
recommend a development strategy for the necessary integration of infrastructure
for present and future growth of a distributed stratigraphic database system
