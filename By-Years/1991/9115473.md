This is a grant made under the USA/USSR program for Cooperation in Basic
Scientific Research to further cooperation between Drs. Hemmeter, Lazebnik and
Woldar of the University of Delaware and Dr. V. Ustimenko of the University of
Kiev. The principal investigators will study association schemes and Tits
geometries. In particular, they hope to apply these ideas to extremal graph
theory. The research is in the general area of combinatorics. Combinatorics
attempts to find efficient methods to study how discrete collections of objects
can be organized. It is extremely important to modern communications, for
example the design of large networks as in telephone systems and the design of
algorithms in computer science.
