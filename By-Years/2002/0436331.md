The goal of the Third Workshop on Hot Topics in Networks (HotNets-III), being
held in San Diego, California on 15-16 October 2004, is to bring together
researchers in the networking and distributed systems community to debate
emerging research directions. This workshop promotes community-wide discussion
of ideas that are not yet mature, with the expectations that (1) this will
influence and foster ongoing research in the community, and (2) many of the
HotNets position papers will grow into papers accepted at SIGCOMM or other
quality conferences. This grant provides funding to assist 10 US-based graduate
students in attending this meeting. Participation in workshops like this is an
extremely important part of the graduate school experience, providing the
opportunity to interact with more senior researchers and to be exposed to
leading edge work in the field. The support provided enables the participation
of students who would otherwise be unable to attend HotNets-III.&lt;br/&gt;
