The RUI grant provides partial funding needed to purchase a Fourier Transform
Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR) for the Department of Chemistry and Physics at
Augusta College, Augusta, GA. The FTIR is urgently needed to initiate a teaching
and research program to meet the technological training demands of undergraduate
scientists. The research program to be initiated deals with the potential
development of FT emission into an on-line, noninvasive technique for polymer
analysis and the preparation, purification, and analysis of organogermanes for
kinetics studies. Undergraduates will be highly involved in the research.
