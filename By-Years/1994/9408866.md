9408866 Haan The project involves investigations into 1) photoionization and
photorecombination processes in atomic systems, 2) strong field interactions
using model potentials and 3) numerical calculations of photoionization of two
electron systems. Density matrix formulations will enable open systems to be
investigated where these processes might interfere and the use of a time
dependent evolution of the wavefunction enables a clear visualization of the
breakup process in strong fields. ***
