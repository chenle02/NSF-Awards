ABSTRACT AST-9601507 T. L. Hayward A dual camera system is to be developed for
the Hale 200 inch telescope at Palomar Observatory. The first camera will be
used with an adaptive optics (AO) system currently being built for Palomar by
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The AO system will correct the effects of
astronomical seeing to achieve an angular resolution near the telescope's
diffraction limit of 0.1 arcsecond at a wavelength of 2.2 micrometers. The
second camera will provide a complementary wide-field (4 arcminute) imaging
capability. Both cameras will be built using 1024 x 1024 pixel HgCdTe array
detectors, the largest devices for the 1 to 2.5 micrometer wavelength region
available today.
