This project will provide for the dissemination of the results of projects
supported by the Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement Program. This year
will note the seventh year that the Division for Experimentation and Laboratory-
Oriented Studies (DELOS) of ASEE and the National Science Foundation have
cooperated in holding sessions at which grantees from the Instrumentation and
Laboratory Improvement Program have presented their results. The participation
of the grantees in the poster session has grown each year by on the order of
fifty percent, and the expected number this June will be greater than sixty.
There is also an associated technical presentation session, which typically has
four grantee papers and a short presentation by an NSF Program Director on the
ILI program. The amount of work that the three principals have been performing
has grown commensurately through the years, and this proposal was solicited to
support their effort on behalf of the Engineering education community and the
NSF ILI program. Typically, there will be about 2000 faculty attending the
Annual ASEE Conference. The presentation is becoming a fundamental component for
the dissemination of the results of the ILI program for the Engineering
education community. This award allows the three principals to continue their
effort, and supports the anticipated increase in the amount of grantee
participation in the future. With the requested support, continued increase in
faculty interest in undergraduate engineering laboratory development is
expected.
