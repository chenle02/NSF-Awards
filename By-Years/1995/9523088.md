9504321 Noah Modeling, analysis and characterization of the dynamic behavior of
multi-degree of freedom rotor systems with strong nonlinearities is the thrust
of this research project. Analytical models of rotors and their nonlinear
supports and coupling components are developed. Local nonlinearities in rotor
systems are manifested in dampers, clearances and fluid interactions. Linearized
analysis of industrial rotating machinery does not capture its full dynamics,
and designs based upon such analyses may lead to severe malfunctions or
catastrophic failures. In this project analytical/computational methods are
developed for determining the nonlinear dynamic behavior of systems, including
their periodic, quasi-periodic and chaotic response and bifurcation. These
include the harmonic balance method, fixed point method, and their combinations.
The results of this research advance the state of knowledge of nonlinear
rotordynamics and leads to the development of reliable design techniques to
mitigate the effects of nonlinear dynamics and chaos.***
