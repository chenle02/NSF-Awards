This research treats two aspects of the dynamic performance analysis of power
systems using a time scale decomposition approach. The two aspects are: the
development of systematic and consistent reduced order models of synchronous
machines and their controls, and the stability of large-scale power systems
using energy function analysis, leading to a decentralized approach in terms of
local fast energies and global slow energy. The dynamic phenomena associated
with large power systems occur over different time frames. Recognition of this
will be used to develop new approaches to improved operation of both individual
equipment as well as the overall system. The time frame aspect will be
quantified via singular perturbation and time-scale modeling. It is expected
that this research will yield better methods of analyzing large complex power
systems.
