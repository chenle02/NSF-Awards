The awardees will carry out a wide-field, medium deep multicolor survey, using
the newly commissioned red-optimized CCD camera on the Large Binocular Telescope
(LBT) with enhanced sensitivity at 1 micron. This survey will for the first time
enable discovery of faint quasars at redshifts z &gt; 7. They will combine the
LBT sample with other high luminosity quasars at 6 &lt; z &lt; 8, and will carry
out spectroscopic follow-up observations in far red and near-infrared
wavelengths. The main science goals of this work are to constrain the accretion
history of the earliest supermassive black holes in the Universe, and to
determine whether the intergalactic medium becomes largely neutral by z ~6.5 -
8. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of this work include research training
for graduate and undergraduate students, follow-up studies of newly discovered
quasars, and serendipitous discovery of other types of objects such as brown
dwarfs.
