The Department of Chemistry requests funds for the renovation of three research
laboratory modules and a mechanical room. The University committed $3.2 million
to begin a total renovation. Having completed the initial stage of the project,
this proposal focuses on the final three research modules to be renovated. The
three labs are in a poor state of repair. None has fume hood capabilities
because the original air- handling system is imcompatable with the new system.
The third module is unsuitable for an x- ray and solid state lab. All four
faculty members are active participants in research built around the involvement
of both. The research effort is not limited to the graduate level. Over the last
five years, 34 undergraduates have appeared as co-authors on research
publications and 50 have appeared as co- authors on research presentations at
professional meetings. The Department is one of NSF's REU sites and in the last
four years the Department has graduated two NSF Predoctoral Fellows, two ACS
Organic Division Fellows, a Rhodes Scholar and a Rhodes Finalist.
