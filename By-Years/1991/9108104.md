This project will focus upon the structure, function and genetics of protein and
RNA components of the prokaryotic ribosome. (1) The structural features within
E. coli 16S and 23S rRNAs that account for their specific interaction with r-
proteins S8 and L1 during ribosome assembly will be probed by site-directed
mutagenesis and protein-rRNA cross-linking. In addition, the minimum rRNA
segment required for protein binding will be determined to facilitate their
detailed physical characterization in the future. (2) Over 40 mutants of E. coli
r-protein S8 have been isolated on the basis of their inability to
translationally regulate spc operon expression. The metabolic and physically
stability of these proteins will be examined, and their RNA-binding properties
evaluated. 2D NMR analysis of wild-type and mutants S8 will be used to define
the structure of S8, and its RNA-binding domain, at high resolution. (3) Operons
encoding components of the translation and transcription apparatus in several
thermoacidophilic archaebacteria will be isolated and sequenced. Various
approaches will be employed to gain insights into how the expression of these
transcription units is controlled. The results will provide a better
understanding of the evolution of gene regulation, as well as of gene
organization, in this unusual group of organisms.
