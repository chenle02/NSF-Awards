CISE Postdoctoral Associates in Experimental Computer Science: Physical
Geometric Algorithms and Systems for High-Throughput NMR

While automation is revolutionizing many aspects of biology, the determination
of three-dimensional protein structure remains an expensive task. Traditional
automated and semiautomated approaches to protein structure determination
through nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy require dozens of
experiments and months of spectrometer time, making them unsuitable for high-
throughput automation. The research proposed is to develop algorithms and
systems for determining protein structure from only a few key NMR spectra. The
system will use algorithms similar to and adapted from physical geometric
algorithms, pattern recognition and machine vision, signal processing, and
robotics, in order to analyze spectra, assign spectral peaks to atom
interactions, compute secondary structure, and estimate the global fold.
Previously developed software, JIGSAW, represents NMR data with graphs encoding
potential interactions between amino acid residues. JIGSAW applies graph
algorithms to find subgraphs encoding the secondary protein structure. The
postdoctoral research associate will build on the insights of JIGSAW by
assisting to 1) integrate automated analysis of geometry and correlations in
three-dimensional input spectra, 2) prove correctness, completeness, and
complexity results within a random graph formalism, 3) extend JIGSAW to larger
proteins, and 4) utilize long-range interactions in order to estimate three-
dimensional protein structure.
