Abstract EEC-9604480 Shortell The Center for Health Management Research was
designated as an Industry/University Cooperative Research Center by the National
Science Foundation in July 1992. The initial goals of the Center for Health
Management Research were: 1) to develop a research agenda in collaboration with
corporate members; 2) to undertake research, development, and evaluation
projects on behalf of the corporate members; 3)to disseminate to the members
findings of health services research; 4) to identify and disseminate to the
members successful innovations and management practices from other health care
organizations; and 5) to identify and disseminate to the members relevant
research findings successful innovations and management practices from other
industries and countries. The vision of the Center continues to be refined in
order to support its corporate members as they seek to adapt to a complex,
challenging, and turbulent environment. This award provides funding to expand
the Center for Health Management Research. Continuing discussion with NSF,
researchers from Northwestern University, and a number of noteworthy health care
organizations has led to a decision to join the Northwestern-based group to the
Center for Health Management and become an affiliated research site, governed by
a single Industry Advisory Board. The resultant Center for Health Management
Research would substantially increase its complement of corporate members and
its attendant financial support base. The influence of the research would likely
be enhanced through this larger base, our academic colleagues gain access to a
larger set of high-quality organizations, and corporate members have a larger
set of colleagues with whom to share experiences and learnings.
