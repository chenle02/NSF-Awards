Material science, recently identified as one of five strategic and critical
areas of research by the Clinton administration, is experiencing a period of
major advances in numerous areas. Since many of the desired characteristics of
these materials are evaluated as a function of their structure and/or elemental
composition, the material scientist looks toward x-ray techniques to provide
fast, accurate, elemental and structural information requiring minimal sample
preparation. The chemistry department is establishing a modern x-ray analysis
laboratory composed of a wavelength dispersive x-ray fluorescence spectrometer
and an x-ray powder diffractometer. This project affects non-science- majors in
general education courses, as well as most science majors in courses ranging
from General Chemistry to Physical Chemistry. Undergraduate research, examining
environmental topics, is being implemented, thereby encouraging participation in
independent study by African-American and women students.
