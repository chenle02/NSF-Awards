year support for a cadre of 40 leader elementary and middle school teachers from
four districts in northwestern Washington State. With training in Operation
Physics materials, leadership training and continuing project and district
support these teachers will provide comprehensive training and collegial support
for essentially every other K-6 teacher in these districts. The leader or
Level-2 teachers will receive 50 days of training each year in summer workshops,
academic year workshops and scientific research experiences. Workshops for their
peers, Level-3 teachers, will be for two weeks in the summers. Unusual features
of the Washington State-Op are: university faculty from the sciences,
mathematics English and Technology will provide summer instruction and academic
year consultation to the leader teachers, there is substantial support for the
leader teachers in the form of teacher release time for the leader teachers, the
extent to which an outside evaluator will track the project, and the extent to
which the entire project design has been driven by teachers. Level-2 teachers
will earn 36 graduate credits applicable to a Masters degree in Natural Science.
Level-3 teachers may earn 3-graduate credits for each summer with AY follow-up.
