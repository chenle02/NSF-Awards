9706841 Levander This is a renewal proposal for funds to support a postdoctoral
researcher at Rice University for the purpose of completing analysis of active
source data and earthquake data collected during the Deep Probe experiment. This
experiment was conducted in 1995 by a group of U.S. universities (funded by NSF)
and the Canadian Lithoprobe Program. The experiment consisted of a continental
scale active source seismic profile to probe the Archean upper mantle beneath
the Alberta plains, and the Phanerozoic mantle beneath the southern Rocky
Mountains and the Colorado Plateau. The profile extended from southern New
Mexico to the Great Slave Lake. ***
