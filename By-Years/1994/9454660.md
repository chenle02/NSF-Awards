The Southeast Michigan Alliance for Reinvestment in Technological Education
(SMARTE) is planning for Center of Excellence to develop a comprehensive "blue
print" of a regional advanced technological education center. The project brings
together a diverse team consisting of faculty, teachers, and staff members of a
major state university, community colleges, and public school systems, and
regional business, industry, and labor partners.The seven objectives are: (a)
Assess the feasibility of establishing educational standards on a regional
basis. (b) Explore assessment models. (c) Identify models of integration of math
and science for technological education. (d) Explore model curricula that
integrate other competencies such as problem-solving, systems thinking,
communications, work habits, etc. (e) Evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness
of distance learning and alternative methods. (f) Define the professional
development needs of the faculty and teachers. (g) Define how community college
faculty and high school teachers partner with business, industry, labor and
community organizations to design curriculum modules and methodology that will
serve the needs of all partners.
