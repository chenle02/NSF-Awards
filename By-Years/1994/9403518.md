9403518 Escher The projects involve the study of harmonic and minimal maps
between spheres and their parametrization in terms of representation theory.
Other problems involve isoparametric hypersurfaces in various space forms and
the study of Einstein structures. This research may have potential applications
to mathematical physics. ***
