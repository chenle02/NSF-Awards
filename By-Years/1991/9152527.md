Personal computers are being use in physics and astronomy courses to obtain data
in real time, perform analysis, and construct models. In the physics
laboratories the data are used to illustrate and make extensive analysis of
various phenomena. In the elementary laboratories the focus is on analysis to
enhance the skills of students and to provide hands on experience with computers
and modern data acquisition. In the advanced laboratories computers are being
used, in addition to the above, to provide more sophisticated analytical tools.
In the astronomy laboratories available software is being used to help students
visualize celestial motion, perform exercises using celestial coordinates, and
provide background for observation sessions.NSF grant funds are being matched
with funds from non-federal sources.
