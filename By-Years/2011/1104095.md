This project is a partnership between Snohomish School District and Everett
Community College. Everett Community College will use facilities provided by
Snohomish School District to teach Advanced Manufacturing skills. The
partnership will better utilize equipment and facilities, allow middle and high
school students access to advanced equipment, provide professional development
for teachers and engage young students exciting them to study STEM fields. The
opportunities provided by the work will increase the number of students from
underrepresented groups who study STEM fields and enter the workforce. Since the
local need for manufacturing workers, especially in aerospace, is expected to
grow a well educated worker is a critical element to the continued success of
the Snohomish County and Regional economy and this work will help ensure these
workers are prepared.

The project will increase the number of industry certificate holders in the area
of advanced manufacturing by 20%, increase the number of associate degree
holders with experience in advanced manufacturing by 100% and increase the
number of community college transfers to a four-year institution by 15%.

The applied learning/training in the program will increase student scientific
literacy and provide more opportunity to be creative and create connections to
business and industry making study more relevant and focused. The project's dual
enrollment benefits student enrollment and early mentoring and could become a
model that can be duplicated nation-wide.
