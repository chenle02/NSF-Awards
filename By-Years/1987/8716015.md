Tourism is a world-wide phenomenon that is affecting third world peoples, their
views of themselves, and how they present themselves to outsiders, as well as
how outsiders view them. This study will look at this process and see especially
how anthropologists have affected local socio-economic organization and local
knowledge about prehistoric and modern cultures. It will also analyze how
anthropological knowledge, in turn, is incorporated into interactions between
hosts and tourists. For this project the student will work in the Maya town of
Piste, Mexico and will study the effect of anthropologist S.G. Morley's
archaeological work at the site of Chichen-Itza and see how this has affected
the development of tourism in Yucatan. This study will contribute to an
understanding of how anthropology is a social institution that has historical
effects on the peoples it studies. This study has the potential to influence the
way anthropology is done in the future by showing the unexpected side-effects
and spin offs of the basic research endeavor.
