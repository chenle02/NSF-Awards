The purpose of this research is to determine and analyze how family obligations
influence the job mobility of women. In recent years, it has become recognized
that job turnover is an important criterion for career success. A certain amount
of early career turnover is regarded as beneficial because it can lead to
finding a lucrative job, but too much job change may indicate that workers are
failing to invest in job-specific skill that enhance their wage growth.
Surprisingly, little is known about the extent to which women change jobs, let
alone how their mobility is affected by fertility decisions. This research is
important because it will shed light on one of the factors that may account for
persistent male-female wage differentials. To accomplish the research
objectives, data from the National Longitudinal Surveys of Labor Market
Experiences will be analyzed, primarily via the estimation of discrete-time
proportional hazard models. The analysis will reveal how various measures of
fertility and past career interruptions influence the job-to-job hazard rate as
well as the nonemployment-to nonemployment hazard rate. In addition, the
characteristics of women's career interruptions will be described, and the
personal characteristics of women who interrupt their careers will be compared
to the characteristics of those who work continuously. Special emphasis will be
placed on race and cohort differences in turnover behavior.
