This project provides funding support in order to make awards to graduate
students to attend the 44th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on
Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN 2014) to be held in Atlanta, Georgia on
June 23-26, 2014. The IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems
and Networks (DSN) is a premier international conference for presenting the
research results, problem solutions, and insights on new challenges in
dependability and security of computer systems and networks.

DSN 2014 will provide many and varied opportunities for student submission and
participation. These opportunities range from full-length conference and
workshop papers to medium-length preliminary contributions considered by the
Student Forum to brief descriptions of early-stage research in the Work in
Progress category. This project is focused primarily on broader impacts through
the education students will receive from attending the technical sessions of
DSN, mentoring that they will receive through the Student Forum activities, and
networking opportunities they will receive through numerous different conference
activities.
