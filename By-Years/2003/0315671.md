The proposed work will in translate the knowledge and methods developed in the
field of complex systems science into a curriculum appropriate for bioengineers.
Specifically, Binghamton will develop a vertically integrated sequence of six
core courses (including both didactic and lab courses) to serve as the
foundation of the technical education in bioengineering. To complement this core
sequence, this will also be developing a sequence of one-credit courses, to run
in parallel with the technical core, which will serve to introduce
bioengineering students to the necessary non-technical "hard-skills" and
"process-skills" which are essential to successful engineering (e.g. problem-
solving skills, management and business skills, decision making skills, and
social, cultural and ecological implications of technology). Explicit links
(lateral integration) between the technical and non-technical sequences will be
established, with the goal of helping the student learn how knowledge is
acquired and integrated to create understanding. The intent is to create a
paradigm which students will find useful in the process of life-long learning,
which is essential due to the short half-life of technical knowledge. The broad
impact of this program on the field of engineering lies in both the new type of
engineering student we will be graduating and the extension of the approach to
other schools. The understanding of, and ability to work with, complex, non-
linear dynamical systems will become the factor which distinguishes bioengineers
from their engineering and biology colleagues, and will attract a new and
diverse group of students into engineering, who are interested in pursuing a
wide variety of career opportunities building on this expertise.
