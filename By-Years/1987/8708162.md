An analysis of the presynaptic physiology at a vertebrate central synapse will
be undertaken in this research. Synaptic potentials will be recorded with two
intracellular microelectrodes, one presynaptic in the Mauthner axon and the
other postsynaptic in a cranial relay neuron. The investigation is focused on a
single synaptic contact. How transmembrane potential, ions, pharmacological
agents and proteins associated with presynaptic vesicles act on the number of
quanta available and the probability for release will be studied. The hypothesis
to be examined is that quantal presynaptic events are produced by specific
proteins interacting with Ca2+ to trigger neurosecretion. The experiments may
elucidate the fundamental process(es) by which neurotransmitter is released from
central nerve terminals and are important for understanding the mechanisms of
cell communication.
