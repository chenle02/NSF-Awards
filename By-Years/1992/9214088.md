Pacific University is establishing a connection to NSFNET via a 56,000 bits per
second line through the NorthWestNet mid-level network. The connection enables
the school's faculty and students to communicate and collaborate with the
national scientific and educational community, and to access network resources.
Areas of science addressed by Pacific include physics, biology and chemistry.
Another project involves undergraduate and K-12 education. This award funds part
of the costs for one year.***
