9314751 Doser This award will support the travel of Dr. Diane Doser from the
Department of Geological Sciences at the University of Texas at El Paso to spend
one month each year over the next two years at the New Zealand Institute of
Geological and Nuclear Sciences in Wellington conducting cooperative research
with Dr. Terry H. Webb on seismic studies of large earthquakes in New Zealand.
New Zealand is an active seismic region located along the plate boundary between
the Pacific and Australian tectonic plates. Since 1915, 16 earthquakes of
magnitude &gt;6.5 have occurred within the country. This project will examine
the faulting process of 10 historic earthquakes using seismogram modeling
techniques. These models will be compared to geological and geophysical features
of the existing fault zones to better determine fault behavior, slip rates, and
regional variations in earthquake processes increasing an understanding of
deformational processes along complicated plate margins like New Zealand and
western North America. The research is a collaborative effort between Dr. Doser,
an expert in seismological studies of historic earthquakes, and Dr. Webb who has
extensive knowledge of the recent seismicity of New Zealand.
