This project will study groups through curvature conditions on simplicial
complexes with these groups as their fundamental groups. A generalization of
small cancellation theory is given and it is proposed to study these small
cancellation groups and their finitely presented subgroups by curvature
conditions. Higher dimensional analogues are proposed with applications to
classes of groups traditionally studied by geometric methods. A group is an
algebraic object having a binary operation defined on it. Such objects are of
interest to many different branches of mathematics and physics. This project
will study these groups by geometric methods.
