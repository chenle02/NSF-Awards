The Florida Museum of Natural History has been awarded funds for a workshop that
will focus on the informatics and databasing needs of a broad, well-organized
community of botanical scientists, including systematists, paleobotanists, and
evolutionary biologists. Primary objectives involve formulating a strategy for
formalizing user and functional requirements for this community and evaluating
the utility of existing botanically relevant database infrastructure and
standards. The workshop is expected to facilitate establishment of
collaborations between these organismal researchers and informaticists and to
greatly advance both groups in the production and use of integrated standards
and databases and tools that use those standards .
