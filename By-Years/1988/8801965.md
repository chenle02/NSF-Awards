Dr. Gurr wants to determine, in molecular terms, how the biosynthesis of the
alpha and beta subunits of thyrotropin (TSH) is regulated by thyroid hormone
(T3). He previously demonstrated that T3 inhibits the transcription of alpha and
beta TSH genes, and the inhibition of TSH beta gene transcription was more
marked than that of alpha. He now wants to identify cis-acting DNA sequence
elements and trans-acting factors which modulate the response of alpha and beta
TSH to T3 and which determine tissue-specific TSH alpha and beta gene activity.
The binding sites for the T3 receptor on the alpha and beta genes will be
delineated by DNAase footprinting and methylation protection, using T3 receptor
protein which has been synthesized in vitro from T3 receptor cDNA. Other
specific trans-acting factors interacting with these genes will be identified in
nuclear extracts from thyrotropic tumors. Genomic footprinting will be used to
assess the relevance of the in vitro binding data to the situation in intact
chromatin. Cis-acting sequence elements and trans-acting factors which are
involved in determining tissue specific alpha and beta TSH gene expression will
be identified using in vitro transcription, with nuclear extracts from
thyrotropic tumors and tissues in which the alpha and beta TSH genes are not
expressed, e.g., liver and kidney. These experiments are important since they
will demonstrate the mechanism by which hormones are able to regulate gene
expression within specific tissues. While many investigators are working on this
general problem, Dr. Gurr is studying the negative regulation of a hormone which
is composed of 2 subunits, one common to other pituitary hormones and one that
is unique, and is an example of feedback inhibition of a substance which
regulates its production.
