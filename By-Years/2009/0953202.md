0953202&lt;br/&gt;You&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Engineered cell-based sensors and
actuators have great potential for diverse applications in medicine,
environmental cleanup, and biotechnology. Their applications, however, have been
limited by their lack of controllability and scalability. To address this
challenge, the proposed research aims to develop a unique platform technology --
microbial swarmbots, which integrates synthetic biology and biomaterials
engineering. A swarmbot consists of autonomously regulated, small
bacterialpopulations that are encapsulated in microcapsules built from synthetic
or natural polymers. The proposed research will demonstrate the integration of
the swarmbots with sensors and actuators of practical
relevance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The resulting platform has several distinctive
design features: (1) Programmability &amp; modularity: microcapsule properties
and circuit functions can be independently designed and optimized, which
facilitates "plug-n-play" integration for broad applications. (2) Safety: Multi-
layer safeguard mechanisms are embedded in system design - bacteria escaping
from capsules are programmed to die. This strategy directly addresses the
concern on using live bacteria for medical or environmental applications. (3)
Stability and efficiency: Micro-encapsulation will reduce the probability of
mutants taking over (by partitioning the bacterial populations into encapsulated
"microcolonies"), thus enhancing overall genetic stability of gene circuits.
