This award will support the participation of graduate students and postdocs in
the "Seventeenth Riviere-Fabes Symposium" that will be held at the University of
Minnesota-Twin Cities from April 25-27, 2014. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This annual
conference, of which the 2014 meeting will be the seventeenth in the series,
celebrates the mathematical legacy of Nestor M. Riviere and Eugene B. Fabes by
focusing on recent developments in analysis, especially in the field of partial
differential equations. The 2014 program will feature four principal speakers
(Alice Chang, Frank Merle, Maciej Zworski, and Alexandru Ionescu), each of whom
will deliver a two-hour lecture. The program allows ample time for informal
discussion among the participants.
