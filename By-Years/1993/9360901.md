III-9360901 EIC Laboratories Inc. Timothy L. Rose ABSTRACT This Phase I project
involves the synthesis of a monmeric perfluorinates ester of a superacid
(perfluorovinylmoniliformin methyl ester), its polymerization and the
characterization of the resulting polymer. Formation of ionomer membranes with
this unique polymer may overcome certain disadvantages of the highly successful
commercial membranes with this successful commercial membranes containing
fluoropolymers with sulfonic acid groups. These types of membranes are used in
processes like electrodialysis for the treatment of waste streams, production of
chemicals, and water purification. The new structures to be prepared in this
research may improve the performance of such membranes in these and other
important industrial and environmental processes. #a#b#c#d#e#g#
