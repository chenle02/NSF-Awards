This award supports the participation of nine U.S. scientists in a U.S.-Japan
Seminar on Magnetic Multilayered Structures, to be held May 15-17, 1992 in
Honolulu, Hawaii. The co-organizers of the seminar are Professor Peter Levy,
Department of Physics, New York University, and Professor Hiroyasu Fujimori,
Institute for Materials Research, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan. Among the
topics to be covered are: (1) preparation and characterization of metallic
multilayered structures and magneto-optics, (2) experimental and theoretical
studies of their basic properties, e.g., phase transitions, interface magnetism
(two-dimensional), magnetic anisotropy, and interlayer magnetic coupling, and
(3) novel properties and technical applications, soft magnetic films, and giant
magnetoresistance materials. Magnetic and metallic multilayered structures are a
subcategory of the broader field of thin film research. The seminar participants
have been chosen to cover some of the most impressive recent advances. These
advances promote our knowledge of the microscopic interactions that control the
properties of these structures and in addition they serve as a guide for the
development of multilayered materials for such technologies as magnetic
recording, information storage, and magneto-optical recording.
