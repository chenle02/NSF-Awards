This study will investigate the nutritional status and energy balance of a
sample of adult Swazi women who are living in an African environment that is
characterized by suboptimal nutrition and heavy workloads. The investigators
hypothesize that balance between energy intake and expenditure will vary by
season, with expenditure exceeding intake during periods of peak labor and low
food supply. The question of how work output is related to its energetic cost is
generally considered one of the more importantproblems in adaptive human
population biology today.
