Coevolution plays a central role in shaping biological diversity, molding the
structure of biological communities, and driving tight coadaptation between
interacting species. Over shorter ecological time scales coevolution also
generates chronic maladaptation and maintains substantial levels of genetic
polymorphism. The geographic mosaic theory of coevolution provides a unifying
framework for these disparate aspects of the coevolutionary process. The
overarching goal of this proposal is to develop a rigorous theoretical backbone
for this theory. This will be achieved through the application of recently
developed mathematical techniques that greatly simplify the analysis of complex
genetic systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the proposed work
are twofold. First, the models will extend previously developed mathematical
techniques to coevolving systems. The result will be the development of new and
powerful analytical tools that can be readily applied to a diverse array of
problems in coevolutionary biology. The distribution of this analytical
technology will be facilitated by public presentation of techniques at annual
meetings, and by the publication of electronic Mathematica appendices. Second,
the training component of the proposed work will introduce two graduate students
and an undergraduate to these new mathematical techniques, as well as other
computational and analytical approaches. This training will directly contribute
to the increased integration of analytical and computational techniques in the
biological sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
