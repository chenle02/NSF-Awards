This collaborative project between the University of Wisconsin-River Falls and
Winona State University is gathering evidence on the role timing and type of
feedback has on student learning when multiple choice exams are used in large-
enrollment general chemistry and organic chemistry lecture courses. This
systematic chemical education research project is using both traditional
Scantron and Immediate Feedback Assessment Technique forms (also known as
"Answer Until Correct" in which answer spaces are covered with a coating that is
scratched off like a lottery ticket). The variables being investigated include
immediate versus delayed feedback, corrective versus non-corrective feedback,
test retaking, deliberate increases in cognitive complexity demands, and student
confidence in their answers. The results are providing evidence about student
cognitive and metacognitive growth and how different sub-populations vary within
the testing regimes. Volunteer student populations from one doctoral
institution, three comprehensive institutions, and two community colleges
(Anoka-Ramsey Community College and South Suburban College) are participating.
The intellectual merit of this project includes valid and reliable General
Chemistry 1 and Organic Chemistry 1 multiple-choice tests that encompass a
spectrum of thinking skills, including higher order cognitive skills. In
addition, the project is documenting how multiple choice exams are used both for
real-time student learning as well as assessing a student's knowledge. The
broader impacts of this project are the knowledge that is being created about
how the structure of multiple choice questions, coupled with type and timing of
feedback, influences student learning for the whole, as well as for different
sub-groups. Given the wide-spread use of multiple-choice exams, this project
also is establishing best practices for the construction of online practice and
homework problems such that they now can now be formulated better to maximize
student learning.
