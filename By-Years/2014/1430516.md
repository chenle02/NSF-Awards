This doctoral dissertation improvement grant will support the investigator, a
PhD candidate, to engage in a study of home security devices using participant
observation and interviews. She will address how moral norms are configured into
devices, how the home as a physical space and domestic sphere is affected by the
design of home security products, and how risk is made material and intelligible
through home security devices. Through an examination of this technology, she
will also address the much broader question of insecurity and how home security
technology serves as a defense against a sizable number and variety of threats.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will contribute insights for better
understanding how norms are configured into other technologies, particularly
those that are designed to promote other prudential, individualistic ends, and
how the resulting technologies in turn have an impact on societal norms. These
are plausible, broader benefits of the results of this study to society.
