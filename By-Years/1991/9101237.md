The primary focus of this project is producing a unified, accessible treatment
of the existence, uniqueness, and structure of the sporadic simple groups. In
addition, the principal investigator will study the action of groups on finite
simplicial complexes. A group is an algebraic structure with a single operation.
It appears in many areas of mathematics, as well as, physics and chemistry. The
fundamental building blocks of finite groups are finite simple groups. One of
the major results in mathematics of the past decade is the classification of
finite simple groups, the proof of which would require 10,000 to 15,000 journal
pages. The research supported is aimed at simplifying the treatment of the
sporadic simple groups.
