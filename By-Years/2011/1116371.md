A mobile health monitoring system generates and monitors data related to a
patient?s health using a wireless or wired channel. It may also control dosages
of medicine or alter the behavior of medical devices to preserve a patient?s
health. Such continuous monitoring and control gives mobile health monitoring
systems the promise of improving health for lower costs than traditional
methods. The security of mobile health monitoring systems is critical because of
the importance of their tasks and the vulnerability of the devices and their
operating environments. Such devices are sometimes used in hospitals or other
health care facilities, but more often in patients? homes, offices, and other
ordinary environments whose physical and cyber security cannot be controlled.
The security of widely used mobile health monitoring devices is badly flawed.
This danger will be addressed by adding security mechanisms to the overall
system and environment in which mobile medical health devices operate. While
less effective and efficient than designing such devices properly in the first
place, there are reasonable low-cost solutions that can substantially improve
the safety and security of such devices.
