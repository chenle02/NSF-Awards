This research deals with new applications of discrete and continuous time
stochastic control to the mathematical models of economic growth, mathematical
finance and mathematical insurance, as well as developing novel non-traditional
control techniques useful for this purpose. In the area of discrete time
control, we will study and analyze convex-valued dynamical systems, similar to
the ones used for the analysis of the mathematical models of economic growth and
we will use these results in analysis of complex discrete time financial market
models. In the second part of our research, we will study new applications of
the optimal control of diffusion processes to optimization models in finance and
insurance. We will investigate mixed regular-singular stochastic and impulse
stochastic control appropriate for those problems. We also intend to study the
class of nonlinear partial differential (or integral-differential) equations
with gradient constraints that form an appropriate analytical framework for
these models.

The importance of these activities is in the development of new methodology of
applications of stochastic control in mathematical finance and insurance.
Successful completion of the research objectives will increase our understanding
of the structure of the policy the financial and insurance optimization models
and will allow one to get a better insight into the nature of the optimal
dividend distribution policy to which a publicly traded financial corporation
should adhere. More importantly, it will provide understanding of the risk
control policy such an institution should follow.
