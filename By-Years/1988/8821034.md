Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
available to the chemist for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It
is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectroscopy is essential
to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. This award, co-supported by
the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program (MPS) and the Instrumentation and
Instrument Development Program (BBS), will help the Department of Chemistry of
the University of Louisville to acquire a high-field NMR spectrometer. The areas
of research that will be enhanced by the acquisition include: 1) Conformational
properties of backbone modified peptides 2) Quenching of fluorescence of
aromatic amino acid residues by intramolecular sulfur atoms 3) Oligosaccharides
and polysaccharides of bacteria 4) Conformational isomerism in metal formyl
complexes 5) NMR studies of binuclear diiron complexes containing polyimidazolyl
ligands.
