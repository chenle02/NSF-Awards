The ultimate goal of this project is to understand mechanisms responsible for
memory processing in the brain. Although several factors contribute to the
formation of memories, it is well recognized that the encoding of information in
the brain depends on two critical processes: attention and meaning. In effect,
events are best remembered when they are attended to and when they are
meaningful. In mammals, it is further generally acknowledged that information is
initially stored in the hippocampus of the brain. In previous studies using the
rat model, the investigator identified a system of connections in the brain that
generate the so called theta rhythm of the hippocampus, which appears to serve a
direct role in the encoding of significant (or meaningful) information in the
hippocampus. Specifically, the hippocampus receives information from various
regions of the cortex, and theta may serve to amplify information bearing
signals from the cortex, leading to their storage in the hippocampus. In a
similar manner, another system of inputs to the hippocampus from the midline
thalamus has been identified that appears to code for the dimension of attention
to environmental events. This project will, in part, examine the effects of
selective activation (or inactivation) of inputs to the hippocampus that are
responsible for attention and meaning in memory processing in this structure.
More specifically, the manner and degree to which these manipulations will
enhance (or impede) learning and memory in rats will be examined. These studies
should significantly contribute to an understanding of mechanisms of memory
formation in the brain. The researcher engages undergraduate and graduate
students in his research projects and continues to disseminate his experimental
findings in various professional and lay forums.
