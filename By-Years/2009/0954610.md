Professor Anne J. McNeil of the University of Michigan Ann Arbor is supported by
the Chemical Catalysis Program in the Division of Chemistry to study Ni-
catalyzed chain growth polymerization for the synthesis of pi-conjugated
polymers and copolymers. The aims of the proposed research include (a) obtaining
insight into the mechanism of transition-metal-catalyzed chain-growth
polymerizations, (b) synthesizing, characterizing, and evaluating new Ni0-arene
-complexes as intermediates and initiators, (c) developing new synthetic methods
to provide access to a new class of functional organic materials with novel
properties and applications, and (d) elucidating the fundamental reactivity
preferences when multiple monomers are used. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed
research promises to advance our understanding of the metal-catalyzed
polymerization of conjugated polymers, with the potential of increasing the
diversity of conjugated materials available for applications in technological
devices, including thin-film solar cells and light-emitting diodes. Graduate and
undergraduate students will be trained in multidisciplinary research involving
organic, inorganic, and polymer chemistry. Students and other faculty members
will be engaged in a comprehensive overhaul of chemical entries in Wikipedia.
