Intellectual merit: The effect of intense lasers on atoms and molecules will be
investigated using innovative computational methods. The emphasis will be on the
way these lasers remove electrons from matter, and how these processes can be
controlled by using parameters of the laser (such as intensity and polarization)
as control knobs.

Broader impact: The use of intense lasers in the physical and biological
sciences has opened up new frontiers for research and applications. The research
described here will have an impact on all disciplines which rely on using
current or projected laser sources. Students will be trained in the use of new
computational procedures, which are applicable across disciplines also.
