The onset of scuffing wear will be studied in a device which will allow
simulation of the contact conditions of pressure, temperature and contact stress
which exist in the elastohydrodynamic conjectures of gears, cams and similar
components. The results will be related to molecular adsorption/desorption of
the lubricant on the wearing surfaces.
