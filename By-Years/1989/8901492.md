This research is concerned with a variety of related topics in linear algebra
and the representation theory of groups and algebras. The principal investigator
will examine permutation representations and apply these results to branched
coverings of Riemann surfaces, to zeta functions, prime splitting, and relative
Brauer groups of number fields. Further, he will examine how various properties
of matrices and representations over a commtative ring are affected by extending
the base ring. A matrix is a rectangular array of algebraic data. This research
deals with algebraic data from more general objects called rings. This work sits
at an interface between traditional matrix theory and abstract algebra. It has
potential consequences for several different areas of mathematics including
group theory, number theory and algebraic geometry.
