This project, a collaborative effort between the San Diego Supercomputer Center
(SDSC) and the University of California, San Diego, (UCSD), addresses
performance analysis on the Internet and development of models to predict such
performance. There is a need for tools that analyze and model available network
data and also assist in defining data sets for network evaluation and
optimization. Such capabilities will become more critical as the Internet and
its NREN component develop higher performance and are are more high spread. Some
areas of initial investigation include assessments of network latencies,
identification of traffic patterns and service requirements, parameterization of
network performance, and exploration of issues surrounding the granularity and
scope of collected network data.***
