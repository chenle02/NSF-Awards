Beside a solid background in their science, scientists need a wide range of
`survival skills` to develop into accomplished professionals. They need to
communicate effectively orally and in writing, secure employment and funding,
manage stress and time, teach, mentor, and behave responsibly. Higher education
focuses almost exclusively on disciplinary content and methods. The principal
investigators of this proposal have developed a `survival skills curriculum.`
This program includes (1) using active scientists rather than individuals from
other disciplines as instructors, (2) discussing ethical issues within the
context of the skills to which they are relevant, (3) integrating topics of
special relevance to women, minorities, the physically challenged and others
with special needs, (4) providing information about a broad range of employment
opportunities and emphasizing their value, and (5) extensive evaluation. This
funding will be used further to develop this model and disseminate it to other
institutions via faculty training in this type of instruction. This grant will
allow a substantial number of faculty from US institutions to receive the
training and materials to establish their own courses, and a substantial number
of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to attend the workshops on
survival skills and ethics.
