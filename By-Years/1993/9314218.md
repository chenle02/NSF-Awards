9314218 Alt In this project, the PIs will analyze hydrothermally altered oceanic
crust recovered at ODP Hole 504B for Sr isotope ratios and trace element
abundances. They will analyze whole rocks, mineral separates and vein minerals.
Besides data gathering, their fundamental goal is understand water rock
interaction and isotopic flux at sub sea floor hydrothermal systems. ***
