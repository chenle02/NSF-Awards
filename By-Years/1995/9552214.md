452071035 ILI - Instrumentation Project: Life Sciences Title: Data Acquisition
for the Physiology Laboratory and for Student Research in Neurobiology Data
acquisition stations, consisting of a force transducer, a computer-controlled
preamplifier and transducer bridge, an analog-to-digital converter, and a
computer with acquisition, spreadsheet, and graphical analysis software, are
being used by students in a vertebrate physiology laboratory course to improve
their competence in handling data, and engage them d) the scientific process. In
addition, this equipment is being used by senior student researchers to
investigate synaptic transmission in the Xenopus lateral line. These
improvements in instrumentation are not only enhancing the upper-divisional
course work at Xavier, but serving to strengthen the entire Biology program.
