9553525 Kohser This proposal seeks support for a two-phase, four week,
multidisciplinary, summer residential Young Scholars institute in engineering
and earth sciences for twenty students entering the twelfth grade. Approximately
120 high school seniors will attend the one week program (40 students/week for
three weeks). The primary goal of this component of the program will be to
present career opportunities in disciplines relating to minerals, materials,
energy, and the environment. Twenty students from this group will be invited to
return for a three week intensive workshop consisting of intensive and
individualized projects. Follow-up activities will consist of supervised
completion of individualized projects including a competition award for the best
project essays.
