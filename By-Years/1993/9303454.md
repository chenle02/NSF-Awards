This award covers experimental Elementary Particle Physics Research by a group
at the University of California Los Angeles in collaboration with other NSF and
DOE supported scientists. The group will continue studies on the possibility of
doing B-meson experiments at proton accelerators. They will continue the
analysis of diffractive proton scattering at the CERN proton-antiproton
collider. The UCLA scientists will lead a test at CERN, Switzerland, that
explores using data-driven parallel processors in heavy quark production
experiments.
