In real life, one seeks to understand objects in the universe by studying
various characteristic quantities associated with them, such as shape, size,
temperature, and so on. These characteristics allow one to distinguish one
object from another. Some characteristics may change drastically under the
influence of very small external forces, and some remain resistant to change
under such forces. The former are unstable and usually difficult to measure,
while the latter are more stable and easier to detect, hence much more useful.
In mathematics, those stable characteristics are called invariants. They provide
some of the most fundamental tools in almost all branches of mathematics. In
this project, the principal investigator will study a certain class of
invariants of differential equations and apply them to study problems in
classical geometry and topology.

Index theoretical invariants of elliptic operators are important for
understanding the geometry of their underlying spaces. The famous Atiyah-Singer
index theorem and its noncommutative geometric generalizations have many
applications to geometry and topology. All these index theoretical invariants
live naturally in the K-theory of certain operator algebras. The principal
investigator will use methods developed in the studies of K-theory of operator
algebras to investigate various invariants of elliptic operators on manifolds
and spaces with singularities. In particular, he is interested in secondary
invariants such as the higher rho invariant. The principal investigator proposes
to use these secondary invariants to study the structure group of a closed
topological manifold and the homotopy groups of the space of positive scalar
curvature metrics on a given manifold. The principal investigator also plans to
explore the connections of these problems to the Novikov conjecture and the
Baum-Connes conjecture.
