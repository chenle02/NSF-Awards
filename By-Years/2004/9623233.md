9623233 Stewart This career development plan contains both research and
education activities. The objective of the research is to form a genetic basis
for biofilm detachment. The hypothesis of the research is that there are genes
that actively control the process of sloughing detachment, and that these genes
are regulated by cellular environment or physiological status. The objective
would be to develop methods to induce these genes to control biofouling in a
more cost effective and environmentally acceptable manner than the current heavy
reliance on biocidal chemicals. The goal of the educational plan is for the PI
to develop excellence as a teacher. This includes a set of well thought-out
activities to improve teaching technique. ***
