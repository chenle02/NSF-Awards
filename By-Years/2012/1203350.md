Abstract

Approximately 2,500 majority employee owned firms operate in the contemporary US
economy and their ownership structure constitutes a drastic alternative to the
traditional investor or family-owned firm, yet their productive potential has
never been rigorously studied. This project utilizes a three-case comparative
ethnography of firms in the U.S. industrial machine manufacturing industry to
examine the effects of majority employee ownership and high performance work
organization on strategic and operational decision-making. First, how do
majority and non-majority employee owned firms govern and implement strategic
and operational decision making? Second, how is high productivity work
organization governed and implemented in majority employee owned and non-
majority employee owned firms? The three selected firms all utilize extensive
high productivity work organization practices and operate in the industrial
machine manufacturing industry, a particularly challenging context for employee
ownership. Two majority employee owned cases serve as critical cases, in that
their performance will suggest the possibilities for employee owned firms in
less adverse environments. The two employee owned firms vary in the degree of
employee direct participation in strategic governance, in order to parse out the
effects of employee ownership and employee control. The third firm will be
privately owned and will serve as a benchmark. In order to capture the decision-
making processes and subjective orientations of workers towards the firm, data
will be collected through a combination of in-depth interviews and participant
observation, organized around six month internships in each of the firms.

Beyond its intellectual merit, this dissertation will have a range of broader
impacts. I am partnering with the University of Wisconsin Center for
Cooperatives to develop educational case studies from the two majority employee
owned firms. These cases will be made available on the Center's website and will
offer guidance for entrepreneurs considering employee ownership as an
organizational strategy. Second, part of my agreement with the organizations
will be to share my findings and collaborate on research projects to improve
their human resource practices and increase the involvement of employees in
governance.
