The transition of shoot apical meristems from vegetative growth to flowering is
the major developmental switch in the plant life cycle. The timing of flower
initiation is obviously critical for reproductive success, and many plant
species have evolved multiple flowering pathways that are integrated to
precisely regulate flowering time. These pathways include those that monitor the
developmental state of the plant and others that sense environmental cues of
season such as photoperiod and temperature. Our recent work has demonstrated
that both developmental and environmental (temperature) sensing pathways
converge on the regulation of a repressor of flowering, FLC (FLOWERING LOCUS C).
The major goal for this proposal period is to further our understanding of the
circuitry of FLC regulation.

Advances in the understanding of how flowering pathways operate in Arabidopsis
will provide a foundation for understanding flowering-time regulation in other
species. Premature flowering is a problem in many crops in which the leaves or
roots of the plant are harvested. In other crops it is desirable to accelerate
flowering. This work will define strategies to manipulate flowering time in
Arabidopsis. Our long-term goal is to determine whether these strategies can be
used to modify flowering time and increase productivity in crop species. Funding
from this award will be used to train graduate and undergraduate students in
plant genetics and molecular biology.
