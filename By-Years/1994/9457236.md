9457236 Sah Investigations to be conducted in this project will contribute to
the development of a knowledge base for cartilage tissue engineering through
integrative experimental, theoretical, and computational studies. The principal
investigator expects to characterize the spatial variation of the biophysical
properties of articular cartilage and relate the macroscopic to the molecular
constituents. The biophysical mechanisms of cartilage repair and degeneration
are to be delineated by relating biophysical perturbations to structural and
functional responses.
