Dr. Baird is a leading investigator in the area of the biophysics and
biochemistry of receptor-mediated signal transduction in mast cells. The problem
being addressed is the development of a general method for visually observing
(by fluorescence microscopy) a few individual receptors on a single living cell.
This award is a National Science Foundation Faculty Award for Women Scientists
and Engineers. The proposal fulfills the FAW objectives, which are: 1, to
recognize outstanding and promising women scientists and engineers in academic
careers of research and teaching and 2, to facilitate the further development of
their careers.
