9512089 SHIFFRIN Attention refers to the means we use to allocate scarce mental
resources to deal with the many demands upon our cognitive systems. It is now
well established that attention applied to incoming stimuli improves perception
and memory for that material. This research will explore the converse: When as
much attention as possible is allocated to one source of incoming information,
does other arriving information receive any processing whatever? The answer is
not presently known, but has critical import for theories of cognition. The
answer also will provide crucial information needed to design training programs
for tasks with cognitive and motor components. The research will explore this
issue within the visual system. A number of letters will be presented briefly
and simultaneously in a circular array. Prior to presentation, attention will be
directed to one position in the array. Since timing will be such that
eyemovements cannot be made, movement of attention will be internal. Control
conditions will be used to verify that as much attention as possible is directed
to the cued position. Most decisions will be made about the letter presented at
the cued location, but occasionally the subject will be asked to make some
simple decision about the letter presented at a distant location. The research
will ask whether the accuracy of such decisions is greater than what would be
predicted from pure guessing. Theories of automatic processing mandate that
unattended information receives processing, but research to date, because of
some critical flaws, does not provide the needed evidence. This series of
studies is designed to provide definitive answers. It will also ask what types
of information get processed in such unattended conditions. An important feature
of the research project will be the development of a mathematical/simulation
model of attention, automatic processing, and their relationship, extending
research that has already b egun in the investigators' laboratories. ***
