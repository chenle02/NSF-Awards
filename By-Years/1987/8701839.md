The current development of low cost microprocessor components is providing an
expansion of multimicroprocessor applications to resolve problems where time-
critical needs exist. Typical application areas are robotics, nondestructive
assembly line testing, defense systems. A key difficulty in the design of such
systems is the development of the structure of the overall task(s) to be
performed and their resulting distribution over the network of processors. The
problem to be investigated is in the properties of critical real time
distributed systems as they relate to the task structuring problem, and the
corresponding development of algorithms which would be helpful to a designer in
structuring (or partitioning) a task set for this type of application. Implicit
in this work is the use of performance modelling methods to help establish the
distributed system requirements needed to insure the desired performance level
for a particular task structure. The research results will be used to develop a
prototype, interactive design aid to allow system designers to explore and
evaluate alternative task structures.
