This research project, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
Program, addresses the effect of steps on electrocatalysis and electrodeposition
on platinum single crystal electrode surfaces. The electrooxidation of formic
acid, and the deposition of Co/Pt magnetic multilayers form the main focus of
this research carried out by Professor Hector D. Abruna at Cornell University.
This work provides detailed insight into the relation between structure and
function of electroactive metals in fuel cell and magnetic material
applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The detailed understanding of the connection
between electrode surface structure and electrode chemical activity is the focus
of this research project. Using well-characterized stepped single crystal
electrodes, small organic molecule reactions are being examined. In addition,
the use of these stepped surfaces as templates for the structured deposition of
magnetic multilayers is explored in this work. The results of these studies will
provide fundamental insight into the behavior of electrocatalytic systems.
