The proposal continues the development of BOINC, a generalized platform for
supporting distributed computing projects using public-resource coputing power
and storage. The proposal addresses long-term data storage, extends accounting
and enhances personal tools for managing resources. BOINC is a next-generation
follow-on to the hugely successful Seti@Home. The new features added by this
work are meant to extend BOINC to be used by more distributed computing
projects. The proposal advances understanding and use of a powerful current-day
computing environment - public resource computing. Unique challenges are
presented in this environment, whose solutions affect the future of distributed
computing in areas ranging from security to network design and protocols.
