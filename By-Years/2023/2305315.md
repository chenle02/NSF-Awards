Low-rank matrix recovery and sampling are essential problems in contemporary
data science due to their wide-ranging applicability and direct relevance to
practical scenarios. Notably, low-rank matrix recovery algorithms have been used
in the reconstruction of molecular structure and recommender systems for
e-commerce, and sampling algorithms that have led to systems that can generate
art, text, and sound. This project tackles these problems through the lens of
mathematical optimization. The methods developed by this project utilize a
unified mathematical framework that will yield more efficient and accurate
algorithms. Additionally, the theoretical tools it develops will influence the
mathematical understanding of optimization methods more broadly. Students will
be trained in this project.

This project develops algorithms utilizing the geometry of Wasserstein space to
solve problems in matrix recovery and sampling. The geometry of Wasserstein
space, or the space of probability measures equipped with the Wasserstein
metric, is particularly rich and well-suited for data-related tasks. Over this
space, the project considers 1) the advantages of utilizing Wasserstein geometry
for variations of the matrix sensing, and 2) the utilization of gradient flows
and mirror Langevin methods to develop novel and efficient adaptive and higher-
order sampling algorithms. In each of these components, novel formulations will
be developed along with theoretical justification. In particular, the
theoretical justification will show how the geometry of Wasserstein space yields
real practical advantages over existing methods that do not properly leverage
this geometry. Applications of the proposed methods will include matrix
completion, phase retrieval and quantum tomography, training neural networks,
and sampling from generative models.
