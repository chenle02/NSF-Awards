The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will be across
multiple industries that can benefit from regular monitoring of changes on the
Earth's surface. Changes such as droughts, floods, deforestation, urbanization,
and grain supply (acreage and yields) fluctuations have considerable impact on
businesses as well as the environment. For example, it is estimated that US lost
approximately 23 billion dollars due to drought in 2012. This I-Corps project
will make use of vast amounts of satellite data to provide accurate, timely and
actionable insights about these changes to customers in various industries such
as commodity trading, crop insurance, and precision agriculture, pasture
management. Our ability to track these changes at a global scale will also
improve our understanding of the impact of climate and human induced changes on
various ecosystems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project uses machine
learning algorithms that analyze vast amounts of satellite imagery datasets to
provide near real time as well as historical information about various changes
on the Earth's surface. These algorithms were developed through various federal
research grants which includes three NSF grants. Data products created using
these algorithms have been validated to improve the state-of-the-art in several
earth science applications such as forest fire mapping, surface water dynamics,
palm oil plantation mapping, and crop mapping. The analytics technology is more
generally applicable to other domains with similar underlying data
characteristics. The commercial-use prototype will be developed with commodity
traders providing expert feedback on their most meaningful use-
cases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
