Automatic assembly sequence generation (ASG) is important for efficient
manufacturing and concurrent engineering. There are two main difficulties with
developing tools for ASG: (i) the combinatorics makes solutions by blind search
intractable and (ii) criteria for optimal assembly sequences are difficult to
formalize. Earlier work of the PI investigated the use of case-based reasoning
techniques to simultaneously address both problems with encouraging results
especially concerning the extensibility to covering large sets of problems. The
practical objective of this project is to verify these results on a larger
prototype, and thus demonstrate the usefulness of case-based assembly sequence
generation for practical applications. The theoretical objectives of this
project are to investigate new methods for adaptive learning and case matching
which will form part of the new prototype. The result of this work is a fully
implemented case-based reasoning system for a large class of assembly devices.
The conceptual results involved in building such a system should prove useful to
research in intelligent design and manufacturing systems and in case-based
reasoning field.
