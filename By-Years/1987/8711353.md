Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation in vivo causes a selective, systemic
immunosuppression. The mechanism of this effect is unknown. Based on in vivo
detailed wavelength analysis, Dr. De Fabo has hypothesized that this
immunosuppression is initiated by the photoisomerization in skin of urocanic
acid (UCA) to its cis form. Recent results from this laboratory and others have
given support to this hypothesis. Dr. De Fabo proposes to test this hypothesis
further, and has available a unique strain of mouse deficient in UCA.
Preliminary data indicate that high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) is the
most effective method of measuring trans and cis urocanic acid. Dr. De Fabo
proposes to use HPLC to quantitate both isomers of UCA in extracts of mouse skin
as a function of dose and wavelength of UV radiation to establish whether the
formation of cis UCA in vivo shows dose- response and wavelength dependency
characteristics comparable to those which produce UVB-induced immunosuppression.
He will also determine the steady state levels of both isomers in vivo and try
to determine whether urocanic acid exists in the lymphoid organs, and whether
the cis isomer, as proposed by his hypothesis, can be detected in the lymphoid
system. This award will provide HPLC equipment for use in this research. These
pioneering studies may lead to the identification of the hitherto unknown
immunoregulatory photoreceptor in mammalian skin.
