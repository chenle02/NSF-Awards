Recently, spectacular progress in the field of conformally invariant processes
has been achieved, in particular with the introduction of the SLE processes.
Thanks to these advances, it appears now possible to understand at an
unprecedented level of resolution a wide class of models, and to construct their
universal limits. The Ising model, which is probably the most studied model for
phase transitions, has seen recent breakthroughs, and its further investigation
seems very promising: it is one of the models that offer the richest behaviors
and is among the best understood from a mathematical point of view. A unified
picture, describing the limit of this model as random curves and fields,
capturing subtle geometry and boundary conditions effects, seems to be
rigorously obtainable. This picture will also deepen the comprehension of other
models and offer many applications.

Phase transitions are abrupt changes in the nature of systems: vapor that
suddently condensates into water, metals that gain supraconductivity, social
networks whose activity explode once critical mass has been reached. A major
question is to understand how such global-scale phase transitions occur in large
systems. We plan to develop tools and techniques to study models where random
macroscopic geometries arise. Such models have found applications for instance
in chemistry, image processing, ecology, economics or machine learning. Thanks
to new ideas and methods introduced in the recent years, it now appears possible
to give a more complete description of the phase transition of such models,
which will hopefully become useful tools for both theoretical and applied
researchers.
