Abstract of Dihua Jiang's proposal
(DMS-0400414)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Principal Investigator, Dihua
Jiang, works on some basic problems&lt;br/&gt;in the modern theory of
automorphic forms and L-functions. In the global&lt;br/&gt;theory, he
investigates the structures of the discrete spectrum of&lt;br/&gt;automorphic
forms and characterizes the non-vanishing of the central values&lt;br/&gt;or the
residues of automorphic L-functions in terms of periods of
automorphic&lt;br/&gt;forms, using ideas from the classical invariant theory. In
the&lt;br/&gt;local theory, his research attacks the local Langlands conjectures
and&lt;br/&gt;related basic problems in harmonic analysis of p-adic groups. His
long term&lt;br/&gt;goal is to understand the general local-global-automorphic
principles in the&lt;br/&gt;theory of automorphic forms, which reflects one of
the basic principles in&lt;br/&gt;arithmetic and number
theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theory of automorphic forms has been studied
for a long time and was&lt;br/&gt;rooted in the work of Gauss and Riemann among
others. It became early on a&lt;br/&gt;meeting ground for analysis and number
theory, and has developed as an&lt;br/&gt;indispensable tool in analytic number
theory, algebraic number theory,&lt;br/&gt;Diophantine problems, arithmetic and
algebraic geometry, and recently in&lt;br/&gt;infinite dimensional Lie algebras
and mathematical physics. The recent proof&lt;br/&gt;of the Taniyama-Shimura-
Weil conjecture on elliptic curves and the Fermat's&lt;br/&gt;last theorem are
typical examples. The modern theory of automorphic forms
and&lt;br/&gt;L-functions was developed based on the understanding of
automorphic forms&lt;br/&gt;in terms of the representation theory of and the
harmonic analysis over&lt;br/&gt;locally compact topological groups. Langlands
gave a systematic conjectural&lt;br/&gt;description of relations between
L-functions in number theory or algebraic&lt;br/&gt;geometry and those arising
in the theory of automorphic forms. Jiang's work&lt;br/&gt;is concentrated on
the basic conjectures of Langlands and applications to&lt;br/&gt;number
thoery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
