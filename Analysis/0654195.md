The most important partial differential operators in the theory of functions of
several complex variables are the Cauchy-Riemann (CR) operator and the
tangential CR- operator, obtained by restricting the CR-operator to a surface in
complex n-dimensional space. This project aims to extend in a significant way
known results concerning the tangential CR-operator and the associated system of
partial differential equations. In general, this system does not have a unique
solution, so the best that one can do is to find the unique square-integrable
solution orthogonal to the null-space of the operator. For this reason a
fundamental object of study is the Szego projection operator, which is the
orthogonal projection of the space of square-integrable functions onto the null
space of the tangential CR-operator. This operator is well understood in the
case of hypersurfaces in two-dimensional complex space that are of finite type
(which means that they are not "too flat"). Part of this project examines the
Szego projection operator for infinite-type surfaces in two-space. The approach
is to think of the operator in terms of integration against a kernel and then to
estimate the kernel function. The methods used in the finite-type case do not
extend to this setting, so new ideas are needed. The principal investigator also
intends to study the kernel for the Szego projection operator for convex
surfaces in higher dimensions. The operator is reasonably well understood in
this situation, though previous approaches have used knowledge of the Bergman
kernel rather than direct analysis of the integral kernel. An examination of the
latter should give additional insight into the nonisotropic metric that arises
in this case. Finally, the CR- operator itself will be studied for a model
non-(pseudo)convex surface in complex two-space for which estimates on the Szego
kernel exist, but for which little is known about the CR-operator itself.

Partial differential equations provide a powerful language for describing
relationships between changing quantities. Some model heat flow, others are
concerned with wave propagation, and yet others are just objects of study in
their own right. For any partial differential one is interested in solving for
unknown functions in terms of given initial data. The objective is to determine
conditions under which a solution exists, conditions under which a solution is
unique, and relationships between the properties of the given data and
properties of the solution. Although this project studies partial differential
equations that are of fundamental interest in pure rather than applied
mathematics, the new techniques developed will be much more broadly applicable.
