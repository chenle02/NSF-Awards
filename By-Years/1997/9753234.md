Highly concentrated sunlight is capable of supplying ample process heat for
chemical reactions at very high temperatures. It will be used in two activities
during this project. The first process produces an aluminum-silicon alloy from
direct carbothermal reduction of any alumina-silica containing ore. The product
is an aluminum-silicon alloy that can be either used as an alloy, or further
refined via a fractional crystallization and electrolytic separation process
developed in the late 1970's. The main challenge of this project will be to
develop a reactor suitable to utilize solar process heat, and a receiver to
contain the reactor and direct incident solar flux. This project touches two of
the most fundamental needs of the aluminum industry: the need to reduce
industry-wide dependence on the Hall-Heroult process, and the need to
economically employ other forms of aluminum ore. It holds the promise of
realizing one of the most sought-after goals of aluminum industry research since
discovery of the metal: direct reduction from ore to alloy or metal without
relying on expensive electrically-supplied process heat. It is not only the high
cost of electricity that is making the United States lose its international
competitiveness in primary aluminum manufacture. Risk is imposed by fluctuating
costs and fear of increasing energy costs. Benefits from commercialization of a
solar direct reduction process also include the possibility of locating smelting
facilities at the site of ore deposits in some cases. Use of high-temperature
solar process heat will drastically reduce emissions from the aluminum
manufacturing process.
