9630041 Resnick The New Standards Project (a partnership of states and urban
districts) proposes to develop an on-demand test for science. Such a test is
needed by state-level, district-level, and university partnerships that are
engaged in standards-based reform as a way to measure their progress. New
Standards will build upon recent work in performance assessment in science and
collect, adapt, and develop a balance of tasks of various lengths and formats
that are mapped to performance standards. They will conduct item and test
validity studies, review all aspects of item development for accuracy and
assemble a test that meets practical constraints for administration. Design and
implementation will be carried out at the University of California, Office of
the President, Technical quality assurance will be done by the Learning Research
and Development Center, and Science and Equity quality assurance will be carried
out by the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
