The general goal of the research is to develop a new framework for advancing
model representations of cloud and convective processes by integrating
paleoclimate data and climate model simulations. Specifically, the research
strategy consists of three main objectives: (1) conduct fully coupled, isotope-
enabled simulations for the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), mid-Holocene (MH), and
pre-industrial (PI) time periods using a wide ensemble of cloud and convective
parameter sets; (2) perform paleoclimate data assimilation on the perturbed
parameter ensemble (PPE) using sea surface temperature (SST) and water isotope
proxies, respectively; and (3) use the posteriors from the LGM, MH, and PI
assimilations to identify which cloud and convection parameters provide the best
match to the proxy data, then conduct present-day and doubled carbon dioxide
(CO2) experiments with these parameter sets to calculate a narrowed estimate of
equilibrium climate sensitivity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Equilibrium climate
sensitivity (ECS) is a key climate metric that quantifies the rise in global
mean surface temperature in response to doubling of atmospheric CO2 relative to
PI levels. Changes in hydroclimate, temperature extremes, and other aspects of
the climate system in future projections are closely tied to a modelâ€™s ECS. For
decades, estimates of ECS have remained wide despite improvements from using
multiple lines of evidence. One persistent source of this spread is related to
cloud and convective processes, which occur at scales too small to be explicitly
resolved, and thus require parameterizations to be represented in climate
models. This project seeks to address this issue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
potential Broader Impacts include improvement in climate models, school term and
summer internship experience for a high school teacher and graduate student in
collaboration with NASA, involvement of undergraduate students in research
through the Garden State Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority
Participation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
