This research is concerned with the study of the electronic properties of
thermodynamically stable quasicrystals. Recent results have shown several of
these icosahedral crystals possess unusual electronic properties which may be
related to exotic electronic states predicted by theorists. The present research
aims to study the structural, atomic-potential and dimensionality effects by
measuring the magneto-conductivity, thermopower, Hall effect, and specific heat
of several selected and well characterized two- and three-dimensional
quasicrystals and their amorphous and crystalline analogs. The possibliity of
establishing localized states in the supposedly metallic quasicrystals with
strong atomic potentials will be examined. The study will continue to
investigate fine structure in the density-of-states, which is central to recent
theoretical predictions. The magnetic phases of 2D and 3D quasicrystals and in
the new aluminum glasses with both well defined magnetic sites and localized
moments by neutron scattering and magnetic measurements. Spin structures in
real-space and in hypercubic lattices will be analyzed.
