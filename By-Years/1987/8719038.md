This project will result in the construction of an automated system for
measuring elastic constants and sound velocities in minerals at high
temperatures up to 1800 K. The design and construction of the apparatus will be
carried out in the Mineral Physics Laboratory of the Institute of Geophysics and
Planetary Physics at UCLA. The importance of the measurements that will be made
possible by the equipment is tied to fact that geophysical models of the
structure of the Earth's interior are partly based on estimates of the velocity
of propagation of sound waves at in situ temperatures. The measurement of sound
velocities with the new instrumentation will be carried out on the class of
minerals considered likely to be present in the mantle and will play an
important role in testing and refining models of the interior.
