ABSTRACT

PI: Feng, Wei and Lu, Xin Proposal: DMS-0139710 Institution: University of North
Carolina at Wilmington

The Fourth International Conference on Dynamical Systems and Differential
Equations will be held at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington on May
24-May 27, 2002. This is a continuation of the Conference Series on Dynamical
Systems and Differential Equations, a biennial event with a new hosting
university each time to benefit researchers in USA. Details, including history
of past conference series, can be found at http://AIMsciences.org. The goal of
this conference is to gather mathematicians and scientists, with different
training backgrounds and research interests, to report on their recent
achievements, exchange new ideas and look for future directions.

A majority of the NSF funds will be used specifically for partial support of 35
graduate students and ten new Ph-D's in mathematics. Priority will be given for
support of students from under-represented groups in mathematics.
