ABSTRACT OPP-9523941 This Small Grant for Exploratory Research will support
archaeological, geological and archaeological surveys of karst and sea cave
sites in southeastern Alaska. Initial surveys have rendered spectacular cave
paintings, well-preserved organic materials, and evidence that the region had
deglaciated from ca 16,000 BP. This project will contribute to the knowledge of
Quaternary sea/land relationships and geomorphology, marine and terrestrial
biotic communities, and early human settlement along the northern coastal
corridor of North America. Surveys will be conducted in conjunction with the
U.S. Forest Service and the National Speleological Society. *** ??
