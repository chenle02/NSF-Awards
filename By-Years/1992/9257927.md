This 1992 National Science Foundation Young Investigators (NYI) grant focuses on
the development of advanced computational methods for modeling electromagnetic
wave propagation within complex heterogeneous medium. In particular, integral
equation formulations, vector finite element analysis incorporating radiation
boundary- conditions, and new hybrid numerical-asymptotic methods will be the
focus for development.
