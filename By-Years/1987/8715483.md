This award will support the participation of U.S. scientists in a seminar on the
"Basic Mechanisms of Helium Heat Transfer and Related Influence on Stability of
Superconducting Magnets," organized jointly by Professor T.H.K. Frederking of
the University of California, Los Angeles and Professor Takehiro Ito of Kyushu
University, Japan. United States and Japanese participants will meet at Kyushu
University in Fukuoka, Japan August 29 to September 2, 1988. The seminar will
focus on: (1) recent progress in understanding the basic mechanisms of helium
heat transfer in various fluid domains; (2) various stability concepts proposed
for superconductors and magnets; and (3) research and development needs in
various areas of cooling technology in the light of technical feasibility,
reliability, economics and type of magnet application. Scientists in both the
United States and Japan have made significant recent advances in the areas of
magnet heat transfer and related magnet stability. This seminar will provide a
timely interface between these two areas of research as magnet technology is
impacted by the emergence of high transition temperature superconductors.
