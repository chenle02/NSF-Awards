Two major foundations of modern microeconomic theory are the concepts of
efficiency and that of equilibria. These concepts are of practical significance
as well, for efficiency is a frequent objective of policy analysis, and an
equilibrium is taken as a close approximation to what would happen under various
policy alternatives. This project is based on a new approach to the study of
competitive equilibria, using two new optimization principles These principles
lead very naturally to algorithms to actually compute economic equilibria, and
these algorithms offer advantages over existing methods in terms of execution
time and reliability. This project extends the theory, mainly in the area of
economies with externalities, and continues the development of algorithms. The
work in this project is based on two optimization principles that characterize
economic equilibria and efficiency. These principles lead to a new proof of the
existence of a general competitive equilibrium, to new characterizations of
economic efficiency in the presence of externalities, and to new algorithms for
computing equilibria. Underlying this work is a new microeconomic construct
termed the benefit function. This function measures an individual's preferences
and has the property that it can be meaningfully summed across individuals to
obtain a total benefit for the economy. The first optimization principle, the
zero-maximum principle, states that an allocation of resources is efficient if
and only if it maximizes the total benefit and makes that benefit equal to zero.
The second optimization principle, the zero-minimum principle, is the dual to
the first. It states that the total surplus of income, equal to the total value
of profit plus endowment minus the total consumer expenditure required to
achieve fixed preference levels, is minimized the rendered equal to zero by an
efficient price vector.
