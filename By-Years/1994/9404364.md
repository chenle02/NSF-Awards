The research project will include theoretical investigation of delta degrees of
freedom in trinuclei as probed by the electromagnetic interaction. Emphasis will
be on the effect of delta degrees of freedom for electromagnetic processes at
intermediate energies in order to provide reliable theoretical estimates and
analysis for several proposed electron scattering experiments to be carried out
at the Bates-MIT Electron Linear Accelerator Center and the Continuous Electron
Beam Accelerator Facility.
