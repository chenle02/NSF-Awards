Particle channeling occurs when an energetic charged particle beam is aligned
with a major crystal axis or plane. Channeling has contributed in important ways
to our understanding of particle motion in solids at the fundamental level and
just as significantly has led to numerous applications in physics and
technology. Furthermore, channeling is a new source of interesting and
challenging mathematical problems in dynamical systems and stochastic processes.
A complete understanding of channeling requires detailed knowledge of the
channeling particle motion and the spatial and momentum densities of the
particles as they penetrate the crystal. Ellison's mathematical approach to the
study of channeling will continue including: channeling effects in strain-layer
superlattices and other distorted crystals, channeling radiation and related
quantum electrodynamical processes; multiple scattering effects viewed as
particle motion in a random media; and channeling in perfect crystals viewed
within the context of dynamical systems. This research will deepen our knowledge
of channeling, extend its usefulness and lead to new applications. Furthermore,
the dynamical systems and probabilistic methods developed to solve these
problems will be of general applicability and will have importance in other
areas of mathematical science.
