We are establishing a microcomputer laboratory to provide laboratory-based
instruction to all majors in critical lower- level required sociology courses as
well as to provide a variety of opportunities for student research related to
New York City in these and upper-level seminars. The clustered workstations
permit students to share data and software, and to connect to the Internet via
the City University of New York mainframe. With this laboratory, we can more
effectively train students in Sociology and empirical social research, enhance
their quantitative and analytic skills, and encourage as well as equip them for
scientific careers, including teaching. These are important goals for any
student body, but especially so for minority women who are seriously
underrepresented in science and often hampered in their pursuit of scientific
careers by feelings of inadequacy and anxiety surrounding math, computers, and
quantitative reasoning.
