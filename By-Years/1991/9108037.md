The general problem of nonparametric function fitting is how best to determine
a smooth function which represents "noisy" data without making strong
assumptions about the nature of the function beforehand. When a function of
several variables is sought, both conceptual and computational problems increase
in complexity; and extensions of one-dimensional techniques may or may not work,
for example in applying standard estimation techniques over irregularly shaped
regions or subspaces. This proposal addresses the construction and evaluation of
an efficient class of estimators of characteristics of the unknown function and
particularly of its integral.
