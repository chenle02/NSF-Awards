This highly interdisciplinary symposium will bring together scientists from
academia and industry to discuss the significant advances and opportunities in
designing, producing, and using materials that are inspired by biology. The
topics of the symposium will include polymeric materials, colloidal systems, and
inorganic materials with applications ranging from photonic band gap materials
to bone engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because the organizers plan to target
at least 25% of the talks (oral and poster) to be given by graduate students and
postdoctoral fellows, and others by young faculty, this symposium will provide
an excellent opportunity for these young scientists to establish academic and/or
industrial collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;
