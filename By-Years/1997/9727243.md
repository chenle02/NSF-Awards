This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program
provides continued support for research on carboxylate-bridged metal dimers by
Dr. Stephen J. Lippard, Chemistry Department, Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. Metalloproteins containing such units are responsible for many
biological functions, including oxygen transport, methane hydroxylation, and
hydrolysis of phosphate esters. In this study, three lines of investigation will
be pursued: oxidation chemistry of diiron complexes as models for the active
site of the hydroxylase component of methane monooxygenase; metallohydrolase
chemistry that mimics urease and metalophosphatase; and sugar isomerization
reactions to model D-xylose isomerase. Emphasis will be placed on designing
dinucleating ligands that have sufficient internal preorganization so that they
fold into shapes that create the appropriate cavities for metal binding. One
class of ligands is dicarboxylates in which two Kemp's triacid anhydride-
chloride moities are linked by a bridging 1,3-diaminoxylene,
1,4-diaminophthalazine, or bis(aminomethylphenyl)porphyrin group. Symmetric and
unsymmetrically substituted amidinate ligands, that are isoelectronic with
carboxylate, will also be investigated. Attempts will also be made to
functionalize mono-carboxylate bridged systems using a multicomponent ligand
with two terminal bidentate units joined by one bridging carboxylate spacer. The
compounds synthesized will be tested to see the extent to which they mimic the
structures, physical properties, and reactivities of the biological prototypes,
including intermediates in catalytic cycles. Many biologically-important
hydroxylases, hydrolases, and isomerases function because of a reaction center
that contains two linked metal atoms and a surrounding carboxylate group. In
order to understand the details of how these enzymes work, model compounds will
be designed, synthesized, and tested for catalytic activity.
