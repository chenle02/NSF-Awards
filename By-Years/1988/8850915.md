This 1.5-year project will prepare elementary school teachers in rural, western
Minnesota to teach mathematics in a manner that is consistent with the new NCTM
Standards. Ten teams, each consisting of two teachers and a principal, will
participate in a summer workshop that includes instruction in mathematics
content and methodology, demonstration teaching with children, and preparation
of an inservice program for participants' colleagues. Academic-year contact will
be maintained through use of a telecommunications network, visits by project
staff to participants' schools, and two group meetings. Concordia College and
the participants' school districts will contribute as cost-sharing an amount
equal to 27% of the NSF award.
