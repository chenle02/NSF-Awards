94-19501 Johnson This award by NSF will support laboratory measurements of
sputtering from surfaces of a range of materials. Sputtering from these
materials simulates similar processes, induced by UV radiation, electrons, and
ions, on the surfaces of small and large bodies in the outer solar system (in
particular, comets, satellites, planetary rings). Effects of thermal sublimation
rates of the irradiated samples will also be studied. The research, which
includes numerical modeling to interpret the laboratory measurements, is
expected to lead to an improved understanding of the physical and chemical
changes caused by sputtering. This understanding will be crucial for
interpreting observational data of bodies in the solar system as well as of the
interstellar medium (i.e., interstellar grains). It is expected that the
research will be exceptionally productive because of the investigators' skills
and outstanding past performance, their state-of-the-art laboratory facility,
and the current dearth of reliable data in this research area.
