There are usually several sources of sound that we hear, all at the same time,
yet the auditory system is quite good at segregating which sound components come
from which source. A sound source which is localized and identified based on its
acoustic properties has been called an "auditory image" and may depend on
several features such as the frequency, intensity, and pattern of its acoustic
spectrum. This project investigates the role that coherent amplitude modulation
(AM) may play in the formation and segregation of auditory images. Processing of
AM is evaluated with psychophysical detection, discrimination, and masking
procedures, to examine both how information on the modulation is extracted, and
how this information is combined across frequency regions to aid auditory image
formation. Specific models will be tested along with computer simulations of
subject performance. The experiments use novel approaches to important questions
of complex auditory functions, and results from this basic work also are likely
to have some impact on automated speech recognition systems and aids for the
hearing impaired.
