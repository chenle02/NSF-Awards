This action funds Craig Andrew Milroy of the University of Texas, Austin to
conduct a research project, entitled "Improving the properties of conductive
polymers for biomaterials, renewable energy, and water purification membranes,"
during the summer of 2012 at the University of Wollongong in Wollongong, New
South Wales. The host scientist is Professor Gordon Wallace.

The Intellectual Merit is to improve the properties of conducting polymers for
use in water-purification membranes, biomedical devices, and flexible
electronics. The proposed research optimizes the electromechanical properties of
a novel composite material that incorporates the electrical conductivity of
polypyrrole and the elastic properties of polyurethane.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.

In addition, the lack of inexpensive high-performance materials currently places
an enormous burden on industry and society. As such, this highly-conductive and
elastic material under study could have immediate application as a tissue
engineering scaffold for neural and cardiac tissue regrowth, as well as for
ultra-high throughput separation and water-purification membranes, polymer
battery electrodes, artificial muscles, high-strength textiles, implantable
sensors, and high-performance clothing for defense, healthcare, and emergency
services.
