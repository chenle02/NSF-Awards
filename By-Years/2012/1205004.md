This award is a Planning Grant for an Unconventional Shale Oil and Gas
Technology Center of Excellence. While conventional oil and gas exploration has
existed since the mid-1850s, rapid changes in the technology allowing the
recovery of natural gas and oil that is bound up in shale formations has
resulted in game-changing opportunities for US energy production and has changed
the demand for and nature of the skills needed by technicians. This award allows
Pennsylvania College of Technology to plan to develop an ATE Regional Center of
Excellence that will work with employers across the Appalachian Basin to create
educational programs that will meet current and future needs for technicians in
a wide variety of technology specialties in service and energy companies. The
goal is to develop educational programs and products that will be useful to
other institutions in responding to the dynamic, ever changing unconventional
oil and gas industry. Core activities of the proposed Center include the
identification of promising practices for the recruitment of underrepresented
groups (women, minorities, persons with disabilities, and veterans) and the
development of plans to influence participation by these groups in oil and gas
STEM-related technician occupations.
