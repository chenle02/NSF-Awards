9452474 Danielson Although electrophoresis is a very important analytical tool
for biochemistry and the life sciences, it is rarely considered as part of an
analytical instrumental laboratory course. Capillary electrophoresis (CE) is a
relatively new technique that can demonstrate both the separation power and
quantitative capability of electrophoresis in a short period of time. Our
undergraduate students are carrying out CE experiments that demonstrate the
separation of closely related compounds such as optical isomers as well as the
basic theory. A comparison of CE to standard gel electrophoresis is also being
made. Both techniques have good resolution capability but only CE is amenable to
facile quantitation. In addition, two undergraduate research projects, one in
analytical chemistry and one in biochemistry, are using the capillary
electrophoresis instrument.
