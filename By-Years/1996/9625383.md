Gelfand Recent computational advances have made it feasible to fit hierarchical
models in a wide range of serious applications. With this capacity various
issues in model determination arise. This research studies the selection of a
best model within a collection of such models. It concerns itself with the
trade-off between goodness of fit and parsimony and the inappropriateness or
shortcomings of customary criteria. The research also addresses the matter of
model adequacy. With hierarchical models, model failures can occur at each
stage. Approaches for identifying the existence of such failures and their
nature are examined by the investigator. Finally, for hierarchical models
hyperprior specification is often vague. This work considers conditions under
which the resultant posterior is a proper distribution. The modern intellectual
contribution of statistics is modeling and inference. In working with scientists
from other fields, the statistician helps to formulate appropriate models for
the scientists' problems and data as well as to indicate how inference can be
developed which provides answers to the questions which motivated the
scientists' investigations. With the wide availability of high speed computing,
increasingly sophisticated models are being considered permitting the research
effort to focus on the determination of the most appropriate model for the
application rather than having to settle for an obviously inadequate one.
Nonetheless, models must offer some simplification or else they are no easier to
understand than the complex phenomenon they are modeling. This research
addresses several important issues in the process of determining a satisfying
model.
