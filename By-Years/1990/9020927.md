Participation by U.S. astronomers in the meetings of the International
Astronomical Union (IAU) is important. Over one- quarter of the active U.S.
research astronomers are working on projects in collaboration with foreign
scientists. Several large foreign instruments which have unique capabilities are
routinely used by U.S. astronomers. The largest and most important international
meeting is the General Assembly of the IAU. Unlike many other international
scientific unions, the IAU emphasizes scientific sessions and presentation of
research results. It is important for the continued health of astronomy in the
U.S. that American scientists be able to participate in these meetings. The IAU
meets every 3 years. The IAU General Assembly will meet in Buenos Aires,
Argentina July 23 to August 1, 1991. The American Astronomical Society (AAS)
will organize a program of grants for travel to attend the IAU General Assembly
and its associated meetings. Applications for travel to the General Assembly
will be accepted by the AAS, and awards will be decided by a selection committee
chosen by the U.S. National Committee for the IAU. The travel grant program will
be publicized by the AAS at its meetings and through continuing announcements in
the AAS Newsletter.
