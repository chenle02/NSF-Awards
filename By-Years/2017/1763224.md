The PI requests that the CCSS program, within the ECCS Division of the
Engineering Directorate at the NSF, to support a workshop titled workshop titled
"Workshop on Intelligent Cognitive Assistants (ICA)" to be held at IBM Almaden
Research Center, San Jose, CA on November 14-15,2017. The goal of the workshop
titled "Workshop on Intelligent Cognitive Assistants (ICA)" is to identify gaps
in science, engineering and technology for developing intelligent, energy-
efficient, brain-inspired perception and corresponding devices and systems to
support human daily activities and address emerging
applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed ICA workshop will gather experts
from fields spanning psychology, sociology, artificial intelligence and machine
learning, robotics, computer science and engineering, to identify the highest
priority research needed to address the scientific and engineering challenges of
creating the most effective and beneficial Intelligent Assistant-Human
collaboration to address applications such as: elder care, autonomous vehicles,
smarter communities, and workplace activities.
