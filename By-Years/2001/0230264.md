The proposed research seeks to quantify the contribution of surface ocean
currents to the interannual variability in fresh water transport from the Arctic
into the Greenland and Labrador seas. It will then investigate links among this
variability and atmospheric forcing, with an emphasis on modes of variability
such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and will assess the roles of
buoyancy fluxes and mechanical mixing in mixed layer depth as this relates to
fresh water export from the Arctic. This research builds on past work by the
same investigator and will integrate a 3-D, coupled ice-ocean model run for 53
years using NCEP atmospheric forcing. A simpler coupled model using a two-layer
ocean will also be run, using idealized forcing and geometry, in order to
clarify individual dynamic modes of the ocean-ice system and help to interpret
the 3-D model simulations.
