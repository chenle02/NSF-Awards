Parallel programming has become increasingly common with the advent
of&lt;br/&gt;"multi-core" computer chips that pack many processors into a
single&lt;br/&gt;chip. Most standard laptop and desktop computers now come with
anywhere&lt;br/&gt;from two to thirty-two such cores. Such chips offer
unprecedented computing power, but at a price: to&lt;br/&gt;extract their full
potential, programmers writing software for the new&lt;br/&gt;chips must use
special programming language "libraries" in order to&lt;br/&gt;specify how the
program is to do two (or more) things at once. One&lt;br/&gt;popular such
library is called OpenMP. These so-called parallel&lt;br/&gt;programs are
notoriously difficult to get right, and many contain&lt;br/&gt;undetected
defects ("bugs") that can cause the program to crash or&lt;br/&gt;produce
incorrect results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CIVL project has the potential to
dramatically reduce the effort&lt;br/&gt;required to develop new static analysis
tools. The key idea is a&lt;br/&gt;unified language for describing parallel
programs, whether these use&lt;br/&gt;MPI, OpenMP, or both. One tool translates
the original program into&lt;br/&gt;the new language, also called CIVL. Other
tools perform static&lt;br/&gt;analysis on the CIVL program. Eventually, many
other parallel&lt;br/&gt;libraries will be added to the new system. The
advantage of this&lt;br/&gt;approach is that the designer of a new static
analysis tool need only&lt;br/&gt;design the tool for a single language---CIVL
---but then gets a tool&lt;br/&gt;that works on all the source libraries "for
free". Similarly, when a&lt;br/&gt;new parallel library comes along, by
developing a translator from it&lt;br/&gt;to CIVL, one can immeidately reap the
benefits of all the static&lt;br/&gt;analysis tools. The researchers expect that
the resulting platform&lt;br/&gt;will make it much easier to develop correct
parallel programs, no&lt;br/&gt;matter how that parallelism is expressed.
