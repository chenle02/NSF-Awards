ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OCE-0326646&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds have been
requested to support the participation of U.S. scientists, graduate students and
post doctoral fellows in the 8th International Estuarine Biogeochemistry
Symposium to be held in Solomons, Maryland in May, 2004. Meeting logistic
support also is requested. During this meeting, presentations and discussions
will cover the following areas of interest: (1) investigations at boundaries
such as sediment-water, water-air, the pycnocline, shifts in redox conditions,
and land-estuary interfaces with emphasis on groundwater sources and
interactions; (2) process studies, especially those involving time-series; (3)
particulate-water interactions with a focus on organic matter/trace metal
interactions, storage/fate of organic carbon and biological activities; (4)
modeling efforts and (5) new technical/analytical approaches. The symposium
plans to spotlight research efforts taking place in Chesapeake Bay and similar
systems in other countries. Results from the symposium will be published most
likely in a special edition of the journal Marine Chemistry. &lt;br/&gt;
