This project is a workshop that brings together educators from the military
academies, the Centers of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance
Education, and the commercial sector to facilitate discussion, definition, and
planning for a National Cyber Defense Exercise. Such an exercise will provide
civilian universities significant educational benefits related to computer
network security, as has already been demonstrated by experience with the
service academies Cyber Defense Exercise. This workshop determines the structure
of such an exercise among several civilian universities, using lessons learned
from the originators of the original exercise at the United States Military
Academy (West Point). Funds for this workshop cover a meeting of a small
steering committee prior to the workshop, and production a report about the
workshop and communicating those results to appropriate audiences. This
resultant workshop designed to allow multiple independent universities to use
the Exercise as a supporting tool in developing their own creative and original
solutions to teaching and research about computer security and information
assurance. And the Exercise will broaden the knowledge and expertise about
defending computer security beyond the students at the military
institutions.&lt;br/&gt;
