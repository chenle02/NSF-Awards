The research will provide basic information for the preparation of a fiber
optic probe for lithium ion based on new fluorescent lithium ion carriers
immobilized on fiber optic bundles by Langmuir-Blodgett (L-B) film techniques.
This is a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) award. In Phase I four new
florescent ionophores were synthesized. One of these has greater sensitivity and
great Li/Na selectivity than any other fluorescent ionophore reported in the
literature and is suitable for preparation of L-B films. In the current Phase II
additional analogs of these ionophores which will have absorption and emission
in the visible spectrum will be evaluated. Those having the best optical
characteristics and specificity for lithium, when prepared as L-B films, will be
used to prepare fiber optic probes. These will be evaluated as sensors for
determination of lithium in blood serum.
