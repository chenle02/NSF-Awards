A model is proposed for the structural design process for buildings which
enables a computer-based representation of the contents and intent of the
governing Building Code Specification. This computer-based representation will
be easily accessed, readily understood by structural design engineers, amenable
to straightforward updating as the Specification evolves, and compatible with
existing procedure-based design software as well as with evolving knowledge-
based design software. The enabling technology will be demonstrated by
implementing an electronic version of the LRFD Specification for steel
buildings. The results will be a computer design tool that can be delivered as a
layered product to give a range of capabilities, from a tutorial package to a
software development environment, extensible to other design philosophies and
other construction materials.
