This Targeted Research track project is exploring a digital library framework
based on peer-to-peer networks that leverage existing digital library efforts
such as the Open Archives Initiative and the Kepler project. The investigators
are developing new models for building digital libraries that are self-
sustainable and support evolving communities of interest. A key aspect of this
approach is to build a network with nodes clustered by access patterns. Major
challenges being addressed include: (a) keeping the network connected in the
presence of frequent joining, re-joining, and leaving of participants; (b)
maintaining a low technology barrier for building communities with diverse
interests; and (c) supporting communities in ways that accommodate their
evolving interests.&lt;br/&gt;
