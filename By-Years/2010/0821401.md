The National Science Foundation has awarded Duquesne University funds to acquire
a capillary liquid chromatograph coupled to a tandem mass spectrometer, with the
associated computer programs for analyzing data. Acquisition of this instrument
enables broad expansion of research and educational capability, because it
offers access to measurement capability that is currently not possible at
Duquesne University. Examples of experiments include mapping out how biological
systems carry out the complex business of building and tearing down fatty
molecules that comprise the structure of cells and act as signal carriers within
cells; measuring the biological consequences of exposure to heavy metals species
(arsenic, chromium, and mercury species) on a chronic basis; and developing
definitive standards for measuring and identifying, accurately, chemical and
biological molecules that pose a health threat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These
experiments improve the understanding of how complex biological systems operate,
and they provide information needed to protect the population from environmental
threats, either acute or chronic. The consortium of colleges and universities
that we have developed will facilitate the training of new generations of
undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral associates in the
most modern scientific measurement methods. Undergraduate women and ethnic
groups that are traditionally under-represented in the sciences will be among
those carrying out this research. Duquesne University thereby becomes a central
regional resource and a leader in education and training for potential
scientists.
