This research is based on the theme of using algorithmic techniques to enhance
the performance and flexibility of parallel architectures. Specific projects
span a spectrum from traditional topics, such as task scheduling and load
balancing, to less familiar ones, such as using emulations to achieve
architectural flexibility (e.g., reconfigurability); from foundational questions
concerning the potential and the limitations of various modalities of
computation and communication (e.g., the limitations of bufferless
communication), to more immediately applicable studies of algorithmic techniques
that endow a parallel architecture with facilities that would be prohibitively
expensive to provide in hardware (e.g., a multigauging capability). The program
is motivated by three observations: (1) the speed of processors in parallel
architectures increases faster than the speed of the communication subsystem;
(2) the potential of parallel computation is realized only when programmers are
liberated from having to manage the detailed physical resources (number of
processors, interconnection topology, etc.) of their machines; (3) technological
developments are continually creating new modalities of parallel computation.
All three of these phenomena increase the importance of developing algorithms
that enhance the computing power of parallel architectures. Observation (1)
suggests that we can now relegate to software chores that previously demanded
the speed and concomitant cost of hardware implementation. Observation (2)
points out the increasing need for algorithms that enhance the portability of
parallel programs. Observation (3) suggests the need to understand emerging
modalities of parallel computation, in order to exploit them effectively.
