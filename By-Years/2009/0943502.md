In plants, hydraulic failure in the water transport system, the xylem, is caused
by the introduction of gas bubbles and formation of embolisms in individual
conducting cells. The fact that plants can repair xylem embolisms even when
their hydraulic systems are under considerable tension has remained one of plant
science's most puzzling and important mysteries - the mechanisms underlying this
repair are essentially unknown despite evidence the phenomenon occurs in a wide
variety of plant species. This research will test a novel hypothesis about a
physical mechanism of embolism repair under tension. The research will be
conducted with shrub species from field sites across North America. Measurements
to be conducted include the percent loss of conductance due to embolism
formation, gas contents in root and stem xylem in the field and under controlled
conditions in the lab, as well as dye-tracer and anatomical studies to determine
the pathways of water movement during embolism formation and repair. The
research could potentially be transformative for plant biology by establishing
mechanisms by which plants sustain water transport under high tension in the
presence of abundant gas in their water transport cells. The proposed activity
will help to fund a Ph.D. student and a postdoctoral position. At Cal State
Fullerton, the project will include active involvement of undergraduate students
in the research, including a large number of students from underrepresented
groups. The research potentially will have implications for application in
horticulture and agriculture, most directly for sustainable irrigation
management practices of woody fruit crops.
