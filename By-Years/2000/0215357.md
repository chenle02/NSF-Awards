The objective of this project is to improve understanding of the heterogeneous
chemical kinetics of atmospheric particles. The P.I.s will study laboratory-
generated atmospheric particles composed of cores of elemental carbon coated
with organic layers and determine the chemical kinetics of reactions in the
layers with ozone. The specific goals of the research are: (1) to generate
particles composed of cores of elemental carbon with organic, (2) to determine
the chemical kinetics of reactions in the layers with ozone, as dependent on the
qualitative layering characteristics, such as thickness and chemical type, (3)
to quantify interactions of the layers and the ozone reaction kinetics with
relative humidity, and (4) to investigate the response of the aerosol mass
spectrometer as a qualitative and quantitative analytical instrument for these
types of organic particles. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this
work will be an improved understanding of heterogeneous processes in the
atmosphere that are important for human health, climate change, and air quality.
This project will also foster international collaborations and provide
opportunities for graduate training.
