The goal of this work is to develop a better fundamental understanding of the
actuation and force sensing required for micromanipulation (objects from 5-500
microns) by exploring the following hypothesis: it is possible to manipulate
micro-sized rigid and flexible objects while measuring physical properties, such
as stiffness, by using the same microfinger to act simultaneously as an actuator
and sensor. This hypothesis is explored both theoretically and experimentally by
creating a set of smaller and smaller microgrippers. Two models, one analytical,
the other numeric, of this new microfinger will be developed to predict
performance as a function of size. Experiments using actual microgrippers verify
the quality of the model.

The work impacts science, education, and outreach to minority populations. A
compliant microgripper is an enabling technology to manipulate flexible and
fragile bio-objects for applications in bioengineering, microbiology and
genomics. A microgripper squeezes an oocyte to determine its viability by
measuring the stiffness of the cell before subsequent injection of DNA or RNA,
turning tedious manual procedures into programmed, automatic sequences, thereby
reducing cost. New ways of detecting diseases, such as malaria, by measuring
physical properties of cells with the microgripper become possible. Broader
impacts include education and outreach. Great emphasis is spent on having
supported students give talks about this technology at local middle schools and
high schools to entice the next generation to become engineers. These talks
improve the professional capabilities of the graduate students while
simultaneously demonstrating to young students the purpose of studying math and
science.
