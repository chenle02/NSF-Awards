DMI-9631224 Danyluk Chemo-mechanical polishing (CMP) chemically enhances removal
of the surface layers of metals, oxides, and polymers in manufacturing large-
scale integrated circuits. It is an alternative process to reactive ion etching
(RIE) of semiconductor device, polishing of other non-metallic systems such as
quartz for laser windows, and silicon nitride ball bearing. The university has
been developing hydrodynamic models for the tribological contact between a
polishing pad and a silicon or silicon dioxide surface, measuring fluid film
thickness, constructing sensors for the situ measurement of wear rates, and
developing models for the wear of silicon dioxide. This project provides an
opportunity for two graduate students to spend three months of summer in
industry implementing and applying the experimental techniques and models to the
polishing of silicon dioxide (dielectric). This collaboration will lead to am
improved understanding of CMP through (1) the implementation of models and
measurement techniques developed at the university; and (2) the knowledge gained
through industry experience and the need for production of consumable and CMP
tools.
