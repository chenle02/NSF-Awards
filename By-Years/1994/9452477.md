9452477 Olson A laboratory improvement program has been proposed to integrate
and modernize the laboratory components of three environmental engineering
courses: "Environmental Chemistry for Environmental Engineering", "Physical-
Chemical Processes", and "Microbial Processes". The project will involve the
development of three new pairs of laboratory exercises that will help to
reinforce key topics between the classes. In addition, the new exercises will
illustrate the fundamental relationships between chemical and microbial systems,
provide the opportunity to analyze more realistic complex samples, and expose
engineering students to modern instruments in gas chromatography and
spectrophotometry that they currently do not have access to. Among the equipment
items requested, the two major instruments include a gas chromatograph and a
scanning spectrophotometer. A few additional equipment pieces that support the
new types of proposed exercises are also requested. By the fall of 1994, the
program will acquire new dedicated wet-laboratory space for undergraduate
environmental engineering instruction. This laboratory will be used primarily by
undergraduate majors in Environmental Engineering, a brand new baccalaureate
program, and by Civil Engineering majors who specialize in environmental
engineering. The current enrollments in each of the three classes are in the
range of 35 to 55. While some State of California funds are available to equip
this new laboratory, the amount available falls short of what is needed to
significantly modernize the facilities. The requested equipment will greatly
improve our ability, therefore, to provide an exceptional laboratory experience
for this new degree program.
