9403360 Gilkey The research covers a number of topics in the overlapping areas
of geometry, analysis and topology. These mainly involve questions of spectral
geometry and invariants, in particular the eta-invariant and asymptotics related
to heat equation techniques for manifolds with boundary. The research has
potential applications to other areas of mathematics, particularly topology, as
well as to operator theory in mathematical physics. ***
