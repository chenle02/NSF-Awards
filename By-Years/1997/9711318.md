Scranton OCE-9711318 ABSTRACT In this continuation of her ongoing research, the
principal investigator will study how organic carbon is remineralized under
anaerobic conditions in the water column of the Cariaco Basin of Venezuela.
Because the transition from fully oxygenated to completely sulfidic water occurs
over considerable depth, she will be able to study details of anaerobic carbon
cycling that would be difficult in the great majority of other accessible marine
systems. This project is a component of Project CARIACO, a larger, multi-
investigator time-series study of the Cariaco Basin.
