9452317 Ross An interactive computer laboratory will be established for use both
by non science majors studying physical science and by physics majors. As the
centerpiece of this project, non science majors will use the computers for
hands-on manipulation and interpretation of images obtained from weather
satellites. Thus, students taking Introduction to Meteorology, Introduction to
Geology and Introduction to Astronomy will gain meaningful scientific experience
through the analysis of data presented graphically rather than numerically. The
laboratory will allow nonscience majors to work directly with remote sensing
data. High-resolution images from both geostationary and polar orbiting
environmental satellites will be received and stored. These will include images
showing visible features, temperature features and water vapor content. The
images will be retrievable for study either individually or in "animation loops"
which show the changes occurring over a 24-hour period. The laboratory will also
be a powerful tool for physics majors, who will use the computers for
interactive modeling of physical systems and graphical analysis of data obtained
in physics laboratories.
