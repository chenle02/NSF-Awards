The long term objective in the proposed studies is to learn more about the
cytoskeletal elements associated with the cell membrane in eukaryotic cells,
with particular reference to discovering the molecular basis for regional
differentiation within and associated with such structures. The basic approach
will be to study four specific polypeptides which have been identified as core
proteins within the membrane skeleton of the ciliated protozooan, Tetrahymena.
Though globally distributed, these proteins are concentrated and highly
patterned within the oral apparatus. The four polypeptides have been purified,
and they will be characterized by antibodies, peptide mapping, in vitro
assembly, and microsequencing. These techniques will make possible comparisons
with vertebrate cytoskeletal proteins. The experiments will also set the stage
for cellular studies on the formation and regulation of cell architecture in
protozooans. This work has the potential for leading to significant insight into
fundamental principles of cytoskeletal structure-function relationships.
