Tissue-Specific and Developmental Expression of Lectin Genes in Cereals and
Rice: Molecular genetics and immuno cytochemical approaches will be used to
study processes that control tissue- specific gene expression of lectin
synthesis. The approach will consist of the following stages; a)
characterization of genomic sequences of wheat germ agglutinin and rice lectins;
b) analysis and mutagenesis of promoter sequences of these genes, c)
transformation experiments to examine how specific gene constructs are
expressed. The differential localization of lectins among different cells of
closely related species of crop grasses provides a model system for studying
cell-and tissue-specific expression of closely related proteins. It provides a
unique opportunity to answer questions important to the genetic engineering of
plants e.g. How will wheat germ agglutinin genes be expressed when introduced
into rice? Will the pattern be similar to that found in wheat or in rice? What
are the gene sequences responsible for determining the pattern of expression of
similar proteins in different tissues? Finally the potential creation of lectin-
deficient plants could possibly answer the perplexing riddle of lectin function
in organisms.
