9614471 DePaolo The primary proposed research is aimed at further developing a
new approach to U-Th-Pb geochronology, and assessing its applicability to ocean
floor basalts. The new technique may allow for improved understanding of the
temporal framework of deep sea volcanism. The proposed work involves precisely
measuring 206Pb/207Pb and 208Pb/207Pb, and U/Pb and Th/Pb in mineral, glass and
groundmass separates of selected submarine basalts to determine the
applicability of the method. The plan is to evaluate whether the necessary
initial condition of uniform 206Pb/207Pb and 208Pb/207Pb is satisfied in oceanic
basalts, and to compare the U-Pb and Th-Pb dates from the same rocks to Ar-Ar
age determinations to establish its reliability. Two other secondary projects
will be pursued. The first will use stratigraphic time-series data from basaltic
lavas to quantitatively assess the hydrological properties of partial melt zones
to better understand the role of melt zone dispersion and chromatography in the
study of isotopic variations in the mantle. The second project is aimed at
verifying the evidence for fractionated mantle reservoirs in the early Archean
mantle and quantifying approaches for reconstructing the initial isotopic and
chemical compositions of metamorphosed Archean rocks.
