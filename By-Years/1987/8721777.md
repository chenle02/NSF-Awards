Experiments are proposed to provide a critical assessment of the use of
(14C)-2-deoxglucose and specifically labeled (14C)-glucose in the measurement of
cerebral functional activity. The uptake and retention of radioactivity in
discrete brain regions from (14C)-2-deoxyglucose, (1-14C)-glucose and
(6-14C)-glucose will be evaluated with high resolution autoradiography in which
4 um frozen brain sections are thaw-mounted onto nuclear emulsion coated slides.
These studies will delineate the similarities and differences in the relative
uptake and retention of radioactivity from the various compounds and in glucose
utilization rates determined with the appropriate kinetic models. The hypothesis
will be tested that the previously demonstrated low retention of radioactivity
from (14C)-2-DG in some brain regions relative to that from (1-14C)-glucose is
due to regionally high glucose-6- phosphatase activity, low phosphorylation of
2-DG, or low transport of (14C)-2-deoxyglucose-6- phosphate accumulation will be
measured in microdissected brain regions by liquid scintillation counting in
rats killed by microwave radiation, 1 to 45 minutes after i.v. injection of
(14C)-deoxyglucose. If some brain regions contain high glucose-6-phosphate
activity, an initial accumulation, followed by a decline in 2-deoxyglucose-6-
phosphate, is predicted. If a brain region exhibits low phosphorylation of
(14C)-2-DG, little accumulation of (14C)-2-DG is not transported as effectively
into the cells of certain regions as is glucose, low levels of accumulation of
radioactivity from (14C)-2-DG will occur at all times. The ability of (14C)-2-DG
and specifically labelled (14C)-glucose to register alterations in functional
activity will be determined by sensory stimulation and by stimulating a well
defined afferent pathway to the hippocampal formation. Concurrent
electrophysiological recording will be performed to determine the relationship
of metabolic and electrical activities.
