Abstract

Proposal Title: Algorithms for Improved Engineering of Chemistry Proposal
Number: CTS-0114263 Principal Investigator: Michael Deem Institution: University
of California Los Angeles

The objective of this project is the development of strategies for searching
for the best materials property using combinatorial techniques coupled with
Monte Carlo methods. The techniques to be developed are aimed at improving on
the current grid search methods, which are often cumbersome to employ. Monte
Carlo strategies are expected to provide significant improvement, and the
ability to incorporate a priori knowledge should further improve the search
strategy. Several variables can be manipulated in order to seek the material
with the optimal figure of merit. Variables such as composition as well as film
thickness and deposition method can be investigated. The work will focus on the
theoretical aspects of the problem. Virtual libraries and materials will be
constructed, and the Random Phase Volume model will be used to assess the
validity of the methods. Techniques developed will be applied to data generated
by an industrial collaborator. A wide range of improved material properties such
as superconductivity, magnetoresistance or catalytic activity have been sought
using combinatorial methods. The overall goal of high-throughput methods is to
hasten discovery for improved processes and materials properties.
