RESEARCH INITIATION AWARD: INVESTIGATION OF THE MECHANISMS RESPONSIBLE FOR
INCREASED ANTIBODY PRODUCTION BY HYBRIDOMAS EXPOSED TO STRESS ABSTRACT
Monoclonal antibodies are among the largest-volume products made using mammalian
cells. Increased antibody production has been reported for hybridomas exposed to
environmental stress. The objectives of this project are to characterize the
mechanisms responsible for increased antibody production, and to identify
reactor conditions with increased productivity. Concurrent changes in energy
metabolism and DNA synthesis will be monitored in order to determine the
interrelationships between the regulation of cell growth, energy production and
protein expression. An understanding of these relationships is required in order
to decouple cell growth from product formation. Excessive cell growth is not
desired because expensive medium is wasted on the production of biomass. Reduced
cell growth rates are also desirable because many primary, hybrid, and
genetically- altered cell lines decrease their rate of product formation after
repeated cell divisions.
