A large body of research suggests that people have a strong need to maintain a
positive self-image, and that self-esteem plays an important role in a diverse
array of important human behaviors. Despite this agreement on the importance of
self- esteeem, the question of why people need self-esteem has not been
addressed. This research will attempt to answer three questions: (1) why do
people need self-esteem?; (2) how is self-esteem related to other aspects of
people's conceptions of reality?; and (3) how does the need for self-esteem
affect social behavior. This research will explore to what extent self-esteem
functions to buffer the anxiety that results from human awareness of their
vulnerability and mortality. Because self-esteem is essentially a cultural
creation, a great deal of social behavior is oriented toward acquiring
validation of one's worldview and self-worth from others. If self-esteem and
cultural worldviews serve an anxiety-buffering function, then: (a) increasing a
person's self-esteem or faith in worldview should make that person less prone to
anxiety in a threatening situation, and (b) reminding people of a major source
of anxiety should increase their need for validation of their self-worth and
worldview. This research should increase our understanding of why self-esteem is
so important and so beneficial for the individual.
