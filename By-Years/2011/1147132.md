Stomata are microscopic valves on the surface of all land plants that allow the
exchange of gas and water vapor between a plant and the environment. Correct
stomatal patterning is critical for the efficient exchange of gases, which
directly effects plant biomass production and water use efficiency. The tightly
regulated molecular mechanism controlling the production of stomata ensures that
they develop at an appropriate density and distribution. This project will
produce a more complete understanding of the gene network driving the production
and patterning of mature stomata from undifferentiated cells. The project
focuses on characterization of two newly identified stomatal regulatory genes
called LONE GUARD CELLS (LOGC) and EXCESS INITIATION OF STOMATAL LINEAGES
(EISL). The project will elucidate the function of these two new genes in
specifying cell fate during stomatal development. In addition to addressing new
regulators, this work will explore the regulation of the well-known stomatal
differentiation gene, MUTE. Combined, this project will provide a fuller
understanding of the genetics underlying stomatal development and may facilitate
manipulation of this process for the benefit of crop improvement. This work has
additional important and broad impacts in providing underrepresented minority
students from Native-American and Pacific Islander decent with opportunities to
participate in genetic and molecular research training at a primarily
undergraduate institution. The study will largely be conducted by undergraduate
and Masters students who will gain experience in discovery-based research and
peer-reviewed publication to give them the tools necessary to enter research
professions.
