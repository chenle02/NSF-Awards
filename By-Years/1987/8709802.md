The atmospheric sulfur cycle is controlled to a large extent by natural
processes involving the release of biogenic sulfur gases into the atmospheric
troposphere. An understanding of these processes is of importance to a number of
global problems in atmospheric chemistry, including: the origin of SO2 and
sulfate aerosol in remote regions; the impact of sulfur gases on tropospheric
oxidant cycles; the contribution of biogenic sources to acid precipitation in pH
sensitive ecosystems; and possible long-term climate controlling feedbacks
between greenhouse gases and cloud condensation nuclei. This project is a field
study of chemical cycling of sulfur through the boundary layer in marine and
coastal regions. Ground-based measurements will be made of an array of gaseous
and aerosol sulfur compounds at three sites: a laboratory on Virginia Key,
Miami; the Florida Keys; and Barbardos. The compounds to be measured include as
many as seven individual sulfurous compounds. The field measurements will be
done in conjunction with other investigators measuring oxides of nitrogen and
ozone. The primary goal of the project is to investigate the relative abundance
and diurnal variations of the sulfur compounds at the field sites in order to
critically test current theories regarding the nature of oceanic sulfur
emissions and their atmospheric transformations.
