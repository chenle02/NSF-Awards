Fundamentally, algebraic geometry is the study of solutions to systems of
polynomial equations. The systems of interest typically involve many equations
and many variables, and it is essential to look for ways to simplify them. One
way to do this is by tuning certain parameters to zero; if done carefully, the
resulting system retains many properties of the original one, and may be more
amenable to analysis. Another way to simplify is to look for symmetry in the set
of solutions, and take advantage of this to reduce the problem and extract
information about the original solution set from a smaller set. These
techniques, respectively known as "degeneration" and "equivariant localization",
can be used in concert: for example, one may degenerate to a system possessing
extra symmetry. This project will use these methods to study several problems of
interest in enumerative geometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of this project
is to study the geometry of algebraic varieties with group actions using
equivariant and degeneration techniques. The PI will study flag varieties,
Schubert varieties, and toric varieties using methods from equivariant
cohomology, as well as the theory of Newton-Okounkov bodies. Motivating problems
are to determine criteria for a variety to admit a flat degeneration to a toric
variety, and to produce a wider class of examples where the Newton-Okounkov body
can be computed explicitly. The PI will also continue his study of degeneracy
loci, and investigate their finer geometric properties by developing the
combinatorics of diagrams for signed permutations. Finally, the PI will explore
applications of the recently-developed operational K-theory, focusing on the
relationship between equivariant localization and Riemann-Roch theorems in this
context.
