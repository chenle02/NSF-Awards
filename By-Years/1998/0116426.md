With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation program Youngstown State
University will acquire a powder X-ray Diffractometer system to support the
research needs of faculty, master's level students, and undergraduate students
at the institution. The instrument will also support research and training of
faculty and students at other colleges that are part a consortium of users
affiliated with single crystal X-ray facility at Youngstown State University.
The X-ray Diffractometer will provide data of sufficiently high quality to
enable structure determinations of powder samples, which is not possible with
multi-wire detector currently used for powder analysis. The instrument will be
available on hands-on basis to students in upper level laboratory courses and
thus will positively education and training at the institutions.
