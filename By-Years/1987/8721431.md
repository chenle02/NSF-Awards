Adenovirus is a mammalian virus that contains at least 10 different proteins in
an architecture that is complex but creates the virion's characteristically
simple icosahedral shape. Adenovirus is an important model in molecular biology
with a growing body of knowledge describing its biological properties. Dr.
Burnett's aim is to understand the whole virion, at atomic resolution if
possible, using crystallography to obtain finely detailed accurate images of
those constituent molecules that are crystallizable, electron microscopy to
establish the overall relationship among molecules and biochemistry to determine
the composition of the virion and its component substructures.
