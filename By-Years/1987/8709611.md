This MRI Research Planning Grant is for one year to obtain pilot data on
innervation f the inner ear. The sensory receptor cells in the cochlea of the
mammalian ear are of two types, the inner hair cells (IHC) and the far more
numerous outer hair cells (OHC). These receptor cells are innervated by nerve
cells (neurons) that have their cell bodies in a structure called the spiral
ganglion of the ear. Adult animals have two types of spiral ganglion cells,
based on their contacts with one or the other type of hair cells, the diameter
of their fibers, and size and shape of their cell bodies. It remains puzzling
that the OHC, representing roughly 3/4 of all the hair cells, receive contacts
from fewer than one-tenth of all the ganglion cells. It is not clear how the
neurons develop into these two classes. In newborn animals, some studies suggest
that these cells are morphologically different from the adult neurons, and are
initially a homogeneous population. This planning grant is a preliminary step
toward clarifying the anatomy and ultra- structure of the spiral ganglion
neurons that contact OHCs in newborn rodents. Both light microscopy and electron
microscopy will be used, in conjunction with dye-filling techniques for single
cells, and specific antibody staining. The analysis of these data will provide a
basis for a later full proposal to pursue the development of these neurons. This
project is on a group of cells important in understanding mechanisms of hearing.
The data will provide a needed baseline to allow preparation of a full research
project on development of these cells.
