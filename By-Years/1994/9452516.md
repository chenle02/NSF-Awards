9452516 Smith-Huerta The objectives of this project are to improve undergraduate
laboratory instruction in plant morphology, anatomy, and development in the
Department of Botany at Miami University in Oxford Ohio. This project develops a
model for the incorporation of advanced instrumentation and discovery-based
teaching methods into these courses which have traditionally been taught without
the benefit of modern instrumentation. The proposed improvements will impact
most heavily five different morphology/anatomy courses with a total enrollment
of about 200 undergraduates. The project will also benefit other courses in
general botany, plant physiology and plant ecology. This instrumentation will
also be used by undergraduates to conduct independent research projects and in
their capstone research experiences. The main focus of the improvement will be
the incorporation of modern instrumentation, image processing, and computers
into the existing discovery based lab experience. Undergraduate majors, non-
majors and pre-service teachers will be stimulated and challenged to operate
advanced instrumentation and develop problem solving skills using the same
techniques and equipment as research plant scientists.
