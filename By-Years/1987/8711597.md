This award provides travel funding for twenty participants to attend the
ACM/SIGIR International Conference on Research and Development in Information
Retrieval. This conference is sponsored by the Laboratoire de Genie Informatique
- IMAG - of France, in cooperation with the (U.S.) Association for Computing
Machinery (ACM) Special Interest Group in Information Retrieval (SIGIR). Massive
amounts of textual and other non-numeric information are generated daily
worldwide. The need to store, access, and retrieve this information effectively
makes the issues of information retrieval research highly relevant. By
participating in the ACM/SIGIR International Conference, American scientists
maintain their active role and leadership in the worldwide community of
researchers in information retrieval.
