This INSPIRE award is partially funded by Transforming Undergraduate Education
in STEM Program in the Division of Undergraduate Education in the Directorate
for Education and Human Resources and by the Division of Engineering Education
and Centers in the Directorate for Engineering. The project is using a rigorous
process of data gathering and analysis, overseen by a committee of national
experts, to explore a set of questions about the career choices of those who are
trained as engineers or are employed as engineers (without earning a degree in
engineering) in the United States. The National Academy of Engineering, part of
the National Academies, has a long track record of providing independent and
trustworthy advice on matters of national interest. As globalization and
economic readjustments continue to affect the ability of the United States to
remain technologically competitive, the roles of engineering education and of
engineers will become even more critical than they are today. A fresh look at
this vital segment of the nation's innovation capability is useful for a variety
of policy-making purposes.
