The goal of this research is to develop a set of principles for machine/man
compatibility that can be used by system designers or process engineers when
designing or selecting computer-based manufacturing systems. These principles
are intended to aid in achieving maximum system effectiveness. The proposal has
the following steps: Survey of the metalworking industrial sector with respect
to the application of machine/man principles, case studies to extract tentative
machine/human principles, and from the information gathered, derive principles
intended to guide future system design and selection. A computer-based
revolution in manufacturing is now under way. Now is the appropriate time to try
to set up human factors guidelines for the design of such technology. The
principles derived in this proposal will address this need. The investigators
are well qualified to conduct this research, and based on their past record
should be successful with this work.
