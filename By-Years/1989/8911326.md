This project involves theoretical models aimed at under- standing mid-ocean
ridge spreading centers and seafloor struc- ture. The principal investigators
have developed 2-D time- dependent convection models that show that thermal and
composi- tional density stratification of the mantle beneath spreading centers
can lead to fluctuations in crustal thickness. They will now consider the effect
of lower mantle viscosities and will specifically test whether high frequency
variations in crustal thickness result that might explain the origin of abyssil
hill lineations. They will construct 3-D models of magma flow beneath ridges,
including flow in a ridge axis conduit to investigate the origin of the inside-
corner bathymetric high at ridge-transform interestions and the asymmetry of the
median valley near intersections. They will also explore a model for ridge
segmentation and episodic spreading based on stresses and deformation in the
lithosphere rather than convection in the mantle.
