&lt;br/&gt;The foci of this research involve the preparation of of
cyclopentadienones and the use of these compounds in cycloadditions and related
processes. Within this context the concept of antiaromaticity-driven reactions
and retro-Nazarov chemistry will be explored. An indanone synthesis,
cyclopentadienone dimer photochemistry, the synthesis of eight-membered rings
and the synthesis of polyenes will be carried out to develop and test the scope
of the methodology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and
Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Michael
Harmata in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Missouri-Columbia.
Dr. Harmata will focus his work on developing synthetic methodology using
cations and cycloaddition processes. Starting with simple starting materials,
complex molecules can be obtained in a quick and efficient manner. There is
potential for broader impact of the work in the areas of medicinal and materials
chemistry. The project also presents an excellent venue for the training of
graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;
