Building on a network previously established under an NSF grant, Simmons
College proposes to strengthen and expand the activities of pre-college science
teacher-leaders in New England, with emphasis on environmental science education
in the region. Twenty middle school teachers and twenty high school teachers
will take part in two summer workshops and will work in small teams during the
academic year to develop science teaching activities. An electronic network will
facilitate communications and data exchange between the participants. In
addition, participants will be prepared to serve as teacher-leaders and will
disseminate information on resources and teaching strategies to colleagues in
their home districts through a series of workshops. Cost sharing on this project
is 42.5% of the NSF contribution.
