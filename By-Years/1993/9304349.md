This award provides 56% of the funds required for the purchase of a modern
atomic absorption spectrometer that will be installed, operated, and maintained
in the Department of Geology and Geophysics at the University of Wisconsin-
Madison. The University is committed to providing the remaining funds needed for
the acquisition of this equipment. The instrument will be used primarily in the
research programs of the Principal Investigator and colleagues that are focused
on the chemistry of groundwaters and hydrothermal solutions.
