Research on the structure and reactivity of soot (black carbon) continues.
Although topics related to the role of the solid phase and studies of
carbonaceous atmospheric particulate are receiving attention, the emphasis of
the work continues to be on heterogeneous photochemical reactions involving soot
and reaction schemes in more complex systems. The photochemical behavior of
reaction systems involving soot being studied under conditions of simulated
solar radiation include: (i) soot/sulfur dioxide/oxygen/water vapor The role of
the surface, through selected surface reaction and incorporation of trace metal
constituents, is included in this study. (ii) soot/oxides of nitrogen (iii)
soot/ozone The kinetics and mechanisms of the latter two reaction systems,
previously determined in this laboratory, provide a solid basis for this group
of studies. Several surface-sensitive vibrational and ultraviolet spectroscopies
are employed as analytical tools in this work. Reactions of soot are being
studied in more complex systems than previously. Specific focus currently is on
the effect of certain reactions on the subsequent catalytic activity and
reactivity of soot, and the determination of kinetics and mechanisms of soot
reactions in multireactant systems. Investigations of both the photochemical
reactions and multireactant system are being carried out at low concentration
levels in a specially-designed, optical path, reaction cell interfaced
simultaneously with an a fourier transform - infrared spectrometer and Cahn
electrobalance.
