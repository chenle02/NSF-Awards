This project involves the purchase of a medium field Fourier-transform nuclear-
magnetic resonance (FT-NMR) spectrometer with a broad-band, multi-nuclear probe,
and supporting hardware and software necessary to operate the spectrometer from
the two remote instructional sites. The networked spectrometer is enabling the
consortium to meet the goals of this project, including the improvement of the
quality of chemistry education, increased exposure for students in chemistry
courses to the concepts and techniques of modern NMR spectroscopy, and the
strengthening of the collaboration between the chemistry faculties of three area
schools. Hands-on instruction in NMR spectroscopic techniques begins with two
experiments in the general chemistry laboratory and progresses in complexity,
scope, and frequency of use through organic chemistry. Undergraduate research in
organic chemistry and inorganic chemistry is also being enhanced significantly
through the acquisition of this instrument.
