This project will develop global criteria for selecting clustering procedures
using the admissible clustering approach of Fisher and Van Ness with extended
definitions of admissibility conditions. These admissibility conditions will be
applied to the general infinite parameterized family of clustering procedures
proposed by Lance and Williams; and for each condition, the corresponding subset
of the family's parameter space yielding admissible algorithms will be
determined. Clustering is a heavily used tool for partitioning a group of
objects into subgroups or species. It is used by taxonomists, librarians,
epidemiologists, bankers, scientists and many others to classify large, complex
sets of objects into homogeneous groups which can be comprehended and handled
better. Numerous clustering methods have been proposed over the years, with each
giving a different clustering; hence, the choice of algorithm is important. The
work here is to codify the various algorithms according to the properties needed
for a specific application.
