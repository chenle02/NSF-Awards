Abstract

This project, Transition to Algebra: A Habits of Mind Approach, led by
professionals in the mathematics group at the Education Development Center, is
developing a collection of modules introducing key ideas of algebra in ways that
complement the core curriculum when a school is offering double period algebra.
The key habit of mind being developed is abstracting from calculation. Modules
deal with the transition from arithmetic to algebra, rational numbers,
expressions/equations/word problems, graphs and equations, geometry of algebra,
and proportional reasoning. The target population is students in urban high
poverty schools with a significant ELL sector.

The proposers' hypothesis is that instructional materials focused on developing
conceptual understanding and mathematical habits of mind can complement
traditional skill-focused algebra instruction in ways that are engaging to
students. Furthermore, they argue that using materials with such meta-cognitive
aims will actually strengthen the learning of core algebraic concepts and
skills. The supplementary algebra modules are being developed by a form of
design research. Concurrent with development and field test of the student and
teacher materials, the investigators are addressing four research questions. The
first two questions are focused on the effects of the intervention in developing
student habits of mind and in improving their competence and confidence in
algebra. The other two address the feasibility of implementing the new approach
to double-period algebra in a variety of school settings. A small-scale quasi-
experimental field test is being used to give preliminary estimates of the
effectiveness of the instructional materials and the implementation guidelines.
The core purpose of these research activities is to inform development and
refinement of the student and teacher instructional materials.

Products of this development effort will be a valuable resource to schools as
they devise strategies for helping all students master the essentials of
elementary algebra.
