Pathways to the Future Workshop 2003

PI: Billard Lynne

DMS-0307631

Abstract

This proposal is for a workshop to be held immediately prior to the Joint
Statistical Meetings (JSM) in August 2003 in San Francisco. The workshop is
targeted at young women researchers in probability and statistics who have
received their doctorates in the last five years. A major talk from a senior
researchers focuses on how to develop a research career, the pitfalls to be
avoided as participants establish their own academic careers, and general advice
on how to be as successful as they can in the research academic environment. The
talk itself is the springboard for extended discussions among the junior
participants and invited senior researchers governing the issues raised. In
addition, workshop participants give a brief presentation of their research
interests and research environment. The opportunity to meet and interact with
each other as well as a few established researchers is invaluable as the
participants learn to promote their own research and to decrease their
professional isolation. As a result of the workshop, attendees should be more
successful in their own researcher careers, and thus, for example, survive the
promotion and tenure process so that these women become role models for the
students at all levels (undergraduate and graduate) in their own training
programs.
