9316701 Hyman Transcription termination, defined as the release of the nascent
transcript and dissociation of RNA polymerase from the template, is arguably the
least well understood aspect of eukaryotic transcription. The goal of the
proposed research is to contribute to defining the mechanism(s) that are
responsible for termination of transcription by RNA polymerase II. There are two
specific aims. The first describes experiments that address which sequences are
required to direct 3' end formation in vivo. Models proposing that a secondary
structure may be important for this event will be tested. The second aim is to
utilize an in vitro biochemical assay to complement, and extend the molecular
approach. %%% The focus of much research in molecular biology is in the study of
gene expression. This is concerned with how genes are turned on in some cell
types but not others. This work is concerned with how transcription, an
important step in gene expression, is controlled. Specifically we will ask how
the enzyme which is responsible for the transcription reaction stops at the
appropriate place in the gene. This reaction is referred to as transcription
termination. Little is known about transcription termination yet it is an
extremely important part of fundamental cell mechanisms. ***
