The Department of Electrical Computer Engineering at the State University of New
York at Buffalo will purchase a workstation network consisting of Sun
Microsystems SPARC 2 file server and Sky Computer Skystation application
processor which will be dedicated to support research in engineering. The
equipment will be used for several research projects in computational photonics,
including in particular: study of dynamics in photonic materials, development of
computer aided design tools for photonic integrated circuits, the design and
performance communications networks.
