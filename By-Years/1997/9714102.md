9714102 This project sponsors a Workshop on Higher-Order Operational Techniques
in Semantics (HOOTS II) held at Stanford during December 8-12, 1997. The
workshop provides an opportunity for researchers working on various techniques
based on operational semantics for reasoning about higher-order programs to work
together to gain an in-depth understanding of the full spectrum of existing
techniques, including those outside their immediate area of expertise. The
workshop builds on the preliminary exchange of ideas promoted by HOOTS I, which
took place at the Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences in Cambridge,
England, October 1995. The structure is that of a working meeting rather than a
forum for presenting technical papers and includes a mix of activities. The
workshop will result in progress towards a richer and more elegant framework for
operational techniques to a wider range of languages using combined expertise of
the participants in diverse areas of specialization. ***
