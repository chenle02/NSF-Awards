ABSTRACT This grant is for support to upgrade an existing laboratory computer
which was originally installed in 1983. The laboratory is dedicated to
magnetospheric research under the direction of Prof. Roger Arnoldy. The proposed
facility is a combination of a high-resolution color graphic work station and
multiple PC's with optical disc and tape transport capability. ***
