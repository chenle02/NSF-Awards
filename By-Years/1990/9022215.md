Professor Reiss is supported by a grant from the Experimental Physical Chemistry
Program for the experimental and theoretical investigation of nucleation, the
process by which an aggregate of molecules too small to be observed becomes the
nucleus upon which other molecules condense in the vapor phase, which leads
eventually to the formation of a liquid droplet. The experiments are carried out
in a cloud chamber, and the goal is the understanding at the molecular level of
the physical cluster itself and the physical process by which it is formed. The
theoretical and experimental studies in this research involve a molecular theory
of vapor phase nucleation, capable of quantitative prediction of critical
supersaturation for homogeneous nucleation in single and multicomponent systems
under conditions of practical interest. Studies of vapor phase nucleation of
vinyl polymers will be based on the same theory. The theory involves the
identification of the physical cluster consistent with the physical process of
nucleation and the analysis of that cluster with Monte Carlo simulation.
