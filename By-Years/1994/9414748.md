9414748 Shibata This proposal supports the collaboration of Dr. Edward Shibata
of Purdue University and Dr. Seigi Iwata of Japan's National Laboratory for High
Energy Physics (KEK). Project funding will enable Dr. Shibata to spend one year
in Japan, resident at KEK, in order to conduct research in the TOPAZ experiment
at the TRISTAN collider at KEK with Dr. Iwata and other U.S. and Japanese
physicists. Dr. Shibata will collaborate in two KEK experimental high energy
physics programs that will complement his U.S. research program on the CLEO
experiment at Cornell University. After he returns to the U.S., Dr. Shibata will
use his experience gained in Japan for development and constructions work on the
recently approved upgrade of the CLEO II detector to CLEO III. This proposal
brings together research scientists from two countries working in the area of
high energy physics. The U.S. scientist will have the opportunity to become
familiar with research techniques, equipment, and facilities at KEK as well as
contribute to the overall research effort. Therefore, this proposal fulfills the
objectives of the Program in its exchange and transfer of scientific knowledge
through an international collaboration. ***
