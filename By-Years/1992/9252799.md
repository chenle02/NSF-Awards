The Technology Summer Camp provides an environmental science and engineering
program for rising ninth grade African-American, Hispanic, Native-American and
Pacific Islander students. The camp involves students, through group interactive
activities, in the excitement of the process of science and engineering and will
expose them to a wide variety of career options and mentoring experiences. The
program's goal is to encourage students to pursue rigorous math and science
training in high school and to begin considering the many options for scientific
and technological education at the university level, as well as to make students
more aware of science and technology as a social endeavor.
