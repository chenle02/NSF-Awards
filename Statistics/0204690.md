Proposal ID: 0204690 PI: Scott Schmidler Title: Statistical models of biopolymer
sequence and folding

Abstract:

This research involves development of new probabilistic and Bayesian statistical
models for the analysis of biopolymer sequences. Emphasis is on predictive
modeling of proteins and RNA. Models for sequences of random variables with
complex short- and long-range interaction structure are developed and explored.
Particular focus is placed unifying statistical models estimated from data with
statistical mechanical models of polymer folding estimated via experimental
parameter measurement. Targeted applications include protein structure
prediction, protein folding kinetics, and protein-RNA binding. Statistical
methodology development focuses on connecting statistical models for sequence
analysis and change-point problems, including graphical Markov models and random
fields, to statistical mechanical models of polymer folding, especially on
biopolymers (proteins and RNA), to develop predictive theories. An additional
core component of this research program concerns development of computational
methodology for probabilistic inference in these models, including novel Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms for multi-modal distributions and rough
energy landscapes.

Modern research in the molecular biosciences and biomedicine relies increasingly
on both computational modeling and analysis of large collections of experimental
data. This research concerns development of novel and unified methods for
combining these areas. This work leverages physical models to develop improved
methods for statistical data analysis, and uses statistical methodology for
improving predictive accuracy of physical models. The focus is on analysis of
protein and nucleic acid sequences and structures being generated by high-
throughput whole-genome analyses. These advances will provide important new
statistical methodology for computational biology, as well as provide domain
scientists with improved tools for data analysis and predictive modeling.
