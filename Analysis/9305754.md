Assani will investigate problems of multiple recurrence and nonconventional
averages introduced by Furstenberg. He will study pointwise and norm convergence
of these non-conventional averages. He will study the Wiener-Wintner versions of
return times theorem which were used by Furstenberg in his proof of Szemeredi's
theorem on arithmetic progressions. This project involves research in ergodic
theory. Ergodic theory in general concerns understanding the average behavior of
systems whose dynamics is too complicated or chaotic to be followed in
microscopic detail. Under the heading "dynamics" can be placed the modern theory
of how groups of abstract transformations act on smooth spaces. In this way
ergodic theory makes contact with geometry in its quest to classify flows on
homogeneous spaces.
