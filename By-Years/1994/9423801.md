This research project examines change in the recent "democratic revolutions" in
central and eastern Europe. Political stability is dependent on democratic
values and practices taking hold. Democratic leaders are hypothesized to be both
more global and more local in their orientations. Data are to be collected from
interviews with political leaders in communities throughout the new democracies
of eastern and central Europe. This research, unlike all previous work, focuses
on local political activity, the impact of globalization, and comparisons among
new and established democracies. Change will be assessed by comparing leadership
interviews with those originally collected between 1991 and 1993.
