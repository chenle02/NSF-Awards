This SGER award is to develop a three-dimensional electromagnetic particle code
which will be capable of processing 20 million particles in a 200 by 200 by 200
grid. In order to achieve this ambitious goal, new and unique computational
techniques will be introduced which include radiating boundaries local
processing of fields, local, filtering and the elimination of Poissons equation
and its time consuming solution. Scientifically, the grant will be used to
investigate the fundamental physical processes associated with plasma clouds
expanding into an ambient magnetized plasma. This problem is important for the
space plasma applications of the release of lithium and barium, clouds, galactic
plasma jets, and the interaction of cometary atmospheres with the solar wind.
