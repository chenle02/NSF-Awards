Hydrogen is an ideal future fuel. In an era of declining cheap fossil fuels,
water is an almost inexhaustible source of hydrogen and oxygen. Utilization of
solar energy in the biocatalytic approach to water splitting is attractive
economically, since the light harvesting mechanism and the active redox centers
for water splitting exist in higher plants and algae. However, systems for the
bioproduction of hydrogen are impractical, for at least one of the following
reasons: (a) the photosystems of isolated plant (thylakoid) membranes become
inactive after a short period; (b) hydrogen production is often dependent upon
highly oxygen-sensitive enzymes (e.g., hydrogenases), and (c) some
photobiological hydrogen-producing systems depend upon electron transfer relays,
such as methyl viologen, that are auto-oxidizable and light-sensitive. The goal
of the proposed research work is to utilize a single technique to overcome these
basic problems that restrict the use of biological systems as photocatalytic
systems for the production of hydrogen and oxygen from water. In this proposal,
they have described the principal for, and the basic steps required to, test the
feasibility of depositing low amounts of metallic Pt directly onto the
photosynthetic membranes of intact cells of blue-green algae as a means of
achieving a low-cost photocatalytic material with long term stability.
