Abstract: This proposal focuses on conducting a feasibility study for the
institution of an open access National Science Foundation (NSF) publication
repository. Specifically, the Johns Hopkins University, in conjunction with the
Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR) and the University of
Michigan (UM) will evaluate the technical, policy, and business implications of
several approaches that range in options from developing a new system to
adopting and customizing distributed technologies to federating a network of
institutional repositories. The outcome of this feasibility study will help to
better characterize and inform decision makers on the relative strengths and
weaknesses for both the technological and economic dimensions characterizing
current dialogues on the subject and to further address lingering questions,
community wide, about the functional nature and designs for future open access
repositories. This feasibility study will similarly address a challenging set of
activities pertaining to the integration of traditionally shared data and open-
source electronic publishing systems through shared stewardship and
infrastructure architectures.
