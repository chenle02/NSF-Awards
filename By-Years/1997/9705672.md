9705672 Polyak ABSTRACT The main purpose of this proposal is to develop new
aspects of the Nonlinear Rescaling (NR) theory and new methods, that are based
on this theory, for solving constrained optimization problems. Developing
software, which will take into account the special structure of unconstrained
optimization problems typical for the NR approach is our second goal. Solving
real world large scale nonlinear optimization problems is our third main target.
The ability to solve large scale nonlinear optimization problems is critical in
mechanics, structural engineering, optimal control, tomography, image
recognition, power system optimization, and economics, to mention a few.
Recently the NR type methods have been used with great success for solving very
complex Truss Topology Design (TTD) problems. The TTD problems arise in
structural optimization, in particular, in creating bridges, cantilevers, and
inner skeletons of airplane wings capable of carrying external loads under
different loading scenarios. Funding a structure, which is able to withstand
external forces, have certain characteristics of rigidity and at the same time
to have minimal cost is a typical large scale nonlinear constrained optimization
problem. Our research is aimed to find efficient methods for solving such
problems.
