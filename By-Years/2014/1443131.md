The Russia-Japan-USA Symposium on Fundamental and Applied Problems of Terahertz
Devices and Technologies will be held June 17-21, 2014 at the University at
Buffalo, NY. It will address research areas in the field of interaction of THz
radiation with micro- and nanostructures and advanced solid-state THz emitters
and sensors, including novel device concepts. This conference will foster
advances in the leading research on various types of Terahertz technology, by
gathering a diverse group of experts, researchers and students. The program
provides the opportunity for scientific exchanges and discussions on exciting
breakthroughs in the terahertz field and the understanding the underlying
physical mechanisms. It will promote interactions between leading researchers in
USA, Japan, and Russia on terahertz devices and technologies and will focus on
the technical challenges and barriers of transitioning the research results into
the THz system-level applications. The highlights of the symposium will be
accessible worldwide through the symposium proceedings.
