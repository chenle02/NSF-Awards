9513275 Kenney All organisms must communicate effectively with their environment
and adapt in order to survive. In both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, a paradigm
for adaptive responses is the two-component regulatory systems. A two-component
system contains a sensor (which is often a membrane protein which functions in
trans-membrane signaling) and a response regulator (often a DNA binding protein
which regulates transcription). Changes in the environment result in the
phosphorylation of the sensor from intracellular ATP. The sensor then transfers
its phosphoryl group to the regulator which alters its output. The sensor (or
sometimes another distinct protein) stimulates the dephosphorylation of the
regulator to re-set the system. The two-component system in E. coli regulates
the porin genes by responding to changes in osmolarity of the growth medium. At
low osmolarity, ompF is preferentially expressed and at high osmolarity, it is
repressed and ompC expression is switched on. EnvZ, the sensor, transfers its
phosphoryl group onto OmpR, a DNA binding protein that regulates transcription
of the porin genes. Little is known about how the OmpR-like proteins interact
with DNA; they do not contain sequences similar to those of DNA binding domains
found in other regulators. A major goal of this work is to precisely determine
the region of OmpR which contacts DNA and identify the amino acids which make
direct contacts. Studies will also address the dual role of OmpR as an activator
(of both ompF and ompC) and also as a repressor (ompF only). A model arising
from genetic studies predicts that phospho-OmpR (OmpR-P) binds with high
affinity to activate ompF and at low affinity to repress ompF and activate ompC.
It also predicts that unphosphorylated OmpR plays no role in transcriptional
regulation. These studies will provide the first direct biochemical evaluation
of this hypothesis. Measurements of DNA binding using fluorescence anisotropy
will examine the effect of phospho-OmpR on binding to flu oresceinated promoter
fragments. In addition, biochemical approaches will be employed to investigate
the potential regulatory involvement of OmpR-P-induced oligomerization,
determine the region of OmpR which interacts with the promoters as well as RNA
polymerase. ***
