This proposal for continuation of, "Fundamental Studies of Visible
Superfluorescence and Atom-Field Interactions in an Optical Resonator", calls
for continued development and use of the first working microlaser. This devise
is a laser oscillator in which coherent light is generated by means of the
interaction of a single, excited two-level atom with a single mode of the
radiation field. The objective of the ongoing research is to develop an improved
microlaser with controllable features and study its quantum mechanical behavior.
