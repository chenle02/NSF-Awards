The discipline of psychobiology is being introduced into an interdepartmental
advanced level research seminar for psychology and biology majors. Improved
physiological measurement experiments are being added to both the laboratory and
the research components of the undergraduate psychology and biology curricula.
The acquisition of an eight-channel Narcotrace-80 physiograph with the necessary
accessories is allowing measurements in sleep physiology and learning, classical
conditioning, and biofeedback, as well as heart and muscle physiology. Detailed
and accurate physiological measurements are being facilitated with the
introduction of physiobiology into the curriculum.
