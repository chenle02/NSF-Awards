The proposed work focusses upon how factors such as bulk concentration,
particle shape and rigidity, and polydispersity control the structure of thin
films that are produced by the adsorption of large particles from solution.
Although the primary thrust is on proteins and latex spheres, the results should
be of more general applicability. The adsorption of many proteins is essentially
irreversible, i.e. there is not desorption or surface diffusion. The situation
is needed using the Random Sequential Adsorption (RSA) process. It is proposed
to calculate the rate of adsorption, saturation coverage, and the structure of
the film for several well defined models using computer simulation. The results
of this study will assist in the design of processes to manufacture thin films
with certain desired properties.
