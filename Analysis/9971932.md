Abstract

Award: DMS-9971932 Principal Investigator: Nikolai Nadirashvili

We shall study the upper bounds for eigenvalues on surfaces. Let M be a smooth
compact two-dimensional surface. Assuming that the area of M is equal to 1, one
can prove that for each k,the k-th eigenvalue of the Laplacian on M has an upper
bound depending only on the topology of M; however, the sharp upper bounds for
the egenvalues are known for only a few surfaces. We plan to confirm Rauch's
``Hot Spot'' conjecture on the location of the supremum of the second Neumann
eigenfunction on a convex plain domain. We shall study the Liouville type
properties for complete minimal surfaces. Recently the author proved the
existence of a complete and bounded minimal surface. This result settled in the
negative the problem of Calabi and Yau. We expect that mild additional
assumptions will give us the nonexistence result for complete bounded minimal
surfaces.

Elliptic second order equations are at the heart of different fields of
mathematics and especially in the problems of applied mathematics, fluid
dynamics, elasticity, etc. For applications one mostly needs information about
the geometry of the solution of the elliptic equations, locations of their
critical points, dependence of the spectrum on the shape of the domains, etc. We
are planning the study of the geometry of solutions and eigenfunctions of
elliptic equations. In particular we study the problem of the location of the
hottest point in an isolated body in the absence of inner sources of heat. It is
expected that whatever the initial distribution of the temperature the hottest
point after a certain period of time will reach the boundary of the body. This
is a long-standing conjecture, so far proved for the bodies of the simplest
shape like balls, cubes etc. We are planning to settle the "hot spot conjecture"
for a wide class of domains.
