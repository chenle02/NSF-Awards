The goal of this project is to encourage more outstanding undergraduates to
pursue research careers. Considerable experience has been gained in the last
four years with successful REU sites. This year the program is continued with
the key aspects of the previous years including: (1) a successful recruitment
program; (2) careful matching of student interests with available research
projects; (3) an effective management structure; (4) research assignments the
students can quickly grasp and complete in the proposed time frame; and (5)
follow-up procedures designed to maintain student interest in research. The four
research projects involve probabilistic methods, state-of-the-art soils testing,
scale modeling, structural testing, and soil-structure interaction. Two students
are involved in each project to allow for student interaction. Interaction is
also fostered by group seminars and meetings. Follow- through strategies include
a newsletter mailed after the REU student leaves the University of Maine. The
students have full use of advanced laboratories and computational facilities.
