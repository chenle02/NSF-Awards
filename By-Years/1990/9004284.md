The primary purpose of the sabbatical is to allow the principal investigator to
collaborate with Dr. Stuart Barker (University of New England, Armidale,
Australia) on an ecological genetic analysis of cuticular permeability and
epicuticular hydrocarbon composition in Australian populations of the
cactiphilic fly, Drosophila buzzatii. Within and among population genetic
variation for the two traits--and for their plastic response to variation in
ambient temperature and humidity regimes--will be quantified using a half-sib
experimental design. This analysis will repeated three times--during the annual
summer population bottleneck, during recovery from the bottleneck, and when
population sizes are maximal--to assess possible temporal changed in G-matrices.
Mate choice experiments will assess the role of epicuticular hydrocarbons in the
mating system of D. buzzatii. Ancillary experiments will quantify the impact of
dehydration on reproductive performance of D. buzzatii. The sabbatical with Dr.
Barker will provide the principal investigator with conceptual background and
genetic techniques required to conduct his own program of research into the
evolution of physiological adaptations and acclimation responses to
environmental variation. A second project--field and laboratory studies o
australian cicada thermobiology--will augment the principal investigator's work
with U.S. species and lead to phylogenetic analysis of patterns of body
temperature regulation in cicadas.
