0138474&lt;br/&gt;Dong&lt;br/&gt;Under this Investigator Initiated Award, the PI
will focus on assessing the effect that human neutrophil/leukocyte (PMN)
adhesion to melanoma cells has on melanoma cell adhesion and transmigration
across endothelium, i.e., tumor cell extravasation. Evidence suggests that
leukocytes assist tumor cell adhesion and transmigration. Studies will be
performed in a novel flow chamber that permits examination of the effect of flow
on tumor cell attachment. The four aims are: 1) to characterize the role of
tumor-elicited leukocytes in dynamic tumor cell extravasation, 2) to identify
tumor-secreted chemokines associated with PMN recruitment and determine their
ability to assist with tumor extravasation under flow conditions, 3) to
determine hydrodynamic shear effect on adhesion efficiency in tumor-leukocyte
interaction and 4) to foster education/teaching through the application of
engineering principles to cell biology.
