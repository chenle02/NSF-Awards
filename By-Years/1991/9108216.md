With National Science Foundation support, the University of New Mexico's Maxwell
Museum will purchase an ARGUS computer system and use it to manage their large
and valuable anthropological collections. The ARGUS system includes a relational
data base which will allow artifacts to be catalogued, described and retrieved
in different combinations according to required criteria. It will also be used
to record registration and loan data. The result will be improved management of
the collections and increased ease of use for researchers. The collections of
the Maxwell Museum consist of approximately 15,000 individually catalogued and
7,500 cubic feet of box stored archaeological materials, 30,000 individually
catalogued ethnological objects as well as large numbers of photos, slides,
paintings and other materials. Not surprisingly, they focus on the Southwestern
United States. The archaeological materials span the period from Paleoindian
through contact times and are particularly strong in documenting late Puebloan
and contact period occupation from about 1250-1700 A.D. The ethnographic
materials include extensive series of kachinas as well as sand paintings and
constitute a particularly valuable resource for students of native American
cultures. The Maxwell Museum was one of the first in the United States to
automate its collection management and the original SELGEM system is both
inadequate and out of date. As a result, it is difficult to find and track
materials and to meet researchers' specific needs. Installation of ARGUS will
remedy this situation. This project is important because it will help the
Maxwell Museum curate its large and irreplaceable collections. It will increase
access not only to scientists but to the general public.
