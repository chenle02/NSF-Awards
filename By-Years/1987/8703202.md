This research develops a new approach to the lexicon, using network structures
to describe the relationships between the alternative meanings of words. In
traditional theories of the lexicon, these various meanings are simply listed,
as though there were no further lexical structure present. Recent linguistic
research suggests, however, that the lexicon is very highly structured, in ways
not modeled by traditional approaches. This investigation clarifies lexical
network structure in much more detail than has previously been done, and models
these results in ways that will be useful to artificial intelligence researchers
building computer systems for natural language processing. The lexicon - the
body of knowledge about words, their meanings, and how they are related - has
recently become a focus for intense research for natural language processing
systems. The present project, a collaboration between researchers in artificial
intelligence and linguistics, offers a new approach to capturing knowledge about
words. The network approach is meant to be compact (due to a limited number of
links allowed between meanings), yet powerful enough to substantially enhance
the ability of computers to process natural language input and output.
