This research develops a micromechanically based constitutive theory for
polycrystalline ceramic materials. The theory is consistent with the
microstructure of the material and the kinetics of the microstructural changes.
The theory will, therefore, allow for a systematic study of ways in which the
microstructure (i.e., grain size and distribution, defects, surface flaws, etc.)
influence the mechanical performance of the material. The research results will
have a potential to provide rational answers for the dependence of the crack
growing resistance on grain size and will lead to fabrication of better and
mechanically more reliable ceramics.
