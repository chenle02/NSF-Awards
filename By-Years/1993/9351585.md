With the growth in complexity of today's computer applications, there is a need
for increased computing power, not only in supercomputers, but also for other
types of computers, including personal computers. Scientists and researchers
agree that parallel processing represents the only way to increase computer
speeds dramatically. They also believe that parallel processing will be the
architecture of choice for future high performance computers. To prepare for the
future, new scientists and engineers need to learn the architecture and
programming of parallel systems at the undergraduate level. The goal of this
project is to teach undergraduate students in electrical engineering the
fundamental concepts of architecture and programming of systems with parallel
processing. In order to be most effective and provide the strongest learning
experiences, lectures in parallel processing should be coupled with well-
planned, coordinated laboratory studies and experimentation. This proposed
project will enable students to understand and to have hands-on experience on
systems with parallel architectures through integrated lectures and laboratory
experiments.
