An important role of computational geometry is to understand and formalize the
structure of data. And as data is becoming a central currency of modern science,
this role is growing in importance. However, much of classical computational
geometry inherently assumes that all aspects of data are known and precise. This
is rarely the case in practice. This project focuses on building the foundations
for two extensions to classic geometric settings pertinent to noisy data.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. The PI will study locational uncertainty in point sets,
where the location of each data point is described by a probability
distribution. Given such an input, the goal is to formalize how to construct,
approximate, and concisely represent the distribution of geometric queries on
this uncertain data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. The PI will study the geometric
consequences of applying a statistical kernel (e.g. a Gaussian kernel) to a data
set. He will investigate how this process can smooth data, remove degeneracies,
and implicitly simplify and regularize algorithms. Moreover, he will explore the
geometric structure of the resulting kernel density estimate, and how it relates
to algorithms for the data and approximate representations of the data.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will lead the development of a data-focused
educational program around the themes of data analysis, algorithmics, and
visualization. The PI is developing a model course for this program on data
mining; it focuses on the geometric, statistical, and algorithmic properties of
data. An extensive set of course notes is being compiled, accompanied with
videotaped lectures freely available online. This class and program attract many
interdisciplinary and diverse students and observers. This program is part of a
larger effort to make relevant data analysis techniques from computational
geometry available to a broader data-rich audience.
