This award will provide support to a group from Rochester University, to
continue research in high energy physics. The group will participate in a
collaboration using the CLEO II detector at the Cornell Electron Storage Ring
(CESR). The collaboration plans a wide range of studies in high energy physics
including the decay of heavy quarks. The Rochester group will concentrate their
studies on the decay of the heavy b quark. In particular they will determine the
fraction of b quarks that decay to u quarks rather than to c quarks, search for
forbidden decays of b quarks and investigate the decays of the upsilon (4S)
meson into non bb states. These studies are fundamental to the corroboration of
the so called "standard model" of the electronweak interactions.
