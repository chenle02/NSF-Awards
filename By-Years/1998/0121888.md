0121888&lt;br/&gt;Kenkre&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Pan American Advanced Studies
Institutes (PASI) award, jointly supported by NSF and the Department of Energy
(DOE), will take place in Bariloche, Argentina in the spring of 2002, on the
topic of modern challenges in statistical mechanics and its applications.
Organized by Dr. V.M. Kenkre of the University of New Mexico, the institute will
bring scientists from several fields together to conduct an intensive school for
students from the U.S and Latin America focused on two major areas: nonlinear
phenomena and pattern formation in biology, and the validity of the methodology
of statistical mechanics for complex fluids. A third focus area on modern
computational methods in statistical mechanics will serve as general support for
the other two.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The subjects discussed will center around
current areas of much activity in statistical mechanics, in particular: in the
formation of patterns, the role of noise in inducing order as well as disorder,
and applications and implications of statistical mechanics to complex systems in
biology, chemistry, physics, engineering, and other contexts. Dissemination of
this PASI will be accomplished by publishing the proceedings of the school in
book form.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
