Continued analysis and interpretation of data collected during South Channel
Ocean Productivity Experiment (SCOPEX), an interdisciplinary experiment focused
on the North Atlantic right whales, is proposed. Also new modeling to examine
the effect of stratification on tidal rectification, relevant to SCOPEX, is
requested. This proposal covers only the physical oceanographic component.
