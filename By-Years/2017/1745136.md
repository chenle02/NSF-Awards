This project supports travel for early- and mid-career female researchers in
robotics to attend a full-day &lt;br/&gt;workshop at the Robotics Science and
Systems (RSS), which runs July 12-16, 2017 in Boston MA. The need for
a&lt;br/&gt;"Women in Robotics" workshop is compelling: of the 20 workshops at
last year?s RSS, 5 had no female speakers&lt;br/&gt;and 9 had just one. The
workshop will feature keynote speakers, panels on academic and entrepreneurial
career&lt;br/&gt;paths, and a poster session by female graduate students who are
new to the RSS community. While open to the&lt;br/&gt;whole RSS community, the
focus of the workshop is on broadening participation of female researchers in
&lt;br/&gt;robotics, and all the speakers and invited participants will be
women.
