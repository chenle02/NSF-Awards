This award provides support for postdoctoral research on problems arising in
the general area of geometric function theory. The work focuses on the geometric
properties of quasiextremal distance domains. These are domains characterized by
the property that points and closed sets can be joined by curves within the
domain whose lengths do not be arbitrarily long. They are singled out because
they have the characteristics believed to be fundamental for the study of
quasiconformal mappings. Work on this project will concentrate on showing how
the modulus of quasiextremal distance domains carries over to the dilatation
constant for quasiconformal mapping defined on them. A second line of research
will consider the length of level sets of univalent mappings and the question of
the largest power to which such a mapping's derivative has a finite integral.
Complex function theory encompasses the study of differentiable functions of a
complex variable and related classes of functions such as harmonic functions and
quasiconformal mappings. The subject is highly geometric; many of the problems
concern the properties of various sets under transform by functions from one of
the above classes. Applications of the theory to potential theory and fluid
dynamics is now standard in engineering circles
