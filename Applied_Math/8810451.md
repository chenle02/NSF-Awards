This project is mathematical research funded under a Research in Undergraduate
Institutions award. The subject matter is Lie groups, which are relevant to many
areas of mathematics because of their role in embodying the symmetries of
various systems, be they physical, geometrical, or algebraic. More specifically,
Professors Ratcliff and Benson will work on analysis and differential geometry
of nilpotent Lie groups. They hope to classify the Gelfand pairs that arise from
actions of compact groups on nilpotent Lie groups. Professor Ratcliff plans to
develop a discrete decomposition of distribution spaces and operators on the
Heisenberg group. Professor Benson is planning to explore symplectic structures
on nilmanifolds and Kaehler structures on solvmanifolds.
