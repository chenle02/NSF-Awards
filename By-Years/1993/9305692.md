9305692 Berger This award provides 60% of the cost of improving the laboratory
equipment in the thermoluminescence (TL) dating laboratory in the Department of
Geology at the Western Washington University. The University is committed to
providing the remaining funds needed for the equipment upgrade. Thermal
luminescence chronology uses the fact that mineral grains act as dosimeters of
natural radiation capable of storing a portion of the energy from low-level
environmental ionizing radiation (alpha, beta, gamma rays) which they absorb
while at or near the surface. Because daylight empties light-sensitive electron
traps and heating empties all electron traps (i.e., thermally stable defect
sites) the time of last exposure to daylight of unheated samples or the last
heating of volcanically heated materials can be dated with TL methods. At earth
surface temperatures the storage of radiation energy can be accommodated for up
to about one million years, making the TL method especially useful for timing
events in the Quaternary period. The improved capabilities of the Western
Washington University lab will be used in research projects which require dating
of Quaternary samples. ***
