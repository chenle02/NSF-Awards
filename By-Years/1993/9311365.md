9311365 Lane This award provides travel costs for an Assistant Professor at the
University of Alabama to visit China and work with the Qingdao Institute of
Chemical Technology on modelling jet loop reactors for carbonyl synthesis. This
is an important issue in chemical technology which the Chinese have been working
on, and for which they have developed a reactor. During the three-month visit by
Dr. Lane, a computer simulation will be constructed of a jet loop reactor used
to synthesize butyraldehydes from propene, carbon monoxide and hydrogen over a
homogenous cobalt catalyst. This cooperative work on a challenging technical
problem will also open up opportunities for future scientific cooperation with
China. ***
