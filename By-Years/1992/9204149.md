The object of this research is the measurement of the radiative properties of
water clouds near the Azores (June 1992) as a component of the Atlantic
Stratocumulus Transition Experiment (ASTEX). In particular, the University of
Washington research aircraft will make measurements of the spectral absorption
of solar radiation by these clouds, the optical thickness, effective particle
size, bidirectional reflectance of cloud tops, and the flux of ultraviolet
radiation in and above the clouds. Also, as opportunities permit, microphysical
structure and radiative measurements will be made of clouds modified by the
effluents from ships.
