This NSF Rapid response Research (RAPID) project will examine the differences in
immune response between individuals who live or die after infection with the
Ebola virus. Currently it is not well understood why some infected individuals
live while others die. It is important to understand how the response of immune
system develops before the symptoms of the disease appears. In this proposal,
investigators will examine blood samples from Ebola patients to look for
proteins associated with immune response, and examine the differences in these
immune proteins between patients who live versus patients who die after
infection. They will also examine the time course of the appearance of immune
proteins. Early detection of changes in these immune proteins will allow for the
identification of the individuals, such as health care workers, already exposed
to the virus. Such screening of the immune system may also lead to discovery of
antibodies that are produced by the immune system of some individuals who
survived the disease. These antibodies can be used for vaccine development or be
used directly in infected individuals as a
therapeutic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical: The goal of this NSF Rapid response
Research (RAPID) project is to determine the immunosignature of individuals who
have survived the Ebola infection and to examine the time course of the
immunosignature during infection prior to the development of symptoms. The PI
will use a technology developed in his laboratory that employs high density
arrays of peptides to detect antibody binding using a less than a drop of blood.
The pattern of binding depends on the immunological state or health status of
the individual. The PI has collaborators in place with access to blood samples
from previous Ebola outbreaks, as well as access to samples from the current
Ebola outbreak. This work should lead to the development of methodologies for
early detection of Ebola infection prior to the development symptoms, and could
advance vaccine and therapeutic development.
