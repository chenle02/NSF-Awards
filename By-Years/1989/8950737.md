Mount Holyoke is upgrading its introductory physics labs by using new technology
in carefully chosen applications to enhance the educational value of the lab.
They are using 12 microcomputers, a frame grabber, A/D electronics, and software
to use in new introductory lab applications. These do not replace stopwatches
and meter sticks with high-tech equivalents: students need to know and have
confidence in rough and ready methods of measurement. The role for the new
technology is to have students go where they could not go before: (1) acquire
previously unattainable kinds of data, and (2) have access to conceptual tools
for visualization and thought experiments. An essential part of the plan is the
development of software which builds on the social ambiance of the introductory
lab: real data from real experiments, and discussions with lab partners and
instructors. The computer will (1) talk to the outside world through instrument
interfaces, (2) talk to clusters of users through graphics, and (3) enable the
kinds of manipulations students need to perform: arithmetic on data, graphing,
fitting, varying of parameters, and visualizing. All of this is being smoothly
integrated, so that the graphics screen becomes a focus for discussion, and new
analyses or ideas can be tried out with just a few keystrokes or mouse clicks.
The grantee provides funds for this project that are an equal match for the NSF
award. The University will contribute an amount equal to the award.
