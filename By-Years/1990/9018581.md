A cooperative program with oceanographers at Kagoshima and Kyushu Universities
in Japan will investigate the variability of the Kuroshio for about one year.
Seven inverted echo sounders (IES) complement the array of current meters
provided by the Japanese universities and allow time series of baroclinic
fluctuations to be calculated. Free exchange of data and joint analysis will
take place between the principal investigators.
