&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;0118406&lt;br/&gt;Gray&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Americas
Program award will support a workshop organized by Dr. Charles M. Gray, Montana
State University, and Dr. Pedro E. Maldonado of the University of Chile, to be
held in Pucon, Chile in March 2002. The workshop will focus on the theoretical
and experimental foundations of cooperative cortical dynamics with the goal of
discussing different and complementary approaches to improve our understanding
of brain function.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participants will discuss theoretical
and empirical approaches to characterizing and modeling neuronal activity in
different structures of the nervous system, using a variety of methods ranging
from electrophysiological techniques for the recording of large numbers of
neurons to the mathematical analysis of spike trains. An added benefit of this
activity will be the introduction of advances in systems neuroscience and
techniques employed to examine cortical function to students from the U.S. and
throughout Latin America. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
