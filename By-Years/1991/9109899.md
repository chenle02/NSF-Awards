These experiments will examine why some foods stimulate overeating
(hyperphagia). This research is based on the finding that the addition of an
artificial sweetener (saccharin) to high- moisture foods stimulates long-term
energy intake of laboratory rats. Pre-exposing rats to either the unflavored
food or saccharin in water blocks the ability of saccharin to increase energy
intake; this is called the pre-exposure effect. In all experiments, rats will
either be pre-exposed or not pre- exposed to flavors and then fed test diets for
several weeks. Test diets will contain either no added flavor, saccharin,
monosodium glutamate, citric acid, or vanilla. Experiments involving saccharin
will determine whether or not rats learn relationships between the flavor of
saccharin and subsequent absorption of food energy, whether or not experience
with saccharin in food influences subsequent preference for saccharin, and
whether or not the pre-exposure effect persists over time. The information
obtained from these experiments should improve our understanding of how
chemosensory stimuli influence energy intake and growth. This, in turn, will be
useful for developing treatments that increase or decrease energy intake by
humans and domestic animals, as well as assist those developing improved foods
and beverages.
