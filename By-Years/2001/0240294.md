Color vision in butterflies is dependent upon the presence of different
photoreceptor neurons within the retina, which are sensitive to different colors
of light. Just as in many vertebrate and invertebrate species, this results from
the highly regulated expression of different forms of the light sensitive visual
pigment rhodopsin, in different types of photoreceptor cells. During evolution,
gene duplication events have produced numerous forms of rhodopsin in different
species. The PIs will study this evolutionary process and the origin of the
different forms of rhodopsin. The PIs will examine the rhodopsins of the Tiger
Swallowtail butterfly (Papilio glaucus) as well as those of more distantly
related species. The PIs will measure the colors of light absorbed by the
different butterfly rhodopsins and determine which specific photoreceptor cells
within the retina express each form of rhodopsin. The PIs will also compare the
amino acid and nucleotide sequences of these and other rhodopsins to determine
whether the rhodopsins absorbing the same wavelengths of light are likely to
have evolved from a common ancestral gene or if they may have evolved
independently. These studies will clarify the evolutionary mechanisms by which
color vision was established, and contribute to the basic knowledge of the
visual system of insects.
