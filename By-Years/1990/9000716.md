Six students will be chosen to participate in this Research Experiences for
Undergraduates project. Seven faculty members engaged in five research programs
will introduce the students to a variety of possible directions on which to
focus their energies. They include work on the phi-transform, a new tool in
harmonic analysis for decomposing general functions as sums of simple terms. It
mixes time and frequency considerations, providing cancellation in powerful and
subtle ways. Particular examples involving electromagnetic scattering,
electrocardiogram analysis and NMR imaging will be studied. Work on Chern-Moser-
Tanaka invariants in the theory of several complex variables has been hampered
by the difficulty in calculating the invariants. Now it is possible to involve
students in the use of symbol manipulation algorithms to make estimates and
create numerical models to study these important mathematical structures.
Students may also work on mathematical models of molecular evolution, (the
distribution of nucleotides in the coding regions of individuals chosen from a
random-mating population); on new high resolution methods for constructing
magnetic resonance images from raw MR scanner data; on Fourier analysis over
local fields; and on combinatorial number theory, specifically, on the
randomness of the distribution of primes. Efforts will be made to encourage
students to develop their work into publishable form or as the basis for senior
honors theses.
