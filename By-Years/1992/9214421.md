Grand Valley State University proposes to capitalize upon the recent efforts to
improve science equipment and instructional space to now complete its
modernization agenda by updating and consolidating its research and research
training facility. The resultant modernization and consolidation will improve
research and research training in biology, chemistry, geology, and the Water
Resources Institute. Specifically, this grant will be used to: Remodel 18
dedicated individual research laboratories, upgrade and modernize research and
research training laboratories, consolidate research and research training
activities currently scattered elsewhere on campus, provide flexibility for
future growth, and modernize the infrastructure. Modernizing the infrastructure
includes: replacement of the HVAC primary coil, air balance the HVAC system,
replacement of the temperature control system, replacement of worn/inadequate
gas, water, and air systems, increase utility capacity and flexibility, provide
a centralized high purity water system, and incorporate state-of-the-art
environment safety controls.
