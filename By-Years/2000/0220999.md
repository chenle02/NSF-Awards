Interactions of Meddies with Seamounts&lt;br/&gt;Georgi Sutyrin
URI&lt;br/&gt;William Dewar FSU&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will address the
dynamics and transport properties of self-propagating, baroclinic-eddies in the
presence of topography. Eddies of Mediterranean origin (Meddies) are examples of
these features. The dynamical impact of vortex property transport and
propagation of seamount-Meddy collisions have been observed buy are poorly
understood. Numerical models will be used to examine the following related
topics: topographic effects on Meddy transport, topographic influences on Meddy
propagation, mean flow generation on topography by Meddies and consequent
feedbacks. These studies are pertinent to the question of how to parameterize
tracer transport in large-scale models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
