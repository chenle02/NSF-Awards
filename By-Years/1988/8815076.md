This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of robotics and computer-aided analytical chemistry. The focus of
this research is on the development of computer-controlled robotics which can
perform as an expert analytical chemist. Thus, this system should be able to
design, test and implement its own analytical procedures. This project focuses
on three new areas of research: 1) the development of a chemical analysis expert
system, 2) time optimization of robotic procedures, and 3) development of
standard robotic methods. This research is designed to develop computer software
which will act as artificial intelligence for laboratory robots. Such software
will allow the robot to perform at the level of an experienced analytical
chemist.
