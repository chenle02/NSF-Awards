9512931 Jenkins This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research
in mechanics and statistical physics between Cornell University and the
University of Rennes. The investigators are James T. Jenkins and Michel Louge
and Daniel Bideau and his research group at Rennes. The investigators propose
studies on granular materials. They will focus on a simple problem of
determining the motion of a single particle moving on or near the surface of a
bumpy, frictional, inclined plane. The project has important industrial
applications and takes advantage of complementary expertise in physics of
granular materials at Rennes and mechanics expertise at Cornell. ***
