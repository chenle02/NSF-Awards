This project is a collaborative effort between the University of Pittsburgh and
Carnegie Mellon University to promote innovation to students on both campuses.
This project is aligned with NSF goals for promoting innovation and educating
students such that they understand the pathways to a career in Science
Technology Engineering and Math (STEM) Innovation. The project goal is to design
and develop a program that utilizes the NSF Graduate Research Fellows Program
(GRFP) and the NSF I-Corps Sites program to introduce graduate students to
innovation career opportunities in Science Technology Engineering and Math
(STEM). These GRFP students will be included in I-Corps teams and offer domain
expertise in STEM related topics while learning the innovation process through a
virtual opportunity start-up facilitated by the Innovation institute.
&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project will also include interdisciplinary
activities such as field trips to expose the students to regional innovation
resources and allow them to gain an understanding of the regional innovation
ecosystem. The project team will track student engagement level in the project
as well as the success of the participants for five years after graduation and
metrics associated with diversity and inclusion. The project will launch a pilot
to evaluate the proposed model and share the outcomes of this pilot project with
other NSF Sites and Nodes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
