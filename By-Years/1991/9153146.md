The Electrical Communications Laboratory facilities at the University of Texas
at San Antonio are being upgraded to extend and cover the traditional as well as
new base technologies, such as fiber optics, satellite communications, high
definition television, and digital audio recording. Three levels of
experimentation are used. Initially, experiments dealing with the design of
basic building blocks of analog and digital communications systems are
investigated to provide familiarity with various signal processing techniques
used in modern communications systems, instruction on how to operate
communication laboratory test equipment such as spectrum and modulation domain
analyzers, and exposure to some hardware/software implementation. The second
level of experimentation involves small system design in which discrete or
integrated devices are used to build small systems. Level three involves
experimentation with a complete communications system such as a fiber optics
network or a simulated satellite link like "MODEM" which can simulate an entire
digital communications system and provide performance information similar to
laboratory observations.
