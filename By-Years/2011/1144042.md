The work of the proposed Message Passing Interface Forum addresses the
continuation of activity focused on enhancing the Message Passing Interface
(MPI) for passing data between processors in distributed computing systems built
from heterogeneous multi-cores, for parallel remote file operations, and for
dynamic process control of such parallel applications. The current standard
provides a core of routines used for point-to-point and one-sided data exchange,
blocking collective communications routines, remote parallel file access and
dynamic process control. In addition, these are augmented with support for
features such as derived data types, communications contexts, process groups,
and virtual process topologies. &lt;br/&gt;The work of this forum will produce a
communications standard suitable for addressing the needs of parallel
applications on the next generation computing facilities at the petascale level
and beyond.
