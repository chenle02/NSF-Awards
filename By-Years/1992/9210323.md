This project involves efforts to incorporate more realistic psychological
assumptions into formal economics, both at a general level and in particular
economic applications. The research emphasizes two general areas. First, many
social scientists have criticized mainstream economics as too narrowly focused
on how people pursue their material self- interest, ignoring social goals such
as fairness. The project involves developing a general game-theoretic model of
the fact that people try to help those who help them and hurt those who hurt
them. The model's implications in several economic situations are considered,
and it is shown how consumer concerns over fairness will lead a monopolist to
lower its price. The second area of research is to understand the economic
implications of "loss aversion" and the "endowment effect." These notions
summarize strong psychological evidence of seemingly central features of human
preferences: our utility from consumption is heavily influenced by our status
quo, and we tend to weigh losses relative to this status quo more heavily than
gains. Foundations are developed for incorporating such issues, and economic
applications are pursued. The main application under development is consumer
dynamic savings-versus-consumption decisions, investigating whether consumers
tend to resist lowering their consumption in response to bad news about future
income. This research brings more realism to economic models by incorporating
well-established psychological findings. It takes a significant step toward
building a useful and descriptive theory to enhance our understanding of human
behavior.
