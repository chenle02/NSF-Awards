Education Development Center, Inc. (EDC), in collaboration with seven school
districts, two subcontractors (EdCo and Inverness Research Associates), a
publisher (Sunburst Communications), and a large group of consultants and
advisors, proposes to develop a new mathematics curriculum that will address the
unique needs of middle school students. This curriculum will build upon the
central theme of mathematics in the human experience and will focus upon
students' learning to see and think mathematically. It will reflect a view of
learning as a process of constructing one's own knowledge, and it will emphasize
the importance of the social context of learning for middle school students. It
will integrate the use of computer simulations, exploratory environments, and
tools. This project will bring a new vision of mathematics, new types of
learning experiences, and a new structure to the middle school curriculum. It
will also address the critical issues that can determine whether a new
curriculum is widely accepted and used well, including teacher suport, student
assessment, classroom implementation, curriculum evaluation, and parent
involvement.
