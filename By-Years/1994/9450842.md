9450842 Glover This project will to enable underrepresented minority (Afro-
American) students to develop the skills in using modern technology which they
will need if they are to enter and contribute to the mainstream of research
efforts in the U.S.A. Students will gain hands-on experience in using digitized
video as a research technique for studying a wide variety of physical systems;
increase student interest in physics by using digitized video to broaden the
range of systems which can be studied in the physics laboratory; and increase
student understanding of physics by enabling them to make measurements with
greater precision and detail than is possible using just meter sticks and stop
clocks.
