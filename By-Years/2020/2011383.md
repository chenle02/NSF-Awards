This award supports research in relativity and relativistic astrophysics and it
addresses the priority areas of NSF's "Windows on the Universe" Big Idea. Much
excitement has accompanied the beginning of the gravitational wave era ushered
in by LIGO's first detections, and this project seeks to study and model the
types of systems observed in these detections. In particular, this work will
implement a number of physical processes including magnetic and neutrino cooling
and heating effects in a numerical code used to simulate such systems. For a few
different reasons, a phase transition at very high densities is expected in
neutron star matter, and this project will study what range of effects such a
transition could have on both the gravitational wave signature and
electromagnetic emissions. This study will contribute to furthering the science
obtained with LIGO and electromagnetic telescopes as well as future
observatories. The project will train students and other personnel and its
research will be broadly disseminated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In an effort to push
forward the multi-messenger science achieved in the merger of non-vacuum,
compact object mergers, this project seeks the continued development of a
distributed and adaptive code infrastructure that models such mergers within
relativistic, magnetohydrodynamics. In addition to magnetic effects, realistic
equations of state, along with neutrino heating and cooling, will be adopted in
simulations of the merger and post-merger of compact object binaries. In
addition, adopting a model of a high density phase transition in a piecewise-
polytropic equation of state agnostic to the underlying physics, the range of
dynamics for such transitions in mergers will be
studied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
