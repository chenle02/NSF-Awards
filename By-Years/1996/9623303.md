9623303 Dorit Ribozymes are the smallest biological molecules capable of
transmitting genetic information and of carrying out biochemical functions. In
the research funded by this award, new biological activities for these RNA
enzymes will be generated using a novel experimental in vitro system. These
experiments explore the molecular basis of biocatalysis, and the ease with which
novel enzymatic functions may be evolved. Such questions, fundamental to an
understanding of cellular metabolism, have previously been considered only in a
theoretical context. The work conducted under this award will reveal the
catalytic versatility of these experimentally tractable and biologically
important molecules, and help establish guidelines for the development and
design of biomolecules of potential diagnostic, therapeutic and environmental
utility.
