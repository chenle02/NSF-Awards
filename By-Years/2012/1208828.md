This research will investigate many-body spinor atomic Bose-Einstein condensates
beyond the mean field limit. Our focus is on generating and studying quantum-
correlated spin states including squeezed and entangled states, as well as
exploring the application of these states to quantum-enhanced metrology of
magnetic fields. This research builds upon our recent observation of spin-
nematic squeezed states created in a spin-1 condensate quenched through a
quantum phase transition. Additionally, we will investigate non-equilibrium
quantum spin dynamics that will explore the fascinating intersection of
metastability, correlations and entanglement in a quasi-isolated quantum spin
system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These studies provide insight into fundamental
principles of many-particle quantum mechanics that are important to many areas
of physics. Squeezed and entangled states have a wide range of applications in
quantum metrology, foundational studies of quantum mechanics, and quantum
information and quantum simulations. This work utilizes and develops many of the
techniques of ultra-cold atomic physics. Ultra-cold atoms and molecules have
become important tools in studies of low-energy collisions, quantum degenerate
gases (including Bose-Einstein condensates and degenerate Fermi gases) and
precision measurements of fundamental constants and symmetries. Technological
applications of these systems include precision sensors for navigation and
magnetometry, atomic clocks and emerging quantum technologies including quantum
information and communication. Ultra-cold atoms also provide new tools to
investigate important problems in condensed matter physics including exotic
magnetic order thought to arise in a wide variety of frustrated magnetic
materials and unconventional superconductors.
