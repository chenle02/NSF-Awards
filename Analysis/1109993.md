This award will support the participation of graduate students and postdocs in
the "2011 Riviere-Fabes Symposium" that will be held at the University of
Minnesota-Twin Cities from April 15-17, 2011.

This annual conference, of which the 2011 meeting will be the fourteenth in the
series, celebrates the mathematical legacy of Nestor M. Riviere and Eugene B.
Fabes by focusing on recent developments in analysis, especially in the field of
partial differential equations. The 2011 program will feature two principle
speakers (Hitoshi Ishii and Michael Taylor), each of whom will give a two-hour
lecture, and a number of one-hour talks delivered primarily by young
mathematicians (Xiaochun Li, Yvan Martel, Robert McCann, Susanna Terracini). The
program allows ample time for informal discussion among the participants.
