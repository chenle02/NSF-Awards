This award supports an investigation into three problems involving the theta
correspondence, the Siegel-Weil formula, values and derivatives of Eisenstein
series and L-functions, and algebraic cycles on Shimura varieties. Problem I
concerns the basic properties of the local theta correspondence, especially the
question of the first occurence. Problem II concerns a possible relation between
the height pairings of algebraic cycles on certain Shimura varieties and the
Fourier expansions of central derivatives of Siegel Eisenstein series. Problem
III involves the application of the relation of Problem II to the derivative, at
the center of symmetry, of certain Langlands L-functions, generalizing the
formula of Gross and Zagier. The research falls in the general mathematical area
of the Langlands program.The Langlands program is part of Number Theory, which
is the study of the properties of the whole numbers and is the oldest branch of
mathematics. From the beginning problems in number theory have furnished a
driving force in creating new mathematics in other diverse parts of the
discipline. The Langlands program is a general philosophy that connects number
theory with calculus; it embodies the modern approach to the study of whole
numbers. Modern number theory is very technical and deep, but it has had
astonishing applications in areas like theoretical computer science and coding
theory.
