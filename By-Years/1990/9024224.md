This project deals with the development of systems which use acoustic signals to
monitor the performance of equipment. There is a wide variety of potential
applications for such acoustic monitoring systems. As sensors and computer
hardware become smaller and less expensive, all manner of machines and
structures could be provided with "nerve systems" to assess their health. This
project involves three phases, comprising 1) modeling of acoustic systems, 2)
data acquisition and signal processing, and 3) system identification. The system
envisioned ultimately will consist of an acoustic excitation, a transmission
path, one or more receivers, and hardware for signal processing and computation.
The monitoring of beams for cracks will be considered as a specific example.
