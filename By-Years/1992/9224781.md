This U.S.-Russia "Workshop on Radiation Heat Transfer in Highly Coupled
Physical Systems" will bring four Russian and one Belorussian researcher to the
University of Texas at Austin for one week in October 1993 to confer with
thirteen American scientists under the leadership of Dr. John R. Howell and Dr.
Theodore L. Bergman. The Russian/Belorussian group will be led by Dr. Alexander
Ivanovich Leontiev of Moscow Technical and State University, and includes: Dr.
Arkady G. Blokh, Central Boiler &amp; Turbine Institute, Russian Academy of
Sciences Ä±A/S!, St Petersburg; Dr. Gennady S. Romanov, Heat &amp; Mass Transfer
Institute, Belorussian A/S; and Dr. Vladimir K. Shikov, Institute of High
Temperatures, Russian A/S; and Dr. Sergei T. Surzhikov, Institute of Mechanics
Problems, Russian A/S and Moscow Physico-Technical U. The researchers will
exchange information and plan collaborative research in radiative heat transfer.
The workshop will center on problems and applications in which radiation is
highly coupled with other heat transfer mechanisms. Specific topics to be
discussed will be: (1) Radiation in Porous, Particulate, or Composite Media; (2)
Radiation in Combustion; and (3) Radiative-Convective Heat Transfer in Low-
Temperature Plasmas. Based on the technical discussions, cooperative research
projects between groups in the U.S. and in Russia and Belorussia will be
identified. This project in energy studies and mechanical engineering fulfills
the program objectives of advancing science by enabling leading experts in the
U.S., Belorussia, and Russia to combine complementary talents and pool research
resources in the areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
