INT 9722589 Baker This U.S.-Hungary research project between R. Terry K. Baker
of Northeastern University, Boston, and Zoltan Paal of the Institute of
Isotopes, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Budapest, will examine deactivation
phenomena associated with supported metal catalyst systems. Specifically, the
collaborative work will feature the formation of carbonaceous deposits produced
on supported platinum particles from interaction with selected probe molecules.
The intent is to develop a metal-supported system that will enable control of
the amount and form of carbon deposit accumulation on platinum surfaces when
heated in a carbon-containing gas environment. If successful, this could improve
our ability to: 1) manipulate the size, morphology and crystallographic features
of platinum particles and 2) identify the optimum amount of additives or
impurities required for tailoring the catalytic properties of the system. This
engineering project in chemical reaction processes fulfills the program
objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the
United States and Central Europe to combine complementary talents and pool
research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence. ??
