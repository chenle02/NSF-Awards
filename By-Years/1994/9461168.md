This availability of a compact e-beam with low cost and lack of high voltage
leads would be attractive for use in non-destructive evaluation (NDE), process
control, and imaging. NDE applications continues to grow and place new
requirements on the sources of X-rays. To evaluate thick cross sections, high
energy X-rays are needed. In certain cases, access is also limited. This is
especially true during periodic inspection of ships, airplanes, etc. In this
SBIR Phase I proposal, a new device for the production of compact, high current
(mA's), variable energy electron beams will be discussed. The device uses
cyclotron acceleration of electrons. The acceleration takes place in a microwave
cavity with an axial magnetic field. The resonant frequency of the cavity
coincides with the electron cyclotron frequency. A high heat-flux capability
target ( a heatpipe or a porous metal heat exchanger), is used to generate the
X-rays. The energy of the electrons at the target may be varied by changing the
radial location of the target.
