This Small Grant for Exploratory Research award provides funding for the PI to
conduct a field study to track the dispersal of coral larvae after a mass-
spawning event in the Florida Keys in August 2004. NOAA/NURP, NURC/UNCW and the
Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary are supporting various components of the
overall project. This SGER provides supplementary funding to test a new concept,
of using magnetic particles of the size and buoyancy of the coral larvae, and an
array of magnetic collectors, to measure the potential time-integrated dispersal
patterns of the coral larvae. This is a conceptually new method that if it
works, can be applied to many types of dispersal studies. The development has
the potential to constitute a major advance in methods available for biological
oceanographic studies.
