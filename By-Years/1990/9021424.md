This award will provide supplemental support to enable Dr. Charles Warner of the
Food and Drug Administration to conduct a collabora- tive research for one year
with Dr. Kunitoshi Yoshikera, Director of the Division of Food Abilities of the
Japanese National Institute of Hygienic Sciences. He will conduct research on
the safety of butylated amisole (BHA) and butylated tolerence (BHT) when used to
extend the useful service life of frying oils. This will permit an assessment of
the risks and benefits associated with the use of such syntheti oxidants. This
work will continue work begun by Dr. Frank Joe in the laboratory of Dr.
Yoshihara.
