This research seeks to develop a chemical modeling approach to the reaction
engineering of complex reaction systems, such as lignin pyrolysis. The objective
is aimed at the elucidation of the reaction pathways, kinetics, and mechanisms
underlying the lignin pyrolysis. This chemical modeling work focuses on well-
characterized model systems (e.g. model compounds) that mimic the key structured
aspects of the actual complex systems. Experiments and analyses of the model
systems will follow. The model obtained from this study will be helpful for
lignin pyrolysis process design, control and optimization.
