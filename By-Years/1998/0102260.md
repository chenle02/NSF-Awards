Prop # 0102260&lt;br/&gt;PI Russell McDuff&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will
supply shipboard scientific support equipment for the research vessels Thompson
and Barnes operated by the University of Washington and dedicated to use in
support of marine research. The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program
provides funds for ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe
conduct of ocean science research. The Program provides support for such items
as deck equipment including winch systems for the deployment and retrieval of
scientific instruments, navigational equipment such as radars, gyroscopes and
earth satellite receivers to pin point the location of research sites,
communication equipment including radio transceivers and satellite transceivers
for voice and scientific data communications and other equipment such as
motorized workboats for transporting scientists to and from data retrieval
sites. The Project Director, Russell McDuff is fully qualified to direct this
project having had considerable experience in overseeing the acquisition and
installation of shipboard equipment. This project will allow the institution to
acquire tension meter system, Inmarsat B, Oil Spill Boom, and a precision
Autopilot System. ***&lt;br/&gt;
