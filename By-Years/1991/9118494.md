This award is for support of a project to measure the helium concentrations and
isotope ratios, K/Ar ratios, and Krypton 81 ages in ice from Vostok Station,
Antarctica. The helium program is a search for nulls and/or reversals of the
Earth's magnetic field, which should leave a strong signal in the helium 3 to
helium 4 ratios and the helium 3 concentrations in ice core helium. If a
geomagnetic helium event is recorded in the ice sheets, it will provide a world-
wide traceable horizon in both Greenland and Antarctica, for model studies of
ice flow and for chronology. The Kr/Ar measurements are to study gravitational
fractionation of gases in the firn. The Krypton 81 dating will provide the first
absolute age on the Vostok core.
