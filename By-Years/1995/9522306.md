9522306 Issa This project will study the reliability of models that are used to
predict failure of brittle materials in applications from data that is generated
on small test specimens. The success of the study hinge on: (a) formulating a
similarity criteria for testing, (b) selecting an adequate kinetic model for
crack nucleation and propagation which reflects experimental observations of
fracture mechanisms, and (c) formulating a three dimensional reliability model
for brittle struatural elements. The study will combine the Weakest Link Theory
for modeling crack nucleation with Statistical Fracture Mechanisms formalism
describing the statistical features of the macroscopic crack growth. ***
