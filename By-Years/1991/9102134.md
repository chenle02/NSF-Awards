Common carrier operations, including truckload trucking, less- than-truckload
trucking, rail and ocean container, are playing increasingly important roles in
the manufacturing and production process. These carriers are, for the most part,
being asked to provide an even higher quality of service for an even lower cost
for shippers using their standard services. This pressure has been combined with
a substantial increase in the size of the largest carriers, complicating the
overall operation. A common mathematical foundation is developed which focuses
on dynamic fleet management under forecasting uncertainties, which is formulated
as a network with random arc capacities (representing market demands). A novel
solution strategy is used, extending similar research developed for stochastic
models of truckload operations. The core of the research is on the solution of
stochastic, dynamic models arising in fleet management problems, and the
development of approximation methods for stochastic programs that allow the
solution of large, real-world problems. Extensive empirical testing in a
simulation environment is planned.
