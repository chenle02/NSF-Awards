World-class manufacturing systems of the future will satisfy diverse customer
demands with extremely low lead times at minimal costs. Virtual manufacturing
systems will be developed as surrogates for today's manufacturing organization
to achieve this world-class distinction. This proposed research supports the
movement toward this goal by investigating the feasibility of the `Factory-in-
the-Computer`; a decision support/status reporting system which integrates
status with predictive technologies. The Factory-in-the-Computer will be
designed to inform different types of managers of current and past system status
as well as projecting the effect of any decision he or she makes in a consistent
and understandable manner. Thus, it will have significant commercial value to
manufacturing companies. In this proposed research, Pritsker Corporation will
characterize and classify the types of problems for which managers require
status and predictive information. They will investigate how existing data
review, interactive graphics, object oriented query, and other analysis
technologies can be applied to these problem classes. This research (Phase I)
will lead to a specification for capabilities of the Factory-in-the-Computer.
