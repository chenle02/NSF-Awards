This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This awards supports an investigation
of the deepwater circulation response to the opening of the Southern Ocean
passages in the Eocene. The PIs will generate benthic foraminiferal stable
isotope data from the middle-late Eocene in multiple ocean basins to test the
hypotheses that (1) the internally stratified Cenozoic ocean structure began ~40
Ma in response to increasing dense southern component water relative to northern
component water, and (2) interbasinal oxygen isotope gradients gradually
increased through the late Eocene as southern ocean gateways progressively
deepened, allowing the proto-Antarctic Circumpolar current to develop and
strengthen. The data generated will shed light on the relationship between ocean
circulation changes and the alteration of the marine carbon cycle as reflected
in the carbonate compensation depth, and on the development of a better defined
internal ocean structure and associated nutrient distribution as a forcing
mechanism for these changes. Broader impacts include education and training of a
PhD student, involvement of undergraduates in laboratory research, and outreach
to local high schools via guest lectures and curriculum development.&lt;br/&gt;
