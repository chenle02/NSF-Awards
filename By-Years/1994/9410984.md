9410984 Raghavan The focus of this proposal is the modeling of the functional
dependence of non-Gaussian response variables on a given set of predictors.
Examples of this include the logistic regression model, where the response is
binary and the log-linear Poisson model where the response represents counts of
incidents in a given time interval. The function of interest is estimated
nonparametrically, using generalized smoothing splines. Inferential procedures
based on a Bayesian formulation, wherein a stochastic process prior is imposed
on this function, will be investigated. A more complete answer requires finite
sample calculations which is a computationally imposing task. Monte Carlo
methods for analysis of the posterior will be explored. ***
