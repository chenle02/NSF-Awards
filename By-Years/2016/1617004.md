This project will study the stars in triple-star systems, which have three stars
orbiting a common center of mass. These systems have orbits which cause the
stars to eclipse, or move in front of, eachother as seen during observation. The
stars' movements will be used to determine their fundamental properties. The
project takes advantage of the fact that the stars in a triple-star system are
at the same distance from us, which makes it possible to determine their
relative sizes. Follow-up spectroscopy of the stars' radial velocities and
detailed modeling is used to determine absolute radii. Triple-star systems have
very complicated motion, which changes their apparent brightness over time. The
team will model these data to determine the internal mass distributions. They
will train graduate students working on Master's degrees and undergraduate
students working on senior thesis projects. The investigators will also
incorporate research results into their college courses and public lectures.

The work will be completed by examining, for the first time, the apsidal motion
of three-body eclipsing binaries for stars less massive than the Sun. The rate
of apsidal precession is related to the mass distribution inside the stars,
which the team will model. They will use archival NASA Kepler mission
lightcurves (photometric time series) and photo-dynamical computer models to
measure the apsidal motion constants, which are directly related to the
distribution and concentration of mass inside a star. The constants will be
determined by modeling the changes in orbital period of the stars. They will use
spectroscopy obtained at multiple ground-based telescopes to measure the radial
velocities and determine the standard stellar photospheric characteristics, such
as effective temperature, metallicity, surface gravity and rotational velocity.
They will make publicly available the datasets and tools they developed to model
multiple overlapping eclipse events for the astronomical community, as well as
the eclipse times, and radial velocity measurements.
