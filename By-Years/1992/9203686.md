This is an individual award for the Postdoctoral Fellowship in Plant Biology.
The applicant received her Ph.D. from Northwestern University and her Ph.D.
research was in signal transduction in animal cells. She plans to carry out her
postdoctoral fellowship research in the laboratory of Dr. Donald Weeks at
University of Nebraska. The proposed research entitled "Molecular analysis of
photoreceptor mediating phototaxis and entrainment of the circadian oscillator
in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii" will introduce the Fellow to plant biology.
