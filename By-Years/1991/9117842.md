Description: This project supports travel and field expenses for Dr. R. Newton
of the University of Chicago to collaborate with three Indian geologists: Dr.
A.S Janardhan of Mysor University, Dr. T.C. Devaraju of Karnatak University, and
Dr. B. Mahabaleswar of Bangalore University. The research will continue
investigations of the late Archean deep-crustal section of southern Karnataka
and northern Tamil Nadu, India, following on the earlier NSF-supported project
of the Principal investigator. The orthopyroxene isograde ("Fermor's Line") will
be investigated as to causative mineral reactions, areal continuity, geochemical
progression, and evidence for the role of infiltrating fluids in the Archean
deep crust. The major thrust of the project will be the elucidation of the early
history of a continent. The project also provides funds for living expenses of
the Indian scientists while doing laboratory studies in the U.S. Scope: The U.S.
scientist is a well respected geologist with long experience in Indian
geological research. He is particularly qualified to accomplish the most through
the collaboration with the selected Indian scientists. The area of research is
of interest to the U.S. and is also of great interest to the Indian scientists.
The project fully meets the objectives of the US-India Program.
