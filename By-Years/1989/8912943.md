This award will provide supplementary support to enable Dr. David Saffen of the
Johns Hopkins University to conduct collaborative research with Dr. Tatsuya Haga
for one year at the Institute of Brain Research, University of Tokyo Medical
School, Japan. They will use pharmacologic methods to characterize the induction
of particular genes following activation of specific receptors in neurological
tissue. It is known that synoptic or pharmacologic activation of neurotrans-
mitter receptors in the cell membrane can result in a rapid genomic response in
neurons of the central nervous system. Dr. Saffen's research aims at increasing
our understanding of this process by stimulating such responses first in
neuroblastoma cells, then attempting to duplicate the response in hippocampal
slices and the adult rat brain. The collaborating Japanese laboratory was a
pioneer in the investigation of nerve cell receptors, and this collaborative
effort may be expected to yield important results in the understanding of neuron
function.
