The International Research Fellowship Program enables U.S. scientists and
engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research abroad. The
program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique
or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.

This award will support a twenty-four month research fellowship by Dr. Susana
Gonzalo to work with Dr. Manuel Serrano at the National Center of Biotechnology
in Madrid, Spain.

For this project, the PI will identify the cis-activity promoter elements of the
INK4a/ARF locus that are responsive to the transcriptional repressor Bmi-1, and
then identify the transacting transcription factors that mediate Bmi-1
repression of this gene. The INK4a/ARF locus encodes two proteins (p16in4a/ARF)
that are important for two different tumor suppressor pathways in mammalian
cells. The expression of both of these proteins is repressed during normal cell
growth, but becomes elevated in response to oncogenic stresses to prevent the
proliferation and survival of cells in which an oncogene has become activated.
This study is critical to understand the control mechanisms that cells use to
fight cancer.

Dr. Serrano is an authority in the fields of cell-cycle and tumor suppression.
His lab has critical tools necessary to develop this project.
