As an abundance of hardware and software tools is dramatically decreasing the
cost and effort required to manipulate digital images, the risks and dangers
associated with malicious attackers easily routing doctored images through
computer and social networks to purposefully influence viewers' opinions,
attitudes, and actions have never been more severe. While there is a growing
awareness that images no longer represent an authentic proof of reality, there
is a gap in research about the public's vulnerabilities to visual misinformation
and how individuals make credible evaluations about image authenticity. Filling
the gap in research, this work conducts a series of empirical studies to find
out the social and cognitive heuristics online viewers use in image credibility
evaluation and how such evaluations influence their attitudes and behaviors. The
data from these studies will help predict the ways by which viewers are most
likely to accept evidence that online images have been manipulated and how they
subsequently revise their emotions and beliefs surrounding them. This work also
looks at potential ways cyber attackers could use social media to subvert social
order by spreading visual misinformation, and what strategies would be effective
in combating such behavior. Results from this work will inform the design of
software for forensic image analysis and will lay the grounds for new
technologies that help Internet users in continuously assessing the veracity of
the mediated visual hoaxes and scams they receive online.
