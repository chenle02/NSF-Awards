This work will provide a coherent data set consisting of bathymetry,
geophysics, petrology, and hydrothermal activity for a substantial length of the
Mid-Atlantic Ridge affected by the Azores hotspot. The overall aim to find the
links among the diverse types of data in order to contribute to maore
comprehensive models of ocean crust formation. Petrologic sampling of a
diversity of segment types will reveal the scale of petrological segmentation of
the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, the relationships between petrological variations and
segment type, and provide data to test geophysical models of the organization
and mechanism of melt segreation and supply to the crust. Also sufficient
sampling to define the fractionation trends for individual segments and to
investigate the relationship between major and trace element variations should
reveal far more about the nature of the Azores hotspot. Hydrothermal studies are
designed to inventory as completely as possible the amount of geothermal mass
and heat stored over this redge section, and to establish the number and
location of any hydrothermally active areas on this section of the ridge.
