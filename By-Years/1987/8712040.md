The physiological regulators of behavior are complex and change in an age-
dependent manner. It is well known that behaviors directed by specific areas of
the brain can be recovered following lesions in young animals. However, this
ability of the brain that allows for recovery of function is lost as the animal
matures. Little is understood regarding the biological mechanisms underlying
this ability to compensate for damages to the brain in the young animal.
However, it is known that these adaptations require compensational changes in
the neural mechanisms and neurochemical systems that regulate behavior. This
research is important because it will provide essential information about the
neurochemical bases of behavior and the dynamics of this regulatory system with
age. A wide variety of sensory-motor tests will be used to ascertain the
behavioral effects of specific lesions. The contributions of specific
neurochemical systems to the specific behaviors will be determined. Through an
approach that considers ontogenetic changes in response as well as the
neurochemical systems involved, an in depth understanding will be gained in the
neurochemical regulation of behavior.
