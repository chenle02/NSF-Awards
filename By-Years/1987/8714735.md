Lasers provide the chemist with the means of carrying out high resolution, high
sensitivity experiments using most of the infrared spectrum. If laser
instrumentation is combined into a laser central laboratory with a "lending
library" arrangement the research of a group of top-notch investigators can be
effectively enhanced. The Department of Chemistry at the University of Illinois
will use this award recommended by the Chemical Instrumentation Program to aid
in the acquisition of a series of lasers that will provide a continuous wave
(cw), high resolution laser resource in the near ultraviolet, visible and mid-
infrared spectral regions for a Shared Laser User Facility (SLUF). The
acquisition will also serve to upgrade the pulsed laser capabilities of the
Facility. The major areas of chemical research that will be enhanced include: 1)
Dynamics of chemical reactions in the condensed phase. 2) High-resolution
spectroscopy of mass-selected van der Waals and hydrogen-bonded complexes. 3)
Dynamics of intramolecular and intermolecular vibrational relaxation in gases
and liquids. 4) Photchemical kinetics of organic systems.
