The Physics Department at St. Lawrence University is offering modern physics
laboratory experiments in a physics course for non- science majors. The
course--"Light and Matter, Waves and Particles"--focuses on the wave-particle
duality. The equipment complements existing laboratory capabilities and allows
for experiments demonstrating microwave optics, the photoelectric effect, and
the wave and particle nature of the electron. In this way the department is
making it possible for liberal arts students to develop an understanding of some
of the fundamental questions raised by twentieth-century physics. The university
will match the award with an equal amount of funds.//
