This research is to establish the distributional properties of estimates and
pivotal quantities in semi-parametric regression models with counting data,
focusing on Poisson and binomial data in the setting of the generalized linear
model. Estimates will be considered semi-parametric in the sense of having a
parametric component and a component which is subject to some "smoothing"
constraint, usually in the setting of generalized splines. Necessary tools that
must be developed for this research and for transfering results from this
research to the applied statisician are efficient computational methods for
smooth general linear model problems in which the design points fall on a
regular, multidimensional grid. This research in statistical distribution theory
will provide useful analytical tools which translate directly into graphical
procedures for selecting probability models and diagnostic procedures for
assessing their adequacy. This research is directed toward situations where
simple parametric models of counting data are not warranted.
