&lt;br/&gt; Interconnect has always been the dominant component consuming area,
delay, and energy in Field-Programmable Gate Arrays and related spatial
computing devices. With interconnect requirements scaling faster than linearly
in device gate capacity and fundamental interconnect delays in VLSI scaling
slower than gate speeds, this problem is only exacerbated as we go forward.
Further, with the size of silicon systems we can build today, all kinds of
single-chip architectures (e.g. multiprocessor, system-on-a-chip, VLIW, Vector,
PIM) will be moving toward greater on-chip parallelism and hence greater use of
on-chip, programmable interconnect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nonetheless,
interconnect is probably the least understood component in programmable devices.
The fundamental goal of this research is to close gaps in our understanding of
interconnect structures and in our quantification of interconnect requirements
and synthesize this understanding into an engineering-grade approach to
programmable interconnect design. This effort will build upon results in VLSI
and Parallel theory, but goes beyond them to close asymptotic gaps, understand
how to optimize the constant factors, and characterize the properties and
behavior of typical designs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pedagogical goal is to
make the design space, issues, tradeoffs, and impact of spatial interconnect
design accessible to students and practitioners with an undergraduate computer
science background.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
