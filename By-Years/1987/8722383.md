In-depth interviews conducted with both employers and employees in four census
tracts with high female employment in Worcester, Massachusetts will elucidate
the processes by which employment opportunities for females become spatially
concentrated and segregated from male employment within metropolitan regions. A
control group of males and their employers will also be interviewed to identify
the importance of confounding variables such as income and education. This
research will integrate the perceptions and actions of employers and employees
with aggregate contextual information regarding the existence of gender
segregation by industry, occupation, and location. Professors Hanson and Pratt
have in previous work documented distinct clusters of female-dominated
industries and occupations within metropolitan areas. This project will build
upon and extend their earlier research by identifying the forces that generate
the gender segregation of employment in space and by developing an integrated
theoretical explanation of why gender segregation by industry, occupation, and
location occurs. It will also highlight the role of location in particular by
exploring the degree to which residence in particular places constrains the
choices women have among different kinds of jobs and careers. Professor Hanson
and Pratt's research will advance our understanding of metropolitan labor
markets and the locations of employment opportunities within metropolitan areas.
In addition to such basic theoretical advances, their work will yield results
that will be useful for policy makers and planners concerned with maximizing
labor force effectiveness and productivity.
