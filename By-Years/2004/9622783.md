9300402 Smith University of Alaska will operate the R/V ALPHA HELIX during 1996
as a general oceanographic research vessel in support of NSF-funded projects.
The R/V ALPHA HELIX is a 133' general research vessel owned by the National
Science foundation and constructed in 1966. The ship is scheduled for 174
operating days in 1996, of which 123 days are in support of NSF-sponsored
projects. The cruises will be primarily in the north Pacific Ocean but include
significant research cruise legs to the Aleutian, Bering, and Chukchi Sea
regions during minimum ice conditions in late summer. This vessel is part of a
fleet used by NSF and other research agencies to support oceanographic research.
Most oceanographic research requires specialized equipment that must be
permanently installed on the research vessel. Trained crew members are also
required to support the equipment systems and research operations. This is the
first year of a planned three year award. ***
