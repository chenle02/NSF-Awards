The investigators, their students and collaborators study mathematical
formulations and efficient computational techniques for applications arising in
image analysis, materials science, and atmospheric and climate modeling. This
multidisciplinary research combines areas of computational mathematics, inverse
problems, image analysis, interfaces and free boundaries, and atmospheric
sciences. They study image restoration using cartoon and texture decompositions,
restoration of images in the presence of a stochastic point spread function,
implicit open curve evolution and applications to free boundary problems in
materials sciences, and variational data fusion of atmospheric records acquired
by multiple instruments. The research team develops novel variational
approaches, iterative and numerical analysis techniques for solving these
inverse problems.

The proposed activity provides the link between efficient mathematical
formulations, imaging approaches, and applications in climate and materials
sciences, where similar approaches have not yet been attempted. In particular,
capability for merging data acquired by multiple sensors is a key part to our
understanding of the Earth's climate system, and therefore, is of importance
when making projections about climate change and climate impacts. Current
atmospheric data fusion methods are largely ad hoc and establishing a firm
mathematical foundation and computational methods for combining important
records enhances their scientific credibility and further a wide range of
scientific analyses. The investigators promote multidisciplinary teaching,
training and learning. Mathematics students are exposed to a broad range of
topics and techniques: (i) in applied and computational mathematics, image
processing and analysis; and (ii) topics outside mathematics, including
materials and atmospheric sciences.
