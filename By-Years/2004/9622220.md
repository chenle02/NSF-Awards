9622220 Rahn This research equipment grant supports the purchase of a
mechatronics workstation: a high performance computer work station for data
acquisition and control, with many of the sensors, actuators and drivers needed
for electro-mechanical interfacing of experimental manufacturing equipment. The
team of researchers will use this system for several new and ongoing projects
like: control of flexible gantry cranes, partial state feedback for rigid link
electrically driven manipulators, intelligent scanners for selective laser
sintering, Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) based control for rapid
prototyping, and improved ride-through for motor drives, and power systems
diagnostics. A major strength of this project is the investigators'
multidisciplinary cooperation that will be enhanced by this award. The impact of
this equipment grant will be enhancement of the experimental research component
of the proposed research projects, and it will support the broader control and
dynamics educational infrastructure at Clemson University.
