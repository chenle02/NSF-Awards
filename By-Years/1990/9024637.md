This research is centered in the areas of thermomechanics and the mechanics of
solids. It is especially concerned with nonlinear constitutive theory, and most
of the issues are related to the notion of materials stability. When certain
bodies are loaded, or heated, or placed in a chemical environment or electrical
field, they will experience transformations such as materials symmetry changes
and domain switching, local strain concentrations, buckling, bifurcation of
their equilibrium field structure, or catastrophic swelling or collapse. These
transformations often have pronounced effects and can be used to story energy
and toughen or weaken materials, they can cause anomalous behavior of
characteristic material moduli, permit polymeric gels to react as muscle fibers,
and aid in the storage of light images in ferroelectric crystals. This program
emphasizes the theoretical investigation of fundamental problems concerning
materials that exhibit such phenomenological behavior.
