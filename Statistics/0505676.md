The investigator studies statistical models in a variety of applied situations
which require innovative modifications of the standard technology. Document
classification builds models in extremely high-dimensional feature spaces, as do
models for inference and prediction with gene expression arrays. Species
occurrence and abundance models deal with large numbers of species, often
sharing many characteristics. In each of these settings, the different contexts
have led the researcher to develop special forms of regularization that allow
one to exploit the structure in the data.

In this advanced technological age, we are faced with analyzing extremely large
volumes of data. Two of the several examples this researcher deals with are gene
expression measurements (40 thousand measurements per human sample), and online
document classification (often the web is the source). Standard statistical
tools do not work well in these situations. This investigator studies innovative
adaptations of these tools designed to defeat the challenges these problems
pose.
