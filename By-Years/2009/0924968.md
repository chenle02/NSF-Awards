Much of human perception is driven by the visual appearance of the world. People
are captivated by the effects of natural lighting and shading patterns, such as
the soft shadows from the leaves of a tree in skylight, the glints of sunlight
in ocean waves, or the shiny reflections from a velvet cushion. In computer
graphics, it is important to be able to accurately reproduce these appearance
effects, to create realistic images for applications like video games, vehicle
and flight simulators, or architectural design of interior spaces. However, it
is still very difficult to accurately model complex illumination and reflection
effects in interactive applications like games, in image-based rendering
applications like e-commerce, or in computer vision applications like face
recognition. In the past, the above applications have been addressed separately,
by devising particular algorithms for specific problems. In this project, the
research focuses on the mathematical and computational fundamentals of visual
appearance, seeking to understand the intrinsic computational structure of
illumination, reflection and shadowing, and develop a unified approach to many
problems in graphics and vision.

The main thrust of the research will be to develop appropriate mathematical
representations for appearance, along with computational algorithms and signal-
processing techniques such as Clebsch-Gordan expansions, wavelet methods with
triple product expansions, and radial basis functions. A major advantage of this
approach is that the same representations, analysis and computation tools can
then be applied to many application domains, such as real-time and image-based
rendering, Monte Carlo sampling and lighting-insensitive recognition. This
research philosophy builds on the investigator's dissertation, where he
developed a signal-processing framework for reflection, leading to new frequency
domain algorithms for both forward and inverse rendering.
