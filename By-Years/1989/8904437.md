The physical mechanisms of climate change are not yet well understood. This
proposal requests support to analyze glacial- interglacial climate change using
a series of experiments with a series of energy balance models (EBM). The PI
will use a coupled climate-sea ice model (CCSI) to evaluate: 1) the influence of
ice transport and leads on polar and global climate and 2) the impact of
Milankovitch solar radiation variations on climate. The CCSI will then be
coupled with a continental ice sheet model to examine the processes involved in
ice sheet initiation and ice sheet response to Milankovitch solar radiation
variations. This research program will help to delineate the effects on climate
of changes in sea ice distribution and help to isolate the mechanisms of
continental ice sheet growth and decay.
