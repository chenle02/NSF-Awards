The Third Potsdam-Fifth Kiev Workshop, coorganized by Dr. David Kaup and
Athanassios Fokas of Clarkson University with V. Zakharov of the Landau
Institute of Theoretical Physics, Moscow, will provide an opportunity for US and
Soviet scientists to discuss Mathematical Aspects of Integrable Nonlinear
Equations, Inverse Problems in Physics, Nonlinear Optics, Turbulence, Plasmas
and Collapse, Ionospheric Plasmas, Atmospheres and Oceans. It will be held in
Potsdam, NY August 1-11, 1991. This meeting differs from previous meetings in
this series in its emphasis on applications. Most of the sections will be
devoted to the application of integrability, dynamical systems, and chaos to
physical systems. The intent is to bring together both scientists working in
theory as well as applications to further enhance the applicability of various
nonlinear models. This project fulfills the program objective of advancing
scientific knowledge by enabling leading researchers in the U.S. and U.S.S.R. to
combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual
interest and competence in the field of basic scientific research on the basis
of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.
