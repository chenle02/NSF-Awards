9317071 Cameron Subunit II of cytochrome c oxidase is a highly conserved protein
required for respiration in all eucaryotes and some procaryotes. The enzyme
complex is the terminal member of the electron transport chain responsible for
transferring electrons from cytochrome c to oxygen. Subunit II binds to
cytochrome c and accepts electrons via the CuA redox center. The protein has
several highly conserved features including two hydrophobic regions, a conserved
aromatic region, a number of negatively charged amino acids thought to interact
with lysines on cytochrome c and a copper binding site like those found in blue
copper proteins. To understand the function of this protein, yeast mutants
defective in subunit II have been generated. We have identified strains
defective in function due to alterations in the CuA binding region and due to
codon substitutions in the aromatic region. We are finishing our analysis of the
mutants and to extend our investigation to revertants of these strains that have
recovered function. We expect to find true revertants that restore that wild
type sequence; pseudo revertants where one amino acid is substituted for another
and strains carrying extra- genic suppressors. Among the latter group, we expect
to identify gene products, both nuclear and mitochondrial, that interact
directly with subunit II. This analysis will yield information concerning
functionally critical amino acids in the protein and possibly about interactions
between oxidase subunits. %%% This is a continuation of the genetic studies on
the yeast protein, subunit II of cytochrome c oxidase. This protein is a highly
conserved protein required for respiration in all higher organisms. This
research has the potential to broaden our understanding of respiration. In
addition, the project is providing college undergraduates with the opportunity
to understand the process of scientific research and to participate in it. ***
