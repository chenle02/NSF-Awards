This award supports the Workshop on Asymptotic Analysis, to be held from October
13 to October 15, 2023 on the campus of Indiana University-Purdue University in
Indianapolis. The workshop, the eighth in a series, convenes PhD students,
early-career researchers, and established mathematicians from Midwestern
universities working in various areas of analysis. An important goal of the
workshop is to introduce graduate students and other early-career researchers to
various subfields of analysis that may not be represented at their home
institutions and to promote the general dissemination of mathematical knowledge
and research activity among analysts. The award provides travel support for
graduate students and early-career researchers, non-local participants without
other sources of support, and some of the invited speakers.

Topics to be highlighted at the workshop include approximation theory, harmonic
analysis, integrable systems and orthogonal polynomials, and several complex
variables. The workshop is designed to bring together practitioners of these
diverse research areas with the goal of promoting cross-topic discussion. This
activity will result in further exchange of knowledge and the development of new
collaborations. The workshop also aims to contribute to the mathematical
professional development of early-career scholars across a range of fields
within the discipline of mathematical analysis.
