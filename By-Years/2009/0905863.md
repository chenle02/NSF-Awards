Changes in stratospheric ozone play a key role in Earth's climate system,
affecting not only the penetration of ultra-violet radiation to the surface, but
also tropospheric weather and climate. This project will involve a multi-model
analysis of stratospheric-resolving chemistry climate models (CCMs). These CCMs
will be used to examine how stratospheric ozone will evolve (recover) in the
21st century, the impact of climate change on this recovery, and the impact of
stratospheric ozone recovery on tropospheric climate and
weather.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These activities will provide a detailed,
quantitative evaluation of the capabilities and biases in the latest generation
of stratospheric-resolving CCMs, new multi-model projections of the evolution of
stratospheric ozone in the 21st century, including quantification of the impact
of climate change, and new multi-model projections of the impact of
stratospheric ozone recovery on tropospheric climate and weather during the 21st
century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will benefit society by improving our
understanding and projections of the Earth's ozone layer and climate system,
relevant to upcoming international assessments of ozone and of climate change.
Furthermore, a post-doctoral fellow and undergraduates will play major roles in
the research and will receive advanced training in atmospheric science and data
analysis techniques.
