Cornell University will initiate a six-week, residential Young Scholars project
in the Environmental Sciences for 15 students entering grade 12. The Cornell
Environmental Sciences Interns Program (CESIP) will include a one-week
orientation at Cornell's Arnot Forest, a five- week on-campus experience
focusing on research, careers, community outreach and science ethics, during
which time the student interns will spend three days each week conducting
research alongside Cornell scientists. Follow-up activities will be conducted in
schools and in 4-H and other clubs.
