9311601 Haynes Current federal legislation regulating the treatment of animals
in research incorporates a requirement that the physical environment in research
facilities be "adequate to promote the psychological well-being of nonhuman
primates." The purpose of this study is to identify and examine the different
and competing conceptions of welfare that various professional and lay groups
bring to the discussion of this requirement. The goal is to clarify the issues
about which the discussants disagree. This can help to provide a framework for
conflict resolution, especially in considering the role of expert knowledge in
regulating the humane use of laboratory animals. With assistance from a
primatology graduate student, the investigator will collect and analyse relevant
information indicating how different groups conceive of psychological well being
and of the enrichment plans intended to promote it. Besides examining written
materials, the investigator will attend a wide range of conferences and meetings
and visit a variety of agencies and organizations, including selected regional
primate centers, in order to gather information and interview representatives of
different professional and lay groups on the topic. The analysis of materials
and conversations will allow the investigator to develop a prelininary report to
summarize findings and to consider whether a more formal survey would be useful.
Telephone interviews will be conducted during the last several months of the
project, to pretest questions for a potential survey, to provide a basis for
revising and evaluating the preliminary report, and to develop dissemination
plans. Results from project will be disseminated in the form of a book and
articles, as presentations to interested groups, and in symposia. This project,
by generating insight into the ways professional and lay people think about the
psychological well being of primates, will provide assistance in improving
communication and resolvin g policy disputes. ***
