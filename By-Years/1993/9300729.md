An ultra fast scanning tunneling microscope will be constructed to image atomic
motions over small distances in ultrahigh vacuum. By optimizing the instrument
for imaging of small areas (less than 100 A across) atomic resolution imaging
will be achieved at ratesup to 10 msec per image for full images, or 100 usec
per scan line for narrow images. These rates are 10 to 1000 times faster than
currently available UHV instruments. The system will operate at sample
temperatures up to and above 600 C. This will permit the observation of
dynamical processes on material surfaces with much faster timescales than is
currently possible. Samples will also be characterized by LEED. In particular,
we will use this instrument to study atomic diffusion of Si adatoms during
annealing of the Si(100)-2x1 reconstructed surface as an investigation of the
fundamentals of molecular beam epitaxy. We will also study the motion of surface
atoms during melting of the Ge(111)-c(2x8) reconstructed surface.
