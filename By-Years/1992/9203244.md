Gonzaga University is establishing a connection to NSFNET via a 56,000 bits per
second line through the NorthWestNet mid-level network. The connection enables
the school's faculty and students to communicate and collaborate with the
national scientific and educational community, and to access network resources.
Areas of science to be addressed on the Internet by Gonzaga include physics,
computer science, engineering and mathematics. Gonzaga is also implementing a
Center for Information and Technology, which will serve as a resource accessible
over the Internet housing databases in scientific, economic, demographic and
technological fields. This award funds part of the costs for one year.
