In this CAREER award, supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program
of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Yung-Ya Lin at the University of California,
Los Angeles, will conduct research on improving sensitivity and contrast
enhancement in magnetic resonance by harnessing, controlling and amplifying spin
chaos. Prof. Lin will develop a virtual magnetic resonance (MR) facility that
will be used in education, and outreach to teach the fundamentals of MR research
to students and the general public, as well as providing a virtual laboratory
for MR scientists to explore new detection schemes.

The methods developed by Prof. Lin may prove useful in improving magnetic
resonance imaging for medical applications. Prof. Lin will mentor graduate
students, undergraduate students and post-doctoral fellows in this research. In
addition, the virtual MR facility will provide a tool for learning the basics of
MR by beginning students as well as a tool for exploration by seasoned
researchers.
