The Five College Astronomy Department will obtain 5 processing workstations for
use by undergraduate students. The workstations will be used: (1) to develop
laboratory exercises related to course work at the introductory and advanced
levels; and (2) to enhance the research opportunities available to
undergraduates in the department. Image processing was largely pioneered in
astronomy, and it is now applied to a wide range of scientific and technical
disciplines including geology, atmospheric science and medicine. Through the
introduction of this hardware into astronomy lab courses, astronomy majors will
be introduced to scientific analysis tools which have become as fundamental to
astronomical research as the telescope, and the quality of laboratory exercises
that they do will be substantially improved since they will involve processing
of digital data obtained at the world's most powerful telescopes using state of
the art instruments. For non-majors in our courses, the introduction of
astronomical image processing provides a means to teach this basic scientific
analysis tool in an exciting scientific context. Finally, the availability of
image processing facilities to undergraduates will substantially improve their
access to research opportunities within the department and improve the quality
of the independent study and senior honors programs.
