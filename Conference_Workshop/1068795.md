The meeting will facilitate interactions between students and faculty---with
interests in ring theory, broadly interpreted---from institutions in the
Southwest. It takes place at New Mexico State University in Las Cruces in the
first weekend of March 2011. Six speakers will deliver hour long talks on topics
within their specialty. Five speakers will be local to the Southwest region, and
one will be a prominent algebraist from outside the region. The lectures will be
accessible to graduate students. The meeting also features three hour-long
poster sessions in which the participating students will present their research.

The study of rings, in the broadest sense, is crucial to many branches of
mathematics---commutative and non-commutative geometry, group representations,
number theory, coding theory, and cryptography to name a few---and touches on
even more---combinatorics, homotopy theory, and statistics, for example.
Algebraists in the Southwest region pursue research on a variety of topics under
the umbrella of pure and applied ring theory. The geographical distances in the
region are such that interactions between people at different institutions
rarely happen spontaneously. The meeting will bring together students and
faculty from a variety of institutions for inspiring talks and ample time for
scientific interaction. One can expect that new collaborations and discoveries
may result from such a meeting. About 50 participants are expected: students,
young and senior faculty from New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas, and neighboring
states. Participation of students from underrepresented minority groups, women,
untenured faculty, and faculty at non-Ph.D. granting institutions is
particularly encouraged.
