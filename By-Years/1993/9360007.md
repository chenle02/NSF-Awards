9360007 Schmanski Thermoset polymer composites have been used as building
materials for many years and are successfully used in the construction of marine
vessels, aircraft, buildings, and space vehicles. Pultrusion is one well known
process that is used throughout industry to manufacture composites. Composites
can be reinforced with fiberglass, carbon, or other fibers to create high
strength, light weight, damage resistant materials. The predictable high
strength characteristics of the composites, allows thin sections and these are
used in combination with other materialls, such as insulation or sound blocking
medium, creating sandwich type building material. The material used with
composites is often manufactured thhru an extrusion process. This requires
expensive, labor intensive operations to create the final construction materials
from composites and extruded material. We propose to develop a manufacturing
process that will combine pultrusion and extrusion processes into one operation.
This will eliminate the expensive, labor intensive operatin required for
fabricating two materials into the combined building material. This research
will concentrate on creating an extrusion process that can simultaneously be
utilized as part of the pultrusion process. The extruded member will be integral
to the pultrusion die and will act as the mandrel as it is formed ahead ofthe
pultrusion die. The result will be a building materials that has dual materials
makeup without the expensive fabrication process. This project would result in a
sophisticated, highly effecient and economical building material that would have
multiple uses both indoors and in outside environments.
