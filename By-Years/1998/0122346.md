This award provides partial support for construction of two bunkhouse-style
dormitories, a small laboratory building, a dining/lecture hall and related
physical improvements at the Indio Mountains Research Station (IMRS). Funds are
also provided for a professional-grade weather station that will provide short
and long term climatic information. The IMRS occupies 38,000-acres in the
Chihuahua Desert of west Texas, adjacent to the U.S.- Mexican border. The
station, which consists of a former ranch house with three rooms and a small
storage building, is used by scientists, educators and students from the
University of Texas at El Paso, Southwest Texas State University, University of
New Mexico, Sul Ross State University, and El Paso Community College. Use of the
station is currently at the level of 700 person-days per year, reflecting both
research and educational uses. However, use is limited by the relatively
primitive accommodations and lack of laboratory facilities on site. The planned
improvements will allow the station to host researchers and provide education
activities that require participants to reside at the station for several days
at a time, and will improve the quality of work that can be done on site.
