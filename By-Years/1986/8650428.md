The interdisciplinary biotechnology programs at Manhattan College and at the
College of Mount Saint Vincent are being expanded and improved at both
institutions by the addition of a required fermentation laboratory component for
students majoring in chemical engineering and biology. This facility is housed
at Manhattan College. Six experiments are being developed in bacterial
fermentation, yeast production, continuous centrifugation, continuous cell
disruption, precipitation and chromatography. The recent acquisition of a
stirred-tank fermentor and an airlift fermentor is providing students with
experience in state-of- the-art equipment in biotechnology. The Biotechnology
Advisory Council, composed of members of the Biology, Chemistry and Chemical
Engineering Departments from both institutions plus corporate consultants,
assures that the goal of developing scientists and engineers with
interdisciplinary expertise in biology, microbial genetics, biochemistry,
biochemical engineering and computer science will be realized at both
institutions.
