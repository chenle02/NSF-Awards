The objective of this project is to establish a conduit which can translate and
consolidate research results into a usable design tool for implementing the
latest aseismic design methodologies for bridges into practice. For bridge
structures located in seismic-prone areas, modern ductility or capacity design
procedures require ultimate limit states under earthquake loading be identified
and properly considered. To evaluate the earthquake ductility demand, effect of
nonlinear foundation response, and other nonlinear effects in the bridge
superstructure discontinuities, nonlinear transient analysis procedure are
developed. The post-elastic interaction of axial force and biaxial bending of
substructure columns are represented by a proper yield surface, e.g. Bresler's
interaction criteria. Attention is also directed to recently developed energy
absorbing devices so that their performance can be evaluated analytically to
assist engineers in their decisions on new designs or retrofitting strategies.
This research fills a gap between the advancement in Earthquake Engineering and
Computational Structural Dynamics and the practical needs of bridge engineers
and designers. This is the second and final phase of a continuing project.
