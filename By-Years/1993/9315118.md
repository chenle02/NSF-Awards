9315118 Ebtisam S. Wilkins The purpose of this project is to develop an
implantable glucose sensor for continuous in vivo monitoring of glucose
concentration in blood or in other body fluids, and without the need for
withdrawal of body fluids. This should lead both to a marked improvement in the
clinical management and scientific understanding of diabetes. The broad
objective of this project is to test in animals an implantable glucose sensor
capable of continuously monitoring blood glucose levels. Specific aims of the
research include the determination of sensor lifetime in vivo, the sensor
response time, the characterization of the sensor behavior, and the
biocompatibility of the sensor and attendant telemetry system in the body fluid
environment. Finally, the sensor would be miniaturized and modified as indicated
for a final design to be used in human trials. ***
