Professor Bhuiyan is supported by a grant from The Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program to develop improved theories for understanding the structure
and thermodynamics of polyelectrolyte and colloidal solutions. Such theories are
important in understanding the properties of macromolecular systems including
the interpretation of experimental data on DNA structures. Professor Bhuiyan
will apply the methods of statistical mechanics of electric double layers, in
particular the Modified Poisson-Boltzmann (MPB) theory, to a study of the
structural and thermodynamic properties of cylindrical polyelectrolyte and
spherical colloidal solutions with the following objectives: 1) to extend the
recently derived MPB theory for cylindrical polyelectrolytes to ionic cloud
distributions surrounding a spherical colloidal particle; 2) to study cell
models for the cylindrical polyelectrolyte and spherical colloidal solutions
with and without added salt; 3) to compare the results of the MPB theory with
classical Poisson-Boltzmann theory, liquid structure integral equation
calculations and computer simulations; and 4) to consider further development of
the MPB approach to these systems in light of the results obtained.
