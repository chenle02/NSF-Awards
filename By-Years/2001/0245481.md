Abstract Moscovici

This project will continue the program initiated several years ago by the
principal investigator in collaboration with Alain Connes, providing a general
setting for the understanding of transverse geometry. A main new objective
consists in the application of this program to the context of modular forms and
modular correspondences, in order to uncover the hidden compatibility between
the pointwise product of modular forms and the action of the Hecke operators.
Another major goal of the proposed research is the elaboration of a K-theoretic
interpretation for the Godbillon-Vey class and for other secondary invariants,
by means of a refinement of the operator-theoretic local index formula that lies
at the core of the program. The proposed work will contribute to the development
of new mathematical tools for the treatment of a multitude of non-classical
spaces, which have a discernible geometric meaning but cannot be adequately
described by means of commuting coordinates. Such spaces, arising in many areas
of mathematics and physics, have in common the feature that their observable
local parameters behave like infinite-dimensional matrices rather than numerical
variables. To deal with them efficiently much stretching and rethinking of the
known geometric techniques is required, process that has led to the development
of noncomutative geometry. A distinctive feature of the present project is the
systematic utilization of non-classical symmetry principles.
