The research questions for this proposal are designed to explore the
interactions of teaching practices, curriculum materials, and professional
development to understand how they can be optimized to improve student learning.
The University of Delaware and Texas A&M University, working in partnership with
Project 2061 of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, will
study how to provide, on a large scale, the professional development and
continuing support teachers need to improve student learning of key ideas and
skills in middle-grades mathematics. Over five years of a longitudinal study,
the research team will examine how the use of specific research-based
instructional strategies in the classroom-supported by professional development
and highly-rated curriculum materials-relate to lasting improvements in student
learning. An experimental study in years 4 and 5 will test the feasibility of
delivering professional development and ongoing support cost-effectively on a
large scale.
