Guo, P. MCB 9723923 Technical A virus-encoded RNA (pRNA) is required for the
packaging of phage phi29 dsDNA into a preformed procapsid during maturation.
Packing of DNA also requires the DNA packaging protein gp16, ATP and Mg++. A
highly sensitive in vitro assembly system has been established to study phi29
DNA package. With the aid of pRNA and cloned gene products, DNA can be packaged
in vitro with up to 90% efficiency and up to 108 plaque forming units per ml of
infectious virions can be assembled without background. In the presence of MG++,
6 pRNAs bind to the protal vertex of procapsids (the site of DNA entry) and are
released after DNA packaging is completed. It is known that the pRNA has two
functional domains, one for procapsid binding and one for an unknown but
essential role. The requirement of the pRNA for ATPase activity of the DNA
packing protein suggests a role for the pRNA in the energetics of package. The
hypothesis being tested is that the pRNA, acting as part of a DNA packing
ATPase, undergoes a series of conformational changes during DNA packaging. The
conformation of the pRNA in the presence of ATP is investigated by chemical and
nuclease probing and crosslinking. Non technical The study of pRNA
conformational changes as it relates to phage phi29 DNA packaging is to provide
basic information regarding viral assembly, RNA structure, bioenergetics, and
molecular motion. As the involvement of the phi29 pRNA in DNA translocation is
unique among known RNA functions, investigation of the structure and function of
this molecule has broad significance to the mechanisms of RNA/ATP, RNA/Mg++,
RNA/protein, RNA/DNA, and RNA/RBNA interactions. Additionally, the study of the
phi29 DNA translocation process may have relevance to other DNA translocation
enzymes, such as helicase, as both processes can utilize ring-shaped structures
with six-fold symmetry.
