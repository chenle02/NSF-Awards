This award supports US-participation in the First International Antarctic
Climate Evolution Symposium that will be held in Granada, Spain, 7?]11 September
2009. The SCAR (Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research) Scientific Research
Programme on Antarctic Climate Evolution (ACE) is a well-known international
program established for the worldwide coordination of the paleo climate
research. Recent results and opportunities for future cooperation are
highlighted, which is timely for Antarctic projects upon completion of the
International Polar Year 2007-2009. In terms of broader impacts, this workshop
promotes international collaboration, broadens the perspective of U.S.
scientists, and provides an opportunity for the next generation of scientists to
interact with leaders in the field. This award also provides support for
applicants from underrepresented groups, as well as early career scientists and
students. Outcomes have societal relevance in understanding global climate
change.
