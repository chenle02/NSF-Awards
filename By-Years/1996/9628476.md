*** 9628476 This Small Business Innovative Research Phase II Project focuses on
developing technology for the selective breeding of marine shrimp. At present
there are more than 2.8 million acres of shrimp farms in production. Shrimp
farmed are principally non-selected wild stocks or are produced from unselected
farm reared broodstock. Virtually no work has been done to selectively breed
shrimp for improved performance in farming environments. If shrimp can be bred
for enhanced survival, faster growth, or improved feed conversion, the
profitability of farming will be improve. Penaeus vannamei, the principal
species raised in the Westem Hemisphere, has been selected for the program. The
Phase I research objectives were to obtain and identify stocks that could be
used in the breeding program. Work completed in the Phase I research identified
16 unique base sequences in one gene that can be used as markers to
unambiguously identify the stocks for the breeding program. The overall
objective of the Phase II research is to: Establish populations that are
homozygous for alleles that can be used to conclusively identify family lines
for the purpose of genetic selection and production of stocks for sale. The
activities include: Developing nucleotide probes that can be used to screen
individual shrimp for the base sequences that identify a particular allele;
Identifying individual shrimp that carry each of the unique base sequences;
Raising individual shrimp to sexual maturity; Breeding to establish populations
that are homozygous for the identified sequences and; Conducting comparative
evaluations of performance in production environments. ***
