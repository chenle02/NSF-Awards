Professor R. Stephen Berry is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to organize an International Conference on Small
Particles and Clusters. This is the 6th conference in this series which is held
every two years, and this is the first such conference to be held outside of
Europe. The conference will be held at University of Chicago from September 16
through 23, 1992. The award will be used to provide participant support for
attendees. %%% The subject of inorganic clusters is central to the field of
materials design and preparation, and is one of the areas specifically targeted
in the President's Science Advisor's special initiatives for 1992. The study of
clusters provides new kinds of insights into the transition from molecular to
bulk matter.
