Lateral mobility of membrane proteins and their differentiation into
functionally distinct subdomains is very poorly understood. This project focuses
on the assembly, functional organization, and dynamics of the translocon complex
(TC) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and how these features contribute to the
function, morphological appearance of the organelle, and differentiation into
rough and smooth ER domains. The TC consists of Sec61p, the translocation
channel itself, and associated integral and peripheral membrane proteins that
function in translocation or co-translational modifications of proteins made on
membrane-bound polysomes. The hypothesis to be tested is that TCs form higher
order structures that define the rough domain of the ER. These structures may be
stabilized by mRNAs that interconnect TCs forming membrane bound polysomes,
cytoskeletal elements, and/or hypothetical proteins that form links between the
TCs. Proposed experiments will determine whether the restrained lateral mobility
of GFP-tagged TCs is caused by interactions of cytoskeletal elements with the
TCs and/or with membrane-bound ribosomes. The effects of ER membrane proteins
p180 and CLIMP-63 on the lateral mobility of the TCs will be assessed. The PI
will also investigate whether changes in the morphology of the rough ER are
associated with changes in the lateral mobility of the TCs and with the
expression of specific linker proteins. Additional experiments will determine
whether the reorganization of the rough ER is accompanied by changes in the
expression level of rough ER proteins and whether the respective RNAi molecules
can suppress this rough ER reorganization.
