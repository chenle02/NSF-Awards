0454283&lt;br/&gt;Park&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Imaging the Deep Roots of the San
Andreas Fault&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Forces driving earthquakes are global ones
resulting from plate motion, but we do not always know how they couple to the
faults at the surface. The SAFOD project is designed to examine in great detail
the processes that generate earthquakes, but on a very small scale. In order for
the results from SAFOD to be applicable to other areas, we also need to know the
connection between the local earthquake processes and global plate motions. This
project will use the magnetotelluric method to sense the more regional structure
by monitoring natural electromagnetic fields. The method has the advantage of
being able to examine structure at all levels of the crust, allowing us to
examine how the fault motion at the surface is linked to plate motion at depth.
This project has international collaborators from Germany.&lt;br/&gt;
