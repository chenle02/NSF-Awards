This is the first year of a three year continuing award. It provides funds to
support the collaboration of researchers from several U.S. institutions with
their counterparts in Europe who are funded by the European ESPRIT program for a
project on Geometry- Driven Diffusion in Vision. The U.S. research groups are
led by Pietro Perona (CalTech), Jitendra Malik (University of California at
Berkeley), David Mumford (Harvard University), Stephen Pizer and Ross Whitaker
(University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill), and Sanjoy Mitter (MIT). A number
of European investigators are to be involved, from Utrecht University in the
Netherlands, Katholieke Universiteit Lueven in Belgium, University of Las Palmas
in Spain, University of Paris IX Dauphine in France, the Royal Institute of
Technology (KTH) and Linkoping University in Sweden, and the Swiss Federal
Institute of Technology. Some important research resultsbased on nonlinear
diffusion processes have arisen for early vision tasks. This consortium is
investigating the theory of this approach to image processing, some testbed
implementations, possible applications such as medical image enhancement, and
possible insights into the natural parallelism, cooperative/competitive
mechanisms, and neural feedback mechanisms between layers in the brain.
