Science advances through coordinated developments in theory, experimentation,
and observation. In the field of ecology, theoretical advances have repeatedly
guided experiments and observation, resulting in a mature, predictive
discipline. Theory has provided the basis for management of invasive species and
pests, guided conservation efforts, improved fisheries management, and
contributed to the effective management of human, livestock and wildlife
diseases. New challenges posed by unprecedented rates of environmental change,
the dominant effects of human activity on climate and the environment, and the
massive amounts of data now available highlight the need for new ecological
theory that is invigorated by novel approaches, new collaborations, and the
integration across relevant sub-disciplines. This workshop engages researchers
at diverse career stages, with different theoretical backgrounds and skills, and
from different geographical and cultural backgrounds. New theoretical directions
and collaborations developed during the workshop will guide future research. New
theoretical paths will provide the foundation for training future generations of
ecologists and our workforce, ensuring they have the requisite skills to tackle
emerging problems. Theory directly and indirectly resulting from the workshop
will accelerate the advancement of a discipline that lies at the heart of global
problems such as food security, public health, environmental change, and
resource limitation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Workshop activities and discussions
will identify key areas in ecology that need reinvigorated theory; establish the
approaches needed to advance these theories; identify emergent areas in need of
new theory; and develop an agenda for advancing ecological theory. Initial
workshop discussions tackle topics including theory that spans levels of
ecological organization; theory of uncertainty, ecological variation, and the
limits of prediction; and the role of transients and non-stationarity.
Discussions in large and small groups will debate and determine the theoretical
approaches needed to advance these and other critical contemporary ecological
questions. Groups will determine when entirely new theory is needed and when
hybridization of existing approaches may address a challenge. Simultaneously,
entirely new areas in need of theory will emerge from group discussions. These
may include disciplines that share common challenges, forging new or
strengthening existing collaborations. Results will appear as publications in
leading journals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
