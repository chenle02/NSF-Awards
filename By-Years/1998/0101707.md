LaGuardia Community College is establishing the Institute for New Media and
Applied Technologies in collaboration with new media industries, colleges, high
schools, and community leaders. The goals are to bring IT education and skills
training to the unique and underserved multi-ethnic residents and business
population of Brooklyn and Queens. The project creates a comprehensive,
interdisciplinary curriculum that emphasizes experimental learning and industry
internships for students and faculty and leads to an A.A.S. degree in New Media.
A total of 200 students will be enrolled and no less than 15 faculty members
will be trained and participate in externships. The project will also establish
skill standards, based on those developed by ACM and the Northwest Center for
Emerging Technologies. The project will collaborate with the New York New Media
Association, Consolidated Edison of New York, Queens County Overall Economic
Development Corporation, and other area businesses and community organizations
to form an advisory board and set benchmarks. The Northwest Center for Emerging
Technologies also serves as the project evaluator.&lt;br/&gt;
