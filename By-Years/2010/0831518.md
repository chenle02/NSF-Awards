The focus of this project is on providing a molecular level understanding of
photochemical reactions occurring inside secondary organic aerosol (SOA)
particles. SOA contributes to both direct and indirect radiative forcing of
climate, and affects air quality in the urban and remote atmosphere. The primary
goal of this research is to understand the photochemical processing of SOA
derived from the oxidation of isoprene and selected monoterpenes by ozone or the
nitrate radical (NO3). To achieve this goal, model SOA will be prepared and the
absorption spectra and photodissociation spectra of the resulting SOA material
will be investigated using the method of aerosol photodissociation spectroscopy.
In parallel, the composition of model terpene SOA will be analyzed in detail
using ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry before and after the SOA is exposed
to simulated solar radiation. In addition, absolute quantum yields for
photolysis of several model carbonyls embedded in SOA-like materials will be
measured. This information will be used to estimate rates of photochemical
reactions occurring inside atmospheric SOA particles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
interaction between solar radiation and organic materials is directly relevant
to several areas of research, including the photodegradation of organic polymers
and coatings, photochemistry of soil organics and dissolved organic matter,
organic photochemistry, and water purification. This research will also provide
information useful for predicting the health effects of aged organic particulate
matter. Two graduate students will be supported through this award.
