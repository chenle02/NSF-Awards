In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor Matthew Sigman of the Department of Chemistry at the
University of Utah will explore the development of techniques to more
efficiently optimize diverse enantioselective reactions. Classically, catalyst
optimization has remained mainly empirical, wherein evaluation of a significant
number of ligands, often structurally unrelated, is required to develop a mature
chiral catalyst. To overcome this impediment, Professor Sigman will use modular
ligands, which permit the introduction of systematic changes to the ligand
structure, in combination with physical organic mechanistic tools (i.e., Hammett
electronic parameters and Charton/Taft steric parameters) and design of
experimental statistical approaches to facilitate catalyst design and
optimization. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This work could lead to both new
enantioselective catalysts for challenging, synthetically useful transformations
and the development of new approaches for mechanistic analysis and catalyst
optimization. Success in each of these areas will have an impact on any area of
activity in which the synthesis of molecules and catalyst optimization is
needed, such as the pharmaceutical, chemical, agricultural industries and their
biological and chemical research activities. In addition, this project will
provide training of students, from pre-undergraduate to post-doctoral, including
those from groups historically underrepresented in the sciences.
