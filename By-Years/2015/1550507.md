This project focuses on techniques for survey analysis that can inform decision
making -- potentially in a broad range of
areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;D-Ready will use contemporary machine
learning techniques to process and filter the data the team will collate
regarding such areas as choice preferences. The proposed technology will be
deployed with two goals in mind. A survey design methodology will be used to
help ensure that decision-selection guidelines are unbiased for individual user.
This is important because the more unbiased the decision support product, the
more widely it will be trusted and used. The team will also use cursor-tracking
technology to develop an in-depth statistical picture of how individual users
view decision-support site-apps. This will allow for the team to use nonlinear
regression and classification methods to segment users into distinct types. The
insights learned from these analyses will be valuable to support decision makers
in a broad range of applications. Applying the customer discovery process during
the I-Corps curriculum, the team intends to come up with a more complete value
proposition that it will provide and refine the product features that will be
most useful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;D-Ready is envisioned as an online
and mobile decision support guide that creates customized information for users
that is simple, convenient and unbiased. The proposed technology has potentially
broad applications in several areas including marketing, for example, where a
three-step strategy of 1) defining an attraction for a certain population, 2)
harvesting detailed interactive behavior data while users react to that
attraction, and finally 3) analyzing that data for the purpose of market
segmentation, represents a powerful new form of survey collection.
