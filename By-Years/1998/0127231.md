Computer Engineering (32)&lt;br/&gt;Traditional undergraduate instruction in
process control focuses on abstract analysis and often does not prepare students
for the industrially important task of synthesizing process control strategies
and designs. The key goal of our project has been to bridge this chasm between
academics and industry by developing and incorporating into the curriculum
inexpensive and flexible process control lab kits that will allow students to
design, implement and test their own control systems. The students will have the
important tasks of determining the placement of sensors and control elements,
and the nature of the control strategy. With our kits, students conduct several
flow, level and temperature experiments, which illustrate concepts from simple
draining tank dynamics through the implementation of advanced multi-loop control
systems. In this project, the needed components, a software control system, and
student instructions have been developed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because our kits
are inherently safe and require only electrical power and water to run, they can
be used for laboratories, classroom demos and exercises, independent activities,
distance learning and for educational outreach to high school students. In the
future, kits could be adapted to provide experiments for a range of engineering
courses including Introduction to Engineering, Material and Energy Balances,
Unit Operations and Reactor Design. Evaluation of the kits and materials
developed have been conducted at Lafayette College. Rowan University and
Manhattan College have completed additional testing.&lt;br/&gt;
