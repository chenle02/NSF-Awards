The wind-tunnel laboratories used in this institution's aerospace engineering
program are updated and improved, exposing students to modern computer-aided
wind-tunnel technology. A mini- computer, with graphic capabilities, is
interfaced to the wind- tunnels so that students can carry on experiments using
real-time data acquisition and analysis. This modernization of equipment and
analytic techniques exposes students to laboratory computer technology, enhances
the study of experimental/analytical fluid dynamics and better prepares students
for the aerospace industry and graduate study. This award is being matched by an
equal sum from the grantee.
