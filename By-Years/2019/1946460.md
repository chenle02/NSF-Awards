A fundamental algorithmic/software issue in 3D printing, visualization, and
geometric computing is incompatible file-exchange formats. For instance, 3D
printing data is usually stored in a format called STL, but there are numerous
geometric tools which use other (incompatible) formats (some well-known
extensions being: STH, RPI, and STEP, to name just a few). This project will
pursue a novel direction to improve compatibility and efficiency in geometric
computing: restructuring files, in their native format, without translating them
into a new format. This will enable faster checking of 3D models and processing.
A key novelty is that this work will use existing file formats rather than
create a new one. Potential impact include faster modeling of complex geometric
data and real-time remote collaboration on complex designs, such as mechanical
parts or architectural data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The restructuring and
preservation of native file formats is technically quite involved, and leads to
several interesting research directions: (1) How much additional geometric
information can be ``hidden'' in a file simply by reordering the data? (2) What
is the most useful geometric information that should be ``hidden'', (3) What is
the most effective way to pack information for an application while still
preserving the file format? A key example to keep in mind is how STL redundantly
stores vertices of facets, and that this enables one to introduce a new ordering
of the redundant data without disrupting the underlying file format. Answering
these questions can also help support streaming of geometric
data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
