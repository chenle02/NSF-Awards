In collaboration with botanists of the Philippines National Museum, Drs. Sy
Sohmer and Benjamin Stone of Hawaii's Bishop Museum are initiating an intensive
plant collecting program throughout the Philippines, as phase one of a
comprehensive inventory of the estimated 10,000-12,000 species of ferns,
conifers, and flowering plants of that tropical island nation. The plant
collections of the National Herbarium, virtually destroyed at the end of World
War II, will be augmented significantly, and U.S. and European botanists will
aid in the identification and study of the thousands of new specimens.
Scientists from the University of the Philippines are also participating in this
biodiversity inventory. As specimens begin to accumulate from field teams
throughout the country, staff at the Philippines National Museum will enter
information into computer databases modeled upon similar ones implemented at the
Bishop Museum. Initial priority for field collecting is being given to forested
regions under consideration for protection or otherwise of interest to
conservation agencies. The inventory will also be of use to resource managers
and others who must have up-to-date knowledge of species identity, geographical
distribution, local uses and names, and ecological condition--common, rare, or
extinct--for the plants of the Philippines. A published identification guide to
the plants is one of the long-term goals of the collaboration.
