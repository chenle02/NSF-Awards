In this project, the PI will collect and analyze nutrient data on a hydrographic
line along 165|W in the Pacific, from 57|N to about 21|S. This line is a
component of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE), and is designated as
WOCE line, P13. Measurements of the nutrients, silica, nitrate, nitrite, and
phosphate will complement hydrographic and other tracer measurements made by
PI's from other institutions.
