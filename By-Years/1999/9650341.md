The Department of Chemistry is developing a project based on its acquisition of
a single crystal x-ray diffractometer. Single crystal diffractometry has become
the standard method for the characterization of crystalline materials and should
be taught in the undergraduate curriculum. Recent improvements in
instrumentation, including speed of data collection and significant reductions
in price, make this feasible. In addition to the benefits of training in modern
instrumental methods, there is a decided benefit to chemistry students through
the enhancement of spatial reasoning skills from continued exposure to three-
dimensional problems and three-dimensional images that can be manipulated by
computer. The department plans to introduce the instrument in a limited fashion
in the freshman year and, with increasing sophistication, each subsequent year,
culminating with a project in which students mount a crystal, collect data,
assign a space group, and determine the structure during the senior year.
