This research project in the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is
designed to provide deeper understanding of the relationship of molecular
structure to reactivity in organic compounds. The molecular concept of host
systems for general organic guest compounds, based on hydrophobic binding of the
guest in aqueous solution, is deficient in several respects. This project is
will investigate certain molecular architecture principals for designing hosts
that are guest-sticky in hydrophobic solvents. Particular areas of interests
are: (1) concave functionality and the importance of preorganization; (2) the
relationship between guest rigidity and reaction rate; (3) intracavity
chemistry; and (4) Computer assisted molecular architecture.
