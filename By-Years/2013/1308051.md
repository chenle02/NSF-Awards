Predicting Single Cell Mechanical Behavior: Integrated Insight of Mechanical
Theory and Microfluidic Device Experiments

The mechanics of single cells, or how cells deform and respond to forces from
the surrounding environment, is important both for understanding fundamental
cellular biology and diagnosing and treating diseases. For example, red blood
cells are less deformable and stiffer when infected by malaria. Vesicles,
simpler enclosures made of lipid (fatty) molecule bilayers, can be used as
simple models of living cells. Vesicles also have their own biologically
inspired applications in green energy technology, biosensor technology, and
targeted drug delivery. This project brings together the integrated insight of
novel microfluidic devices and rigorous mechanical theory from engineering to
investigate single vesicle and cell mechanical behavior. By observing cell
deformation under well-controlled flow conditions and simultaneously shaping a
theory to explain the observations, a predictive cell mechanics simulation tool
will be developed. This project will improve understanding of (1) the response
of synthetic vesicles and natural cells to a range of external flows from pure
rotational to pure extensional flows, (2) the impact of membrane molecular
structure on vesicle and cell mechanics and how theory can capture this effect,
and (3) the adaptation of this microfluidic device and accompanying theory to a
high-throughput method for studying single cell mechanics in biological
research.

Broader impacts of this research include advancing understanding in fundamental
cell mechanics while also promoting teaching and learning through the training
and mentorship of undergraduate researchers and participation in K-12 outreach
programs. The fellow will gain experience and training in cellular biology to
complement a mechanical engineering background, spurring on a multi-disciplinary
research career.
