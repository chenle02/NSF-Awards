The addition of steel fibers to reinforced concrete beams has been determined to
significantly enhance the mechanical properties of the member. However, little
research has been reported concerning the effect of steel fibers on the
vibrational characteristics of regular reinforced and prestressed concrete
flexural members. The objective of this research program is to experimentally
determine the influence of adding steel fibers to regular reinforced and
prestressed concrete beams on the vibrational properties (frequency and damping)
of these structural members. The change in dynamic response as a function of
fiber type, volumetric fiber content, regular and prestressing reinforcement
ratios and concrete strength will be the parameters of study. The dynamic
properties of the flexural test specimens will be assessed from the results of
free vibration and forced vibration tests. All specimens will be tested in both
simply supported and cantilever beam configurations. The results obtained from
this research project will begin to determine if the addition of steel fibers to
regular reinforced and prestressed concrete members will result in a significant
increase in structural damping.
