When a liquid drop is subjected to an external force, it typically undergoes
oscillations in its shape with a frequency that depends on the material
properties of the drop. In some naturally occurring and technological processes
of interest, drops contain inclusions in their interior. These inclusions, which
could be small bubbles or solid particles, can affect the characteristic
oscillations of the drop. The goal of this EAGER proposal is to show that by
measuring the frequency of drop oscillations, the size, number and locations of
such inclusions can be determined. The project will use a combination of theory,
numerical computations and experiments to demonstrate the feasibility of this
idea, which is called “interfacial spectroscopy.” The results could be useful as
a quality control tool in a variety of processing operations involving such
materials as inks, paints, and other suspensions or to detect impurities and
contaminants in multiphase systems. The project will involve high-school
students and undergraduates in the design and implementation of experiments to
validate the approach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Natural pulsations of multiphase
systems like particle-laden drops exhibit surface waves with intriguing
frequency and decay features. Recent studies have shown that slightly deviating
frequencies for a few modes form bands akin to fine-structure split in atomic
energy levels. It can be shown that such frequency and decay spectra are unique
for each internal structure of the multiphase multispecies domains. This
suggests the possibility of finding what is inside a complicated opaque liquid
from experimentally measured interfacial wave spectra data. This EAGER project
will establish the viability and accuracy of this diagnostic technique. The
project will concentrate on four specific matters considering particle-laden
drops to be the representative of complex systems. First, simulations will
demonstrate how frequencies and decay constants of interfacial waves vary with
size, number and position of the particles inside a droplet. Secondly, an
inversion algorithm will be devised to extract the particulate details from
spectral information. Then, the diagnostic procedure will be applied in real
experiments to test the capability and the limit of the technology. Fourthly,
the uniqueness theorem for inversion will be generalized to see whether more
complex structures can be revealed using the approach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
