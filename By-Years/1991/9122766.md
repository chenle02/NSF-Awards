The oceanographic instrumentation program supports requests to acquire
instrumentation for the collection, processing and analysis of oceanographic
data. This proposal from the SJS/Moss Landing Marine Laboratory requests funding
for equipment that will be used to support NSF-funded research cruises aboard
the R/V POINT SUR, a 135 foot vessel that is owned by NSF and operated by the
University.
