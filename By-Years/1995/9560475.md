95604752 Field This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
will develop a low cost technique to provide highly reproducible wavelength
stabilization of diode lasers. Frequency stabilized diode lasers are required
for applications including wavelength-division-multiplexed (WDM) communications
networks, process control, medical instrumentation, and data storage. At present
these needs can only be met using expensive distributed feedback and distributed
Bragg reflection diode lasers. This Phase I will provide an integrated optic
reflection grating structure which can be used to stabilize and lock the output
wavelength of inexpensive Fabry-Perot diode lasers, significantly reducing the
cost of single frequency stabilized sources. The same grating fabrication
process can be applied to stabilize the entire range of diode laser output
wavelengths. The project will build and measure the performance of an integrated
grating feedback device which may then be integrated into a prototype laser
device in Phase II. The product is expected to be a frequency stabilized diode
laser which operates at a pre-set optical frequency and which will be
commercially applied in WDM communications networks, process control, medical
instrumentation, and data storage. This technology has a sufficiently low cost
that it may also stimulate applications beyond these markets.
