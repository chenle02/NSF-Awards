9315098 Ulrich Synoptic observations of the surface of the sun using the Mt.
Wilson solar tower will be continued. One series of observations consists of a
daily drawing of the solar surface since 1920 while a second provides a daily
magnetogram since 1967. Beginning in 1986 several dopplergrams have been
obtained each day. As time permits, other observations for particular purposes
are made. The data from this program support various solar studies including the
NSF Global Oscillation Network Group project and the NASA Solar Maximum Mission.
