0966644&lt;br/&gt;Lenhoff&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This NSF award by the Chemical
and Biological Separations program supports work to characterize the principal
impurities to be removed in the purification of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)
produced in cell culture by Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, which are used
ubiquitously in industrial practice. We will identify the impurity proteins that
persist in the product stream, with the main source being proteins produced by
the cells that make the mAbs, hence the name host cell protein (HCP). An
additional class of impurities to be characterized are product-associated
impurities, i.e., proteins that bind to the mAb product and are therefore
difficult to remove from the process stream during the purification steps. These
analyses to identify the principal impurities to be removed in a given mAb
process and can serve as the basis for optimizing the strategies for separating
them from the mAb product. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Complementary to characterizing
these two classes of impurities is characterization of their behavior in the
important class of separations involving liquid chromatography. Knowledge of the
chromatographic behavior of the different proteins, both mAb product and
impurity, under different conditions will allow identification of the conditions
most suitable for removing the impurities from the product stream.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results will be applied to representative efforts to
optimize particular mAb separations. Capabilities such as those to be developed
in this project can be instrumental in streamlining industrial process
development methods for the large and growing class of mAb therapeutics. The
research will also serve as an effective vehicle for student education and
research training, via the students who will perform most of the research.
