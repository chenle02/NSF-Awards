This award supports the establishment of the Summer Institute in Museum
Anthropology at the Smithsonian Institution to provide an intensive four-week
program to train anthropology graduate students to use museum objects in their
research. Students will learn to analyze museum collections in light of
anthropology's current research agendas, using a range of qualitative and
quantitative methods and approaches developed over the past twenty-five years.
The training will take advantage of the Smithsonian Institution's vast
anthropology collections and related resources, allowing students a hands-on
experience working with museum specimens on individual projects. The Institute
will focus on experiential learning, combining elements of a field school with
classroom/laboratory training.

Anthropology collections at the Smithsonian and other museums represent an
enormous national legacy, assembled over generations to document world cultures
and serve anthropological research. However, many potential researchers are not
effectively utilizing museum collections because they do not know how to
approach or evaluate this type of data, which presents distinct challenges.

The Institute will train 36 graduate students over the three year course of the
grant, leading to better research design and methodology in research on museum
collections and an increase in theses and publications effectively utilizing
museum objects. Through development and sharing of curriculum materials, it will
serve as a model to encourage wider teaching of museum anthropology research
methods and development of similar programs at university museums. The broader
goal of the program is to use museums more effectively as sites for the
production of knowledge. Increased productive use of collections will allow
anthropology to capitalize on the investment made by former generations, as well
as engage in research of interest and value to the communities where this
material originated.
