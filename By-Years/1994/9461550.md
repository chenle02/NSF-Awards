The novel application of symbolic computing techniques to analytical lens design
described in this proposal has the potential to dramatically increase the
capabilities and performance of current optical design programs. Merit functions
based on symbolically calculated Nth-order aberration theory expressions can be
rapidly evaluated as they consist of rational polynomials based on Gaussian
(paraxial) ray-trace data. This will result in greatly increased speed over
programs whose merit functions are calculated from multiple skew ray traces.
These features facilitate the construction of accurate functional approximations
to the merit function surface which in turn allow novel mathematical methods to
be used to analytically search the configuration space for globally optimum
solutions. In addition merit functions of this type give detailed information as
to the magnitude of error created by each element in the optical system. This
information will allow standard optimization algorithms to adjust system
parameters more efficiently and "intelligently". The promise of analytical lens
design has not been fulfilled due to the inability of humans to deal with the
sheer size of the expressions involved. The great power of current symbolic
calculation programs now makes possible the effective use of this theory to
significantly advance the art of optical design.
