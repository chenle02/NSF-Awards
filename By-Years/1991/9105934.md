A central issue in developmental biology is to identify genes that are involved
in specifying cell types in the appropriate spatial patterns. This issue will be
investigated by identifying genes and gene products involved in the
specification of different sensory organs in the fruit fly. The newly developed
FLP recombinase system will be used to screen for mutations that cause defects
in sensory organ pattern or development. Using this method, essential genes with
early lethal phases can be detected and phenotypes of recessive mutations can be
observed in the F1 generation. More generally, these studies have the potential
for identifying genes that play a role in neuronal and epithelial
differentiation in a variety of species.
