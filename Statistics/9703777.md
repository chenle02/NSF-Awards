DMS 9703777 Foundations of Regression Graphics Dennis Cook University of
Minnesota ABSTRACT This research centers on finding how real-time,
computationally intensive, graphical methods can be used to investigate the
statistical structure of regression problems. It is based on the premise that
the full benefit of modern computer graphics cannot be realized in regression
analyses without sound theoretical foundations. Emphasis is placed on the
expansion and application of an emerging theory for regression graphics based on
dimension-reduction subspaces, and on the implications of this theory for the
interpretation of standard graphical constructions. Graphical foundations for
regressions with a censored survival time as the response are given special
attention. The ability to visualize statistical data plays an important role in
analyzing complex relationships. For example, a measure of the marginal impact
of mandatory testing in grade schools requires understanding how different
socioeconomic settings influence performance. Recent advances in high
performance computing, one of the Federal Strategic Areas, allow for the
opportunity to develop new graphical techniques that go far beyond traditional
graphics in both applicability and power. This research centers on finding how
computer graphics can be used to investigate complex statistical relationships.
It stems from the notion that, even in complex systems, it is possible to
construct easily understood graphical displays that contain all or nearly all of
the relevant information in the data. This ability to preserve information in
easily understood displays requires new theoretical foundations that are an
integral part of this study.
