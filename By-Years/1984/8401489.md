This study concerns convective heat transfer in porous materials. Two-phase
thermal convection processes will be examined. Primary interest is in porous
materials saturated with a fluid which can undergo boiling. Horizontal layers
heated from below and thermosyphon geometries will be considered, as will
melting processes around a freely falling sphere.
