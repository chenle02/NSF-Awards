The Zaparo Documentation Project (ZRDP) will bring together remaining speakers
of Zaparo, a linguistic isolate spoken in the Ecuador. There are three last
speakers of this under-documented language who are in their nineties and in
frail health. The outcomes of this project are pivotal to understanding the
typological features which characterize the Zaparo language family. The project
records conversational interactions and oral narratives from which a corpus will
be constructed with interlinearalized transcriptions. The project will be
valuable to researchers and to community members as the final products include
the central corpus (in video and audio formats), a Zaparo-Spanish-Quichua
Dictionary and a Zaparo primer.
