Abstract Savin 9623533 Savin will continue his work on exceptional dual pair
correspondences, over p-adic and real fields, with applications to automorphic
forms, in particular to the construction of a motive with Galois group G2. A
purpose of this research is to get a better understanding of zeroes of
polynomials. Almost everybody knows how to solve a quadratic equation. It is
also possible, although it is less known, to find zeroes of any polynomial of
degree 3 or 4. A higher degree polynomial, in general, can not be solved, but
can be studied by attaching to it a mathematical object called the Galois group.
Conversly, one can ask the following question: given a Galois group, can you
find a polynomial corresponding to that group? The aim of this research is to
give a positive answer to this question for a class of groups of type G2(p). The
degrees of corresponding polynomials are, roughly speaking, the 6th power of the
prime number p. For p=5 it is around 6 billion! This research will provide a
good understanding of such polynomials.
