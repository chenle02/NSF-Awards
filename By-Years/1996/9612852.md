Work under this award includes developing a standard-based quality of service
(QoS) management capability for the Internet. The Internet architecture and
protocols are undergoing a major extension to provide integrated services,
meeting the growing need for real-time distributed applications. With the
imminent availability of multicasting and Q0S capability in commercial IP
routers, Q0S management of the integrated services Internet architecture becomes
a crucial step for progress. The set of managed objects, the Q0S monitoring and
controlling tools, and the evaluations resulting from this experiment are
expected to provide insights into the management of the future integrated
services Internet.
