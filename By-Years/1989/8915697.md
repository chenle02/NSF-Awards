The Larson and Hilde (1975) magnetic anomaly data from the Hawaiian lineations
continues to provide the "blueprint" for geomagnetic polarity during the latest
Jurassic and Early Cretaceous. Magnetostratigraphic data from land sections has
confirmed the main features of the polarity pattern and provided the correlation
to various biozonations and hence to geologic stage boundaries. This research
will build on the previous work and targets certain intervals for detailed
investigation both in the oceanic record and in magnetostratigraphic sections on
land. If the presence of the short polarity chrons can be substantiated both in
the oceanic anomaly and land-based record, it will significantly refine the
record of polarity change in the Early Cretaceous.
