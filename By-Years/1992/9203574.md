Dr. Cynthia M. Dupureur has been awarded a Postdoctoral Fellowship in Chemistry.
Dr Dupureur's doctoral degree was from Ohio State with Professor Ming-Daw Tsai.
She intends to continue her research at CalTech with Professor Jacqueline
Barton. In Barton's laboratory she will learn many of the techniques for
manipulating DNA and learn about metal ion interactions with DNA. This will
prepare her for her long range career goal of studying metal ion function in
endonucleases and designing molecules to interact with DNA for therapeutic
purposes. %%% The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as an
important infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge and
experience of new Ph.D.'s and attract them into meaningful careers in
contemporary chemical research and teaching.
