OCE-9730697 Weingartner The project is for a field study over the northern
Bering Sea shelf to test new theoretical ideas about shelf convection and the
spreading of ventilated waters away from the convective region. These ideas,
which have now been explored in a number of publications by several
investigators, propose alternatives that are significantly different from
earlier ideas of ventilation by quasi- geostrophic plumes. The filed work
consists of deployment of eight moorings, instrumented with Seabird
temperature/salinity recorder and conventional current meters. In addition, PIs
plan to acquire independent information from remote sensing on the polynya
development and on surface feature tracking.
