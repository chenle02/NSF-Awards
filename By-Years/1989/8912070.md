In this project in the Theoretical and Computational Physical Chemistry Program
of the Chemistry Division, Professor Hoffmann will carry out molecular orbital
calculations to probe the electronic structure and bonding in organic,
inorganic, and organometallic discrete molecules and one-, two-, and three-
dimensional extended arrays. The structure, electrical conductivity, magnetism,
and other properties of Tl(I)-Tl(I), noble gas overlayers on metal surfaces,
tetraphosphorus complexes, Co-Hg clusters and polymers, high pressure LiGe
allotropes, NbSe one-dimensional chains, bonding in carbides, O-O bond formation
in the solid state, the limits of the Zintl concept, and electron-rich and
electron-poor multicenter bonding in the solid will be studied.
