With funding from the NSF Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and
Mathematics (S-STEM) program, the "UC Irvine Pathways to Engineering
Collaborative" project will support high-achieving, low-income students with
demonstrated financial need at University of California, Irvine (UCI) and Irvine
Valley College (IVC). Throughout its five years, this project will fund 360
scholarships for community college students who are pursuing engineering degrees
with a specialization in advanced manufacturing. Recognizing the crucial need
for partnerships between two-year institutions and universities in the
advancement of students who pursue baccalaureate degrees in engineering, this
S-STEM Track 3 project establishes an academic and counseling collaboration that
includes co-advising, mentoring, and tutoring and establishes pathways to
baccalaureate degrees in engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drawing on Tinto's
theory of student retention and Eccles Expectancy-Value theory to examine choice
and success in engineering, the partner institutions will organize their project
around five principle objectives. First, they seek to create an ecosystem of
curricular and co-curricular supports to improve the transfer student
experience. Second, they will increase the number of community college students
who transfer and matriculate in engineering. Third, they plan to mentor these
transfer students toward graduating with baccalaureate degrees in engineering
with a special emphasis in advanced manufacturing. Fourth, the project team will
aim to increase the number of these baccalaureate degree recipients who enter
into the workforce or graduate school. Finally, the investigators will carry out
their work with an eye toward contributing new knowledge on success in
engineering through a multi-year mixed method longitudinal study. This multi-
year mixed-methods study investigates the priorities, values, and experiences
that shape academically talented low-income students' education choices and
their will to succeed. The investigation is guided by the following overarching
research question: "What drives academically talented, low-income engineering
students, who begin their academic careers at community colleges, to succeed in
engineering?"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
