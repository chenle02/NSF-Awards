This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the project is to develop a
new psychological model of our access to our own propositional attitudes (our
beliefs, desires, intentions, judgments, decisions, supposings, and the rest),
integrating a wide range of results from across cognitive science. According to
this model, our knowledge of our own attitudes is always interpretative, and is
no different in kind from the access that we have to the attitudes of other
people. (The model allows, however, that our access to our own experiences and
feelings is more direct.) The main result of this research will be an
interdisciplinary book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Philosophers have traditionally
assumed that we have immediate, non-inferential, ?introspective? access to our
own propositional attitudes, and most ordinary folk agree. Even most cognitive
scientists believe that this traditional model is partially correct. Yet there
is extensive evidence from different areas of cognitive science that people will
often confabulate attributions of attitudes to themselves while remaining under
the impression that they are introspecting. There is also plenty of scientific
data of other sorts that challenges the traditional account of the character of
our self-knowledge. These forms of evidence will be surveyed and evaluated, and
the proposed model will be developed, compared with a range of relevant
alternatives, and defended in the light of the
evidence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will marshal a wide array of
scientific evidence in support of a clearly delineated and bold hypothesis,
which is radically in conflict with common sense and with the views of virtually
all philosophers (alive or dead). Since few cognitive scientists have
appreciated the theoretical significance and revolutionary implications of their
own discoveries, the project will also make an important contribution to
cognitive science.
