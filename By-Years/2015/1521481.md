The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology
Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will be in the ability to better screen for and
manage glaucoma. Americans over the age of 40 need to be screened for elevated
eye pressure which may lead to glaucoma and blindness. This STTR project aims to
develop a non-invasive low-cost instrument that will allow frequent eye pressure
measurements through the eye lid. Approximately 4 million Americans suffer from
elevated eye pressure and require regular monitoring, the technology developed
under this grant will improve public health, reduce cost of eye pressure
measurements and will lead to an annual market opportunity in excess of 1B US
dollars. Given the universal need for convenient eye pressure measurement
systems a similar market opportunity exists in Europe and the developed
countries of Asia and Latin America.

The proposed project will develop a patient-specific calibration method.
Through-the-eye lid tactile tonometry is an indirect pressure measurement
technique. While universal calibration may still produce relative pressure
measurements, a patient specific calibration will improve the accuracy to a
level comparable with existing instruments such as Goldman applanation
tonometers. The proposed research will examine the ability of a single
measurement to produce an accurate patient-specific calibration. The proposed
approach utilizes an artificial neural network trained a-priory by a finite
element model of the human eye capturing easy-to-measure model parameters. It is
anticipated that the accuracy of the technique can reach +/- 5 mmHg or better
with respect to Goldman applanation tonometry.
