9725427 Sen This research involves the investigation of anisotropic parameter
estimation from observations of anisotropy in crustal and mantle materials.
Forward modeling techniques will be used based on the reflectivity method and
global optimization methods such as simulate annealing and genetic algorithms
for the parameter estimation problem. Prior analytic and numerical
investigations reveal that the dependence of model parameters on seismic data
for anisotropic media is highly nonlinear and, therefore, a nonlinear, global
optimization method is appropriate for this purpose. Questions addressed include
the uniqueness of anisotropy parameters, the type of data needed to determine
anisotropy parameters, and the importance of inclusion of anisotropy parameters
in a given data set. ***
