This project establishes a regional consortium of schools that can provide a
program of curriculum support and faculty development to address dual goals of
strengthening and supporting existing faculty and enlarging the pool of
qualified faculty in information assurance and computer security. Project
activities include conducting workshops and mentoring programs to increase the
production of information assurance and computer security professionals in South
Dakota, North Dakota, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.

Intellectual Merit: The intellectual merit of this proposal is the transfer and
dissemination of curricular content and the development of partnerships in a
network of higher education institutions in order to advance knowledge within
the information assurance field. This proposal impacts the number and quality of
faculty capable of teaching and conducting research in the field. The project
uses a mentoring model that starts with the partner institutions in this project
and subsequently has the potential of replication beyond the initial cohort of
colleges. This transfer of knowledge also stimulates research and positively
impact the job market as an increased number of graduates are prepared to enter
employment in high demand areas. In addition, the involvement of tribal colleges
produces a faculty development model that other Native American universities can
follow.

Broader Impact: The broader impact of the project is the dissemination of the
well-developed information security knowledge and infrastructure to regional
institutions. The project plans an initial cohort of 36 faculty members. In
addition, preference in participation in the project is given to teams that
include women or minority faculty or administrators. The initial cohort of 36
faculty will in turn mentor others to further expand the reach of the project.
