Elliptic partial differential equations are an important tool in the analysis of
the behavior of physical systems. They arise in the study of temperature
distribution, stress and deformation due to torsion, incompressible fluid flow,
electric and magnetic fields, and in many other fields of science and
engineering. Very often their solutions may be obtained with the aid of an
electronic digital computer, and so they are of interest to applied
mathematicians, computer scientists, and engineers alike. The first phase of the
proposed research would formulate, implement, and then evaluate a finite
difference method designed to be most effective on elliptic boundary-value
problems with singularities of known form. The evaluation process would consider
the method's accuracy over a population of problems, as well as determine its
computational efficiency over a range of grid sizes. The second phase of the
project would implement vector and parallel versions of the original scalar
algorithm on a Cray X-MP/24 supercomputer. The performance tradeoffs between
increased vector length and increased multitasking would then be investigated.
