0320793&lt;br/&gt;Gayes&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation award to
Coastal Carolina University in South Carolina provides funds for acquisition of
field instrumentation for research in coastal marine processes, especially
erosion and faunal habitats. Instruments supported here include (1) a digital
side-scan sonar system and (2) a sub-bottom profiling system, together with
appropriate processing and analysis software and computer hardware. The
instruments will be used in several ongoing research projects, and they will be
integrated into the courses in the Coastal Marine and Wetland Studies
curriculum, using both the University's small research vessel and planned
continuation of ongoing collaborations with NOAA on the R/V Ferrel through the
Sea Grant Program. A major thrust of CCU's program is integration of research
and education, including a recent AIRE award from NSF, and these instruments
support extension of that effort in marine sciences, enabling research projects
by undergraduate students at this predominantly-undergraduate campus, as well as
students in the new Master of Science program in Coastal Marine and Wetland
Studies. The instrumentation award is supported by the Division of Ocean
Sciences at NSF. &lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
