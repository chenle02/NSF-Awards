This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop
large-scale and continuous manufacturing process for tunable nanoporous carbon
by etching metals away from the metal carbide starting materials. The porous
carbon materials prepared by this technology are anticipated to exhibit small
pore sizes of 0.5-2.2 nanometer with sub Angstrom control and large pore sizes
up to 30 nanometer with nanometer control.

The broader/commercial impact of this project will be the development of a
scalable process to manufacture porous carbon materials with tunable pore sizes
that will have major applications in a number of areas including atmospheric gas
sampling, electrical energy, gas storage, poisoning treatment, water filtration
and desalination.
