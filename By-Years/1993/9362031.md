9362031 Dunsmuir Flavor in tomato fruit is associated with high levels of both
sugars and acids. It is known that the level of malic acid in the fruit declines
by 50% with fruit ripening and that this reduction is thought to be mediated by
a cytosolic NADP dependent malic enzyme (NADP-ME). The tomato NADP-ME genes
which are expressed in the pericarp during ripening by using a heterologous
probe for NADP-ME from maize will be isolated and characterized. Once isolated,
the tomato genes will be used in genetic engineering experiments so that the
induction of NADP-ME which occurs during ripening would be reduced or inhibited
and higher malic acid levels would persist within the ripe fruit. In parallel
higher levels of the same enzyme in the fruit will be engineered in order to
gain insight into mechanisms which regulate acid levels in the fruit. %%% The
anticipated outcome of this research would be the ability to directly engineer
the acid levels in fruit which could significantly affect the flavor of tomatoes
in the treatment of processing tomatoes. ***
