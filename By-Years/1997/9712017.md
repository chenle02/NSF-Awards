Kathryn Besio University of Hawaii, Manoa Adventure travel and expedition
mountaineering in northern Pakistan relies on Balti male laborers as porters.
The doctoral dissertation research will examine transcultural interactions
associated with the Karakorum portering economy, focusing on hitherto invisible
participants in those transcultural interactions: women and children of
Baltistan. Portering is the primary means by which cash is introduced to the
village economy. The investigation will look at areas of conflict and the impact
of this form of work in the village of Askole, Baltistan, Pakistan over two
field seasons. Using participant observation and time-geographic analysis it
will demonstrate how relations of portering are rooted in the daily activities
of the research participants.
