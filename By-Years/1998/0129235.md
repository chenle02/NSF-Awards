0129235&lt;br/&gt;Cerqua-Richardson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This three-year award
for U.S.-France collaboration in novel optical materials involves students and
faculty researchers at the University of Central Florida's School of
Optics/CREOL and research groups at the University of Bordeaux I in France.
Kathleen T. Cerqua-Richardson, Alfons Schulte, and Thierry Cardinal at CREOL and
Bordeaux respectively will lead the collaborative program. The goal is to
fabricate and characterize chalcogenide and oxysulfide glasses and their related
waveguides for integrated optic applications. Chalcogenide glasses have shown
potential for use in linear and nonlinear optics. They exhibit high optical
nonlinearities, are photosensitive in the visible region and transparent in the
telecommunication spectral region. They suffer from limited long-term stability.
The research will address several current limitations associated with non-oxide
chalcogenide glasses and extend knowledge in new oxysulfide glass systems. The
US researchers bring to this collaboration expertise in processing and optical
fabrication of bulk chalcogenide materials, Raman spectroscopy using near
infrared techniques for fiber and films. This is complemented by French
expertise in the synthesis and characterization of bulk oxysulfide materials and
ab initio calculations.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This award represents the US side
of joint proposals to the NSF and the French National Center for Scientific
Research (CNRS). NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses for the US
investigators and graduate student. CNRS will support the visits of the French
researchers and graduate students to the United States. &lt;br/&gt;
