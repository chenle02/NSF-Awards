9704755 Pitts The Texas Geometry and Topology Conference has been held semi-
annually since 1989. The conference has been jointly sponsored by the University
of Texas at Austin, Texas A&M University, Rice University and the University of
Houston. The conference is designed to enhance both the educational and the
research atmosphere of the community of Texas geometers and topologists. The
conference has three specific goals: to bring researchers of national and
international statue to Texas to discuss their research and to interact with
mathematicians from Texas and surrounding states; to make it possible for the
community of geometers and topologists from Texas and surrounding states to meet
and share mathematics on a regular mathematics; to contribute to the development
of graduate students and young faculty in geometry and topology. 4
