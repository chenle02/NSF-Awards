This project will give undergraduate chemistry students at Stockton State
College the opportunity to work with a modern computer-controlled FT-IR system.
The instrument will enhance substantially the laboratory instruction in Organic
Chemistry, Physical Chemistry, and Laboratory Methods. Students completing their
senior thesis requirement in chemistry will use the instrument in research
projects. In addition, students in the biology, environmental studies, and
physics programs will use the FT-IR system in laboratory courses and research.
The FT-IR instrumentation and associated accessories and software will form the
focus for introducing undergraduates to Fourier transform techniques, computer-
controlled instrumentation, database searching, and computer- assisted data
collection and manipulation. Diffuse reflectance and cylindrical internal
reflectance accessories will allow students to explore the most modern sampling
techniques for infrared spectroscopy.
