In the Engineering Projects in Community Service (EPICS) program, Electrical
and Computer Engineering students earn academic credit for long-term team
projects that solve technology-based problems for local community service
agencies. Each project team is a mix of sophomores, juniors, and seniors, and
each student may participate in an EPICS project for up to 3 years. This
structure provides the continuity required to carry out long-term engineering
design projects that can have a significant impact on the community. The program
is establishing a hardware prototyping facility. Its goal is to enable the
student teams to fully implement and test their designs. The students thus
experience all phases of an engineering project, from project-definition
meetings with their community service agency partner, through system design, to
construction and evaluation of a system prototype. After a prototype has proven
its value to the community, funds raised from private sources are used to
produce the systems deployed on a permanent basis. The five current EPICS
projects and those to be added involve many technologies: computer networks,
digital electronics, distributed databases, electromechanical systems, energy
management systems, human-computer interfaces, power electronics, solar power,
speech processing, and wireless communications. The equipment supports hardware
prototyping efforts involving any combination of these technologies. The
addition of this full-scale hardware prototyping capability is crucial to the
continued development of the EPICS program. It enables the EPICS program to
become an outstanding model of how community awareness, communication skills,
teamwork, system design skills, and project management skills can be taught to
undergraduates in engineering.
