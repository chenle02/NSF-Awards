The research objectives are to obtain and analyze observations of solar
oscillations and long-term solar variability taken at SCLERA (The University of
Arizona Santa Catalina Laboratory for Experimental Relativity by Astrometry) and
at Yunnan Observatory near Kunming, China. The international collaboration has
been organized in order to furnish observations of the Sun covering a sizeable
fraction of a day and, consequently, to significantly reduce the otherwise
serious effects of false diurnal signals present in the data of a single site.
The observations will be obtained with the SCLERA solar seismographs currently
in operation at the University of Arizona and at Yunnan Observatory. The set of
facilities offers research and educational opportunities that are at the
forefront of solar physics for both U.S. and Chinese scientists through a
relatively low-cost ground-based program. The first results from the
international cooperation are expected to yield improved information about the
structure of the interior regions of the Sun and about long-term solar
variability, which may have an impact on long-term variations in the Earth's
climate.
