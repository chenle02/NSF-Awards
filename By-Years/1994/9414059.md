9414059 Huband and Leake This award supports a planning visit to China by a
delegation under the sponsorship of the American Society for Engineering
Education to investigate and define opportunities for US-China collaboration in
engineering education, with an emphasis on accreditation policies, standards,
and practices. In addition to the importance of developing a more comprehensive
relationship among the engineering education communities of the two countries,
this visit may influence the Chinese to adopt US engineering education standards
- based on a four year undergraduate degree - rather than the 5.5 year German
standard. This is of importance for US engineering firms hoping to do business
in China, since the standards selected by the Chinese government could exclude
US- trained engineers. Opportunities for expanded cooperation in other mutually
beneficial areas of engineering education will also be discussed.
