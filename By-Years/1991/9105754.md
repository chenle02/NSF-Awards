This award provides 50% funding for the acquisition of an inductively-coupled
mass spectrometer to be installed and operated in the Department of Geology and
Geophysics at the University of Minnesota. The University is committed to
providing matching funds. The equipment will be used to provide key geochemical
analyses for a variety of research programs supported by NSF in earth sciences
and oceanography. These projects are involved in the laboratory and field
aspects of fluid-rock interactions, fluid- mineral equilibria and isotopic and
trace element studies, as well as limnological research.
