This award supports participation in the KUMUNU 2016 algebra conference
scheduled to take place at the University of Kansas on October 1 and 2, 2016.
The KUMUNU conference is held during one weekend each fall and has taken place
every year (but one) since its inception in 1999. The original idea was to bring
together algebraists at three midwest universities: Kansas, Missouri, and
Nebraska, but over time the conference has expanded in scope to its present
status as a major regional conference. The conference will feature six talks by
leading researchers in commutative algebra and a poster session. The award will
be used to support travel and lodging for participants, particularly junior
researchers and graduate students. Special efforts will be made to support
participation by women and underrepresented minorities.

Generally speaking, the topics presented at the conference fall under the
umbrella of commutative algebra. Commutative algebra has its origins from
multiple sources, including algebraic geometry and number theory. In its modern
form, it often provides a common language for parts of several different fields,
including algebraic geometry, algebraic number theory, combinatorics and
computational mathematics. A recent trend in the conference has been to include
talks that represent applications of commutative algebra to different fields,
such as geometric singularities and computational and/or combinatorial topics,
rather than topics that might fall purely under the purview of commutative
algebra. Continued inclusion of speakers beyond the original triad of
universities reinforce this pattern and contribute to the goal of broadening and
strengthening connections between algebraists throughout the midwest. More
