9353411 Hernandez-Heinz This 4-year project aims at providing students --
especially at- risk, minority students -- greater access toi challenging,
colllege track mathematics courses. To this end, the project prepares some 155
teachers at 4 large San Francisco High Schools to implement two new exemplary
mathematics curricula: Course A of the California Mathematics Framework, and the
3-year Interactive Mathematics Project (IMP) materials. The program provides the
teachers appropriate content background (including topics from probability and
statistics, geometry, trigonometry, and mathematical modeling), as well as
stressing problem-solving, applications of graphing calculators, cooperative
learning, the uses of journals and portfolios, and alternative assessments. The
project has 3 basic components: (1) a 1-week summer program focusing on
mathematical content; (2) intensive support during the school year (including a
daily, special, common preparation period for participating teachers); on-site
visits by staff; group meetings and conferences with staff; and on-going staff
efforts to maintain and nurture support from school administrators; (3) an
"After the Bell Program, "especially for at-risk students, featuring after-
school involvement of parents, peer tutoring, field trips, a homework "hot-
line," and the like. In order to prepare the participants to become leaders in
mathematics reform in San Francisco, the program provides them with many
opportunities to develop, exercise and hone their leadership skills. An external
evaluation not only looks at the effectiveness of the implementation model, but
also focuses on student outcomes, such as increased enrollment, and success in,
demanding college-track mathematics courses. Cost-sharing is 64% of the NSF
contribution.
