This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)Phase I project will develop a
highly-parallel, mass-selected purification system for large pharmaceutical drug
libraries. The need for high-throughput purification is driven by the industry
recognition that combinatorial chemistry samples must still be purified even
after chemical screening. This is a daunting task considering the exponentially
increasing number of drug candidates being synthesized by combinatorial and
parallel methods. This proposal will examine monolithic parallel flash
chromatography and preparative liquid chromatography configurations. The key
enabling technology is photoionization mass spectrometry, which permits accurate
molecular detection in mixtures of compounds without the problems of
competition-for-charge and ion suppressions that plague conventional ionization
methods. This will make it possible to monitor several chromatography columns at
the same time. The goal of the project is to have a purification system in place
that has a practical purification rate of 1 min per sample (16 parallel
purifications in about 16 min) corresponding to a potential 16 hr daily rate of
960 sample purifications per day.

The commercial application of this project will be in the important niche market
of molecular analysis and screening for drug discovery.
