This project will concentrate on several new applications of frame theory
concerning the transmission of information. First, for communication networks
such as the Internet, packets of data are often lost in transmission and are
retransmitted according to a protocol invisible to the user. In many
applications, the subsequent delay is unacceptable and best possible
reconstruction from what is initially received is necessary. Second, it has been
shown that wireless communication systems which employ multiple antennas can
have very high channel capacities. Until now, constructive approaches to
achieving this capacity have relied on the assumption that the receiver knows
the complex-valued Rayleigh fading coefficients. This assumption is often
unrealistic in practice and recently new classes of unitary space-time signals
have been proposed where neither the sender nor the receiver knows the fading
coefficients. The investigators will facilitate the implementation of both of
these programs along with a host of related problems in signal/image processing.
This will require: (1) The construction of totally new families of uniform tight
frames with specific optimization properties; (2) The development of algorithms
for their implementation; (3) The development of new (and computationally
efficient) methods for inverting the Gabor frame operator to allow a much
broader class of functions to be used for signal/image processing.

Is it possible to develop a cell phone which will not fade under almost any
circumstance? Is it possible to have your computer receive an almost perfect
message immediately after it is sent? Is it possible to develop a hearing aid
which not only allows the wearer to hear what he/she wants, but also allows a
person to filter out sounds they do not want to hear? Is it possible to have a
breast x-ray which is so clear that cancer diagnoses are 99% accurate? The
answer is that all of these (and a host of other important questions) are
``theoretically possible''. What is needed for the implementation of these
important applications is the development of a branch of mathematics called
``uniform tight frames''. Working with a dozen research groups around the
country, the investigators are developing the mathematics needed for these
applications as well as developing the means to implement these results in the
specific cases listed above and a large number of other areas of application.
