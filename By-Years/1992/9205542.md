Nistor will continue his work in that part of the theory of operator algebras
relating to noncommutative geometry, and particularly index theory and cyclic
cohomology. His immediate goals include a formula for the bivariant Chern-Connes
character and the identification of the Atiyah-Singer integrand, computation of
the cyclic cohomology of foliation algebras using Bott's simplicial methods, and
a combination of these two into an index theorem for foliations. The general
area of mathematics of this project has its basis in the theory of algebras of
Hilbert space operators. Operators can be thought of as finite or infinite
matrices of complex numbers. Special types of operators are often put together
in an algebra, naturally called an operator algebra. These abstract objects have
a surprising variety of applications. For example, they play a key role in knot
theory, which in turn is currently being used to study the structure of DNA, and
they are of fundamental importance in noncommutative geometry, which is becoming
increasingly important in physics.
