The local structure in thin films of YBa2Cu3O7 (YBCO) and (La Sr)2CuO4
superconductors will be investigated using a series of EXAFS experiments. The
behavior of the c-axis Cu(1)-O(4) and the Cu(2)-O(4) bonds as O is removed and
reintroduced in the same sample via anneals will be measured to determine how
the anharmonicity changes with Tc. Substituted samples will be studied to
understand how the local structure and site, Jc, and quasiparticle lifetimes
depend on different dopants. This will be clarified with c-axis and a-axis
films. More dilute concentrations of Fe, Cu, Ni and Zn in bulk YBCO will be
investigated as the low concentration regime may be important for controlling or
limiting the quasiparticle lifetime.
