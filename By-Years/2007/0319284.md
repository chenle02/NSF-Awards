This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project proposes to model,
fabricate and test 2-D photon crystals for far-field coherent emission. Very
recently published research showed that thermal emissions from 1-D photon
crystals (PC) had near-field coherent components. Interference between photons
and surface structure effective turned the PC into an infrared antenna emitting
radiation in narrow bands. Ion Optics will fabricate thermally heated PC
emitters based upon patterned silicon (dielectric-air PC) covered with very thin
patterned metal films. Computer models will first study potential structures.
Optimal structures will then be fabricated and tested. Emission will be measured
as a function of angle and wavelength, and we will look at diffraction effects
to test coherence. The project will lead to production of inexpensive, highly
efficient, narrow line-width, low dispersion infrared MOEMS sources well suited
to spectroscopic applications. Phase I results will be used to model
spectroscopic vapor detection to determine potential for improved sensitivity.
Significant advances over available MEMS components would show feasibility for
Phase II.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Such light sources would enable detection of
vapor species at very low concentrations (parts per billion or parts per
trillion) for applications to atmospheric research, environmental research,
detection of chemical warfare agents, explosives, etc.&lt;br/&gt;Potential sales
could exceed $20 million per year.&lt;br/&gt;
