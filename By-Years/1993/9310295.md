9310295 Schlick The goal in this proposal is to extend this work further so that
is can be applied routinely to protein and nucleic acids. We propose to develop
and implement a new algorithm that combines implicit-integration and normal-mode
techniques. The new algorithm will maintain the large time-step stability
inherited in the implicit scheme, but also resolve the high-frequency components
of the motion so that the activities of high-frequency modes can be retained.
With parallel implementations on state-of-the-art machines, this will make
possible simulations at time-steps of order 100 femtoseconds; the total
simulation time will then approach the millisecond range.
