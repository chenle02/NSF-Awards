This award will support the continuation of a program to develop and utilize
techniques for diffraction-limited imaging of infrared astronomical objects from
large aperture, ground-based telescopes. Recent developments in detector and
telescope technology and also in image processing now allow large improvements
to be made in observing efficiency, angular resolution, and scientific
productivity. For this purpose, a specially constructed, two-dimensional camera
will be used in the wavelength range from 1 to 5.5 microns to utilize both the
unsurpassed angular resolution of the cophased 6.86m Multiple Mirror Telescope
(MMT) and the availability of conventional telescopes in the northern and
southern hemispheres. This instrumentation will be used to characterize the
masses and luminosities of low mass stars and substellar objects which are only
barely observable at the present time. It will also help examine the innermost
regions of circumstellar material around both young and evolved stars and
produce high spatial resolution maps of volcanic activity on Jupiter's moon Io.
To provide more accurate, higher contrast images and to detect wavelength-
dependent structures, new techniques will be developed for differential speckle
interferometry, more powerful bispectrum analysis, and for more accurate
calibration of atmospheric seeing. In a continuation of a very successful
outreach program, high school teachers and students will also be involved
directly in this research program.
