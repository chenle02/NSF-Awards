&lt;br/&gt;0420048&lt;br/&gt;Mahadevan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project proposes to improve the
bioelectrical energy generation capacity of the micro-organism Geobacter
sulfurreducens through a novel metabolic engineering approach based on an
integrated computational and experimental strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
commercial application of this project will be in the area of biomass
processing, for conversion of waste biomass to value added products (i.e.
electricity). &lt;br/&gt;
