This award supports a U.S. Yugoslav project development visit to the Gradevinski
Institute, Zagreb, Yugoslavia. The primary purpose of the visit is to develop a
collaborative research proposal between Dr. Robert Schiffman of the University
of Colorado's Department of Civil, Environmental and Architectural Engineering
and Dr. Antun Szavits-Nossan at the Gradevinski Institute on a comprehensive
theory of finite strain consolidation of soft soils. This project was approved
by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on Cooperation in Science and Technology and is
funded through a joint fund consisting of matching contributions from the U.S.
and Yugoslav governments. The U.S. contribution is provided annually by the
Department of State and no NSF funds are involved. The grants are composed
principally of Yugoslav dinars and made to the principal Yugoslav institute. A
project development award provides travel funds for the American scientist to
Yugoslavia.
