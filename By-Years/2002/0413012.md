For decades, the lens-CCD chip paradigm has dominated the design of imaging
sensors. Design goals of these systems are to maximize resolution and to
maximize the field of view. This work proposes a new design paradigm for a
sensor that employs state-of-the art optical micro-electro-mechanical systems,
with the goal of ultimately producing ultra-high resolution images. This will be
made possible by an application of the theory of vector fields and distributions
to optical design, and the effort will entail collaboration between a
mathematician and an electrical engineer. A major component of this work will
involve the integration of research and education. This work will enable
students and researchers to explore the multi-discipline area of optical
microsystems through the development of courses, labs, and research experiences,
developing a qualified next-generation engineering force for US leadership in
the emerging optical microsystem field.
