This award supports the research of Professor C. Greene to work in
combinatorics. He intends to investigate partially ordered sets, representations
of the symmetric group and tableaux. In particular, he intends to work on
Young's seminormal representation of the symmetric group, Mobius functions on
planar lattices, balanced tableaux, the lattice of shuffles and a conjecture of
D. Jackson on lattice-determinants. The research is in the general area of
combinatorics. Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study how
discrete collections of objects can be organized. And, so it is extremely
important to modern communications, for example the design of large networks as
in telephone systems and the design of algorithms in computer science.
