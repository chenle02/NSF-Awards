This study seeks to (1) explore the ways in which Navajo students and Navajo
professionals experience and understand engineering design in the context of
their culture, community, and society; (2) conduct a design-based research study
on the development of culturally-contextualized theory of learning and
curriculum modules that will be piloted in several schools in the Navajo Nation;
and (3) create and pilot tools to evaluate Navajo students? experience of
engineering design. Under the theoretical frameworks of social constructivism
and culturally relevant pedagogy, this study will use a phenomenographic
approach to explore the ways that Navajo students and Navajo professionals
experience engineering design in the context of their culture, and a design-
based research approach to apply the results from the phenomenography in the
iterative development of culturally-contextualized engineering curricula.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the focus on engineering in the Next Generation
Science Standards, the results of this study will provide critical insight into
how to engage and evaluate Navajo students in culturally-contextualized
engineering design curricula, which will illuminate pathways for higher
education and careers in STEM fields.
