The objective is to build an intelligent system for design of analog integrated
circuits. The ultimate goal is to automate the design process with a tool
performing the following four functions: l) It prepares symbolic equations
describing circuit specifications in terms of cuicuit parameters, 2) A database
of design goals is created, 3) The system is an intgelligent front end to a set
of supporting design tools such as circuit simulators, layout tools, etc., 4)
The system stores and uses design expertise from a library of circuit
descriptions. This project is one supported under the Creativity Awards for
Undergraduate Engineering Students.
