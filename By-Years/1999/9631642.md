9631642 This award supports a consortium of three laboratories located at
Stanford University, U.C. Berkley, and University of Pennsylvania. The long term
goal of this project is to determine the total DNA sequence of the Arabidopsis
thaliana genome. For the next three years, the specific goal of this consortium
is to produce at least 5.2 Mb of finished sequences of DNA from chromosome 1.
Additional important goal of this project is to apply the new high throughput
DNA sequencing technologies to Arabidopsis genome sequencing. All sequences will
be deposited in GenBank upon completion of each BAC or YAC clones. Unfinished
sequence data will be made available on a WWW site to be set up at Stanford.
Clones and other materials will be made available through the Arabidopsis
Biological Resource Center at Ohio State. This award is one of the three awarded
by the triagency (Department of Energy, National Science Foundation, and US
Department of Agriculture) Arabidopsis thaliana genome research program. The
activity of this consortium will be coordinated with the other groups engaged in
large scale sequencing of the Arabidopsis genome. The results will contribute to
determining the overall strategy for the completion of the sequence of the
entire Arabidopsis genome. More importantly, the information and data produced
will be useful to the general research community and will contribute to a rapid
advance in plant biology.
