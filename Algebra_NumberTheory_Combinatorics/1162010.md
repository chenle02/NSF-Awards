This proposal is in combinatorial representation theory, the focus being on
tensor power centralizer algebras. These are generalizations of the group
algebra of the symmetric group, the Brauer algebras, braid groups, and
Temperley-Lieb algebras, and arise as algebras of operators preserving
symmetries in a tensor space. The proposal includes two main projects. (1) The
first will unify and expand the theory of affine and degenerate affine Birman-
Murakami-Wenzl (BMW) algebras. These algebras arise via the study of knot and
link invariants, but also in Schur-Weyl duality with symplectic and orthogonal
Lie algebras and quantum groups. For the PI and collaborators, the latter
connection has facilitated a completely parallel treatment of the affine and
degenerate affine BMW algebras, which has already yielded new findings and
simplified previous constructions. The result is a wealth of surprising
connections across the literature, including to symmetric functions, central
element constructions, and the K-theory and cohomology of orthogonal and
symplectic Grassmannians. (2) The second project will develop the theory of two-
boundary centralizer algebras, which were brought to the community?s attention
via recent work in loop models and quantum spin chains. By exploring the
symplectic symmetry in certain type-A tensor spaces, realizations of the type-C
affine Hecke algebras as centralizer algebras may arise. Techniques developed
will generalize to two-boundary BMW algebras as the symplectic and orthogonal
analog; similarly, two-boundary Hecke-Clifford algebras may be in Schur-Weyl
duality with type-Q Lie superalgebras.

The goal of representation theory is to take otherwise intractable algebraic
objects, break them into their most basic pieces, and build them back up again,
gaining salient information in the process. Combinatorics offers many simple yet
remarkably powerful tools for keeping track of those smaller pieces, the
reconstructions, and the data gathered. Since the birth of combinatorial
representation theory at the turn of the 20th century, we have learned how to
harness these tools for use in quantum mechanics, crystallography, molecular
biology, voting theory, and many other disciplines. In mathematics, the research
proposed by the PI will be of broad interest, including to those studying
symmetric functions, Lie theory, quantum groups, braid categories, algebraic
geometry, low dimensional topology, mathematical physics, and differential
equations.
