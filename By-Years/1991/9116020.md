It is proposed to integrate satellite imagery of sea surface temperature and
reflectance (turbidity) with a mixed layer model and a three-dimensional
circulation model to infer dynamical processes of the subtidal circulation in
Delaware Bay. Then, the output of the three-dimensional model will be validated
against in- situ data.
