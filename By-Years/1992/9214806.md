Under the direction of Dr. James Richardson, Mr. Michael Heckenberger will
collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will conduct approximately 18
months of fieldwork in the Upper Xingu region of the Brazilian Amazon. This
region has been relatively little affected by European contact and Mr
Heckenberger will study the settlement pattern, past and present of Kuikuru
Amerindians. In the first stage of this project he will examine present
practices of land use. He will analyze how villages are spatially organized and
relate this pattern to social organization. He will then focus on individual
family groups and where specific activities are conducted. In the second phase
of the research he will use this knowledge to trace Kuikuru change over time. He
will locate and map historic villages to compare past and present settlement
patterns. Finally he will conduct archaeological excavations at prehistoric
sites to examine a more distant past. For many years anthropologists have
studied tribal peoples of the Amazon region in an attempt to understand how
groups at a relatively simple level of technology and social organization adapt
to tropical environments. The problem these reseachers face however is that even
seemingly "untouched" groups have been indirectly exposed to Western contact for
over one hundred years. Therefore it is difficult to tell the extent to which
observed patterns developed truly independently of outside contact. Mr.
Heckenberger's research will help to answer this question. This work is
important for several reasons. It will increase our understanding of culture
contact and change. It will also assist in the training of a promising young
scientist.
