The test results of a bridge will be used to calibrate standards for strength
evaluation of existing bridges. Nondestructive test procedures for bridge
condition evaluation being researched by the University of Cincinnati will also
be calibrated. It is proposed to further exploit this test for the advancement
of analytical modeling and nonlinear analysis of reinforced concrete structures.
Collaborating researchers from the University of Cincinnati and Wiss, Janney,
Elstner Associates will design, conduct and document the test as a benchmark
experiment for validating and calibrating RC bridge analytical finite-element
modeling and analysis. Instrumentation will be designed and installed to measure
local and global responses to serve this purpose. Information will be
documented, archived and disseminated to permit analytical model generation and
response simulation by analytical researchers.
