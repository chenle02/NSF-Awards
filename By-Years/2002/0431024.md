Fluorescence optical diffusion tomography (FODT) uses diffusely scattered light
to image deep into tissue. This new biomedical imaging modality has tremendous
potential in the early diagnosis of cancer and the development of new
pharmaceuticals because: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) it offers the chemical and
molecular specificity of spectroscopy; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) it can also be
coupled to fluorescent molecular imaging agents to target specific cancers or
biological processes of interest; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3) it is minimally
invasive since it only requires exposure to light; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4) it
has the potential to be low cost since it does not require coherent optical
sources and demodulation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, a critical barrier to
this technology is the creation of algorithms which can reconstruct images from
light that has been diffusely scattered by seemingly opaque tissue. This
research creates the foundation for FODT technology by developing the algorithms
that can accurately reconstruct FODT images from this diffusely scattered light.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The algorithms are based on Bayesian inverse methods and
multigrid optimization of the resulting cost functionals. Critical goals of the
research are to reconstruct accurate fluorescence yield volume renderings,
&lt;br/&gt;to directly estimate pharmaco-kinetic parameters, to form
reconstructions which use modulation and wavelength diversity to improve
specificity, and to develop novel polarization-sensitive imaging methods.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. A level of effort statement: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
PIs will make every attempt to meet to the original scope and level of effort of
the project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
