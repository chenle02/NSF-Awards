Although the terms "signaling", "communication", and "network" are deeply
embedded in the parlance of biology, the more profound meanings of information
and communication are overlooked often. Information can be quantified, its flow
may be measured, and tight bounds exist for its representation and conveyance
between transmitters and receivers in a variety of settings. Communications
theory is about efficient communication when energy is at a premium, as is often
the case in biology. Perhaps most fundamentally, information theory allows
mechanism-blind bounds on decisions and information flow, i.e., the physics of a
system allows determination of limits that any method of information
description, delivery or processing must obey. Thus, a rigorous application of
communications theory to biology seems both attractive and obvious as an
organizing principle -- a way to tease order from the myriad engineering
solutions that comprise biological systems. Similarly, the study of biological
systems -- engineering solutions evolved over eons -- might yield new
communication and computational theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A communications-
theoretic approach to multicellular biological systems such as microbial
ecosystems and human tissues has received scant (if any) attention, so this
research will carefully explore this interdisciplinary intellectual gap. Topics
to be considered include the input/output capacity of multi-cellular biological
systems, representation methods for structural information, and information flow
during tissue development, maintenance, regeneration, and aging, especially in
epithelia. Genotypically aberrant epithelial cells can selectively suppress
malignant behavior when part of a phenotypically normal structure -- which
implies that somehow the cells understand they are part of a normal structure.
How such structural information is stored and communicated between cells could
prove an important lens on the health and disease of such cellular communities.
