The Friday Harbor Laboratories (FHL) is a marine biological field station of
the University of Washington located in the San Juan Islands at the junction
between Juan de Fuca and Georgia Straits. There is an unusual richness of marine
life in the region attracting scientists in widely divergent fields from
national and international universities and research institutions. Topics of
research range from molecular and cell biology along a scale of increasing
spatial dimensions to community ecology. Zoologists, fisheries biologists,
oceanographers, botanists, paleobiologists, and researchers from various
biomedical fields are frequent users. Highest priority is given to maintaining a
suitable environment(instrumentation, field biological resources, logistical
support, housing) for research involving marine organisms. Over 90% of the FHL
operating and capital budget is provided by the State of Washington although
over 2/3 of the scientific people whose work is supported by FHL are from
institutions outside the State of Washington. This will support a 2,700 sq. ft.
laboratory for modern biochemical and molecular research.
