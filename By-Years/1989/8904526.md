The recognition of Megatracksites covering hundreds or even thousands of square
kilometers is unprecedented in the history of paleoenvironmental research.
Preliminary indications suggest that they are intimately related to
unconformities and can be tied to sea-level fluctuations. This research will
focus on careful analysis of at least two of the three megatracksites currently
known in the western USA. Continued analysis of a large number of less extensive
tracksites will reveal if any belong to megatracksite complexes or can be
explained in terms of similar depositional/paleoenvironmental controls. Data
acquisition at all sites will be used to expand a comprehensive catalog and
furnish statistically sound census data. Because trackways are so good in the
Colorado Plateau region, they will, if systematically analysed, serve as
excellent models for dinosaur trackways research in other regions worldwide.
