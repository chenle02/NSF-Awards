9531086 Rock This is an award to support conduct of a conference to address
issues of importance to the education of environmental engineers, a significant
component of which involves conduct of research by university faculty with the
assistance of students primarily at the graduate level. Session content
addresses issues of importance in preparing graduates for environmental
engineering practice. Sessions scheduled include consideration of the attributes
expected of program graduates in terms the market for their services,
educational approaches and curricula for meeting practitioner perceptions and
needs, roles of practitioners in enhancing the content of curricula and the role
of practitioners in influencing innovations in education of engineers for
environmental engineering practice. The conference will be conducted at the
University of Maine from August 3-6, 1996 by the Association of Environmental
Engineering Professors under auspices of the University of Maine in joint
sponsorship with the American Academy of Environmental Engineers. Results are
expected to be used for program planning.
