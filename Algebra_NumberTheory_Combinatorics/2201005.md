Algebraic geometry has found increasing applications to problems arising in the
sciences and engineering. This was recognized in the establishment of the
Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) Activity Group in
Algebraic Geometry, SIAM biennial conferences, and in the SIAM Journal on
Applied Algebra and Geometry. In this project the PI will pursue research and
training activities that will extend and deepen the role of algebraic geometry
in applications, including mathematical physics. He will also engage in
mathematical outreach activities at his institution, nationally, and
internationally. This project will provide research training opportunities for
students.

In more detail, in this project the PI will apply methods from combinatorial
algebraic geometry to problems in spectral theory from Mathematical Physics. The
spectrum of a discrete periodic operator is a real algebraic hypersurface in an
arithmetic toric variety, and many open questions in this area are amenable to
ideas from algebraic geometry. The PI will also work towards classifying the
Galois groups and the inverse Galois problem in enumerative geometry. To that
end, the PI will develop tools, both computational and theoretical, for
exploiting and studying Galois theory in applications.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
