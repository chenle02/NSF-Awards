This project is equipping a laboratory that can be used for an interdisciplinary
course in mathematics that meets the needs of students in the business and
social science programs at the college. The course is precisely bringing a
scientific context and perspective into a course alternative to college algebra
for business and social science majors. It is providing the requisite
mathematical background for the analysis and modeling of experimental data, is
offering a significant laboratory science component in which students collect
data to be analyzed, and is teaching the development of basic science laws. This
course is providing an avenue to ensure that non-science-majors have the
requisite data analysis skills and basic science knowledge to enable them to be
competitive in their careers.
