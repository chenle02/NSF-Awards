The goal of this project is to improve the teaching of biomechanics in
undergraduate physical education courses, and to improve the quality of
independent studies completed by undergraduate physical education students. The
grant assisted in purchasing a Video Analysis System that allows the
quantitative kinematic analysis of movement, and the graphical presentation of
data superimposed over a video image of skill performance. Classroom instruction
is being improved by the system since mechanical principles such as the work-
energy relationship can be graphically presented in relation to skill
acquisition, pathological movement patterns, injury mechanisms, and errors in
skill performance. The video system supplements existing laboratory equipment
for the measurement of force and muscle activity, and it allows undergraduate
students to conduct independent projects quantifying both kinematic (movement
patterns) and kinetic (forces affecting movement) aspects of human movement.
