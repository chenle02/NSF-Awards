The investigator proposes to pursue two lines of research on which he has done
some work. The first line of research is to investigate the conditions under
which the incentive effects of private information are ameliorated by large
numbers of economic agents and when markets may perform well in these
circumstances. The second line of research is to develop and analyze methods in
which there is an interrelationship between economic decisions and social
aspects of an environment. In such models we may expect rational economic agents
to care about their relative position in society. This concern may result in
qualitatively different predictions from those generated from models ignoring
these social aspects of the environment. This project is important because it
would improve our understanding concerning how differing conventions for making
non-market decisions interact with market decisions.
