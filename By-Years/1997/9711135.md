Abstract - Zhang The proposed work is to develop a model to simulate columnar
solidification. The model will incorporate mathematical descriptions of
macroscopic transport phenomena and microscopic development. The transport
equations composed of the mass, momentum, and energy equations will be solved at
both the macroscopic and microscopic levels subject to appropriate kinetic
constrains. A microscopic cellular model, which takes into account melt
undercooliing and non-equilibrium kinetics will be developed to predict the
shape, size, and spacing of cells. A numerical method that employs grid
clustering and migration will be used to track the solidification front.
Experiments for Bridgman solidification and single droplet solidification will
be conducted under both transient and steady-state conditions. Measurements of
the micro-structural characteristics will be compared with predicted results.
