This project funds the development of computer-assisted, investigative exercises
for improvement of undergraduate laboratory classes in General Biology, Cell
Biology, and Human Physiology. The project includes three principal objectives:
(1) modify several laboratory activities to follow an investigative rather than
a cookbook type of approach; (2) purchase additional data acquisition systems
that enable us to conduct computer-assisted investigative laboratory activities
on a larger, more practical scale; (3) develop or purchase tutorial materials
for prelaboratory instruction accessible to the students by way of computers in
the Life Science Computer Learning Center. Recent experience in this department
with Macintosh-based data acquisition systems in undergraduate Human Physiology
classes have demonstrated the value of computer-assisted activities for
augmenting an investigative approach in laboratory classes. Computer-based data
acquisition reduces the time required to perform the laboratory exercises and
thereby permits dedication of more of the laboratory period to developing
hypotheses, predicting outcomes, devising alternative test conditions, and
pursuing other aspects of the investigative approach. This places greater focus
on the process of science and motivates student interest in laboratory classes.
