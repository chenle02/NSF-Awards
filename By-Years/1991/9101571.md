This project is an international collaboration between US, Canadian and USSR
scientists focusing on the effects of Russian expansion into the Siberian taiga
on a group of reindeer herders, the Evenks. The recent expansion of the trans-
Siberian railroad has had major ecological effects on these people, including
the introduction of a number of diseases, nutritional changes and the economic
buildup of the areas around the tracks. The two-year research program will
consist of field work in the Surrinda village of the Baikit region of the
Central Siberian Plateau. Subsistence ecology, demographic analysis, activity
patterns, genetics, health and nutritional status will be assessed from a sample
of the Evenks. The project will provide baseline data on the ecology and human
genetics of a Siberian indigenous population, may contribute to our
understanding of the peopling of the New World, and will provide a better
understanding of the effects of technology and westernization on small,
indigenous populations of reindeer herders. Such information will help
administrators concerned with economic development to make more enlightened
decisions.
