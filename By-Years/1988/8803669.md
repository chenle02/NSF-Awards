The proposed continuation of global and regional studies of earthquake source
mechanism using waveforem inversion will cover the following topics: 1.
Continuation of the centroid-moment tensor (CMT) analysis of current events
using GDSN, and other - as available - data, with the results sent to the USGS
on a monthly basis and submitted quarterly for publication in the Physics of the
Earth and Planetary Interiors. 2. Utilization of the data from the High-Gain
Long-Period (HGLP) network operating between 1972 and 1976; this was the first
global digital network and little use has been made of it; will determine
station responses and sensitivities; permanent storage on the optical media
(WORM type discs); 3. CMT and very broad bank (VBB) analysis of the HGLP data
for selected events between 1972 and 1976; this period is characterized by many
large earthquakes lacking, so far, proper analysis; 4. Systematic search for
events with a statistically significant non-double couple component; it is
highly likely that there are events which have an unusual source mechanism: two
events near Torishima Island, south of Japan and three events on Iceland have
mechanism that appear to be consistent with being caused by magma injection. ***
