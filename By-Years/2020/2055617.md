The goal of the project is to develop further the mathematical tools needed in
the study of fundamental questions in nonlinear partial differential equations,
calculus of variations, and free boundary problems. These questions have their
origins in the applied sciences like elasticity, fluid mechanics, or cost
optimization, and are relevant in areas of pure mathematics like geometry. The
theoretical aspects of these models are important towards a better understanding
of basic physical phenomena and could be useful for the larger scientific
community. The project provides research training opportunities for students and
its outcomes will be broadly disseminated to diverse audiences.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator (PI) will study
several questions related to the classical obstacle problem. One of them
concerns the multiple membrane problem, which describes the interaction of N
elastic membranes in contact with each other. Mathematically, it can be viewed
as a coupled system of obstacle problems with N-1 interacting free boundaries.
Another question to be addressed deals with the uniqueness of certain blow-up
cones for the thin obstacle problem, also known as the Signorini problem. An
important part of the project considers the optimal transportation problem for
quadratic costs with densities that vanish on the boundary of their support.
This problem is equivalent to the second boundary value problem for a highly
degenerate Monge-Amp√®re equation. The PI also aims to understand the interior
regularity of minimizing maps in the calculus of variations for one of the
simplest polyconvex energies in two dimensions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
