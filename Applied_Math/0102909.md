DMS 0102909 PI: Thaleia Zariphopoulou

In most market models, the classical assumption of a perfect market is not
satisfied. The PI proposes to continue her research program to develop methods
to study valuation problems in incomplete markets, concetrated in the following
class of applications: i) optimal asset allocation under market frictions the
goal being to derive and analyze the optimal risky demand and to represent the
value function in terms of distorted measures, ii) valuation of derivatives
written on nontraded assets with the goal to use utility-based pricing
methodology to specify the hedging strategies and to expole their role in risk
aggregation, iii) dynamic hedging of volatility risks the goal being to specify
the arbitrage-free components of the implied volatility process and to study
their implications to the dynamic management of volatility risks, and iv) asset
valuation under irreversible decisions with the goals being to evaluate early
exercise instruments under constraints related to irreversible decisions and to
analyze the impact of irreversibilities to prices and optimal demand. The
technical tools come from stochastic analysis, stochastic control and nonlinear
partial differential equations.

In most market settings, the classical assumption of market completeness is not
satisfied and, therefore, the traditional approach of perfect replication cannot
be applied. It becomes hence necessary to review the pricing and risk management
concepts. The first step is the development of a unified framework to analyze
the inherent market risks, and identify the components that can be hedged away
and the ones that cannot. The second step is the establishment of a coherent
method to price the unhedgeable risks in order to achieve effective risk
management. The PI proposes to continue her work in market models with frictions
along the aforementioned two general directions. The proposed methodologies rely
heavily on the classical economic principles of utility theory which reflect the
investors' preferences towards the risks that cannot be eliminated. Among
others, the PI proposes to study models of asset allocation, derivative pricing
and risk management under various market frictions including stochastic
volatility, nontraded assets and irreversible management policies.
