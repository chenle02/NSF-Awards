In Invariant Theory, one studies algebraic expressions which remain the same
under spatial symmetries. Such algebraic expressions are called invariants. For
example, the distance to the origin does not change under the rotation of the
plane around the origin. The distance to the origin is an invariant. The PI will
study a new approach to classical invariant theory. In collaboration with
mathematicians and engineers at UIUC, the PI will study applications of theory
of subspace arrangements to computer vision and image
compression.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will work on various other topics in
commutative algebra, algebraic combinatorics, number theory. Cluster algebras
were introduced by Fomin and Zelevinsky. These algebras have deep connections
with the theory of quiver representations. The PI will explore this further in
collaboration with Weyman and Zelevinsky. To a matroid or polymatroid one can
associate various quasi-symmetric functions. The PI will study universal
properties of such invariants.The PI will collaborate with Masser to find an
effective version of the Mordell-Lang problem in positive characteristic.
