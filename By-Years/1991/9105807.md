The major goal of this research is to investigate the role of stimulus-induced
intracellular potential changes in the coordination of plant responses to
gravity. The principal investigator has shown that gravistimulation induces
rapid membrane hyperpolarization along the upper side and depolarization along
the lower side of the elongation zone of bean roots. This indicates ether that
cells in this region detect gravity directly or that there is very rapid signal
transmission from the putative gravity-detecting region at the root tip. These
alternatives will be tested by investigating electrical changes in 1) other
species, 2) roots from which the caps have been removed, and 3) roots of mutants
with impaired communication between the cap and the elongation zone. These
experiments will be coupled with computer- based analysis of growth rate
distribution and curvature development during the response in order to establish
a link between electrical perturbations, signal transmission and growth
modifications. These studies would improve our understanding of the interaction
of plants with their environments, and may enhance jour ability of modify or
control plant growth. //
