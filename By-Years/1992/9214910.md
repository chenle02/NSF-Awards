This research will investigate a new method of material modeling based on the
use of neural networks. This approach is different from the conventional methods
that are based on the construction of relatively simple mathematical models and
the use of classical parameter identification techniques. By contrast, in neural
network modeling the knowledge of the material behavior is captured directly
from observed experimental behavior and is encoded within the connections of a
learning, self-organizing neural network.
