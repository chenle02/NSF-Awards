Two areas which need further enhancement in the parallel computing effort of
the National Center for Supercomputer Applications are the creation of a
balanced hardware environment that will facilitate greater user access and
system throughput, and consulting support for the migration of users to the
newly acquired Connection Machine. This award will provide hardware to increase
the communication bandwith, and also allow a greater number of users to access
the machine. It also provides for staff/consultants who can assist users.
