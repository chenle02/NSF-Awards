The PI is continuing his work in the categorical foundations of the theory of
computation. This work is based on recent technical advances involving topos-
theoretical models of computation. Special emphasis is being placed on exposing
the intrinsic functorial semantics of these models, the creation of new topos
models, and the continued refinement of a synthetic theory of computation.
Applications include classification and characterization of higher type
functionals and new approaches to computable analysis and effective semantics.
The problems proposed are important ones lying at the interface between category
theory and computation theory. There is a renewed interest, both in the U.S. and
internationally, in the use of category theory in the foundations of
computation. This modest grant will indicate the appropriation of certain
categorical tools for the explication of the foundations of computation.
