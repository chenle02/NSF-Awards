The project will deal with the processing and fabrication of superconducting
ceramic materials. The main objective of the research is to prepare yttrium-
barium-copper oxides in bulk, sheet, and fiber shapes. To accomplish this, both
molten salts and high- quality sinterable ceramic powders of proper cation ratio
will be used as starting materials. Powders will be synthesized in the
laboratory from aqueous cation solutions by using homogeneous precipitation and
emulsion precipitation techniques. Molten salts will be prepared from barium
hydroxide, copper nitrate, and yttrium hydroxide salts. The influence of
individual processing steps on the characteristics of the material synthesized
and on the overall performance of the component as a superconducting device will
be investigated. A significant level of cooperation with USDOE Ames Laboratory
scientists will be an integral part of the program.
