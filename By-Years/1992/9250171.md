The aim of this project is to establish eight computer-based physiologically
oriented instrumentation systems in the laboratory section of introductory
biology courses (both major and non-major oriented). Laboratory exercises are
designed to foster understanding of the scientific method and encourage critical
thinking. Students are guided to consider accuracy, sensitivity and precision
when using the equipment. Experiments to be performed include such student
controlled exercises as a comparison of changes in student resting and
exercising heart rates among smokers and non-smokers, and males and
females.***//
