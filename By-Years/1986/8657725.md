This Presidential Young Investigator award will fund research on methodologies
for real-time expert rule-based adaptive control of machinery (in contrast with
conventional mathematical model-based control). The initial focus of the
research will be on application of the fuzzy-learning adaptive control (FLAC)
technique to precision motion systems. Ultimately, through combining elements of
mechanical design, VLSI electronics, and machine intelligence, the goal is to
realize a new generation of "smart" actuators and mechanisms for manufacturing
automation and space applications.
