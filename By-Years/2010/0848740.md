This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project focuses on the
research and development of a novel voice authentication security system which
combines speech verification with speaker verification. As a basis for
authentication, the proposed system generates a one-time pass-phrase which users
are challenged to respond to immediately. Following the challenge, the dual
verification engine verifies that the response is the required pass-phrase and
that it is associated with the person articulating the pass-phrase. The proposed
system addresses the vulnerabilities of previous voice authentication systems
associated with 'ear shot' surfing, eavesdropping and theft. The proposal offers
a solution for identity theft threats where personal information cannot be said
aloud and further addresses password systems limitations. The proposed project
will develop and construct a system which expands the voice capabilities to
include a wider selection of users, channels and types of speech. The system
will expand pass-phrase generation to support large customers and its passphrase
'topic selection' privacy feature. Additionally, the system will automatically
enroll users over multiple calls overcoming previous limitations due to
inadequate speech across channels.

The outcomes of the proposed project include secure authentication through
speech via the widely growing number of speech recognition applications, voice
channels and converged platforms. As more individuals use their voice on a
variety of devices and networks such as VoIP or cellular, real-time, speech
applications will benefit from the proposed method. The proposed speech security
system method may also be the choice for those with visual or other applicable
handicaps. Because of the continuous rise of security breaches and related
identity theft, the outcomes of this project should significantly impact society
by providing a robust security option for speech-enabled user interfaces.
