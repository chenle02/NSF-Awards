This proposal involves the study of the state resolved kinetics of the
vibrational relaxation of O2 and NO. The PI postulates that the breakdown of the
local thermodynamic equilibrium assumption in regard to the vibrational
distributions of O2 and NO in the stratosphere necessitates state specific
laboratory studies in order to fully understand ozone formation and destruction.
The P.I. will clarify the importance of Slanger's ozone formation mechanism via
quantitative measurements of the relaxation of vibrational states in O2 using a
tunable Argon fluoride laser to access high vibrational levels. Noting the
importance of NO as a stratospheric catalyst of ozone destruction, the PI will
also investigate the initial vibrational excitation of NO resulting from
reaction of NO2 with O(3P) and to perform state-to-state studies of vibrational
relaxation at high total energies.
