Establishing the primary body axis is fundamental to animal development. This
research project builds on the discovery of a novel gene, termed panish, that
establishes head to tail polarity and anterior body plan of a mosquito-related
midge, Chironomus riparius. Prior to this work, the only factor known to fulfill
this role in insects was the homeobox gene bicoid, discovered in Drosophila
nearly 30 years ago. Bicoid is now firmly established as a fundamental model for
molecular gradients and embryo patterning. Surprisingly, most insects lack
bicoid and a major question in the field is how other insects establish head-to-
tail polarity during embryonic development. Preliminary phylogenetic and genomic
studies indicate that global body plan organizers such as bicoid and panish
evolved independently multiple--perhaps even many times within the group of
flies. The proposed research will test this hypothesis using high-throughput
sequencing technology and will characterize experimentally the molecular nature
of the panish gene product. The expected results will help to understand a
fundamental mechanism of animal development in its evolutionary context. The
project also provides training opportunities and is tied to a joint research
project with a local high school that was initiated in 2011. In this
collaboration ninth and tenth graders, under the supervision of two
collaborating high school teachers with entomological expertise, seek to develop
culture techniques for a specific fly species that may provide important
information on the evolution of primary embryonic axis determinants in flies.
The collaborating high school teachers incorporated the project into their
curriculum to teach scientific methodology. Additional science-education
outreach tied to this project specifically targets underrepresented groups.
