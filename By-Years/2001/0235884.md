Aquatic ecosystems are threatened by over enrichment with nitrogen (N) and
phosphorus (P). For unclear reasons, P enrichment generally has the greatest
impact in freshwater while N enrichment has the greatest impact in saltwater.
The goal of this study is to understand how the biogeochemistry of N and P
change along the transition from freshwater to saltwater in an estuary. The
project will measure inputs and removals of N and P along the salinity
transition of the Patuxent River estuary, investigate the importance of
watershed-derived particulate P, and test hypotheses about interactions of N, P,
iron and sulfur cycles. Transformations and releases of N and P will be measured
by incubating sediment cores from along the salinity gradient. The mechanisms of
salinity effects will be investigated by experimentally altering concentrations
of seawater, sea salts, sulfate, and nitrate over incubated cores. The results
will help guide nutrient management in coastal ecosystems. This is a
collaborative project with Jeffrey Cornwell (DEB-0212636)
