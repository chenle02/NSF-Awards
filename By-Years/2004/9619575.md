AST-9619575 Bennett A Search for Extra-Solar Planets via Gravitational
Microlensing. There is great astronomical interest in the goal of finding and
characterizing planetary systems orbiting other stars. Dr. David Bennett and
colleagues will put into place an observational program to discover planets
orbiting other stars by means of gravitational microlensing. He will follow-up
on microlensing events initially discovered through surveys conducted by other
teams of observers. Principal observational facilities for this project are in
South Africa, and Dr. Bennett is collaborating with South African astronomers to
get the telescope properly instrumented and operational for this research
effort. The Division of International Programs at NSF is assisting on this award
by providing travel funds.
