Arthur Lewbel Brandeis University SBR-9514977 The research will attempt to solve
many of the problems associated with estimating consumer demand. Included in the
research will be an attempt to separate out the effect of changing prices when
most prices move in parallel, a refinement for combining information from
national consumption trends with information for some years on individuals'
consumption, better methods for estimating expenditures on individual goods,
particularly when some goods are bought infrequently (i.e. automobiles), and
modeling of intrahousehold consumption decisions and behaviors. Sophisticated
econometric techniques will be used in this research.
