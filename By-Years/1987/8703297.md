The aims of the proposal are to investigate the sequence of events involved in
the early stages of nodule development using specific Rhizobium mutants that
induce the formation of nodules on alfalfa roots which are arrested at distinct
stages of their development. The PI hypothesizes that infection thread formation
is the second signal for nodulin gene expression, and that the nod and exo genes
interact in the early stages of nodule formation. Dr. Hirsch is proposing a
multi-faceted approach utilizing techniques of plant tissue culture, genetics,
molecular biology and electron microscopy. Both bacterial genes and plant genes
are involved in the formation of a nitrogen fixing root nodule. Understanding
the roles of these different genes in nodulation is essential if we are to
transfer the nitrogen fixing capability into nonleguminous plants.
