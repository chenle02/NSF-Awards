This project aims at solving a number of algorithmic and
architectural&lt;br/&gt;problems that will enable tabled logic programming
engines, such as XSB&lt;br/&gt;(http://xsb.sourceforge.net), to become viable
platforms for supporting the&lt;br/&gt;emerging infrastructure for the Semantic
Web. The project will address the&lt;br/&gt;following
issues:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Design of algorithms for solving a long-standing
problem of&lt;br/&gt; inconsistency between tabling and update
operations.&lt;br/&gt;2. Designing an architecture for supporting explanation-
based reasoning&lt;br/&gt; at the engine level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Developing
low-overhead algorithms for allowing tabled query answers to
be&lt;br/&gt;correctly updated when changes occur to the underlying predicates
is of&lt;br/&gt;critical importance in applications that require tabling and at
the same&lt;br/&gt;time frequently modify the data underlying those tables (such
as workflow&lt;br/&gt;schedulers, verification algorithms, database queries,
CASE tools).&lt;br/&gt;Explanation based reasoning is important for debugging
and verification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will develop a new
technology, which will allow tabling logic&lt;br/&gt;engines to provide
inference services for the Semantic Web. Logic&lt;br/&gt;inference engines are
expected to become a crucial part of the Semantic Web&lt;br/&gt;infrastructure.
Once in place, the Semantic Web will enable a host of&lt;br/&gt;applications in
information retrieval and Web services, which will become&lt;br/&gt;inseparable
part of people's daily life.&lt;br/&gt;
