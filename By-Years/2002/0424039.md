Today's power conversion circuits are based on the two conventional topologies:
voltage-source and current-source, a "two-leg" structure supporting all existing
power conversion circuits. The conventional voltage-source (V-source) and
current-source (I-source) converters have their theoretical limitations that
prevent economical and efficient solutions to many applications. For example,
the V-source inverter is a buck converter that cannot produce an output voltage
greater than the source voltage. This limitation often requires an additional
dc-dc boost converter for many applications such as batteries, photovoltaic, and
fuel cells, which makes the power conversion have much lower efficiency, larger
size, and higher cost.&lt;br/&gt; In this project, we investigate a new type of
power conversion circuits, an impedance-source (Z-source) power converter that
was proposed two years ago with the intent to overcome the problems associated
with the conventional V- and I-source converters.&lt;br/&gt;This research
project is to extend and apply the Z-source topology to the entire circuit
spectrum (categories) of power electronics, including dc-to-ac, ac-to-dc, ac-to-
ac, and dc-to-dc power conversion and to develop their control theory. With the
successful extension and application of the Z-source concept to all power
conversion categories, a "third leg" will be established. This "third leg" will
change the entire spectrum of power electronics circuits and provide a third
option to optimize performance, maximize efficiency, and minimize cost and
size.&lt;br/&gt;
