9355756 Johnson The proposed study seeks to provide important information on the
effectiveness of high school and college level assessments in facilitating
students' achievement, and in developing positive attitudes toward mathematics
and science in predominantly African American populations, The study will gather
information on the thinking and problem solving processes used by students
during performance assessments, as well as the degree to which the experience of
participating in a performance assessment was positive. The study will validate
performance assessments in terms of appropriateness of the measures, their
alignment with the curriculum and pedagogy, and their achievement of the
intended purpose.
