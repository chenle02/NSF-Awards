Transition metal complexes in which two or more metal atoms are linked by
various aryldiimido bridging bridging groups will be synthesized and studied.
These bridging groups have the important advantage that electronic communication
in a new domain of high oxidation state metal complexes can be systematically
examined. First homo- and then heterometallic dimeric systems will be studied to
probe the fundamental chemistry of the linked transition metal fragments and to
identify perturbations caused by the introduction of the heterometal-imido unit,
respectively. In the final stage of the project the chemistry of multimetallic
systems, i.e., polymers with aryldiimido linkages, will be investigated.
Electrochemical, spectroelectrochemical, variable-temperature magnetic, and
diffraction studies will be performed in collaboration with workers at other
instututions. %%% In this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and
Organometallic Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Eric A. Maatta of Kansas
State University will synthesize and characterize complexes of early transition
metals, in high oxidation states, that are bridged or held together by
aryldiimido ligands. These compounds will include a variety of polymeric
materials that may have very useful properties as conductors.
