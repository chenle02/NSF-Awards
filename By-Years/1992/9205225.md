The Department of Statistics at Yale University will purchase workstations and
peripherals that will be dedicated to support research in the mathematical
sciences. The research to be supported lies in: 1. Product partition models for
evaluating and selecting classifications; 2. Theory of empirical processes, with
applications to econometrics and semiparametric models 3. Mixture models, the
development of graphical diagnostics and formal tests for identifying the
presence of mixing in generalized linear models, and for determining the numbers
of components of finite mixtures; 4. Probabilistic models for molecular
evolution, including alternatives to the traditional branching tree.
