Floss 9604888 This award supports a three-year collaborative research project
between Dr. Heinz Floss of the University of Washington and Dr. Yu Sam Kim of
Yonsei University in Seoul, Korea on "Stereochemical Studies of Malonate
Metabolism." The goals of the project are 1) to determine the stereochemical
course of malonate decarboxylation by the malonate decarboxylases from selected
species and 2) to determine the stereospecificities, if any, of methylmalonate
activation. Dr. Kim's research group in Korea has a long-standing interest in
the metabolism and physiological role of malonate and its derivatives in plants
and microorganisms and has done extensive research on this subject. Dr. Heinz'
research group has extensive experience in the stereochemical analysis of
enzyme-catalyzed reactions and has developed methods for the analysis of
reactions involving malonate as substrate. This project will bring these
research groups together to study the steric course of a number of enzyme
reactions involving transformations of malonate or its derivatives. The study
should lead to improved understanding of enzyme reaction mechanisms. ***
