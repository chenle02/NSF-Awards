9601357 Arjomand This project investigates the long-term processes of sociolegal
change set in motion by the meeting of the Western and the Islamic legal and
political regimes. It offers analytical descriptions and a typological
classification of the forms of law and political organization in the Islamic
Middle East before the impact of modern constitutionalism. It then focuses on
the legal consequences of modernizing change and the undermining of
constitutionalism in the legal and political traditions of the Islamic Middle
East that resulted from these changes. Public and constitutional law will be
considered the critical link between political organization and the legal
system. The modernizers' attempts at rational political reconstruction and legal
reform invoked support, resistance and counter-proposals among different social
forces and vested institutional interests which engaged in a political struggle
that determined constitutional change at decisive turning points. The method for
this study is comparative, and uses a historically circumscribed typology to
account for the variations, in time and across countries, of the constitutional
outcomes and political regimes in the Islamic Middle East.
