Recent years have witnessed the rise of Internet of Things (IoT), a newly
emergent networking paradigm that connects humans and the physical world through
ubiquitous sensing, computing, and communicating devices. With the ultimate goal
of building reliable, robust, and secure IoT systems that are usually composed
of multitudes of unreliable wireless devices - sometimes even carried by
malicious users - this project develops TRIP, a 3-in-1 integrated framework of
TRuth discovery, Incentive, and Privacy preserving mechanisms for IoT systems.
This framework consists of 1) a truth discovery mechanism that can distill true
information from the deluge of sensory data generated by the ubiquitous IoT
devices, 2) a security and privacy mechanism that can not only protect user
privacy but also defend against malicious attack, and 3) an incentive mechanism
that can select reliable participants in order to maximize the quality of
collected information. The successful completion of this project, which for the
first time systematically investigates an integrated design of IoT systems, will
facilitate not only a whole spectrum of applications that have significant
natural and societal impact, but also various curriculum development and
outreach activities that can benefit a large group of students, especially the
female and minority students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to realize the
proposed TRIP system, this project addresses a series of important research
challenges. First, to infer truth information from the noisy and sparse sensory
data collected by human-carried IoT devices, this project delivers a novel truth
discovery method that can capture the variety in the reliability of different
users as well as the correlations among the objects. Second, this project
investigates not only privacy preserving mechanisms that allow the server to
conduct truth discovery operations without knowing the genuine values of user
observations, but also security solutions that defend against malicious users
who try to inject false information for the purpose of sabotage or financial
rewards. Third, an effective incentive mechanism is developed to motivate
reliable users to contribute to the IoT tasks. Finally, the above mechanisms are
seamlessly integrated into networked IoT systems in a distributed and parallel
manner, and evaluated on real testbeds in order to validate the effectiveness,
efficiency, and the practicality of the proposed research.
