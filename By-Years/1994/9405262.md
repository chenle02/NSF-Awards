94-05262 Williams The five participating universities in the Southern
California region, in cooperation with the California Engineering Foundation,
the California Manufacturing Technology Center, and the Los Angeles County
Economic Development Corporation, will form the Southern California Coalition
for Education in Manufacturing Engineering to develop outstanding, well-
integrated, practice-oriented, ABET-accredited undergraduate programs in
manufacturing engineering in this area containing a high concentration of
manufacturing industries. The program is expected to play a significant role in
the reindustrialization of the Los Angeles area. The Coalition will focus on the
long-term, systemic reform of undergraduate manufacturing engineering education
across the curricula, enhancing existing manufacturing-related baccalaureate
degree programs and creating new degree programs and degree options related to
manufacturing that emphasize this integrated approach focusing on Integrated
Product Development. These efforts will include curricula modernization,
developing closer ties with industry, exchanges of instructors, utilization of
active professionals working in industry to teach classes, use of industry
facilities, university/industry team teaching, and promoting knowledge transfer
from industry to academia and greater awareness of manufacturing engineering as
a challenging discipline. These program will emphasize quality as a key element
in the conduct and administration of the academic program and quality concepts
integrated throughout the curricula. ***
