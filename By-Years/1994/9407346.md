9407346 Allen This is a Research Planning Grant. The proposed research to be
conducted during the planning period is the cloning, overexpression and
crystallization of the enzyme proline racemase. The research following the
proposed planning period is the determination of the structure of proline
racemase by X-ray crystallography in the native state and in the presence of
substrates, substrate analogs and transition state analogs. Proline racemase has
been shown to induce strain/destabilization of substrate, one of four mechanisms
by which enzymes bring about rate accelarations. The induced strain is relieved
in the enzyme-transition state complex. Of the modes of catalysis, the least
understood is strain/destabilization since it is difficult to devise experiments
for its evaluation. The comparison of the X-ray crystal structures of the
enzyme-substrate and enzyme- transition state analog complexes of proline
racemase will allow direct observation of the structural and chemical means by
which this enzyme achieves strain/destabilization of the substrate. %%% There
are few cases in which enzymes have been proven to undergo
strain/destabilization in the enzyme-substrate complex. Proline racemase is the
sole example in which transition state and substrate analogs exist and which is
amenable to study by X-ray crystallography. The structure of these complexes
will provide the basis by which we can understand the strain/destabilization
mode of catalysis. ***
