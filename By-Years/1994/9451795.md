9451795 Lion A laboratory has been developed to support hands-on student
experimentation with current aspects of environmental engineering. The focus is
on providing a context for the use of modern analytical tools and
instrumentation by addressing current environmental problem areas such as:
assessment and remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater; lake
acidification; oxygen sag; biological wastewater treatment; removal of mixed
wastes from soil; water removal from sludge; biodegradation in landfills; and
pollutant mixing in river flow. Laboratory exercises reflect recent and ongoing
research of the Cornell faculty in Environmental Engineering. This focus on
current environmental problems, facilitated with modern analytical tools, allows
participating students to experience the excitement and challenge of a
dynamically evolving field.
