The University of the Virgin Islands, a historically black university, requests
support from NSF for connection of its campus network to NSFNET. The connection
would be made from UVI to the organization supporting connectivity to the
University of Puerto Rico and from there to SURAnet, the midlevel network
located in this region that will provide operations and network information
services. The award will support a 56 thousand bits per second connection from
the University of the Virgin Islands to the University of Puerto Rico. The
University will benefit from the greater functionality and network speed
available through this connection to be able to access supercomputers,
libraries, and make file transfers along with being able to implement a more
reliable mail system. Students, instructors, and faculty researchers will
benefit from the link. This is also a unique opportunity for the school to
explore innovative educational resources.***
