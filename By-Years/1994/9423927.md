Professor Donald Truhlar is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry to continue his research in theoretical and
computational chemical dynamics and energetics. He will continue his research in
the following areas: 1) Development of improved methodologies for treating
quantum reactive scattering; 2) Continued work on diatom-diatom systems
including HF-HF and H2-H2 systems; 3) Work on solvation models for nonaqueous
solvents, and their application to variational transition state treatments of
reactions in solution; 4) Dynamics of reactions at metallic surfaces; and 5)
Development of new techniques and parallel Monte Carlo path integral algorithms
for treatment of vibrational energies, vibrational partition functions and free
energies. Truhlar's research is aimed at a basic molecular level understanding
of chemical dynamics and solvation. This research has important strategic
implications in areas of atmospheric and environmental chemistry
