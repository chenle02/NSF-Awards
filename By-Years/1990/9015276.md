The research proposed is concerned with probabilistic concepts arising in the
theory of computation on the one hand, and its effect on the understanding of
the nature of randomness on the other. The theory of problems with intractable
random instances is more subtle than similar worst-case theories. Constructive
expanders, coding theory, and other combinatorial and algebraic techniques must
be used. An important use of hard-on-average problems is the generation of
pseudo-random strings. In contrast, worst-case negative results rarely have
applications, while worst-case positive results are hopeless for many easy-on
average problems.
