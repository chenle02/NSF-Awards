*** 9703613 Lewis Chen Schmidt This award provides funding for the conduct of a
three-year open workshop on decision- based design. The workshop will be
conducted via a series of face-to-face meetings, conducted three times per year,
and with continuing interaction between all interested parties via electronic
and Internet technologies throughout the three-year period. Specifically, the
workshop will include the development of a Web Page. A primary component of the
workshop will be the continual, open development and dissemination of the
philosophical, theoretical, and practical results of the workshop discussions
and activities. The workshop will concentrate on a diversity of research efforts
directed at the development of a theory of engineering design based on the
emerging notion that engineering design is a process of decision making that is
amenable to the myriad of tools and theories that have been developed in the
field of decision theory over the past 200 years. If successful, this workshop
will provide a new direction for research and education in engineering design.
New theoretical concepts should lead to approaches to engineering design that
will enable the design of better products: products that appeal more to their
respective markets, cost less, have lower environmental impact, and which are
more friendly for consumers in particular and society at large. These concepts
are likely to lead to entirely new approaches to engineering education, with a
new focus on engineering design as a process of decision making. ***
