The objective of this project is to support increased participation of US
graduate students, postdoctoral associates and junior tenure-track faculty
members at the 9th International Workshop on Micro and Nanotechnology for Power
Generation and Energy Conversion Applications. This workshop provides a highly
interactive forum for researchers to present and discuss recent innovations in
micro and nanotechnology for power generation and energy conversion
applications. The scope ranges from integrated microsystems for power
generation, dissipation, harvesting, and management to novel nanostructures and
materials for energy-related applications. The support provided through this
project serves to defray the costs for junior researchers (students, postdocs,
and junior faculty members) to attend the workshop to present their work and
learn more about the economically and environmentally vital field of high power
microsystems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attending meetings to present their work and
learn more about the broader context of their field is a key educational
experience for students and postdocs everywhere, and indeed for junior faculty.
These new researchers are also the future of this field, and the
interdisciplinary connections fostered by this workshop are the basis for the
field's future progress. Without travel support, students, postdocs and new
faculty are less likely to be able to attend this workshop and take advantage of
this educational opportunity, and travel support may encourage many to attend.
To encourage increased and diverse participation, news of the workshop has been
disseminated broadly through print media, web presence, direct emails to past
participants, and direct outreach to interested individuals and groups,
including underrepresented minorities and women.
