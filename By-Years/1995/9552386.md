A Molecular Modeling Laboratory is being established to introduce undergraduate
science students to the extremely important area of computational chemistry.
Students use the laboratory for class-related studies and in undergraduate
research. Instruction of the basic principles of biological, organic, inorganic,
and physical chemistry are substantially improved through the calculation and
visualization of 3-D structure, molecular orbitals, protein dynamics, enzyme
substrate binding, reaction pathways, vibrational spectra, and more. Whenever
possible, calculations from the laboratory are used to address questions arising
from measurements the students make in the experimental laboratories. Senior
thesis students in the chemistry, biochemistry, and molecular biology programs
use these powerful computational methods and visualization techniques to
understand and interpret their research results. In both course-related studies
and undergraduate research, the laboratory enhances the students' understanding
of basic chemical principles as well as introduces them to modern computational
methods routinely used in graduate school and industry.
