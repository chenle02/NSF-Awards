DMS-0104325 Craig Guilbault

This award provides partial support for active research mathematicians with
limited means of support to attend and participate in the Eighteenth,
Nineteenth, and Twentieth Annual Workshops in Geometric Topology to be held in
the summers of 2001, 2002, and 2003. The workshops will be hosted by Oregon
State University in the 2001, Calvin College in 2002, and Brigham Young
University in 2003. The 2001 Workship will feature Princial Speaker Abigail
Thompson of the University of California, Davis who will deliver three one hour
lectures. Similarly, the 2002 and 2003 Workshops will also be centered around
prominent principal speakers. Further information is available at:
