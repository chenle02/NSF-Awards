The principal focus of this project is the development of computational schemes
and algorithms for the real- time simulation of complex multibody systems on
multiprocessor computing systems. The results of this project may have a direct
impact on the design, simulation and control of large multisegment, multi- joint
structures as well as the design of software for the newly-emerging multi-
processing hardware. The project utilizes graph theory and operations research
methods to investigate inherent parallelisms in computational schemes and their
suitability for execution on multiprocessing systems. Automated symbolic algebra
packages are employed to generate novel theoretical formulations for describing
the dynamics of complex multibody systems which incorporate rigid and flexible
bodies. The work is fundamental in nature and is applicable of problems in other
scientific and engineering disciplines, in particular the study of motor control
is biosystems using neural net computational models.
