This award supports Professor James P. Riehl of the University of Missouri at
St. Louis for collaborative research with Professor Harry P. J. M. Dekkers of
the Department of Chemistry, State University of Leiden, The Netherlands. They
are pursuing several related projects on chiral and racemic mixtures through the
use of a new time-resolved circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) apparatus.
Professor Dekkers has built such an apparatus in Leiden, and offers experimental
experience in measurements of luminescence in chiral organic systems, while
Professor Riehl has expertise in theoretical analysis and some experimental work
on the stereochemistry of aqueous lanthanide complexes. The interests and skills
of the two investigators mesh very well. This project focuses on an emerging
area of spectroscopy that may have a significant impact on a number of
significant problems, both fundamental and applied. The proposed collaboration
should further develop the experimental and theoretical underpinnings of time
resolved CPL experiments. A better understanding of molecular energy exchange
and conformational dynamics in chiral lanthanides should also result.
