In the current trend toward microscale organic laboratories, the recent
acquisition of two infrared spectrophotometers by the Chemistry Department at
Hendrix College provides students with routine use of this instrumentation as an
integral characterization tool for most of the microscale experiments.
Additional instructional use is provided in Instrumental Analysis and senior
Independent Study. The Department is continuing to develop new environmentally-
safer experiments for the microscale laboratory, as well as to develop novel
methods for the implementation of established experiments. This acquisition is
assisting in the achievement of two general departmental objectives: (1) the
introduction of modern instrumentation as a routine tool in introductory
chemistry laboratories, and (2) the development of pedagogical models which may
be useful to other institutions.
