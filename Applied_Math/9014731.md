From an operational viewpoint the structure of a complex system may be defined
by its reaction to external probes, not necessarily weak ones. This typically
requires the introduction of spatial and/or temporal nonuniformity from the
outset, at a level beyond any that the undisturbed system possesses. The aim of
the principal investigator is to construct and solve carefully models in order
to illuminate the local and the global structure of classical lattice gases in
thermal equilibrium, thermalized classical fluids in continuous space, and
steady- state operations of clock-regulated queueing networks. The study of
natural systems at the microscopic level is a difficult area of research, given
the enormous complexity of systems that describe everyday phenomena like liquids
and gases. The principal investigator will construct and analyze tractable
models of various fluids in order to gain insight into their behavior at the
microscopic level.
