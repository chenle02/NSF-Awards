9413141 Murdoch This award to an outstanding group of ecologist and geographers
will support a multi-disciplinary training program focused on spatial aspects of
terrestrial, marine and freshwater ecosystems. The research programs of the 12
faculty members span small to global spatial scales in studies of natural,
exploited and managed systems, ranging from individual populations to
ecosystems. In the context of the training program, faculty will aim for a
synthesis of two approaches: that of the analysis of underlying mechanisms
responsible for the dynamics of ecological systems, and that of the analysis of
patterns over a large range of spatial scales. The award will support the
training of undergraduate and graduate students in both theoretical and
experimental approaches combined with instruction in the use of current modeling
techniques. Instruction will involve a combination of coursework, seminars, and
workshops; students will also have the opportunity to participate in an
industrial internship program that are integral to the activity. This award is
also supported by the Geography and Regional Science Program. ***
