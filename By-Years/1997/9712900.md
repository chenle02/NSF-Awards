9712900 Dorman This instrumentation development project will evaluate and adapt
a new seismometer sensor (the PMD Scientific) for use in a suite of Ocean Bottom
Seismometers (OBS) that are maintained in a pool of shared use equipment. The
new sensors will extend the useful frequency range of the OBSs down to 0.03 Hz
frequency. Improved sensors will make the instruments more useful for
teleseismic studies, surface-wave and shear-wave studies, and for compliance
determination of the seafloor shear modulus. The investigators will purchase and
evaluate seven new sensors, fabricate pressure housing for each, and develop a
new leveling system for them.
