Descriptive set theory is the branch of mathematical logic concerned with
definable sets of reals. The research involves several topics in descriptive set
theory and in the relationship between descriptive set theory and other parts of
mathematics, particularly analysis and topology. Some of these topics will be
considered under various types of determinacy assumptions. An outline of the
project follows. 1. Classical descriptive set theory and its connections with
analysis and topology. 1.1 Classification of pointsets in the projective
hierarchy. 1.2 Examples of descriptive set theoretic phenomena occurring in
analysis and topology. 1.3 Descriptive set theory and functional analysis:
Sequences in Banach spaces. 1.4 Descriptive set theory and topology: Paths,
path- connectedness and simple connectedness. 2. Modern descriptive set theory
and its connections with other parts of mathematical logic. 2.1 Set theory in
the Cabal universe. 2.2 Descriptive set theory in Cabal universe. 2.3 Jump
operators and inner model operators.
