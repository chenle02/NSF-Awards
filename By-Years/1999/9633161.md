9633161 Marsden The proposed research lies in the area of geometric mechanics.
It has to do with laying a theoretical foundation for various aspects of
classical mechanics. Nonholonomic systems with symmetry are to be investigated
as an application of the ideas of Lagrangian reduction. Integrable systems and
solitons will be pursued with a view towards certain applications in control
dynamics. Bifurcations in Hamiltonian systems will be investigated in the
context of singular reduction. Geometry of control systems will also be studied.
Geometric mechanics aims to formulate theories and problems in classical
mechanics in a mathematically rigorous setting. There have been several recent
successes of geometric mechanics. The falling cat example, where the cat
executes a complete re-orientation without exerting any angular momentum, has
now been explained using the idea of a connection - a connection is a
mathematical notion originally introduced to study so called principal bundles
in differential geometry. The proposed research will further pursue these
theoretical ideas as well as consider possible applications in such areas as
control theory and robotics.
