This grant funds dissertation research on the syntax of certain dialects spoken
in Northern Italy. By field work in Italy, the student will collect data on
several different verb types. The main dialect of interest is Borgomanerese,
spoken in the province of Piedmont. In this dialect certain intransitive verbs
which share similar meanings have distinct syntactic properties which
distinguish them from all other verbs. These properties have gone previously
unnoticed because Borgomanerese is a very little studied dialect. The special
properties that this distinct class of verbs shares are of interest to
linguistics because they constitute evidence in favor of the hypothesis,
motivated by facts from other languages, which claims that certain aspects of
verb meaning are relevant to syntactic structure.
