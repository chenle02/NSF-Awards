Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to develop novel
digital forensic techniques and support it with experimental validation for
later technology transfer to forensic investigators. The goal of digital
forensics is to establish the origin, integrity, processing history, and meaning
of evidence in digital form that includes digital images, video, or audio. This
is an emerging and rapidly developing field typically approached using methods
from signal processing, estimation, and detection combined with machine
learning. The main thrust of this project is development of forensic methods
that rely on systematic artifacts of imaging sensors due to sensor design, in-
camera signal processing, and imperfections of the sensor manufacturing process
itself. These artifacts form an equivalent of a digital sensor fingerprint. By
detecting the fingerprint in a digital image, one can link a given image to the
specific camera/sensor that took it and establish thus the image origin and
integrity or uncover the image processing history. Some of the research
directions are highly relevant and complex problems that have not been addressed
before, such as the possibility to detect attempts to forge the fingerprint.
Other tasks involve using existing concepts in a novel manner or substantially
improve upon existing technology. One of them is to group images according their
source camera without having the cameras. The developed methods are subject to
large scale experimental verification on a hundred thousand images obtained from
more than 1000 cameras.
