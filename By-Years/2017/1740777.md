The goal of this project is to develop the theory of mixing by resonances in
multi-scale systems in the presence of such phenomena as finite inertia, random
fluctuations, and molecular diffusion. The constructed theory will provide an
effective and accurate method to compute the size of the mixing domain in a
given system, to estimate the rate, thoroughness, and uniformity of mixing, and
to describe the appearance of coherent structures in a chaotic sea. The theory
of processes on resonance surfaces will be combined with the adiabatic model of
transport between those surfaces to develop a statistical long-term description
of transport in systems with resonances. Numerical simulations and study of
experimental data from microfluidics laboratory and space plasma experiments
will be performed to identify the resonance mechanisms causing the transport of
particles and describe the impact of additional stochastic processes on the
stability of transport.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this work will
result in the integration of often disconnected methods and techniques into a
general transport theory for a wide class of flows, discrete maps, and
Hamiltonian systems with resonances. One of the main components will be a novel
technique to quantify different aspects of mixing and the persistence of
quantitative characteristics in the presence of uncertainties and fluctuations
in various multi-scale systems. The obtained results will have direct
applications to a wide range of problems in science and engineering, such as
microfluidics or other low Reynolds-number (microscale) flows, the transport of
comets and asteroids through the solar system, energy exchange between
excitation modes in condensed matter, and motion of charged particles in various
electromagnetic fields of the Earth's magnetosphere or magnetic confinement
fusion devices.
