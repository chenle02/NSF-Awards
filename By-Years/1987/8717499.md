Modern molecular methods are revitalizing the study of fern systematics and
evolutionary biology. In particular, analyses of protein isozymes and other gene
markers now enable researchers to determine the parental species involved in
hybridization events and in polyploid evolution (change through chromosome
doubling). Coupled with new techniques for investigating variation in
chloroplast DNA, these approaches hold great promise for determining the
phylogenetic relationships of groups of ferns. Dr. Chris Haufler of the
University of Kansas continues to pioneer the use of new molecular methods in
resolving long- standing taxonomic problems in fern biology. This project will
focus on a circumboreal group of ferns of the Polypodium vulgare complex. In
addition to molecular data, new morphological data from spore studies and leaf
shape will be used to delimit species in nature, identify hybrid populations and
polyploids, and test whether polyploid hybrids occur rarely or commonly. These
results will then permit more rigorous comparisons of the modes and mechanisms
of speciation in ferns with those known for flowering plants.
