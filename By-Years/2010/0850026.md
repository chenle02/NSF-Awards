Bowling Green State University and Owens and Terra Community Colleges are
collaborating on a scholarship program designed to increase the number of highly
qualified and capable students who are able to attend college.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Each year approximately 20 need-based
scholarships are being provided to students who are selected by class rank,
performance in math courses, successful participation in science and math
activities, leadership experiences, and community service. This project is
increasing the persistence and graduation rate of these students by combining
this scholarship program with an NSF STEP grant, "Science, Engineering, and
Technology Gateway Ohio" (SETGO). These programs include a 5-week summer bridge
program for entering students to prepare them for the rigors of college science
and math courses; a tiered system of mentoring by peers and faculty; learning
communities with monthly events that draw students and faculty together by
merging academics and social networking; and summer research opportunities. The
strategies have been proven in the institution's "Academic Investment in
Mathematics and Science" (AIMS) program to increase student persistence and
success, particularly of under-represented minority students majoring in science
and math disciplines and are based on research that has identified the factors
that most account for student attrition from these disciplines.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This project is demonstrating how
providing need-based scholarships to students who have demonstrated ability and
promise, and a support system that is based on rigorous, scientifically based
research, can greatly increase the graduation rate in mathematics and science of
economically disadvantaged students, and in particular, under-represented
minorities including women.&lt;br/&gt;
