This mathematics research project concerns the areas of analysis, geometry, and
dynamics, which are central to mathematics and crucial to other scientific
fields, such as engineering, biology, and economics. For example, the
mathematical modeling of any phenomenon that undergoes change over time (such as
the population of bacteria in a body, the stock market, etc.) can be viewed as a
dynamical system. Similarly, geometry is the basis for many current industrial
applications such as 3D printing. This project will enhance the tools available
in these branches of mathematics. The development of geometry goes back to the
ancient Greeks, who laid down axioms, or basic assumptions, from which other
reasonable properties could be logically deduced. The main focus of this project
is a detailed study of certain phenomena that occur when the Archimedean axiom,
attributed to Archimedes of Syracuse, is no longer valid. The resulting
mathematics turns out to be useful even when the primary object of study is of
the usual, Archimedean, kind.

This research project will use techniques from non-Archimedean analysis and
geometry in order to study a range of problems in analysis, dynamics, and
geometry. The project makes use of Berkovich spaces, non-Archimedean analogues
of real and complex manifolds. One part of the project involves Calabi-Yau
manifolds, geometric objects that play an important role in mathematical
physics. The principal investigator and collaborator will use non-Archimedean
techniques to study a conjecture concerning one-parameter families of complex
Calabi-Yau manifolds that degenerate to a real Calabi-Yau manifold. Another part
of the project is in arithmetic dynamics. Given a discrete-time two-dimensional
dynamical system defined by a pair of polynomials with rational coefficients,
the research investigates how the arithmetic complexity grows along orbits of
the dynamics. Here the problem is formulated in terms of elementary number
theory but approached using a detailed study of an induced dynamical system on a
Berkovich space.
