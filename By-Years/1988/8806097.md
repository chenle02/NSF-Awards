The main research area of this project is in the theory of random graphs. One
open problem is the determination of the chromatic number of a random graph.
Several other specific problems will be considered, including problems in random
partially ordered sets, and in classical extremal graph theory. Many problems in
theoretical computer science are related to random graph theory, for example the
expected behavior of sorting and other commonly used algorithms.
