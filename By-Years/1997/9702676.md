This research is on developing fundamental ideas and techniques for designing
fault-tolerant and highly reliable systems at the register-transfer level. In
today's and future technologies failure mechanisms are many, including:
manufacturing spot defects, hot electron effects, crosstalk and electro-
migration. In this project, the investigator is exploring techniques for design-
for-fault-tolerance and design-for-reliability during the register-transfer
phase of a system design process. Also being addressed are design methodologies
for fault-tolerance enhancement and reliability improvement based on the
statistics and physics of the targeted failures. Finally, software tools for the
design of fault-tolerant and reliable VLSI systems are being developed and will
be incorporated into existing CAD systems. These research results are being
integrated into the curriculum.
