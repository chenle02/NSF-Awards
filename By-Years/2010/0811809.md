Abstract&lt;br/&gt;PI: Meenakshisundaram, Gopi (CCF ? 0811809)
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Current graphics and visualization systems have to be
built such that they can handle gigantic data sets like those from large
scientific simulations including nuclear and power simulations, and geometric
data sets such as digital models of defense and commercial equipments such as
aircraft, ships and power-plants. Such large data sets cannot fit into the main
memory of the computers or be rendered interactively in current graphics
systems. This project involves fundamental research in designing algorithms for
efficient compression of these large data sets that enables fast decompression
of the required portion of the data set in the main-memory and efficient
interactive rendering of these data sets.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This study is
exploring three research directions to solve the problem of interactive
walkthrough of gigantic data sets: syntactic compression, semantic compression,
and access sensitive data layouts. Syntactic compression deals with compressing
data bits. In this project, compression algorithms that exhibit properties like
random-access decompression and stop-any-time decompression are studied.
Semantic compression deals with representing objects with fewer primitives. In
this context, this research studies parameterizable semantic compression
algorithms that trades-off space for compression efficiency. Finally, optimal
data layouts depend on application, and this study explores optimal data layout
schemes of the 3D data sets on external memory for interactive walkthrough
applications. This includes partitioning of the 3D data set using different
metrics like normal vector deviation and spatial distance between objects, and
computing the linear layout of these partitions in the external memory using
graph algorithms. The research is significantly improving the ability to render
large data sets with applications across computer graphics and visualization as
well as other application areas such as military and rescue
simulations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
