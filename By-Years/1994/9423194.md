Spielmann With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Katherine Spielmann and
her students will analyze large collections of ceramic materials excavated from
three late prehistoric pueblo sites in the Salinas area of central New Mexico.
Chemical analyses of paste and included temper will be combined with detailed
examination of surface design. On this basis it will be possible to reconstruct
the system of ceramic manufacturing and exchange across a large region and to
determine how this changed over time. The work will provide important insight
into prehistoric social organization and the processes which give rise to
complex society. Archaeologists have noted that in many parts of the world a
correlation appears to exist between population growth, population aggregation
into regional centers and the emergence of craft specialization. A number of
models have been postulated to explain this observation and the most popular
argues that with population growth, food can become more difficult to obtain and
therefore a number of individuals become craft specialists and barter goods such
as ceramics to obtain necessary subsistence resources. Population growth,
aggregation and craft specialization occurred concurrently in the U.S. Southwest
and as a result of many years of fieldwork, Dr. Spielmann has developed a data
base which provides detailed documentation of this process. Through her proposed
analysis, she shall disentangle cause and effect and gain insight into the
mechanisms involved. This research is important because it will provide data of
interest to many archaeologists as well as Native Americans. It will shed new
light on how complex societies emerge and are maintained and will assist in the
training of graduate students.
