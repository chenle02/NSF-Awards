This travel grant provides partial support for young researchers and students to
participate in MobiHoc 2009 Symposium in New Orleans, Louisiana, USA and partial
support for a workshop entitled, ?The First Wireless of the Students, by the
Students, for the Students Workshop? to be held in conjunction with ACM Mobihoc
2009 created by the students, for the students. The intellectual merit of the
student workshop is to pursue a unique format that will develop leadership,
early-career development and encourage participation in the research community.
The student panels will be an early experience with bold, visionary thinking.
Moreover, ACM MobiHoc is the premier international symposium dedicated to
addressing challenges emerging from wireless ad hoc networking and computing.
The broader impact is fostering an environment of technical discussions and
debates among the communities of mobile computing and wireless systems. In
addition, the event targets to encourage participation by young scientists and
researchers and features a ?Networking Networking Women? meeting.
