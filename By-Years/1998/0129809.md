Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the major goals of neuroscience is to
delineate the neural and molecular mechanisms important for learning and memory.
A prominent type of learning is fear conditioning where one learns to be afraid
of an aversive event and the signals that become associated with the event.
Learning and memory of fear has important biological and psychological
implications for animal survival and human interactions in society. Over the
years, one part of the brain, called the amygdala, has been shown to be critical
for fear learning as measured by numerous fear-related responses in animals and
humans. While the amygdala is an integral part of a fear circuit or system,
little is known about the molecular mechanisms of fear conditioning within the
amygdala. Cascades of molecular events from neurotransmitters activating
receptors and then signal transduction systems to the expression of genes and
proteins are thought to underlie learning and memory. The objectives of this
proposed research are to investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms of
learning and memory of fear within the amygdala. The participation of the major
transduction systems in the amygdala will be investigated by selectively
inhibiting four prominent transduction pathways pharmacologically and
determining whether fear conditioning and gene expression are blocked.
Additional experiments will determine which types of neurons in the amygdala
have these changes in gene expression. The results will contribute important
advances in our understanding of sequential cellular and molecular processes
that underlie the phenomenon of learning and memory of fear.&lt;br/&gt;
