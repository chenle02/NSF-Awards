This project pursues significant, unresolved questions in dynamic general
equilibrium theory. The first part develops convex models of endogenous growth
with special emphasis on the following areas: (1) the analysis of the
determinants of growth and the possibility of sustained growth; (2) the study of
the process of innovation or new product development; and (3) the study of the
dynamic effects of taxation. The project explores the connections between these
three areas and extends this work into open economy settings. The second part
concerns the use of general equilibrium models of imperfect competition to
understand aggregate phenomena. In particular, these models are used to study
the existence of Keynesian "low output" equilibria and unemployment due to
increasing returns and private information. This research should provide new
insights into economic growth, technological change and tax policy. Previous
work by the investigator tying the literatures on dynamic taxation and the
determinants of growth demonstrates that different tax policies and trade
policies can generate permanent differences in the growth rates of different
countries. This project will extend the past work with special emphasis on the
effect of market power, education and different economic policies on sustained
economic growth in an open economy.
