Galaxies harbor an astounding range of physical properties, one of the most
fundamental of which is the total mass (made up of gas, dust, stars, and the
mysterious dark matter). Many important physical properties change as one
considers galaxies across the known range of masses. In this Research in
Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) program, the investigator and students will use
data from the NSF’s Karl Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) to study the gaseous
component of the most extremely low-mass galaxies. These 3-dimensional data
products simultaneously inform upon the amount, the location, and the motion of
the gas in these systems. The team will compare these VLA data with a
comprehensive suite of supporting data to reveal the physical properties of
these faint galaxies. Undergraduate students will play critical roles in all
aspects of this program.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This RUI program will investigate
the physical properties of low-mass galaxies, and it supports the “Survey of HI
in Extremely Low-mass Dwarfs” (“SHIELD”). SHIELD is a holistic investigation of
the low-mass dwarf galaxy population discovered by the ALFALFA blind HI
extragalactic survey. As the most numerous types of galaxies at all redshifts,
low-mass systems are critical for understanding star formation, chemical
evolution, fundamental scaling relations, and galaxy evolution. Working with
undergraduate students at Macalester College, the P.I. will undertake a detailed
study of the HI gas in the 82 SHIELD galaxies and in similar systems. Using the
rich multi-wavelength SHIELD data suite, this program will enable detailed
exploration of the rotational dynamics and the star formation properties of low-
mass galaxies. Multiple fundamental galaxy scaling relations will be extended
into the sparsely populated parameter spaces that the SHIELD galaxies
occupy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
