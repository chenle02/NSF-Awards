Assessment/Research (91)&lt;br/&gt;This project is one component of a
collaborative effort to develop and pilot the National Statistics Teaching
Practice Survey (NSTPS), which is based on the Statistics Teaching Inventory,
designed as part of the completed NSF-funded ARTIST project (DUE- 0206571). This
component is creating the mechanism for administering the survey online,
creating a database and reporting structure, and make preparations for the
national administration of the instrument to a representative group of teachers.
A sister project (National Statistics Teaching Practice Survey: Instrument
development) based at the University of Minnesota is developing, evaluating, and
refining the survey instrument and working with researchers from other STEM
disciplines to align this project with similar efforts in other fields. That
instrument is to be used to gather and examine some pilot data over multiple
time points, including settings where change is anticipated (e.g. in gauging
instructional changes for participants in a best practices workshop). Together
these two projects are preparing the way for follow on work to gather
longitudinal data on the teaching of STEM undergraduate courses in order to
track changes over time and measure the alignment of teaching with data-based
recommendations for improvement in teaching methods and
materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These two connected projects are creating and
implementing online a new research tool to gather important data on the teaching
of statistics courses. The instrument can then be used to study the relationship
of teaching practices with student learning, the alignment of teaching practice
with recognized best practice guidelines, national changes in teaching practice
over time, and changing teaching practices following professional development
workshops. This pilot project has the potential to serve as a starting point and
model for similar instruments and data collection in other STEM disciplines.
