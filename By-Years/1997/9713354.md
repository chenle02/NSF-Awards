9713354 Ismail This two-year award supports US-UK cooperative research in
classical analysis among Mourad Ismail of the University of South Florida, Yang
Chen of Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine, William Evans and
Brian Brown of the University of Wales. The US investigator will work with Brown
and Evans on the spectral theory of the Askey-Wilson operators. They will study
applications of the Dyson Coulomb fluid approximation to develop asymptotics of
extreme zeroes of orthogonal polynomials and recursion coefficients. He will
work on the application of q-orthogonal polynomials in quantum transport in
disordered electronic systems with Yang Chen. The US investigator brings to this
collaboration expertise in orthogonal polynomials and special functions. This is
complemented by Dr. Chen's expertise in mathematical physics and quantum
transport and Brown and Evans' expertise in theory of computation and spectral
theory of differential operators.
