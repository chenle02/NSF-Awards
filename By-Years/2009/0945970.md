This SBIR project proposes to develop a novel bioreactor that will contain
biocatalytic coatings for the desulfurization of petroleum products. A
biodesulfurization microorganism will be immobilized at the interface of a two-
phase membrane with a biocatalytic coating. Biodesufurization technology also
has the potential to significantly reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas
emissions.

The broader/commercial impact of the proposed project will be a decrease in the
levels of sulfur from petroleum products. The petroleum being used is
increasingly ?sour,? high sulfur crude. The proposed process can also be used
for other industrial processes that rely on mass transfer limited biological
reactions.
