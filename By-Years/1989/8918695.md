Teeth comprise a significant portion of the fossil record, and thickness of
dental enamel has been used as a measure to distinguish among human and ape
fossils. Yet, we still do not know how thickness is determined. Enamel thickness
is the result of three poorly known processes: rate of formation, length of
formation time, and number of cells that are producing it. This project is a
Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) analysis of three major parameters of dental
microstructure (enamel prism cross-striation repeat interval, Striae of Retzius,
and pattern of enamel decussation) in great apes and humans. The measurement of
these parameters will permit the reconstruction of crown formation time and thus
provide a better understanding of the determination of enamel thickness. Large
samples of molar teeth will be studied to provide baseline data for the
interpretation of fossil teeth. There is considerable controversy among
anthropologists concerning the nature and pattern of dental development in
living and fossil apes and humans. This study will establish the homology of
enamel thickness categories, and similarities or differences in the
developmental pathways that were followed to achieve enamel thickness in
different hominoid primates. These results will be of relevance to any studies
of enamel thickness and development in other primate groups.
