ADVANCING STEM Women at Historically Black Institutions: Ensuring the Best STEM
Minds Stay at the Table &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;North Carolina Agricultural and
Technical State University will solve a conundrum while transforming itself into
an open, transparent community that supports STEM faculty to achieve their best.
Research demonstrates how unconscious bias can hold women back from inclusion in
the STEM enterprise; NC A&amp;T will help us better understand how gender
barriers intersect with racial/ethnicity barriers through its ADVANCE
Institutional Transformation award. Dr. Shirley Malcom, former president of
AAAS, calls the predicament of STEM women of color "The Double Bind": if it's
hard for us to imagine a woman when we hear the word "scientist", it's doubly
hard to imagine a woman of color as a scientist. NC A&amp;T will study the
factors that lead to the "double bind" and will develop strategies to address
the double bind for women at Historically Black Colleges and Universities
(HBCUs), strategies that can also be applied to lower barriers for STEM women of
color at historically majority institutions. The strategies NC A&amp;T develops
and disseminates will help lower barriers for all STEM women through their
findings on how to best mentor STEM faculty at mid-career.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NC A&amp;T, through its ADVANCE Institutional
Transformation award, will not wait to find answers to the double bind: they
will provide STEM women faculty novel professional development opportunities,
such as developing personal professional development plans with able mentors,
and visiting funding agencies in the DC metro area, an opportunity not
previously available to an historically teaching-focused institution. As the
nation's population becomes increasingly diverse, we want all the best heads at
the bench and in the field: NC A&amp;T will ensure that the best minds are not
excluded because they don't fit the traditional mold.
