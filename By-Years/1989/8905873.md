Professor Miller plans to continue his research into the cohomology of mapping
spaces, by Adams spectral sequence methods. He will also study the unstable
K-theory Adams spectral sequence, and hopes to obtain certain results about
elliptic cohomology. These are basic matters in the algebraization of topology
(geometry), a distinguished tradition that goes back to Descartes.
