The purpose of this study is to better understand the physiological and
biochemical mechanisms used by insects to survive the winter. The flesh fly,
Sarcophaga crassipalpis, will be used as the insect model for this project.
Experimentation will focus on the relationship between diapause, a state of
winter dormancy, and mechanisms of insect cold-hardening. Particular attention
will be paid to the role of the neuroendocrine system in the regulation of
increased cold tolerance. Cryomicroscopy will be used to define the nature of
cellular injury due to low temperature exposure and the role of the
cryoprotectant glycerol in preventing this type of injury. The relationship
between the heat shock and the rapid cold-hardening response will be evaluated.
Although this study is designed to increase our basic understanding of low
temperature survival, the information gained from this research may provide
leads for the future development of new approaches to the control of
agricultural pests. For example, if it were possible to prevent or block the
cold-hardening process in insect pests, these species would be unable to survive
exposure to low temperatures during the winter season.
