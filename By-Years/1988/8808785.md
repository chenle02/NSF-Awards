This Research Opportunities for Women Research Planning Grant is in the general
area of Analytical and Surface Chemistry and in the subfields of chromatography
and mass spectrometry. During the twelve month period beginning 1 July 1988,
Professor Dietrich will draw upon her considerable expertise in both
chromatography and mass spectrometry to develop new skills in hybrid liquid
chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) techniques which she will apply to the
study of various environmental problems, particularly those relating to
hazardous waste management. The planned skill development activities include
both independent work and also collaborative research at the National Institute
for Environmental Health Science. These activities should contribute to
Professor Dietrich's establishing a competitive independent research program in
her laboratory at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University during the
tenure of this Research Planning Grant award. The research area that will be
explored in this project, namely the development and application of LC/MS
techniques for the analysis of multicomponent environmental samples, is broadly
important to both basic science and public health. The results of this work
could impact significantly on the fields of environmental chemistry and mass
spectrometry, as well as upon the health sciences; it could lead to the
identification of new technology that is necessary for the disposal and
treatment of hazardous waste.
