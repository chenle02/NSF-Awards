The Biology Department recently implemented changes to the laboratory components
of its General Biology courses. The changes institute an experimental approach
to laboratory study centering on open-ended investigative experiments and
introducing selected instrumentation, statistical analysis and formal report
writing. Each course contains three weeks of lab study of respiration; in the
first semester the focus is on anaerobic fermentation by yeasts and in the
second semester on whole organism respiration of cockroaches. We presently use a
modified Scholander apparatus that measures gas pressure changes in a closed
system. Funds are requested for the purchase of Li-Cor Portable Photosynthesis
Systems, capable of rapid accurate measurements of CO2 fluxes produced by living
material placed within a measurement chamber. These instruments will replace the
relatively unreliable equipment we are now using and will extend the
instructional capability of the laboratory in the following ways. The fast
response time and high sensitivity of the system will allow each student to run
more replicates during a three hour laboratory, improving the sensitivity of
statistical analyses performed later. Students will be able to choose from a
wider range of treatment effects when designing their own investigations,
because finer distinctions among rates will be possible. In addition, the
equipment will significantly improve the quality of laboratory investigations
into photosynthesis in the General Botany course.
