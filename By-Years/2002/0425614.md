Shaul Mukamel is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program to continue his research in molecular relaxation and radiative
processes. He will continue his development of theoretical methods for the
design and systematic interpretation of multidimensional femtosecond correlation
spectroscopies in systems of coupled localized vibrational or electronic
chromophores. Visible and infrared analogues of multiple-pulse NMR techniques
provide novel snapshot probes into the structure as well as dynamics,
interactions and relaxation processes of complex molecular assemblies. The
fundamental theoretical concepts underlying techniques involving molecular
responses to sequences of shaped and timed radiation pulses will be developed.
Semiclassical methods for simulating nonlinear response functions will be
tested. A classical-oscillator description of the spectroscopies will be
developed, setting the stage for designing new pulse sequences that accomplish
the same goals as their NMR analogues and providing a framework for computing
and interpreting multidimensional signals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The advent of
pulsed laser technology combined with the use of non-linear optical techniques
has led to a large number of new methods to probe gas-phase and condensed-phase
molecular systems. Mukamel is developing theoretical techniques that are central
to the interpretation of the data obtained from these experiments. These
interpretations lead to many important insights regarding chemical reactions and
the effects of solvation in condensed phase systems that can have application to
understanding biological systems.&lt;br/&gt;
