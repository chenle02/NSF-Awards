9714813 Hervig This award will partially support expenses for invited speakers
who will present their latest analytical and theoretical results at a special
session of the 11th International Conference on Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry
(SIMS). The special session is entitled "Isotopic Ratio Measurements Using
SIMS", and the invited speakers will be selected from leading laboratories
working in isotope geochemistry, an area of research where recent technical
developments have allowed advances in precise isotope ratio measurements from
microscopic samples. The special session has been added to the international
SIMS conference with the intent of bringing the microanalytical expertise of the
isotope geochemistry community together with interested SIMS specialists from
materials science and the semiconductor industry. ***
