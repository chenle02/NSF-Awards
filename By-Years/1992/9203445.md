This award supports the research of Professor S. Stahl for research in graph
theory. Professor Stahl will study embeddings of graphs on closed orientable
surfaces. In particular, he will attempt to study the genus of a randomly chosen
orientable embedding of a graph. Graph Theory go back perhaps two hundred years,
but only in the last half-century has the field become an active, fertile, and
flourishing branch of mathematics. A graph is a network of lines ("edges")
joining points ("vertices"), thus the language of graphs becomes a natural way
of describing interrelationships among separated objects. Graph Theory figures
most prominently as an essential tool in Communications Theory and Computer
Science.
