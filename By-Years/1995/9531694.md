9531694 Meerkov This research concerns the application of rigorous mathematical
analysis from systems theory to improve output rate of production lines by
better allocation of resources. It is an innovative approach to the "bottleneck
" problem. The researchers have developed a theory of improvability, where a
production system is considered improvable under constraints if limited
resources such as work -in-process or workforce can be redistributed so that a
performance index (usually production rate) can be increased. Here, improvement,
rather than optimality, is looked for, since it is often impossible to determine
optimality due to the extremely complex mathematical nature of production
systems. The research will also investigate unconstrained improvability, namely
determining the machine, device, or assembly station that impedes the systems
performance in the strongest manner, i.e., the bottleneck. The approach of the
research is based on sound mathematical principles which result in usable
operating rules for the "shop" floor. The researchers have excellent industry
ties, and the theoretical results are constantly evaluated in real industrial
environments.
