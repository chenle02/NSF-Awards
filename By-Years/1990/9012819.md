In collaboration with Drs. Schwartz and Grun at McMaster University, Dr. Clark
Howell will work to improve the ESR dating technique, apply it to tooth enamel,
and determine the ages of a series of significant archaeological sites. The ESR
dating technique is based on the measurement of energy stored in crystal
lattices which result from the bombardment by environmental radioactivity. The
amount of stored energy can be determined by electron spin resonance (ESR)
spectroscopy. The age of the crystal is then determined from the ratio of the
accumulated energy dose to the dose rate, which is a function of the
concentration of radioactive elements in the environment. This method can be
applied to the tooth enamel of large mammals and is thus applicable to most
Pleistocene prehistoric sites for ages up to a few million years. The project
includes two stages. The first will consist of a series of experiments to
increase the accuracy and reliability of the technique. In the second, the
investigators will continue to date samples from anthropologically significant
sites. This research is important for two reasons. Reliable and widely
applicable dating techniques are lacking for most archaeological sites over
40,000 years in age (this is the effective time limit for radiocarbon dating).
If ESR can be established as a workable technique, many archaeological sites
could then be dated and the information derived from them would be greatly
increased. The technique would also be useful to geologists, paleontologists,
and other scientists concerned with the past. Secondly, the specific sites which
Drs. Howell, Schwartz, and Grun plan to examine are important in their own
right.
