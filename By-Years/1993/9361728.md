9361728 Genders This is a Phase I award under the Small Business Innovation
Research Solicitation. In a previous effort, a process based on the
electrochemical hydrodimerization of formaldehyde at a graphite cathode was
developed. A drop in oil prices, and a resultant drop in ethylene prices, the
feedstock for the major present process for ethylene glycol, made the new
process economically unattractive. This effort is an extension of the earlier
work designed to reduce the capital and operating costs required. Modifications
include operating in an undivided, narrow-gap cell with noncatalytic electrodes
thus eliminating the need for costly membranes and catalysts; using solvent
extraction for product isolation and employing gas-diffusion electrodes.
Ethylene glycol is an important commodity chemical. It is a precurser to
polyester, is the principal antifreeze compound in use, and has other
applications in chemical processing.
