This project connects two educational sites to the Internet over a 56kbps line.
The two sites to be connected are in Seward: the Seward Marine Center of the
University of Alaska Fairbanks, and the Alaska Vocational Technical Center, a
state-funded post-secondary educational institution. Faculty and students at the
schools benefit from access to the resources of the Internet, including
libraries and supercomputers. In addition, they are able to communicate and
collaborate with colleagues at other institutions in pursuit of research and
educational projects. The award provides partial support of the project for two
years.
