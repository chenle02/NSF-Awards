This research project, supported jointly by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
Program of the Chemistry Division and the Solid State Chemistry Program of the
Division of Materials Research, addresses key questions of geometric and
electronic structure of magnetic surfaces and interfaces. Professor Klebanoff
will develop and apply methods of spin resolved X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy, photoelectron diffraction, and surface extended electron loss fine
structure spectroscopy to characterize the magnetic properties of thin films of
magnetically active elements deposited on well characterized single crystal
metal substrates. Initial work will concentrate on the interfacial magnetic
properties of Cr layers deposited on the Fe(100) surface, and will be extended
to other ferromagnetic systems including Fe, Co, Ni, and Gd. %%% An
understanding of the magnetic and structural properties of the surfaces and
interfaces of magnetically active materials is of tremendous importance to the
magnetic recording industry and to the design and manufacture of magnetically
active electronic components. This research program will develop powerful new
methods for the characterization of the magnetic structure of thin layers of
magnetically active materials, and apply them to the study of model systems.
Information obtained from these studies will provide data crucial to the design
and understanding of magnetic surfaces and interfaces.
