A "collisionless" plasma is a fully ionized gas in which electromagnetic forces
dominate collisional effects. The motion of a high temperature, low density
collisionless plasma is described by the Vlasov-Maxwell equations, a nonlinear
system of partial differential equations. The major question to be addressed is
this: are there shocks in a collisionless plasma? That is, could a singularity
develop from smoothly prescribed initial values as time progresses?
Additionally, "induction heating" will be studied. In this area one investigates
how a conductive material is heated by using electromagnetic waves. Microwave
heating is a particular example.

"Plasmas" are often called the fourth state of matter (after solids, liquids and
gases). Plasmas account for a huge proportion of the material in the universe.
Famous examples of plasmas include the solar wind, the ionosphere, galactic
nebulae and comet tails. The motion of a plasma is described by a number of
complicated equations dictated by physics. The mathematician's goal is to show
that these equations have solutions, at least under certain conditions. This is
the main thrust of the proposal. A completely different application to be
studied is called "induction heating." Here one tries to determine how various
materials can be heated by passing electromagnetic waves through them. The
microwave heating of food is a particular example.
