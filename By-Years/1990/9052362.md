Limited laboratory time in the Anatomy and Physiology course is being maximized
by using computer-interfaced equipment and instituting experiments that can be
performed on the students themselves. Three physiology packages, the physiogrip,
the cardiocomp, and the spirocomp, which interface with personal computers are
used to perform exercises on muscle, cardiac, and respiratory physiology. Using
the computer to store and analyze data may help students with mathematical
deficiencies, sustain interest in physiology, and give the students more time
for discussion and comprehension of the data. The experiences gained with this
new equipment will become the basis for seminars for high school and junior
college teachers and for the development of a laboratory test bank. The
university will contribute an amount equal to the award.
