9603626 Moore Cell division in some form is central to reproduction of all
organisms, and also to growth and reproduction of more complex forms of life.
Regulation of this division is crucial, and loss of regulation has dire
consequences for all forms of life. Because of this, extensive studies of the
division process have been conducted and many aspects are increasingly well
understood. One component of the process which has not been sufficiently studied
is the control over membrane production. Membranes surround both the periphery
and the cellular components, organelles, which specialize in specific metabolic
functions of the cell. Production of too much, too little, or the wrong
components of the membranes, or at the wrong time, would lead to aberrations in
the daughter cells. The research would be devoted to measuring the changes in
membrane composition which takes place during a cell division cycle and the
biosynthetic/catabolic processes which accompany these changes. The
photosynthetic organism, Chlamydomonas reinhardtti, will be utilized and the
work will concentrate primarily on its major extraplastid membrane lipids,
phosphatidylethanolamine and diacylglyceroltrimethylhomoserine. Since the
pathways of synthesis of these two lipids are not defined for C. reinhardtti,
determination of the pathways and intracellular locations of synthesis of these
two lipids will receive initial priority. This project is concerned with
regulation of synthesis of membranes, particularly their lipid components, in
relation to cell division and the cell cycle. If membrane synthesis is not
properly coordinated with cell division, serious problems could result. A simple
alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, that can be manipulated genetically will be
studied. The pathway for synthesis of two major lipids will be analyzed and
studied. This project will provide new information about how plants control
their growth and reproduction and may have a long-term impact on crop
production.
