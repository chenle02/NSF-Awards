This is a basic investigation into the mechanisms by which a coating of calcium
phosphate ceramics enhances bone tissue ingrowth. Four clearly stated hypotheses
will be tested using in vitro preparations to examine bioactivity of these
materials. Resolution of the hypotheses should substantially improve capability
to design surfaces for bone prostheses without requiring the use of bone cement.
Since breaking down of the cement is the primary failure mechanism of current
implants, the work has great potential significance.
