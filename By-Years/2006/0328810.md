Current spoken language understanding systems operate in a layered fashion,
where utterances are processed entirely at one level (e.g., speech recognition)
before hypotheses are passed to the next level (e.g., parsing). Such a layered
organization creates significant problems in developing robust highly-
interactive spoken language systems because expectations and feedback that arise
from the context of the dialogue are not used by the lower levels of language
processing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In collaboration with SRI international, we
are developing a new architecture for continuous understanding, in which all
levels of processing operate concurrently, sharing information throughout the
system, enabling understanding on a word-by-word basis as the utterance
progresses. This new architecture should have three main advantages: (1) it
should improve the accuracy and efficiency of real-time spoken language
understanding; (2) it should better support the processing of spontaneous
speech; and (3) it should enable more effective spoken language interfaces that
could interact with the user in a free-form, natural manner. The SRI group is
focusing on speech recognition and analysis of prosody.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will have a large impact on the field, and
introduce a new paradigm for language understanding systems that could lead to
significant leaps in robustness and accuracy, and produce a new generation of
highly interactive human-computer interfaces. On a more general scale, as
computers become an ever more pervasive part of the fabric of our society, our
lives become increasingly more complex. If successful, this project would
contribute towards creating much more human-friendly, easy to use, computer
interfaces.&lt;br/&gt;
