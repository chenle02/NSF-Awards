A conference will be held at Park City, Utah from Monday May 12 to Friday May
16, 2007. The conference covers a broad range of topics in dynamical systems,
including, both deterministic and random systems. The conference is intended to
promote interaction between researchers, contribute in the training of young
researchers, and facilitate in the communication of mathematical results.

The field of dynamical systems studies the long term behavior of a system. Since
many mathematical structures can be modeled by such a system the field of
dynamical systems both uses and contributes to a broad range of mathematical
disciplines.

The conference plans to support young researchers at both the graduate and post-
doctoral level, those from underrepresented groups, and other researchers
without support.
