9512841 DiSalvo This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research
in solid state chemistry and materials research between Francis J. DiSalvo at
Cornell University and Jean Rouxel at the Institute of Materials, University of
Nantes. The objective of their research is to determine the structure and
properties of sulfide compounds. The project also involves the chemistry of the
Mott insulator and synthesis of a new compound with a linked network of metal
clusters. The U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in the
synthesis and characterization of new compounds. This is complemented by French
expertise in the structure and properties of solid state oxides and
chalcogenides.
