These investigators have examined the DNA content of individual cells of the
wild mushroom Amarilla mellea. They observed that the basidiocarp (the part
above ground) contains cells that have one haploid nucleus, while the mycelium
(root) is thought to be diploid. The meiotic events involved in spore formation
occur within specialized structures of the basidiocarp and must be separate from
those events that give rise to the haploid cells during generation of the
basidiocarp itself. The applicants propose a careful microscpoic examination of
the basidiocarp to determine the site (or timing) of haplodization. They hope to
identify particular cells undergoing meiotic divisions and to characterize the
structure of the chromosomes in these cells. They also propose a simple genetic
test of individual cells to see if the haploid cells have different genotypes.
If present, such genetic mosaicism could play an important role in the
regulation of development of the organism. Besides documenting an unusual and
interesting phenomenon, these studies will provide an opportunity for a number
of undergraduates to participate in scientific research.
