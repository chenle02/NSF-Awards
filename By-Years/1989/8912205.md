The Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory (RMBL) is an independent, non-profit
field station that provides facilities for researchers studying high-altitude
biology in an excellent, nearly pristine field setting. Researchers have come to
RMBL for almost six decades, and during that time have patiently coped with
inadequate housing. This project will provide funds to construct two cabins,
each housing two to four persons; these will be matched by an equal number of
new cabins, to be constructed by RMBL as cost sharing. Each of these simple one-
room cabins will contain a loft, cold-water plumbing and electricity. The cabins
are for summer use only, but must be designed ruggedly to withstand the rigors
of climate at RMBL's 2900-foot elevation. The cabins will replace current
researcher cabins that are in a state of advanced disrepair.
