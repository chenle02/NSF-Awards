This project focuses on a detailed study of Dendrochronology as a science
discipline (tree ring dating), and places it in an historical context. Andrew
Ellicott Douglass, one of America's premier astronomers, was the founder and
early developer of the discipline of dendrochronology. The project seeks to
answer several fundamental questions: 1) what was the role of Sequoiadendron
giganteum, the Giant Sequoia, in the establishment of dendrochronology? 2) The
basis for the choice of Sequoiadendron giganteum as Andrew Ellicott Douglass's
second test species is little understood, but there were and are problems
employing this plant from a botanical standpoint that could have severely
restricted the early development of the field. How Douglass chose to use sequoia
represents the second question. 3) Finally, and inextricably linked to the
second question, is the question of the choice of organism. Was sequoia the
`right organism for the job?` The research will be undertaken in the well-
ordered Douglass papers in the University of Arizona Library.
