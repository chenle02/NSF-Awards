Abramovitch 9304094 This award will support collaborative research between
Rudolph Abramovitch, Clemson University, and A. P. Rauter, University of Lisbon,
Portugal. This project will develop the synthesis of (i) medium ring homologs of
known flavonoids and flavanols and (ii) macrocyclic diphenyl ether lactones
related to known naturally occurring ring synthesis, e.g. Combrestastin D-2. The
research strengths of the two participants are complementary. Dr. Rauter's work
on the chemistry of flavonoids has provided a basis for synthesizing medium ring
homologs of flavonoids and flavanols. Dr. Abramovitch's on cyclizations using
nitrenium ions provides a methodology permitting novel and ready access. The
Portuguese part of the project will explore whether ketones (or enols) can trap
arylnitrenium ions to form C-O-C bonds. The Clemson study will explore whether
molecular modelling studies (MMX and AM1) can predict which starting materials
have the right geometry to undergo macrocyclizations. ***
