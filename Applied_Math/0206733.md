ABSTRACT

The proposed research explores the mathematical and physical aspects of particle
transport in one-dimensional channels. Mean-field analysis of Asymmetric
Exclusion Processes (ASEP) will be studied analytically and extended to include
spatially varying pore-particle interactions and time-dependent behavior. A
three-state ASEP will also be developed for modeling proton conduction along
water wires. Mean-field and Monte Carlo simulations will be used to obtain
steady-state proton currents as functions of both proton concentration and
electric potential differences across the pore. Finally, an analysis of
interacting particle transport across periodically structured pores will be
performed. Analogies with commensurate-incommensurate phase transitions will be
explored within Frenkel-Kontorowa type models.

Pore transport is a general process vital for separations and catalysis
technologies, electrochemical applications, and cell function. In the limit of
small, molecular-sized pores connecting two particle reservoirs, the motions of
the transported species can be restricted to one dimension. One-dimensional
pores are reasonable models for an enormous number of systems including ion
channels in cells (which mediate electrolyte balance) and zeolites (minerals
that are used to separate hydrocarbon products and mediate chemical reactions).
Therefore, theoretical models that can predict the rate at which molecules enter
and react within structured one-dimensional channels will aid in the design of
molecularly tailored pores in both the industrial and biological settings.
Computational simulations will be used to validate the proposed theoretical
models.
