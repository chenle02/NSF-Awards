9626541 Olafsson This proposal lies in the area of harmonic analysis on
symmetric spaces. More specifically, it has to do with harmonic analysis and
representation theory on causal symmetric spaces. The investigator plans to
study Paley-Wiener theorems for the spherical Laplace transform; causal
compactification and the relation to Hardy spaces on tube domains; analytic
continuation of unitary representations between dual real forms. Causal
symmetric spaces, and more generally, causal manifolds, are modeled after the
space-time continuum. There are two distinguishing feature about causal
symmetric spaces: a temporal orientation is defined on a causal manifold;
symmetries preserving this temporal structure play a dominant role in studying
them.
