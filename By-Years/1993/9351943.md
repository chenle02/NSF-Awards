9351943 Mikkelson In order to provide our students with an effective environment
in which to develop graphics and image processing programs, a system consisting
of a graphics workstation and four X- Terminals is requested. This equipment
will allow our Computer Graphics course to shift its emphasis from low-level
algorithms for generating graphical output primitives and GKS to higher- level
problems dealing with three dimensional graphics, PHIGS and animation. A
collection of tools for building an effective graphical interface based on
standard software in an instructional setting will be designed.The equipment
requested will also allow our Image Processing students to experiment with the
relevant algorithms interactively. An image processing "workbench" will be
developed to serve as an interactive framework within which our students will
implement their programming assignments. This will facilitate learning by
providing an interactive environment for experimenting with the algorithms and
yet allow the students to focus on the basic principles and algorithms involved
without spending excessive amounts of time in the image processing course on the
overall interactive program design. ***
