These experiments will examine the basal ganglia, a part of the brain which
controls movement. In the brain nerve cells form connections with each other and
transmit to one another information that is determined partially by the
chemicals contained within them. However, the ability of the brain in adult
mammals to repair itself following injury or disease is limited and not well
understood. One response of nerve cell death in the basal ganglia is that the
surviving cells appear to reorganize. In other words, the nerve cells form new
connections with cells they do not normally communicate with. The goal of Dr.
Roberts research is to develop anatomical techniques that will allow her to
identify the cells that form these new connections. In addition, Dr. Roberts
will determine the chemical composition of these cells following nerve cell
loss. These experiments which will characterize the surviving nerve cells, will
provide clues as to the functional impact of these changes and may begin to
explain the elements necessary for repair and recovery in the brain after the
injury.
