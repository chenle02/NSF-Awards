Research Objectives and Approaches:&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is
to identify magnetic geometries with ?constant? distribution of magnetic flux,
and to demonstrate magnetic components with energy density 30%-50% higher than
state of the art. The approach is organized into three tasks: Synthesis of
Constant-Flux Magnetic Geometries, Electro-Magnetic Modeling, and Broader
Impact. Inductors with multiple windings will be identified based on synthesis
factors, and verified by finite-element simulation. Practical processes will be
identified for manufacturing of the selected geometries. Design-oriented models
will be developed for performance metrics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual
Merit:&lt;br/&gt;At least 30% of the volume in commercial inductors stores no or
negligible energy. The ?constant-flux? concept improves energy density by
filling the available volume with as much magnetic (core) materials as
practically feasible, then dispersing the windings to shape the distribution of
magnetic flux, e.g., to distribute magnetic flux uniformly. Guiding principles
will be developed from the structural and field standpoints to realize the
constant-flux concept. Performance metrics, such as inductances, capacitances,
and quality factor will be modeled, quantified, and compared with the
corresponding benchmarks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;Demo
modules will be developed for rising junior and senior high-school girls who
participate in a summer camp called C-Tech2 (Computer and Technology and
Virginia Tech) to develop and sustain the students? interest in engineering and
sciences. Through an interdisciplinary program called Scieneering, sophomore and
junior Scieneers will be selected to execute part of the research plan. Industry
mentors will be invited to help establishing a path to commercialization.
