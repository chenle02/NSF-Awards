The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology
Transfer Program (STTR) Phase I project is to provide 7.7 M women in the US
struggling with infertility a quantitative and affordable way to assess their
ovulatory health. This progesterone biosensor is the first outcome of a platform
technology that to expand at-home blood diagnostics and analysis for remote
health care. This project will produce the first of a novel class of
inexpensive, real-time, and point-of-care biosensors that will impact multiple
fields and markets, such as human and animal healthcare, agriculture, national
defense, and biomanufacturing. The initial application will further expand
access to quality health care for underserved populations. The proposed project
develops a device to measure progesterone at clinically meaningful low levels
from blood samples for patients including women who have never been pregnant,
women with ovarian disorders, pre-menopausal and post-menopausal
women.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Technology Transfer Program
(STTR) Phase I project is developing an entirely novel class of biosensors for
physiologically important molecules with progesterone being the first example.
The technical hurdles to be addressed by the proposed work in this proposal are
to first translate optical transduction technology onto low-cost paper strips.
Furthermore, determine if this new class of biosensors can measure molecules,
such as progesterone, from blood to criteria required for clinical use and
commercialization from paper test strips. Lastly, determine the impact of
clinical requirements for a low-cost and portable measurement device to read the
paper lateral flow strips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
