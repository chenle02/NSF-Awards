9413515 Ostriker This award is for the acquisition of a massively parallel,
scalable parallel computer. The planned computer will allow development and
running of computer codes at Princeton and, for those problems requiring a more
powerful computer, running the same codes at a supercomputing center. The
research supported by this computing platform consists of the numerical study of
hydrodynamics. The application areas to be studied are aerodynamics, turbulence
research, and structure formation in the universe. These application areas are
typical of computational grand challenges requiring substantial computational
resources to solve. ***
