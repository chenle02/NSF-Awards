Five private and five public colleges and universities located within or at the
western boundary of appalachia and having an aggregate student body of over
60,000 are promoting the implementation of modern calculus curricula in their
region by: (1) developing and achieving full implementation of calculus programs
at their own institutions and (2) sharing the knowledge and experience gained
through an extensive program of dissemination directed at both high schools and
sister institutions. The availability, within the region, of a large,
documented, widely disseminated sample of successful approaches and
implementations is expected to motivate, encourage, and facilitate similar
efforts at other regional colleges and universities. The latter, combined with
programs to inform and involve high school teachers of calculus will contribute
to the further extension of a revised calculus in the schools. In addition to
workshops, consortium communication will be facilitated through an electronic
network.
