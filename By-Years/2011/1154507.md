The Saddleback College S-STEM Scholars Program is utilizing S-STEM scholarship
funding to support academically talented and financially needy students in STEM
disciplines. The Scholars Program is awarding crucial financial aid to 14-20
full time students each academic year. It serves to support students entering
Mathematics, Pre-Engineering, and Chemistry programs and allows them to pursue
their immediate educational goal of completing an associate degree and/or
transferring to a university to complete a BS degree in a STEM major. Recruiting
efforts for the program are focused on underrepresented populations and
veterans. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to providing student financial
support, S-STEM Scholars are encouraged to engage in extra-curricular
opportunities in research (Chemistry/Engineering) and computer applet
development under the direct supervision of faculty mentors and research
collaborators. Creating a sense of family for the S-STEM scholars is a critical
piece of this program, and social activities serve to bring S-STEM scholars,
faculty members, and other highly motivated STEM students together on a regular
basis to promote networking and a sense of belonging to a group with shared
interests and goals. Additionally, many S-STEM scholars participate in STEM
related conferences as a group with their faculty mentor. S-STEM Scholars attend
transfer workshops as a group and must complete a transfer assessment through
the Saddleback College Transfer Center after being selected for the program.
Participants receive group and individual tutoring as needed and attend a
workshop on Research Ethics as part of the overall program, and they also
participate in career guidance seminars and assess internship opportunities with
STEM industry partners.
