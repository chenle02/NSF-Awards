With the fast development of information technology and the emergence of online
networks, an increasing number of large scale dynamic network data sets become
available. This project develops statistical analysis and modeling of dynamic
networks. The model under study has the advantage of providing rich
visualization of the dynamics of the network, allowing better understanding of
the network structure as well as the behavior of individual nodes. The proposed
inference procedure makes it possible to handle large scale dynamic network
data, such as gene regulatory networks and disease transmission networks. The
model can be used to analyze terrorist networks, study social interaction
patterns, model disease transmission, and much more. The research project
provides an ideal opportunity for involvement of students with a broad range of
background and interests. Additional broader impacts include incorporation of
the methods into relevant courses and dissemination of research results to the
scientific community.

This project develops statistical models and inference procedures for dynamic
networks, including binary networks, weighted networks, and other complex
networks. A state space model will be developed which embeds dynamic network
data into a latent Euclidean space, allowing each node to have a temporal
trajectory in this latent space. A Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm is
proposed to estimate the model parameters and latent positions of the nodes in
the network. The model parameters provide insight into the structure of the
network, and the visualization provided from the model gives insight into the
network dynamics. In addition, the model can handle missing edge data and
predict future edges between nodes. The methods will be applied to real network
data from natural and social sciences.
