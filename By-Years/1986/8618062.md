This is a fundamental engineering research program that will attempt to
mathematically formulate the immune system as a very complex system of molecular
reactions and cell interactions. It is clear that one must quantitate these
processes to provide some sense of order to this complexity. The purpose of this
research is to attempt to provide a set of equations that can be used to model
the immunological processes. This will entail a description of the cell-cell
interactions as well as the biochemical reactions. Ultimately such a model could
provide the basis for administering drug therapy and possibly correctly
determining the prognosis of a disease state.
