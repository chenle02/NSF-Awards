This award provides support for the Institute for Theoretical Atomic and
Molecular Physics (ITAMP) at the Harvard/Smithsonian. The funds are used for a
postdoctoral program, a long and short term visitor program and for wokshops.
The postdoctoral students are provided a unique atmosphere where they can work
freely with the Harvard faculty or staff members of the Smithsonian. The visitor
program provides a focus for bringing together geographically dispersed members
of the AMO community to work together or separately on problems of current
interest in atomic, molecular and optical theory. The workshops, which are
attended on a regular basis by senior and junior scientists, students, and
postdoctorals are devoted to current "hot" topics in the field or are designed
to focus the community on subjects of broad interest.
