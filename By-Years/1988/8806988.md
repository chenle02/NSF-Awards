Quantitative data on the behavior of structures during earthquakes is important
to the evaluation of design methods and building code provisions. These data
allow analytical models to be verified and major damage patterns to be observed.
This research project uses quantitative data collected during the November 24,
1987 Superstition Hills earthquake. Specifically, instruments recorded the
structural behavior of a hospital building on the threshold of major damage. The
research project provides documentation of the damage to the structure.
Additionally, vibration tests are being conducted both prior to and after the
structure has been repaired and retrofitted. This research, along with the
analytical study, provides for an evaluation of current design procedures and
seismic design code provisions.
