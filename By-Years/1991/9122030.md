The principal investigator will work on conformal field theories associated to
the Monster simple group. These will provide the first constructions of
conformal field theories on an orbifold corresponding to cyclic groups of order
greater than two. Constructions based on all 23 Niemaier lattices will be
investigated, with the expectation that clues to a covariant construction of the
Moonshine module based on the 26-dimensional Lorentzian lattice will emerge. The
principal investigator will also investigate the genus zero partition functions
associated to certain sporadic groups which he has recently discovered. Some
recent ideas involving the interplay between algebraic varieties and group
representations will be pursued. This research is concerned with problems in
group theory. In classifying the finite simple groups, a particularly large
group which is called the Monster simple group was discovered. Subsequently, it
has been found that the Monster simple group has interesting connections with
the study of Lie algebras and with mathematical physics. This particular project
is aimed at better understanding these relationships.
