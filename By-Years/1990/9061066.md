The proposal is to develop a methodology for testing VLSI CAD software tools,
and validate it on a portion of the Berkeley VLSI CAD tool set. The validation
approach is to adapt known software testing techniques to testing of CAD tool
software. Comparison of runs on the test cases is made to the results defined in
the specifications. Research being done is: (1) define the form of the
functional specifications; (2) develop test strategies based on the
specifications, but recognize that specs are not complete and use some test
strategies that are independent of input-output specifications; (3) determine
test cases generated from the tool's functional specifications and logical -
structural properties; and (4) prototype test the methodology.
