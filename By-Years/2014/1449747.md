Existing robotic platforms in the market have serious limitations for natural
face-to-face communication. An alternative approach that could overcome many of
these problems is to use state-of-the-art character animation technologies to
project lifelike 3-D models onto a robotic mask that can display the 3-D models?
natural speech and facial expressions. Currently, there are no such animation-
based human robotic agents available in the market that can be acquired, nor can
such capabilities be assembled from plug-and-play mechatronic components without
significant design work and customization. In this proposal the team has
developed a robotic head that projects an animation on a translucent custom
designed facial mask to mimic emotive facial gestures and visual speech.

The proposed product (ExpressionBot) is an extremely low-cost and portable
robotic head using animation-projection and a custom designed facial mask that
can display rich emotive facial gestures and visual speech generated by an
avatar agent. The agent can speak, produce and mirror facial expressions
synchronized with agent?s visual and prosodic speech. The ExpressionBot can be
used as science tutor in classrooms, companionbots in nursing homes, museums
tour guide, hotels receptionists, and tourist information kiosks. The
ExpressionBot1 comprises a rich Physical Display Portal complete with software
libraries for robotic character instantiation including facial expression
generation and visual speech generation, human facial recognition, human speech
recognition and natural language processing, and world environment recognition.
