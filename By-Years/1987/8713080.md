This project in the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is a
continuation of studies on the design and development of fundamentally new
reactions, reagents, and strategies for organic synthesis, with an emphasis on
how three dimensional molecular features influence the formation of large rings.
The synthesis of a variety of diastereomers of erythronolide A seco acid will be
investigated based on the recently developed route to a protected form of the
"natural" seco acid. The synthetic seco acid diastereomers will be used to study
the relationship between seco acid configuration, conformation and macrolactone
efficiency. Relevant to macrolactone biosynthesis, a new preparation of the
putative biosynthetic precursor of all erythromycins, 6-deoxyerythronolide B,
will be prepared. This will entail an investigation into stereoselectivities of
acyclic beta-hydroxy radical reactions, an area of acyclic stereochemical
control that has not been investigated. Finally, the preparation of an
artificial macrolactonization enzyme will be initiated.
