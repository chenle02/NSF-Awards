Dr. Rebecca Conry, Department of Chemistry, University of Nevada, is supported
by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program of the Chemistry
Division under a Research Planning Grant to prepare soluble copper complexes
that will act as homogeneous catalysts for the reduction of carbon dioxide.
Three types of low-valent copper complexes including Cu(I) hydrides, Cu(0)
complexes, and heterobimetallic copper/zinc systems will be investigated for
their ability to reduce carbon dioxide. Multi-electron reduction pathways will
be a primary focus of this work. These planning activities will advance Dr.
Conry's career by providing a basis for preparing a competitive NSF research
proposal subsequent to the completion of this Research Planning Grant.
Activation of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide is important because of its
implications for global warming. Three strategies for catalytically reducing
carbon dioxide are proposed which utilize copper in a variety of oxidation
states and coordination environments. Current industrial processes which involve
reactions with solid surfaces form the basis for the compounds proposed. The
reactivity of the copper compounds will be explored in homogeneous solution with
the ultimate goal of converting carbon dioxide into useful products.
