Abstract: This award furnishes support for an international conference on
singular and oscillatory integrals to be held on the campus of the University of
Wisconsin-Madison from January 7 to January 11, 1999. The funds will be used to
cover travel and local expenses of the principal speakers as well as to support
travel and local expenses of other participants. The meeting will focus mainly
on Fourier and oscillatory integral operators, singular Radon transforms,
oscillatory integrals, and their applications to partial differential equations.

Harmonic analysis, the subject of this conference, has historically had and
continues to have a major impact in various areas of mathematics and its
applications. Its methods have been applied in partial differential equations,
probability, complex analysis, mathematical physics, and integral geometry.
Harmonic analysis has also had a crucial role to play in the dramatic
developments that recent years have witnessed in such concrete areas as
numerical analysis, tomography, and image processing.
