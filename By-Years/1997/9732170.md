9732170 Miller This project requests funds for the support of the design and
conduct of a national study of public understanding of and attitudes toward
biotechnology in the United States, coordinated with the work in the European
Union, Japan, and Canada. Various governmental bodies in Europe, Japan, and
Canada have funded the basic field work in these countries. All of these data
are available for comparative analyses if the United States has a comparable
data set to make available to the other cooperating nation. ***
