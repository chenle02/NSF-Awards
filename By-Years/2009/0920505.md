Animals contain billions of bacteria and most benefit the health of their animal
hosts. Currently, the effects of symbiotic bacteria on the behavior of their
animal hosts remain largely unexplored. Symbiotic bacteria potentially figure
prominently in animal communication, especially among mammals. Many mammals
communicate by scent-marking with products of specialized glands. These glands
are highly conducive to bacterial proliferation, and it has been postulated that
the volatile odorants the bacteria generate are used by their hosts in
communication. This project uses current insights and tools of microbial ecology
to elucidate the effects of symbiotic bacteria on the scent-marking system of
the spotted hyena, a socially complex large carnivore found throughout Sub-
Saharan Africa. Scent discrimination experiments with hyenas in Kenya will
illustrate the information content of hyenas' scent-marks. Chemical analyses
will further illustrate the information content of their marks and also reveal
how that information is chemically coded. Culture-independent molecular surveys
of the same scent-marks will indicate whether variation in symbiotic bacterial
communities underlies the coding of information in scent-marks. Lastly,
contemporary culturing techniques will be used to isolate prominent members of
scent gland bacterial communities, and to ascertain whether they produce the
odorants that, as indicated by the chemical analyses, likely code information in
scent-marks. This project will enhance our understanding of the potential roles
of bacteria in mammalian chemical communication systems. The project will
involve the training of undergraduates across disciplinary boundaries,
integrating cutting-edge advances in molecular biology into animal behavior
research. It will result in public access to over one million molecular
sequences from an entirely novel symbiotic environment, and should stimulate
multi-disciplinary partnerships to generate a central online database enabling
rapid access to molecular sequences from symbiotic systems. This project should
be transformative, opening up a rich new field of study and altering our
perceptions of symbiotic bacteria and the behavior of their animal hosts.
