Drs. Alice J. Cunningham and Joseph L. Glajch of the Division of Analytical
Chemistry (DAC) of the American Chemical Society (ACS) will organize and conduct
a novel three year symposium series entitled "New Voices at the Frontiers" for
inclusion in the April 1995, March 1996, and April 1997 national ACS meetings.
The major objective of these symposia is to provide a prominent forum for
increasing the visibility and participation of young chemists in the analytical
chemistry research and education community. The invited participants will be
current award recipients of the DAC Graduate Fellowships and/or the IM Kolthoff
Enrichment Undergraduate Awards. Each awardee will present a 20 - 25 minute
presentation of his or her accomplishments. In addition, each symposium will
include a 45 minute keynote address to be given by a preeminent analytical
chemist known for accomplishments as a researcher or educator. All participants
in the program will be guests of honor at a reception immediately preceding the
DAC poster session.
