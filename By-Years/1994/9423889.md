9423889 Ezekiel Massachusetts Institute of Technology "Research in Networked
Multimedia Information Services - DUET Additions" This project was requested and
funded by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA). NSF is handling the
award because of its interest in this and related projects, some joint-funded
with ARPA. The award supports a 13 month project to deploy a 300 gigabyte,
network attached, modem accessible super-server to a DOD/ARPA specified
militaryy installation; loading CD-RO,based programs onto the server; and
conducting research on the technologies and economics of dial-up, low bandwidth
local access to it and other digital libraries. Four PC/workstations with modems
are being supplied to field test sites, and eight rack-mounted modems are being
installed at the server site. The services are being provided over ISDN lines.
DUET in the title stands for Dual Use Education and Training, referring to
military and civilian education applications. Most of the effort is being
performed under a subcontract from MIT to Dartmouth College and Medical School.
