Trigonometric parallaxes of nearby stars are fewer in number and lower in
precision than is generally perceived. Most parallax determinations are more
than twenty years old and thus have errors much larger than those possible in
recent years, even with conventional equipment. This program has made use of
this increase in precision in obtaining parallaxes and proper motions since
1967. It is one of the two most extensive such programs now active. It would
continue to enrich the number of high-precision parallaxes and photometry of
stars of the lower main sequence, as well as subdwarf type stars. These stars
are among the oldest in our Galaxy, and their parallaxes and distances are not
now well known. It is expected that the program will calibrate the distance
scale of these old stars with much greater precision than is now available.
Photometry and possibly radial velocities are acquired as necessary. It is also
intended that students will be trained in all aspects of the program.
