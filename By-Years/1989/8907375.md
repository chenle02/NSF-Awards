This proposal requests support to obtain a Time-Resolved Spectrofluorometer.
This equipment enables one to measure very fast processes, occurring in the time
scales of microsecond to 100 picoseconds, in biological energy conversion and
light- induced structural changes in biomolecules and membranes. The proposed
instrument will be the only one of its kind at the University of Nebraska. Since
this instrument is essential in studying very fast reactions involved in
biological energy conversion (as in photosynthesis and photobiology) and
structural changes of the biomolecules systems (as biomembranes and proteins), a
number of researchers at UNL are expected to make use of this equipment in their
research. Graduate students will also be exposed to this equipment for their
training and graduate research. The initial experiments anticipated to be
performed with this equipment include studies of (1) the phototransformation of
phytochrome, a light-regulator of gene expression for the biogenesis of
photosynthetic apparatus in green plants, (2) the structure and topography of
photosynthetic pigments, and (3) structure-function relationships and dynamic
properties of DNA, proteins and model biological membranes. The first two areas
of the proposed studies focus on elucidating the primary molecular processes of
the tetrapyrrole-based photoreceptors in plant photobiological systems.
