This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project is in the general
area of infrared (IR) spectrometry in the subfield of chemical analysis. This
project will develop linear detector arrays for application to infrared
spectroscopy. The availability of these uncooled arrays will lead to the
development of a new generation of IR spectrometers. The advantages associated
with array-based instruments (no moving parts, high measurement speed,
ruggedness, and reduced cost) will then be extended to the infrared region of
the spectrum. In Phase I, single element detectors were fabricated using thin
film deposition and etching techniques. These broadband bolometers incorporate
recently-developed high temperature-coefficient of resistance films, absorber
layers and ultra-thin substrates. Measured detectivities (at 15 Hz) are three
times higher than observed in the best commercially available uncooled IR
detectors. In Phase II, research will concentrate on fabricating and testing
linear detector arrays of high performance. %%% This research has the potential
of allowing spectrometer builders to reach the goal of a compact mid-infrared
spectrometer with no moving parts having high stability and reliability. This
would be of great value in education and technology.
