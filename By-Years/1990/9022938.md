In this project the principal investigator will study a number of problems in
complex analysis and potential theory. In particular, he will investigate the
global behavior of solutions of holomorphic Cauchy problems, the spectra of
various potential theoretic integral operators, the cyclicity of the shift
operator on Bergman spaces, and the reflection of harmonic functions in higher
dimensions. The techniques used to attack such a diversity of problems are drawn
from the theory of partial differential equations, complex analysis and
potential theory. Historically the areas of mathematics known as the theory of
partial differential equations and the theory of complex variables have been
closely associated with each other. Indeed much of nineteenth century
mathematics revolved around this relationship between partial differential
equations and complex variables, with each area having a profound influence on
the other. In this project the principal investigator will use this symbiotic
relationship between the two areas to study a number of interesting problems
involving harmonic functions in several space dimensions. ***//
