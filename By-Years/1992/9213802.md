This grant is for funding of the U.S. Particle Accelerator School (USPAS) in
association with the Applied Physics Department of Stanford University. The
school will consist of a program of graduate level credit courses in beam
physics and accelerator technology aimed at education of young physicists, as
well as older physicists in a transition phase from other areas of specialty, in
the methods of accelerator design. A great National need for such persons
presently exists. These schools have become a very valuable part of the particle
physics scene in our Nation and the World. Accelerator physics is being taught
at only a very few Universities as well as at some National Laboratories. The
accelerator school is held in the Summer, and forms a valuable part of the
effort required to educate students in the art of accelerator design.
