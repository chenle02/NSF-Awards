Clothing is used in every culture to express ethnic and cultural identity. It
is heavily laden with symbols that often function along social lines. This
research project will focus on the use of cloth and textiles in establishing and
maintaining cultural identity among marginalized ethnic groups in developing
countries with significant out-migration. Specifically the researcher will look
at the Andean groups in Sacaca, Bolivia in order to study the socio-economic
conditions of textile production and use. Textiles are also becoming important
economically. The study will investigate the productive roles of Andean women,
who weave textiles for the international market in ethnic art. This research
will advance studies of the semiotic and economic aspects of cultural systems.
While there is extensive literature on the technical and iconographic features
of Andean textiles, little research has been done on meaning and cloth's place
in the cultural system in a political, economic, and historical context.
