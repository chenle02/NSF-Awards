This project addresses the control of nonlinearly flexible structures. The
intent is to determine stabilizing controls based on the energy-momentum
methodology. The system considered comprises a flexible assemblage and a
controller. The demand is imposed that a specified state be an equilibrium
state, and then the energy-momentum method is used to find conditions which the
controller must satisfy, thus characterizing a class of stabilizing controllers.
A nonlinear model for the flexible appendage is used and imposes no restrictions
on deformation.
