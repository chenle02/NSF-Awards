This research, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the
Chemistry Division, will apply information theoretic techniques to thermally
modulated gas chromatography. Approaches previously employed mainly by
spectrocscopists will be used to improve detection limits and mixture complexity
addressable by gas chromatography. For simple mixtures, increased speed of
analysis will result. Noise characteristics of injectors, detectors, and
modulators will be considered in designing novel modes of chromatographic
analysis. %%% This research will apply Fourier Transform and correlation signal
processing to thermally modulated gas chromatography, a technique for separating
and identifying volatile chemical species. Depending on the specific approach
and problem, enhancements to detection or improvements in continuous on-line
monitoring of industrial processes should result.
