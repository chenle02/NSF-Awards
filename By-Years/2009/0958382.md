Abstract: This EAGER proposal focuses on developing a proof of concept that will
help to facilitate the creation and sustainability of standards-based digital
object repositories for social science data. The activities to bring about this
transformative outcome entail development of potential technology services and
sharable tools to transform metadata from the Data Documentation Initiative
(DDI) standards for social science into forms that can be ingested into a
FEDORA-like repository. The products developed will demonstrate at the
institutional level how the Open Archival Information System (OAIS) Reference
Model can be deployed using social science contexts. The innovative nature of
this effort will be in actual demonstration of end-to-end performance of
integrated capabilities that address future needs anticipated for data curation,
preservation, and access. The latter are of particular focus throughout the
focus of social disciplines at the community, national and international levels
of information exchange and discourse. International partners in the United
Kingdom and Australia will participate in the testing and evaluation of this
proof of concept to ensure broader participation and extend global partnerships.
