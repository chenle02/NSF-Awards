Professor Theodore Cohen, of the Department of Chemistry at the University of
Pittsburgh, is supported by the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program for
his studies of metallo-ene cyclization reactions. Both the insertion of
titanocene into allyl phenyl sulfides and the tandem additions of homoallyl and
bis(homoallyl) metals to dienes afford substrates for titana-ene cyclizations.
These are carried out stoichiometrically, but may be adapted for the
cyclopolymerization of conjugated dienes through the use of excess diene,
affording robust ladder polymers. This work is complemented by Professor Cohen's
investigation of allyl phenyl sulfides as substrates for the preparation of
allyl Grignard reagents, which in turn permit the synthesis of a wider variety
of substrates for metallo-ene cyclizations. Reductive lithiation of
phenylthioethers affords homoallyl- and bis(homoallyl)lithiums, offering access
to anion-accelerated ene cyclization reactions through their addition to dienes.
With the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor
Theodore Cohen, of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Pittsburgh,
is developing new and efficient methods for the synthesis of cyclic organic
compounds. Through the discovery and exploitation of new reactions of particular
classes of organometallic compounds (compounds containing bonds between metal
and carbon atoms), Professor Cohen readily accesses complex cyclic structures of
utility in the synthesis of natural products and fine chemicals. These reactions
may be readily adapted to permit the synthesis of `ladder` polymers which
display important physical and chemical properties, such as heat and chemical
resistance, imparted by their unique structural features.
