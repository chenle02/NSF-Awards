This project focuses on the effects of legal counsel from the perspective of
"party capability theory," a set of ideas which proposes that powerful and
organized parties who use courts routinely hold tactical and strategic advantage
over weaker parties, especially individual litigants who use judicial resources
only intermittently. Specifically, it investigates whether and how disparities
between counsel related resources affect the ruling made by an appellate court.
In addition, the research employs a multivariate statistical model to assess the
importance of counsel related resources in relation to other explanations for
outcomes in appellate courts. In addition to advancing empirical understanding
of whether and how lawyers make a difference in litigation, the cross-national
framework, focusing on the English Court of Appeals, enables exploration of the
extent to which party capability theory is context-bound to the U.S. experience.
