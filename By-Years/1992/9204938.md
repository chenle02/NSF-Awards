Research will continue in the areas of nonlinear filtering, Markov chains, and
branching processes. In nonlinear filtering, approximations will be studied and
comparisons will be made between various approximations. For Markov chains on a
general state space, consistent and asymptotically normal estimates of the
transition function are to be sought. Large deviations of the estimates of the
population in a supercritical branching process will also be investigated.
Research will be done on distinguishing between the original signal and
interference when a signal has been received. In addition, attempts will be made
to estimate the probability structure of certain types of randomly evolving
processes.
