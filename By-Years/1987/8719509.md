A numerical computer code is to be completed and tested against an already
available benchmark laboratory experiment for the case of stably stratified
turbulent flow. The code is based on a Large Eddy Simulation in which variable
grid refinement and resolution is utilized to everywhere push the sub-grid
turbulence effects into regions small enough to validate a universal sub-grid
model which is independent of stratification and buoyancy effects. The eventual
application of the code is to be modeling of stratified reservoirs and lakes,
focusing on mixing and dispersion. The purpose of the model is to use adaptive
grid methodology to produce much more accurate and high resolution results at a
degree of complexity and cost no greater than these now used in the field.
