9523127 Rao The principal objective of this research is to develop a new class
of modeling and computational methods to solve certain very large-scale
structural optimization problems. In particular, the focus is on the topology
design of discrete structures, which are recognized as one of the most important
and challenging problems in the field of applied optimization. These new methods
are based on the principles of mathematical duality and have so far been
deployed with remarkable success in two application classes: the maximum
stiffness design of elastic structures and the minimum weight design of plastic
structures. This work will significantly broaden the class of problems where
similar duality-based methods can be applied. The major components of this
project are the new modeling capability due to primal-dual transformations in
various applications and the efficient, problem specific nonsmooth algorithms
that exploit the structure of the resulting min-max formulations. In advancing
the frontiers of modern design techniques, researchers are constantly seeking
scientific and mathematical tools by which satisfactory (i.e., feasible) or even
optimal designs can be efficiently computed. While this has lead to numerous
very successful applications in a wide cross-section of engineering disciplines,
the class of problems related to the topology or configuration design of
discrete structures had remained distinctly unsolved until the recent emergence
of these duality-based methods. Further development of these methods will
represent a significant advance in applied design optimization, and will show
how new and provably optimum topologies can be generated for static and dynamic
load-bearing structures in a variety of automotive, civil and aerospace
applications.
