The adhesion of lymphocytes to one another or to other cells is a poorly
understood phenomenon which is presently analyzed via purely qualitative and
non-physical methods. To address this concern, the Principal Investigators
propose to characterize fundamental physical, chemical, and molecular
interactions that occur during the process of lyphocyte adhesion. This
characterization will be achieved through: - Measurement of affinity constants
of known adhesion molecules. - Quantification of the rate of change of the rate
of change of the intercellular contact area during the adhesion event.
Techniques in fluorescence energy transfer spectroscopy, video microscopy, and
digital image analysis will be employed for this analysis and the results will
be used to develop physical and mathematical models of lymphocyte adhesion
processes.
