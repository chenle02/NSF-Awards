This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will explore
alternative parallelization techniques for very largescale data
intensive&lt;br/&gt;applications on emerging new parallel architectures,
including distributed memory computer&lt;br/&gt;clusters using multicore and
GPGPU processors. The experimental environment includes an&lt;br/&gt;application
and system for large scale image classification and orientation suitable for use
in&lt;br/&gt;geographic information systems. A variety of evaluation hardware is
expected to be available&lt;br/&gt;for the project. The ultimate goal of this
research is to leverage large scale systems, especially&lt;br/&gt;storage, to
provide services to end users in the form of geospatial data. The proposed
research&lt;br/&gt;will leverage preliminary work by the PIs in the application
of CUDA and MPI programming and&lt;br/&gt;will demonstrate the application of
these technologies to very large scale storage, potentially&lt;br/&gt;holding
multiple terabytes of aerial and satellite imagery.
