The Ceratopsia or horned dinosaurs represent an evolutionary radiation of
dinosaurs rich in morphological variation but circumscribed taxonomically. The
known history of the Ceratopsia extends between late Early Cretaceous and the
end of the Cretaceous. Major patterns of the phylogenetic and stratigraphic
history of the Ceratopsia have been established. The purpose of the proposed
study is to apply procedures of modern multivariate morphometrics, including
tensor methods of landmark analysis, finite-element analyses, principal
components analyses with appropriate shear, and resistant-fit theta-rho
analysis, to samples of Centrosaurus and Chasmosaurus in order to map out
patterns of variation within species. A point of focus will be the documentation
of fluctuating asymmetries, which may reveal the genetic structure of the
species. Functional trends in ceratopsian skulls will be traced, and
stratigraphic trends in the evolution of the masticatory system will be
determined. I will test the hypothesis that changes in the jaw suspensorium;
rejection of this hypothesis will call into question the use of the frill for
muscle origins. This study will provide a model for further studies of dinosaur
morphometrics, and will contribute to understanding biodiversity of the past,
and thus the biodiversity of our own world.
