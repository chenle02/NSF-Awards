This project will support international travel by US cognitive scientists
participating in the scientific program at the meeting of the Cognitive Science
Society, taking place July 21-24, 2005, in Stresa, Italy. The meeting is a key
venue for the exchange of scientific information among researchers in the
interdisciplinary field of cognitive science. Travel awards will be made to
approximately forty individuals conducting research in areas central to the NSF
mission, including research on human cognition, reasoning, learning, perception,
development, communication and language, social behavior and culture. The
majority of the awards will go to young scholars, either graduate students or
individuals who have received their Ph.D. degree within the last seven years. By
providing the opportunity for US scholars to forge connections with researchers
from the international community, the travel grant will increase the visibility
of young US cognitive scientists, strengthen and improve the impact of their
individual research programs, and enrich the world's store of scientific
knowledge in the field of cognitive science through collaboration. The proposed
use of funds fulfils the intellectual merit criterion by facilitating scientific
collaborations that contribute to the NSF mission of advancing scientific
research on these topics. The proposal also addresses the criterion of broader
impact on the research infrastructure by making it possible for young cognitive
scientists to participate in a crucial training experience that will foster the
visibility and quality of their research.
