Fields of convective clouds exhibit coherent weather and climate variability on
time and space scales that are very large with respect to individual cumulus
clouds and cloud systems. In the absence of adequate observations, this study
will employ cloud resolving models to explore the sensitivity of atmospheric
convection to its large-scale setting. Three hypotheses will be tested:
&lt;br/&gt; 1.) The occurrence of deep convection has a large sensitivity to
humidity in the free troposphere.&lt;br/&gt; 2.) The occurrence of deep
convection is more sensitive to temperature anomalies in the lower than the
upper troposphere.&lt;br/&gt; 3.) Large-scale variations of convection depend
importantly on large-scale variations of the statistics of small-scale
fluctuations, and not just on large-scale variations of mean
conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is expected that the results from this study
will usefully inform cumulus parameterization efforts in atmospheric models. The
project involves the participation of a post-doctoral associate.
