This Science in Developing Countries award will support travel to Chile and
Paraguay, per diem, and materials associated with the dissertation research of
R. Eduardo Palma, a Chilean doctoral student working under Donald Duszynski at
the University of New Mexico. The project aims to evaluate phylogenetic
relationships within the marsupial genus Thylamys, using molecular analytical
methods of allozyme variation and mtDNA. The molecular data are expected to
elucidate evolutionary relationships within the genus, since most studies have
been limited to morphologic and chromosomic analyses. The research also will
likely provide results needed to develop conservation strategies in the
Neotropics, a region in which research in systematic mammalogy is critical. Both
the U.S. and Chilean sides will benefit from new advances in South American
biogeography. The Chilean side will benefit from dissertation research support,
which will enhance collaborative ties between the U.S. and South America, the
region's scientific infrastructure, and its capacity for basic biological
research.
