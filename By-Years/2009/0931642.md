The Mathematical Biosciences Institute (MBI) is a research institute for the
mathematical sciences that fosters interdisciplinary research at the interface
of the mathematical and biological sciences. The mission of the MBI is (i) to
foster innovation in the development and application of mathematical,
statistical, and computational methods for the solution of significant problems
in the biosciences; (ii) to engage mathematical and biological scientists in the
solution of these problems; (iii) to expand the community of scholars in
mathematical biosciences through education, training, and support of students
and researchers. The mathematical sciences and the biological sciences have had
a long and fruitful relationship. The mathematical sciences have been used to
help model specific areas in the biological sciences and to understand the
implications of these models. The biological sciences have motivated the
development of new mathematical theories and techniques. MBI will continue to
support and encourage exploration of both directions of this interaction.

MBI brings together disparate communities to help initiate research within and
between disciplines and create new collaborations. MBI workshops are divided
between emphasis year activities that promote both breadth and depth in a
general area and current topic workshops that focus on emerging areas in the
biological sciences that are ripe for modeling or on emerging areas in the
mathematical sciences that are needed for progress in biology. MBI also
influences and is influenced by the mathematical biology community through its
Institute Partner program and its various outreach programs. MBI's education
programs and community building efforts enrich the mathematical sciences
community, for example through summer programs for undergraduates and for
graduate students, workshops for young scientists, training and education
programs, short courses in mathematical biology, public lectures, and a range of
programs designed to facilitate the participation of researchers from
underrepresented groups.
