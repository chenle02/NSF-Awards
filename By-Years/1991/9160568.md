The purpose of this work is to design x-ray optics for the collection and
redistribution of the annular x-ray cone generated by transition radiation such
that a uniform x-ray spot is delivered at high power density to a mask/wafer
target. This will increase the power density from the existing 1 mW/cm2 to 5
mW/cm2 permitting transition radiation to be a competitive source for x-ray
lithography. Transition radiation is emitted in conical annulus which has a
central hole in the radiation pattern and more than half of the x-rays are
emitted at angles larger than the angle of peak intensity. Hence, efficient
collection of the x-rays and their proper collimation into a uniform beam area
on the size of the mask and wafer target areas are required for uniform exposure
of x-ray photoresist of microintegrated circuit production. We will demonstrate
feasibility of using Kumakhov x-ray optics to collect and collimate x-rays from
a transition radiation source over a angular range of up to + 30 mrad and to
provide a quasiparallel beam suitable of x-ray lithography. The desired
intensity uniformity across the output x-ray beam is 3% . A complete design of a
Kumakohov lens based on computer simulation and on experimental results with
single capillaries and polycapillaries and their correlation with theoretical
predictions will be done.
