Algebraic geometry has a strong and broad representation at the research
institutions of the Northeastern states. AGNES is a series of biannual workshops
that intends to further the interaction and collaborations between the algebraic
geometers in the area. Each workshop is held over a weekend at one of the
participating institutions. The workshops include research talks by renowned
experts and junior researchers, both from outside the area and within.
Professional development sessions and introductory pre-talks are aimed
particularly at graduate students. Every workshop culminates with an open
problem session. This gives an opportunity to disseminate recent results and
developments, and exchange ideas and views about future directions of algebraic
geometry.

Algebraic geometry is the study of spaces defined by polynomial equations. Many
of the spaces occurring in nature are of this type, and for this reason
algebraic geometry has found diverse applications in the sciences. In
particular, there are strong connections with recent work in theoretical physics
(string theory). This grant will support a series of algebraic geometry
conferences in the Northeastern states. The key aims of the series are to expose
graduate students to a broad spectrum of research in the field and to improve
communication between the many algebraic geometers in the northeast.
