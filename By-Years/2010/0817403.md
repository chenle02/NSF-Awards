Engineering - Other (59) Teamwork predominates in engineering education, yet the
careful design and assessment of methods for students to learn teamwork skills
is not widespread. Teaching teaming skills is a complex challenge, one for which
most engineering faculty have not been prepared. This project is building on a
successful, web-based system for assigning and assessing teaming in engineering
education, expanding this resource to additional institutions and increasing the
capabilities of the tool. The goals of this project are to equip students to
work on teams by providing them with training and feedback, to equip faculty to
manage student teams by providing them with information and tools to facilitate
best practices, and to equip researchers to understand teams by broadening the
system's capabilities to collect additional types of data through a secure
researcher interface. The use of the teaming tools in STEM disciplines outside
of engineering is also being investigated through this project.
