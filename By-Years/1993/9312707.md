9312707 Voyiadjis This research is to develop an accurate constitutive model
for the remolded soil slurry at the front of the cutter head of a tunnel boring
machine. The material in this highly deformed region will be considered as a
Cosserat continuum, and the results implemented into a finite element type
computer code. The experimental and numerical results obtained in this work will
assist in the development of underground space. ***
