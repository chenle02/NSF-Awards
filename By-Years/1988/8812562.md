Chromaffin cells will be used as a model for studying stimulus- secretion
coupling. Release of catecolamines from these cells, which is dependent on an
increase in intracellular calcium levels, can result from either depolarization
of the membrane (voltage-mediated) or an activation of cholinergic receptors
(receptor- or agonist- mediated). It is not known, however, at what point other
than an increase in intracellular calcium the signaling pathways underlying the
two modes of stimulation leading to secretion converge. The objective of this
study is to answer this question by using a high temporal resolution technique
to examine the two pathways, and to determine whether the two pathways are
similarly modulated by common second messenger systems. The whole-cell "tight
seal" voltage-clamp method will be employed to measure ionic currents and to
assay secretion. Secretion is associated with the fusion of cytoplasmic vesicles
with the plasma membrane. These fusion events increase total membrane area which
is reflected as an increase in membrane capacitance. Thus, by simultaneously
recording membrane capacitance and conductance, it is possible to determine the
activity of ion channels and secretion of catecholamines simultaneously.
Furthermore, recent advances in calcium measurement with fluorescent dyes make
it possible to assay intracellular calcium levels over the same brief period of
time. The ability to correlate transmembrane ionic currents and changes in
intracellular calcium levels with the process of secretion by exocytosis
provides a uniquely powerful combination of approaches to the cellular
mechanisms controlling exocytosis at the single cell level. The results of this
research will provide more detailed knowledge of the sequence of events which
couple stimulation to cellular secretion.
