Graphs are powerful tools that can be used to model objects and relationships
between objects. Indeed, many distinct problems can be cast as optimization
problems in graph theoretic terms. Specifically, graph theory provides an
excellent way to model problems related to transportation, network design,
scheduling, robotics and many other areas. It is used to develop and illustrate
the power of different algorithmic tools. There are three broad areas from which
the particular problems considered in this proposal are abstracted: (1) Network
Design: How can a network that connects a given set of sites be built? How can
the network be made reliable, and also provide high bandwidth between sites
(while keeping the cost low)? Such fundamental questions are addressed here. (2)
Motion Planning: How does an agent navigate in an environment? What are good
navigation strategies for navigating in unknown environments? In this case the
agent discovers the environment by actually touching obstacles. How does an
agent record an approximate map of the environment, when working with limited
memory? (3) Scheduling: Precedence based scheduling problems arise in the
context of manufacturing and compilation for parallel machines. How can
effective heuristics for such problems be designed? For most of these problems
it is very difficult to obtain even an approximate solution in polynomial time.
Education Plan: Most computer scientists are constantly faced with the task of
designing algorithms to solve problems. Although these arise in many different
contexts, some basic principles underlie the design of efficient algorithms and
data structures. As a part of the Education Program of this CAREER award, the PI
is planning: (a) to undertake the training of students in designing algorithms,
and (b) to teach them the importance of re-examining existing algorithms so as
to make them simpler and more efficient. An algorithms lab where students
undertake projects, implement algorithms, and act as consultants to students in
other research groups is a significant step in this direction.
