This award provides support for a nine-month visit to Japan by a U.S.
investigator, Barry LaBonte of the University of Hawaii, working under the
direction of the principal investigator, Kenneth Lang of Tufts University, to
participate in ground-based and theoretical support of the Japanese solar
satellite, Yohkoh. Dr. LaBonte will be working with three primary Japanese
investigators: Yutaka Uchida, Professor of Astronomy, Tokyo University;
Professor Yoshiaki Ogawara, Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS);
and Tadashi Hirayama, Professor and Director of the Solar Physics Group at the
National Astronomical Observatory of Japan. The Yohkoh satellite was launched in
August, 1991 by ISAS. It has an expected lifetime of more than three years. The
goals of the Yohkoh mission are the study of energetic phenomena in solar flares
and the study of the thermal and magnetic structure of the nonflare corona. The
X-ray imagers and spectrometers on the Yohkoh spacecraft provide uniquely
detailed and complete information on the corona itself. Observations from
ground-based instruments of the underlying photospheric magnetic field and
chromospheric structure are also essential, however, for the most comprehensive
understanding of the critical science questions. Dr. LaBonte will work on three
specific topics: large scale events, flare emission spectrum, and heating of
corona. The data from the satellite, currently the only solar observatory in
space, will provide the basis for many solar research projects in the United
States and Japan. It also provides an opportunity for significant advances in
our understanding of the physical processes that govern solar flares and the
corona in general. //
