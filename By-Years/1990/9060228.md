The proposed instrumentation using the combined ultrasonic attenuation and
speckle image correlation strain measurement techniques addresses these problems
by providing a compact, rapid and robust nondestructive examination system for
evaluating the material macroscopic properties and surface crack-opening
displacements at critical locations on the full scale operating structures.
Extension of the fundamental correlation between analytical ultrasonic
nondestructive evaluation and mechanical performance, evaluation of a rugged
ultrasonic attenuation measurement system, integration of speckle correlation-
based strain sensing device.
