This is a Research Equipment Grant for an excimer pumped dye laser tomographic
3-D imaging system capable of making time-resolved 3-D images of a fluid flow at
a rate of 1000 frames per second. This equipment will continue the development
of an imaging system for the examination of a coflowing gaseous jet using
holographic interferometry. Image information is recorded on photographic film,
representing the optical pathlength, which is related to the index of refraction
of the medium. The tomographic imager coupled to an excimer pumped dye laser
opens exciting new applications. By tuning the UV radiation to a resonance line
of a species of interest, only that gas will be measured. Thus it should be
possible to selectively measure such species as O2 or OH in a combusting flow.
In addition, by making a measurement of absorption along the path length of the
probe beams, the cumbersome process of fringe readout can be avoided. This
equipment should prove very useful in fluid mechanics and combustion research.
