Abstract

Award: DMS-0506084 Principal Investigator: Huai-Dong Cao

The Ricci flow, introduced by Richard Hamilton, has become one of the most
powerful tools in geometric analysis. In the past twenty years or so, Hamilton
has proved many remarkable theorems in the Ricci flow and developed a remarkable
program to approach the Poincare conjecture and Thurston's geometrization
conjecture using the Ricci flow. More recently, Perelman has made astounding
breakthrough in the Ricci flow with the proof of a local injectivity radius
estimate valid for all dimensions and used it to study the geometrization of
three-manifolds. In addition to the applications of the Ricci flow to three-
manifolds, many exciting possibilities remain. In this proposal, we propose to
investigate several important problems in the Ricci flow and the Kaehler-Ricci
flow which are of great interest in geometry, topology, nonlinear partial
differential equations and complex analysis. They include studying
stability/instability of Einstein metrics of positive scalar curvature (and more
generally of shrinking Ricci solitons), constructing new Ricci solitons, seeking
new Einstein metrics via the Ricci flow, aspects of geometrization of
4-manifolds, studying the asymptotic behavior of solutions to the Kaehler-Ricci
flow on compact Kaehler manifolds with positive first Chern class, and the
uniformization of complete noncompact Kaehler manifolds of positive curvature.

The Ricci flow is an important type of geometric flows (or geometric evolution
equations) which have profound importance and applications in science and
geometry. Examples of applications of other include the motion of a surface by
its mean curvature, the flow of gas in a porous mechanism, the motion of a
liquid crystal, the diffusion of oil in shale, the reproduction of sparse
species, and image sharpening.
