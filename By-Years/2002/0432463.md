Much of the regional variability of weather occurs because of the displacement
of the jet stream and its associated storm tracks. The axis of the jet stream
and the cyclones steered by it move from one geographical area to another and
some jets are observed to be more active in producing cyclones than others. This
project will improve the understanding of the displacement and activity of
atmospheric storm tracks. It will also exploit the methods that have been
developed for analyzing storm track dynamics to improve weather forecasts
through advancing understanding of forecast and data assimilation error growth.
The PI will develop new methods for analyzing the interaction between the jet
structure and the eddy fields including advances in stochastic jet turbulence
modeling and novel contributions to the stability theory of statistical
equilibria.
