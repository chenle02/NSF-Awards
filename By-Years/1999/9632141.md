9632141 Johnson This is a theoretical program consisting of two parts: to study
the fundamental properties of integer and fractional quantum Hall effect (QHE)
and to study nonlinear mesoscopic transport. More specifically, in the first
part there will be a study of the rich ground states and transitions as a
function of magnetic field in small quantum dots, using a previously developed
ensemble density functional method which will be extended to include spin
degrees of freedom and current distributions. Further applications of this
method include a study of the off-diagonal long range order in the fractional
QHE and detailed properties of the composite fermion. In the nonlinear
mesoscopic transport, there will be a comparative study of a formalism developed
by the PI's and the traditional approaches such as nonequilibrium Green's
function with possible application to the second harmonic generation in quantum
wires. %%% In this grant supporting collaborative theoretical research by the
two young PI's, the main focus is on two subjects: properties of layers of
electrons subjected to intense magnetic fields, a subject referred to as quantum
Hall effect and on response of small devices to intense radiation. Both of these
projects involve special theoretical techniques developed by these PI's. ***
