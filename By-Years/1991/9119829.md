Boiling is one of the most important and complex heat transfer mechanisms.
Recent focus on heat dissipation problems for submicron electronic circuits
brings new motivation for better understanding of boiling. This project concerns
studies of direct phase change and nucleation processes on microconfigured
silicon substrates. Recent studies by the PI employing 11.5 >m features at a
density range of 0.4 - 2 (10)5 per cm2 showed a 350% boiling enhancement in
water and the elimination of hysterias and overshoot in FC-72. Future studies
include effects of microfeature spacing, geometry and surface treatments,
development of a more realistic model, micro-second level visualization, and the
measurement of temperature fluctuations. Subcooled boiling measurements will
also be made.
