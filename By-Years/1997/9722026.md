In order to meet the need of an orderly phase out, a two component effort will
be made. First, a complete detailed documentation of the procedures which led to
the successful completion of a two-mode optical transducer will be completed.
Second, active exchanges between the Maryland group and the INFN groups will be
carried out. These exchanges will bear on: o Power and frequency stabilization
of laser. o Photodetector system and associated electronics. o Designs of very
high mechanical Q resonator with mirrors. o Design and assembly of multimode
Fabry-Perot transducers incorporating common mode rejection of low frequency
noise. o Computer interface and control. In addition to the activities mentioned
above, the Maryland group will contact LIGO people and share with them any
result which may be of interest to their effort.
