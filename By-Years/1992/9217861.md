This award from the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, provides partial
support for a new Gordon Research Conference entitled "Chemical Reactions at
Surfaces". This conference brings together researchers from chemistry, physics,
engineering, and materials science to discuss advances in the microscopic
understanding of chemical reactions occurring on solid surfaces. The funding
provided will be used to support the participation of ten advanced graduate
students in this Gordon Research Conference. %%% This award will support the
participation of ten advanced graduate students in a newly established Gordon
Conference on the chemistry of reactions at solid surfaces. The first conference
will be held in March 1993 in Ventura, California.
