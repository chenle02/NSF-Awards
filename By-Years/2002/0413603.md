This is a SGER proposal to study how the Partnerships For Innovation Program can
involve a broader range of academic institutions including smaller research
universities and community colleges, particularly those located in rural areas,
Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Hispanic Association of
Colleges and Universities in catalyzing and enabling innovation through creating
and disseminating new knowledge, enhancing a scientific and technological
workforce and promoting an infrastructure that fosters innovation. There is a
significant body of research that describes university-industry partnerships and
the role of major research universities in innovation. There is a gap in this
growing literature on university-industry partnerships and innovation that does
not adequately cover these types of institutions. The goal of this award is to
study the roles of these smaller academic institutions in the innovation
enterprise. The effort explores policies, practices, programs and linkages that
smaller academic institutions use to stimulate and enhance innovation. The
research consists of on-site, in-depth case studies of at least 10 small
universities and community colleges that are currently involved in innovation
partnerships. The effort involves forming a national advisory committee of
nationally prominent individuals in the field of innovation partnerships,
identifying the domain of innovation partnerships, defining the types of
institutions appropriate for the study, and developing the case studies.
