*** ABSTRACT 9660664 Wixom This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
project will result in the production of new electrocatalysts for use in direct
methanol fuel cells (DMFC). The development of electrocatalysts that efficiently
oxidize methanol and are tolerant to CO and impurities in the fuel is a key
challenge for the commercialization of DMFCs. The primary hypothesis of this
proposal is that multifunctional Pt/metal oxide/metal carbide (PI/MO/MC)
electrocatalysts will be effective for the electrochemical oxidation of
methanol. This design combines two previous strategies that have proven very
successful in improving the efficiency and CO tolerance of anodic
electrocatalysts. Highly dispersed bifunctional sites will be produced on high
surface area metal carbide support materials. The bifunctional sites and carbide
support are inherently active and CO-tolerant. During Phase I, three process
variables used in preparing the supported electrocatalysts will be varied. The
compositional and microstructural properties will be characterized and the
electrocatalysts will be fabricated into electrodes for standard electrochemical
activity measurements. In Phase II the electrocatalysts and electrode designs
will be optimized, and prototype DMFCs will be fabricated. These results will
allow issues related concerning the commercialization of DMFCs based on PI/MO/MC
electrocatalysts to be addressed. The widespread use of fuel cells would be
positively impacted by the development of a low cost, high efficiency DMFC.
DMFCs offers several advantages over conventional fuel cells based on hydrogen
in particular with respect to fuel energy density, delivery and storage. The
demonstration of efficient, poison-tolerant electrocatalysts will significantly
improve the feasibility of using DMFCs in next generation vehicles. DMFCs may
also compete with gas turbines for generation of electricity. ***
