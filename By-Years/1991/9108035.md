This project represents additional effort for completion and extension of
current N2O and NO flux from tropical pastures and forests. The objectives of
the project are: 1). to measure, over an annual cycle, N2O and NO flux from
common land use types in lowland tropical Costa Rica representing a typical
cycle of land usage: primary forests, active pastures created from these
forests, abandoned pastures and secondary forests derived from abandoned
pastures, and 2). to combine field experiments with the field measurements in
objective 1 for determination of the importance of factors controlling the rates
of these fluxes. For the additional period of research the project team will 1).
complete the annual cycle on the land use plots, 2). make exploratory
measurements of flux rates from other soil and land use types in the area to
extend the ability to generalize results, and 3). carry out laboratory and field
experiments that have been stimulated by earlier our findings. These experiments
include rain storm simulations in forest sites to determination the causes for
short-term time dynamics in gas flux from these systems, and fertilization
experiments in pasture sites to determine the causes for lower rates of nitrogen
oxide emissions in those systems compared with the forests.
