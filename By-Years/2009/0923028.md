With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program, the
Department of Chemistry and Physics at the University of New England will
acquire a spectrofluorometer to measure luminescence lifetimes. The primary
research applications of the proposed instrument fall into three broad
categories: (1) the design, synthesis, and characterization of novel metalloles
and metallole-like compounds that display unusual luminescence characteristics,
(2) characterization of the photophysical properties of "tunable" luminescent
lanthanide ion-heterobimetallic dicyanides, and (3) the exploration of the
photophysics and photochemistry of luminescent platinum group molecules.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Luminescence lifetime spectrometers measure the decay time
of the light emitted from a sample that has been promoted to an excited state by
a light source. This provides insight into the mechanisms of energy transfer and
loss in materials that emit light such as organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs)
and chemical sensors. The instrument will be used in research and laboratory
classes by undergraduate students. This is a collaborative award. The instrument
will be shared by investigators at the University of New England (UNE), the
University of Southern Maine (USM), and Bowdoin College.
