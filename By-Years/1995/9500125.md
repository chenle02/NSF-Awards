Kalton 9500125 The principal investigator plans to study a number of fundamental
questions in the theory of unconditional structure in Banach spaces. Among the
questions to be considered is the longstanding problem of whether a complemented
subspace of a Banach space with an unconditional basis also has an unconditional
basis, and a similar problem for complemented subspaces of Banach lattices. The
resolution of these problems could have a profound effect on the theory of
Banach spaces. Another question to be studied is whether a Banach space in which
every closed subpsace has an unconditional basis (or just local unconditional
structure) is necessarily a Hilbert space. A number of other problems concerning
unconditional structure are also to be investigated. Unconditional bases are a
natural framework for the study of the decomposition of functions (or signals)
into basis elements (or simpler pure components) as in the modern theory of
wavelets. This proposal is concerned with studying situations where such
decompositions exist and where they fail to exist. By studying the possible
unconditional bases of a certain space or class of functions one is able to
obtain important information concerning the space. ***
