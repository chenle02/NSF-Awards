9528204 Heeger In light-emitting electrochemical cells, a p-n junction diode is
created in-situ through simultaneous p-type and e-type electrochemical doping on
opposite sides, respectively, of a thin film of conjugated polymer which
contains added electrolyte to provide the necessary counterions for doping.
Light-emitting devices based on conjugated polymers have been fabricated which
operate by the proposed electrochemical oxidation reduction mechanism. Blue,
green, and orange emission have been obtained with turn-on voltage close to the
bandgap of the emissive material. This proposal outlines a focused program of
basic scientific research on the chemistry, electrochemistry, physics and device
physics of Polymer Light-Emitting Electrochemical Cells. The proposed research
will probe the p-n junction created in-situ with the goal of determining the
width and profile of the junction as a function of applied voltage; the proposed
research will characterize the electrical properties of the p-n junction created
in-situ (using current vs voltage and capacitance vs voltage measurements); and,
finally, the proposed research will investigate the stability of the p-n
junctions created in-situ. ***
