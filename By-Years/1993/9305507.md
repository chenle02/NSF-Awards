Recent models of the precambrian construction of the north American craton
indicate that the southeastern margin of the Archean Wyoming craton sustained
intense thick- skinned deformation during an early Proterozoic collision event
at about 1.8Ga. However, much of the deformation and metamorphism of the Wyoming
plate in a wide zone along the suture has been attributed to Archean
deformation. This project will re-examine this broad belt and attempt to
separate and partition the deformation and metamorphism into Archean and early
Proterozoic events. Results will provide a better understanding of the tectono-
metamorphic history of continental response to Proterozoic convergent margin
tectonics. It will provide valuable models for this process that can provide
insight into the evolution of similar but less well exposed regions such as the
southern Lake Superior area.
