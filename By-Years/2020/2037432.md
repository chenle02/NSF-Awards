Researchers from Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) are seriously under-
represented in NSF funded research activities. This is a serious problem given
the increasing diversity of the US workforce and the need to expand the STEM
workforce. This proposed founding conference will bring researchers from 12 MSIs
in the DMV area to form a research alliance among researchers in these
institutions, discuss obstacles to increased research output and how best to
improve STEM research and education in these institutions. The conference will
discuss and establish a research coordination platform across these institutions
with advisory board and a management committee. The conference will also
establish collaborative research teams across these institutions. The organizers
plan several follow-up conferences to evaluate progress as well as adjust
strategies to get to their objectives. This conference will not only help
increase the participation of MSI researchers in NSF funded SBE research
activities; it will also help to expand and diversify the STEM workforce, thus
increasing economic growth. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference
proposal responds to NSF Social Behavioral and Economics (SBE) Directorateâ€™s
Build and Broaden initiative to increase participation of researchers from MSIs
in NSF funded STEM research and educational activities. The proposed founding
conference will bring researchers from 12 MSIs together to form a research
alliance and discuss current obstacles to research productivity in their
institutions and how best to increase research activities and improve STEM
education in these institutions. The proposed conference will discuss new ideas
and solutions to low research productivity in MSIs and could have transformative
effects on research and STEM education in these institutions. The alliance to be
formed at the conference as well as solutions to research problems could also
serve as a blueprint for other groups of MSIs to follow to increase research
productivity as well as improve STEM education. This conference will help
increase the participation of MSI researchers in NSF funded SBE research
activities as well as help to expand and diversify the STEM workforce, thus
increasing economic growth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
