This Research Experiences for Undergraduates program addresses the need to
expose undergraduate students to the tools and techniques used in the
interdisciplinary, and highly dynamic field of microelectronics at Florida
International University. A sample project of a superconducting magnometer will
be developed. The undergraduates will be exposed to a variety of disciplines,
including material science, mechanics, thermal science and electrical and
electronic engineering. Multilevel structures of superconducting materials will
be fabricated using tape cast films. The electromagnetic characteristics will be
investigated by students at Florida A&M University. The entire packaging of the
magnetometer ensuring stable thermal performance and structural rigidity, will
also be developed. This comprehensive research experience will entail broad
exposure to methods of literature search, problem definition and formulation in
these areas, technical report writing, laboratory set-ups, culminating in
specific problem application. The combination of a historically black university
(Florida A&M) and a minority institution (Florida International) is a special,
unique feature of this program.
