This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II Project will develop a
neutral, high flux/fluence nitrogen atom beam source for application to the high
rate growth of III-V nitride semi-conducting materials over large areas. The
proposed source is based on proprietary MID-JET technology. This technology
employs an electrode-less discharge contained by vortex flow, rather than a
dielectric tube commonly used in traditional sources. MIDJET technology
utilizing a temperature of 5000 C to produce1021 nitrogen atoms has been
demonstrated. This is 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than that generated by
currently available sources. It is particularly applicable to Metal Organic
Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD) systems, where it will allow both high growth
rate and the elimination of the use of ammonia. The MIDJET will be adapted for
use in a MOCVD reactor and a demonstration made of the system's ability to grow
gallium nitride at a rate of at least 10 microns per hour. This project will
develop a charge-free, high flux/fluence nitrogen atom beam for the growth of
III-V nitride materials which can replace existing plasma-based tools. With
higher growth rates of high quality material over larger areas, systems based on
the MIDJET will have with application to the fabrication of high power/high
temperature semiconductor devices and blue illumination sources (including those
for flat panel displays).
