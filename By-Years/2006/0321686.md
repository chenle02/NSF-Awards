This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop an
assistive reading device for persons with disabilities. The device, an
electromechanical page turner, will serve to automate the mechanical tasks
associated with page turning, an important ancillary process of reading. With
the touch of a button/pedal, the page turner will automatically grab the next
page of a book, turn it, and keep the book opened flat during the entire
process. In the prior Phase I work, a novel turnstile design was introduced, and
data was collected on bending stiffness, static and dynamic coefficients of
friction, and the mechanical characteristics of paper. The Phase II project will
integrate the Phase I results into an engineering effort to optimize the design
and improve the performance and reliability of the page turner.

The commercial application of this project will be in the area of assistive
technologies for people with disabilities, the elderly, musicians, and avid
readers.
