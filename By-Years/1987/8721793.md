As a continuation of the investigations of hydrothermal activity on sediment
covered ridge axes begun in the Gulf of California (Guaymas Basin), support is
provided for a diving expedition to the Gorda Ridge in the Northeast Pacific.
The southern end of this slow spreading ridge (Escanaba Trough; half- rate (12
mm/yr) is buried under several hundred meters of turbidite sediments derived
from the mountainous coasts of the Pacific Northwest. The sediment composition,
immature sands of metamorphic and granitic origin, contrasts sharply with the
mixture of andesitic and biogenic debris encountered in Guaymas. The
hydrothermal system is thus an extreme end-member with only three components:
seawater, tholeiites, turbidites and as a result, the contribution of the
sediment to the chemistry of the hydrothermal fluids will be easy to discern.
This is especially true since the sediment- starved northern part of the Ridge
is also available for study. In a comparative study of these two systems it will
be possible to establish the effectiveness of reactions with purely detrital
sediments in localizing ore deposits and in controlling their chemistry.//
