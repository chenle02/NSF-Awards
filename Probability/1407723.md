Our world appears differently at different scales! For example a fluid is a
collection of an enormous number of molecules that collide incessantly and move
erratically without any particular aim. How do these molecules then manage to
organize themselves in such a way as to form a flow pattern on a large scale? As
another example, how fast the clotting (coagulation) should occur for a liquid
(such as blood) to turn to a gel? The investigator's research concerns the
relationship between the microscopic structure and the macroscopic behavior of
fluids. The analysis of the mathematical models consisting of a large number of
interacting particles is proved to be useful in understanding the intricate
behavior of our microscopic world. The investigator also emphasizes on applying
geometric and probabilistic ideas in order to develop new insights into complex
dynamics of fluids. The proposal addresses the scaling and collective behavior
of various stochastic and deterministic models that are of interest in
statistical mechanics and differential geometry. These models are either
formulated as interacting particle systems, partial differential equations or
variational problems. In particular, the proposal suggests applying geometric
and probabilistic ideas to study fluid equations. Also, Optimal Transport type
problems are proposed for symplectic and contact forms that could play a role in
understanding fluid equations. As another application of probabilistic ideas in
differential geometry, we propose to study the set of fixed points for
stochastic symplectic maps that appear as the flows associated with models in
celestial mechanics. The proposal also formulates precise conjectures for
particle systems modeling the phenomena of coagulation and formation of gels.
