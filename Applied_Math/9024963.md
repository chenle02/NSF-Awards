This project is concerned with modeling (derivation and presentation of
equations of motion) and analysis (perturbation methods, bifurcation techniques,
numerical methods, etc.) devised for and applied to problems in nonlinear, non-
Fickian diffusion which have recently arisen in a variety of scientific and
technological fields. Central problems emerging in these new technologies are
types of diffusive motion quite unlike anything predicted by classical diffusion
theory. They involve nonlinear fixed and free boundary value problems, phase
transitions, sharp (shock-like) propagating fronts, and discontinuous steady
states. Progress in materials science has spawned an extraordinary wealth of new
exciting scientific and technological problems. For example, polymers and
composites are replacing traditional materials in many older scientific,
engineering and commercial applications, and wholly new fields with a dazzling
array of new applications are emerging because of the existence of new synthetic
polymers and composites. This project deals with modeling and analysis to
develop valid theories for the behavior of new materials and accurate control of
their properties.
