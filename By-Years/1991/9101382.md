This project will analyse systems of nonlinear degenerate partial differential
equations of elliptic-parabolic type which arise in modelling the combined flow
of heat and electric current in a metallic conductor, the welding of metal
sheets, and biological groups the dispersal of avoid crowding. Recent findings
indicate that the existence assertion for these systems is closely tied to the
size of the sets where the equations involved become degenerate. Equations in
which the degeneracy causes the appearance of two free boundaries will also be
studied.
