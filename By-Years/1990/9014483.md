Professor Moy will investigate the unitarity question in the representation
theory of certain kinds of groups. His work will focus on unipotent
representations, reducibility problems related to unitarity, and the
relationship of certain Hecke algebra isomorphisms to unitarity. Group theory is
basically the study of symmetry. To take a simple example, when the system in
question is invariant under a change in the position of the origin of space, the
group of translations naturally arises. While groups are abstract objects,
particular situations demand concrete realizations or "representations" of the
symmetry group. Professor Moy's investigations involve certain special
representations which enjoy a distance preserving property called unitarity.
