The proposed research will use a comparative macro-structural framework, a
geographic mapping approach, and country level data to examine gender inequity
in STEM opportunities in a global context. The proposal will request support for
an international collaboration with Luis Berneth Pena, a Columbian geographer at
the Georg Simmel Center for Metropolitan Studies at Humboldt University in
Berlin, Germany. The intellectual merit of the proposed research derives from an
interdisciplinary, international collaboration between an American sociologist
and a Columbian geographer. The collaboration will allow the integration of a
comparative macro-structural framework of gender inequity in STEM and a
geographic mapping approach. The influence of geographically distributed
economic and socio-political structures on STEM equity outcomes has not been
carefully examined and has the potential for revealing critical gender patterns
in STEM opportunity systems. The merit of the research is based in part on an
integration of sociological and geographic perspectives in understanding gender
inequity in STEM inequity that is spatially distributed and correlates with
larger macro structures. The broader impact of the proposed research is
substantial given growing international focus on gender inequality. As a result
of this focus, organizations such as the United Nations have promoted
measurement of gender inequalities across countries. Measurement is often
limited to general health, education, and labor market issues. Gender inequity
in STEM is a major component in creating and maintaining gender inequity
worldwide. An examination of gender equity in STEM education and occupations
across countries with diverse economic and socio-political characteristics will
lend insights and solutions for resolving inequities in STEM.
