This proposal seeks support for continuation of Brookhaven National Laboratory
experiment 791, a search for very rare decays of the neutral K meson. This
experiment has had an engineering run and one physics run. Another physics run
is anticipated this winter. Wojcicki was the spokesman for two years and remains
in a leadership role. The experiment searches for K zero-long decaying into muon
and electron (forbidden by lepton number conservation) and into muon and muon
(suppressed by the standard model). The latter mode will be studied with good
statistics; the former is a probe to mass scales much higher than can be
achieved in direct reactions with current accelerators. An additional mode to be
studied is into neutral pion, electron and positron. This is a CP violating
decay; it is possible that direct CP violation may dominate in this decay.
