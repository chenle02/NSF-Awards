9404790 Blanpied Research will be performed at the Laser Electron Gamma Source
(LEGS) at the National Synchrotron Light Source of Brookhaven National
Laboratory, at SATURNE in Saclay, France, and at ELSA in Bonn, Germany. Planning
for experiments using the CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer (CLAS) will be
carried out. At LEGS, using tagged polarized gammarays of energies up to 320
MeV, photo disintegration of the deuteron and the E2/M1 ratio of the Delta has
been studied. Measurements of pion production and Compton scattering will be
performed. Measurements of the polarizabilities of the proton, neutron and pion
are in preparation. At CEBAF continued participation in the construction of the
CLAS is planned. At CEBAF continued development of a proposal to measure lepton
pair production in order to study the photo production of vector mesons in
nuclei and possible reduction of the mass of these mesons in the nuclear medium
will be carried out. ***
