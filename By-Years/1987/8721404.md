Geochemistry and Early Diagenesis of the Monterey Formation, Shell Beach,
California. Research will study the geochemistry and early diagenesis of the
Monterey Formation at Shell Beach, California. The Monterey Formation was highly
productive biologically in newly forming marginal basins during times of high
eustatic sea level. The result is organically rich, calcareous, phosphatic,
siliceous sediments typical of upwelling areas. The resultant rocks are very
different from the original sediments. The goal of this study will be to
understand the associated diagenetic reactions and the mineral by-products. The
same reactions and products can occur in many types of sediments, conditioning
them for later diagenetic change. A second goal is to investigate the secular
variations of paleoceanographically important components such as organic and
organic C, PO4, and SiO2, and the insights for past ocean circulation,
productivity, and climate.
