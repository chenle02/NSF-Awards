The field of computational complexity deals with the amount of various resources
(e.g., time and memory space) required to solve a problem on a computer. This
research is an investigation of new techniques to obtain good lower bounds on
the worst case time complexity of various problems. The maxima problem will be
considered. The complexity of this problem is understood in two and three
dimensions, but no higher. The linear decision tree and the algebraic decision
tree models of computation will also be investigated. Applications of results
will also be considered.
