9409243 Ebert Visualization of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations is
an important tool for CFD researchers. However, current visualization systems
are lacking in several ways. First, many systems fail to display all of the
three-dimensional information contained in the data, only displaying stream-
lines, contour plots, or isosurfaces. Second, most systems are a post-
processing step only and cannot be incorporated into the development cycle for
the computational model. Third, most systems do not allow multiple flow
variables to be displayed simultaneously in an easily understandable format.
This project will develop an interactive surface and volumetric visualization
system for the three-dimensional visualization of CFD simulations. This system
will use realistic volume rendering techniques for gases and fluids to display
the complete three- dimensional data from the CFD simulation, including the
simultaneous display of multiple flow variables. Three- dimensional perception
aids, such as accurate shadows, atmospheric attenuation, and refraction, will be
used to increase the understandability of the data. Furthermore, the system will
allow researchers to visualize and to change their models interactively, aiding
in the debugging of the computational models and decreasing the development time
of the CFD simulation. This new system can be used as an interactive virtual
wind tunnel. ***
