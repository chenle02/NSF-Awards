Abstract

0073044

This research aims to develop new statistical methods, inference and theory for
regression modeling of ordinal and bounded data. Recent work indicates a strong
possiblility of unifying the most commonly used ordinal models and extending
them to a broader class of models. A unified approach will lead to comprehensive
and flexible ordinal regression modeling. Further this line of research is
directed at developing improved methods for temporally and spatially correlated
ordinal data. Bounded response data are common in many applications. The second
part of this project will extend general regression methods and inference
methods for bounded response data. Parametric and semi-parametric methods will
be developed to model correlations among bounded responses. Modern computing
algorithms such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo provide the means for developing
software for correlated ordinal and bounded response data.

Ordinal modeling has widespread applicability in the social sciences and medical
studies. Moreover ordinal modeling has recently emerged as an important tool for
risk assessment in environmental toxicology and in civil engineering
applications where the probabilities of events of different severity need to be
modeled. Bounded response data are common in infrastructure studies, which use
bounded condition scores, e.g., 0-100 scale. The data may be correlated over
time (e.g., the history of a road section) and space (e.g., neighboring road
sections are correlated). The methods being developed will improve modeling and
uncertainty assessments and will have applications in many fields such as
environmental risk assessment, infrastructure management, transportation risk
modeling and the assessment of treatments for depression and other social
functioning disorders.
