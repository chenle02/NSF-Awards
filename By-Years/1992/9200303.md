The principal investigator will conduct research on problems of optimal
control, both in continuous and discrete time. Optimality conditions recently
obtained for the control of differential inclusions will be applied to Bolza
problems, and results are to be derived for Hamilton-Jacobi theory and feedback
rules. In addition, a new theory of generalized second- derivatives will be
applied to sensitivity analysis and parametric methods of optimization. Optimal
control problems are useful as mathematical models in many areas of engineering
and operations management. By better understanding their structure and
properties, the gained insight will lead to improved numerical optimization
algorithms.
