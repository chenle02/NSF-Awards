The proposal seeks partial funding (50% cost share) for the publication of a
monograph revising the systematics of two genera of scleractinian corals within
the Caribbean region during Neogene time. The monograph has been reviewed and
formally accepted by the Bulletins of American Paleontology as a separate volume
in part of a series on the Neogene Paleontology of the northern Dominican
Republic. Its contents provide a detailed documentation of the protocol and
rationale underlying morphometric analyses performed in research funded by NSF
grant no. BSR 8605277. The monograph is unique in being one of the first
systematic treatments in reef corals to use a rigorous quantitative approach in
the recognition of species, as well as in tracing the distributions of
morphospecies through space and time. A total of nine species are recognized
altogether, resulting in the synonymy of five of 16 previously reported species
in the Caribbean Neogene. Only three of these species are found to have survived
until the Recent, and only two to extend back into Oligocene time.
