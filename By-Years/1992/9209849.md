This research involves parallel computation for simultaneous optimization of
cell layout and intercell material flow paths. A simultaneous design of cell
layout and intercell material flow paths provides a more detailed picture for a
rapidly analyzing alternative configurations compared to treating block layout
design and material flow design as separate or sequential problems. Two modes of
parallel computation will be used: (1) intrinsic parallel approach, which will
be based on a genetic algorithm and (2) vectorization approach for parallel
computation of a hill climbing algorithm, which will be experimented on a
supercomputer Object-oriented programming is used for the problem representation
and user interface. Because of the emphasis on parallel computation and
application of stochastic global search methods, the approach is expected to
have a high probability of finding near optimal solutions for medium to large
problem sizes which are typically encountered in practice.
