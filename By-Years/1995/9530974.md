This is jointly funded project (between the Theory of Computing Program, CCR
and Probability Program, DMS), that started under CCR-92-25008, ``Probabilisitic
Considerations in the Analysis of Algorithms''. Probalilistic considerations
arise in the analysis of algorithms in at least two important ways: (1) In a
randomized algorithm the outcomes of random events are used to determine the
progress of the algorithm. Randomization is now a standard tool of the
computational scientist; (2) A second area of consideration is when the problem
instances come from some probability distribution, and one wants to understand
the average performance of a particular algorithm, which is often far better
than its worst case. Under this previous grant, CCR-92-08597, probabilistic and
algorithmic issues were explored in such areas as: (a) sampling, (b) path
problems, (c) counting, (d) heuristics for bisection/k-cut of weighted
graphs,(d) greedy algorithms, (e) computational biology, (f) complexity of
determining polyhedra from its faces, (g) hypergraphs, and(h) probabilistic
combinatorics. This project explores problems in both areas. In (1) the area of
randomized algorithms, the problems examined include: (1a) random walks on
graphs; (1b) approximation algorithms; and (1c) learning and routing problems.
In (2) the area of probabilistic analysis, the problems studied include: (2a)
greedy algorithms; (2b) in computational biology, sequencing by hybridization
and physical mapping reconstruction for DNA; and (2c) some geometric
problems.***
