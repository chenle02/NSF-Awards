The conference "Mathematics and Machine Learning 2023" to be held at Caltech,
Pasadena, CA on December 10-13, 2023 will bring together diverse groups of
mathematicians and data scientists to discuss problems at the interface of these
two disciplines. With the increasing role of artificial intelligence (AI) in
everyday life and, more recently, in mathematical research, the time is ripe to
start a regular annual meeting on this subject. Just like development of the
World Wide Web started in the scientific community, the mathematical approach to
machine learning can stimulate development of better AI algorithms and
architecture whose future applications can extend far beyond 'pure' sciences. At
the same time, advanced tools in machine learning start playing a major role in
mathematical research, sometimes assisting expert mathematicians in making
progress with some of the most difficult mathematical challenges. Although the
interaction between the two communities seems natural, the opportunities are
extremely limited and one of the main goals of the conference "Mathematics and
Machine Learning 2023" is to fill this void.

The interactions between mathematics and machine learning (ML) can be roughly
organized into three broad areas: the use of ML for very challenging cutting-
edge problems in mathematics, the mathematical theory of ML, and the use of ML
in automated proof assistants. All of these areas will be represented at the
conference "Mathematics and Machine Learning 2023." This award provides support
to the speakers and to junior participants, with the priority given to
underrepresented groups, Ph.D. students, and speakers/participants with no other
sources of funding. Further information will become available on the conference
website: https://mathml2023.caltech.edu/

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
