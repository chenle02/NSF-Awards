9619522 Computing applications in the real world are generally distributed and
open to interaction with their environment. Creating an architecture for such
systems requires developing mechanisms for managing complex interactions between
distributed components. As requirements and the environment change, both the
individual components and the pattern of interactions between them evolve. This
implies that interaction mechanisms may need to be synthesized during the
execution of the system according to the evolving needs of components. In
current software, the implementation of policies governing interactions between
components is typically represented using a variety of low-level primitives --
such as message-passing, remote procedure call, or shared memory -- and is
therefore a major source of code complexity. The project is studying programming
techniques for abstract and modular representation of interaction patterns. Such
programming techniques will allow code for distributed applications to evolve
gracefully -- for example, by reusing components when only their interaction
context changes. The research is based on Actors, a formal model of concurrent
computation in open distributed systems. ***
