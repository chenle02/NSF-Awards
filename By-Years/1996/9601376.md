9601376 Slemrod This award supports participation of two US investigators,
Marshall Slemrod of the University of Wisconsin and Shi Jin of Georgia Institute
of Technology, in a cooperative research project on relaxation models for
dynamic phase transitions with Zheng Songmu from Fudan University, Shanghai,
China and Wang Jinghua from the Institute of System Science, Chinese Academy of
Sciences, Beijing. The project will employ formal and rigorous mathematical
analysis, numerical analysis and scientific computation to investigate dynamic
phase transitions arising in many important physical processes. This research
addresses an important problem in modeling materials and processes.
Strengthening cooperation in mathematics and computation sciences with China,
which has a long tradition of excellence in mathematics and a recent emphasis in
computational science, is important. The Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute
of Systems Science and the Mathematics Institute at Fudan University are leading
centers in China in these fields, and collaboration among these researchers
should prove quite effective.
