The Analytical and Surface Chemistry (ASC) Program of the Division of Chemistry
will support the CAREER development plan of Prof. Sapna Deo of Indiana
University-Purdue University at Indianapolis (IUPUI). Prof. Deo's integrated
research and education program focuses on the development of bioanalytical
detection methods that are rapid, highly sensitive, have low background, and
require no separation step to detect nucleic acid targets in a variety of
matrices including cells, clinical samples and environmental samples. Prof. Deo
and her students will develop a highly sensitive one-step hybridization-based
detection method for target RNAs based on Bioluminescence Resonance Energy
Transfer (BRET) from the enzyme Renilla luciferase (hRluc) to a quantum dot
(QD). The research of Prof. Deo will provide excellent training opportunities
for graduate and undergraduate students, and postdoctoral research associates in
a highly multidisciplinary area at the forefront of scientific research. Prof.
Deo will integrate her research project with an on-going educational effort to
increase involvement of high school students and teachers in bioanalytical
research.
