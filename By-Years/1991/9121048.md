Fundamental research directed toward improved understanding of metallic
interactions with antimony-based semiconductors will be conducted. The research
is of particular interest for improving the morphology, functionality, and
stability of ohmic contacts and Schottky barriers to compound semiconductors.
The study is material-structure based and includes detailed research on the
electronic properties across metal-semiconductor and semiconductor-semiconductor
interfaces. %%% This research is expected to provide deeper fundamental
understanding of metal-semiconductor and semiconductor-semiconductor growth,
processing, and the fundamental electronic properties of such heterostructures.
From an application point of view, understanding these processes and properties
is beneficial to semiconductor device design and fabrication. The results will
be of importance in a general way to the technology of large scale, high speed
integrated electronic and photonic devices and circuits.
