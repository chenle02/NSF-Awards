This project is mathematical research concerning smooth manifolds and certain
differential operators associated with them. A manifold is a surface (or higher-
dimensional analog) with the commonsensical property that in the near vicinity
of any point, a coordinate system can be introduced that behaves like the
ordinary system in two- (or n-) dimensional space. Differential operators can be
defined in terms of these local coordinates. Certain numbers that can be
extracted from the operators tell us very interesting things about the
underlying manifold. Group representation theory comes into the picture when the
manifold is a symmetric space. The noncommutative perspective afforded by recent
developments in the theory of operator algebras is very helpful when the
manifold carries some additional structure, such as a foliation with
pathological leaf space. One specific objective of the project is to apply
methods of harmonic analysis on semisimple Lie groups to the study of eta
invariants and analytic torsion of locally symmetric manifolds with non-positive
sectional curvature, aiming to express these invariants in terms of the geodesic
flow. Another aspect of the work involves the Chern character and exponentially
summable Fredholm modules in noncommutative differential geometry, with a view
towards applications to operator algebras associated with certain groups.
