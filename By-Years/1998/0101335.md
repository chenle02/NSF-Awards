Association&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special Projects: Graduate Students in
Computing Travel Support for Career Workshops&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This award
to the Computing Research Association (CRA) provides funds to support advanced
graduate students to attend the CRA career workshops in 2001, 2002, and 2003.
The workshops are held in Washington, DC and are open to all recent doctorates
and advanced graduate students in computing disciplines. Topics incorporated in
the workshops include development of effective teaching practices, research
programs, and developing a successful academic career overall. Senior computer
scientists and engineers conduct the workshops and program managers from NSF and
DARPA discussing how their research funding programs are organized are also part
of the workshops.&lt;br/&gt;
