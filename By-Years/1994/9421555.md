A new mutation has been discovered in a strain of rats, which produces a
fundamental reorganization of the forebrain. This Small Grant for Exploratory
Research will establish a stable breeding colony of these mutants, and begin to
characterize the cellular organization of the forebrain. It is essential to
breed the new strain of rat immediately to preserve the mutation, and make it
accessible for experimentation in a variety of studies. Histological analysis of
the brain of these animals will identify the types of cells in the novel
structure. The established colony will provide a valuable novel model system as
a resource for the community. Research on this mutation has potentially very
high impact across neuroscience, because such a large change in structure
suggests novel tests for structure-function relationships, as well as novel
tests about neural development. Its potential impact extends beyond neuroscience
to developmental biology and to biopsychology as well.
