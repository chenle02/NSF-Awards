This award will support travel to a workshop that will take place from November
16 to 20, 2020 at the Banff International Research Station. It is the fifth in a
series of research collaboration conferences. Much of the time during the
workshop is reserved for collaboration in small groups led by senior researchers
in the field. The major goals of this workshop are to produce significant and
impactful research in number theory; help train graduate students and postdocs
by providing exposure to new topics and experience with collaborative research
and the publication process; strengthen and extend a collaborative research
network in number theory and related areas; and enable faculty at smaller
colleges to actively participate in research collaborations. More information is
available at http://www.birs.ca/events/2020/5-day-workshops/20w5175 and
http://www-personal.umich.edu/~weiho/win5/. The award, which provides travel
funding for underrepresented minorities in the mathematical sciences to
participate in the workshop at the Banff International Research Stations will
also strengthen accessibility by faculty from smaller institutions and at
earlier career stage.

This workshop will support the continued development of the number theory
community by bringing together researchers at various stages of their careers
(including graduate students, postdoctoral researches, tenure-track faculty, and
senior mathematicians) for research collaboration and mentoring. The scientific
focus of the workshop is on cutting-edge topics in number theory, including
dynamical Mahler measure, mock theta functions and related combinatorics, number
theory in function fields, q-Analogues of generalized van Hamme
supercongruences, representations of p-adic groups, self-dual normal bases and
cohomological invariants, supersingular isogeny graphs in cryptography, and zeta
functions with coefficients in the Grothendieck-Witt ring.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
