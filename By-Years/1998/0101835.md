The first Conference on Social Cognitive Neuroscience will be held on the UCLA
campus in April 2001. This conference will highlight the new but fast growing
field of Social Cognitive Neuroscience. Symposia will focus on Social Relations
and Theory of Mind, Emotion, Control and Automaticity, Attitudes and Attitude
Change, and Stereotyping and Social Perception. Each symposium will consist of
research reports using neuroimaging, neuropsychological, or computational
modeling methodologies. Additional panel discussions will allow cognitive
neuroscientists and social scientists to discuss ways in which important
questions from the social sciences can be tested using the methods of cognitive
neuroscience. There will also infrastructure talks focusing on developing
coherent training programs in social cognitive neuroscience and securing funding
for this sort of interdisciplinary research. There will also be a poster session
to allow for rapid transmission of other research findings. Informal sessions
will allow additional opportunities for researchers to become acquainted and to
share their latest research results. The conference will help to inform the new
emphasis at NSF on cognitive neuroscience (NSF 01-041).&lt;br/&gt;
