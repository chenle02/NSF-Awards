Mass spectral techniques such as Electron Impact (EI), Chemical Ionization (CI)
and Fast Atom Bombardment (FAB) are used to probe intimate structural details
and to obtain the molecular compositions of a vast array of organic, bioorganic,
and organometallic molecules. The acquisition of instrumentation capable of
carrying out these state-of-the-art techniques is essential for the prosecution
of frontier research in several fields of chemistry and biology. The purchase of
an analytical high resolution mass spectrometer will be facilitated by support
from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program and the Biological
Instrumentation Program. The areas of chemistry and biology that will be
enhanced include: 1) Determination of Organic Structures and Reaction Mechanisms
2) Reaction Pathways in Polynuclear Metal Carbonyls 3) Stereoselective Synthesis
and Characterization of Natural Products 4) Auto-oxidation of Cobalt Dioxygen
Complexes 5) Mass Spectrometric Probes of Enzyme Structures and Mechanisms 6)
Studies on the Dissociation Dynamics of Large Molecules 7) Applications of Mass
Spectrometry to Biochemistry and Toxicology 8) Model Systems for Biological
Oxidation Reactions 9) Characterization of Biologically Important Molecules
