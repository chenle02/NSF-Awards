This research seeks to identify what faculty in engineering and related STEM
fields do that causes students to feel more supported. The literature tells us
that students who feel more supported by faculty and interact more with them
engage more, feel better, and do better academically. Yet, we lack an
understanding of the impacts of faculty behaviors that is detailed enough to
give faculty and other instructors specific strategies for success to apply to
diverse students in a range of settings and
classes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Without this knowledge, faculty attempts to
support students can be diluted or fail altogether. This project's goal is to
take the randomness out of the equation so that faculty can effectively help and
strongly support students. This project adopts both quantitative and qualitative
data collected in both course-level case studies and longitudinal research
designs over short (quarter-long) time scales. A wide range of instruments
including surveys, interviews, faculty/TA reports, and observations will be
used. The overall goal is to capture a rich picture of particular courses with
the goal of understanding how students become highly engaged or when they do not
engage, what appears to limit or hold back their engagement.
