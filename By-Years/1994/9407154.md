Magneto-electro-optics represents a new facet of optical investigations in which
electric fields perturb magneto- optic effects and magnetic fields perturb
electro-optic effects. Many fundamental magneto-optic effects in magnetic
semiconductors and their superlattices require large magnetic fields to resolve
spectroscopic features in dilute magnetic materials with weak magnetization.
This project provides funds to Purdue University for the purchase of a 9 Tesla
transverse-field optical cryostat for solid-state research on magneto-electro-
optic effects in semiconductors, superconductors and magnetic oxides. The high
magnetic field will allow access to new physical phenomena that are currently
inaccessible. The apparatus will be used by three principal investigators and
their students engaged in four independent, but related, research projects. The
high-field cryostat is necessary for studies of Faraday Effect, Voigt Effect and
Excitonic Zeeman Effect, especially with respect to saturation features. Purdue
University has a strong effort in magnetic semiconductors with substantial
growth and fabrication facilities that would fully support the research needs.
