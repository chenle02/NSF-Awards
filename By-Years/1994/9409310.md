In the visual cortex of the brain, areas V1 and V2 are known to be involved in
the processing of signals for spatial aspects of vision, including such features
as texture discrimination and motion. Texture segregation is the process of
distinguishing an object in the visual scene not by a local analysis of its
shape and structure (called form perception), but by a more global analysis of
its internal patterning. The spatial aspects of position and motion also can
involve such global analysis in addition to local analysis. This project extends
work on the nature of such spatial processing, and its relation to our
perception of texture and movement, using a combination of physiological and
psychophysical experiments. The use of identical stimuli for the physiology and
the perception experiments allows correlation and interpretation of measures of
detectability and discriminability for the individual cortical nerve cells and
for conscious perception. A novel method of producing quantifiably variable
patterned stimuli allows a separation of features related to the overall
stimulus from features related to fine structure. Results will lead to a better
understanding of the combinatorial rules for how the visual system integrates
information about what an object is and where it is in the environment, which
are two fundamental tasks for visually guided behavior. This study will have an
impact beyond just visual science, to neuroscience and computational work, and
will be of interest for work on artificial visual systems.
