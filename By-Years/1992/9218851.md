Due to the recent turn down of submarine telephone cables by their commercial
operators, there is an opportunity to make planetary scale measurements of the
geodlectric field variations on the unpowered cables at a number of locations
around the world. Recent work indicates that the long (thousands of km) cables
average out the motionally-induced electric field from ocean flows out to
periods of 10-20 days, in contrast to point electric field sensors which are
dominated by the ocean at 4 days or longer. This means that the cable electric
field may be used for deep sounding of the electrical conductivity of the mantle
by the magetotelluric methods to depths extending well into the lower mantle.
This project is a preliminary magetotelluric study using existing data from the
HAW-1 cable collected at Bell Labs and the installation of special high
stability voltage monitoring equipment on three segments of TPC-1 extending from
Hawaii to Midway, Midway to Wake, and Wake to Guam. This will enable the
potential difference across the entire Pacific basin to be measured.
