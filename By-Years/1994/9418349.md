In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program in the Chemistry
Division, Peter Felker of UCLA will continue his spectroscopic studies of the
structures and intermolecular potential energy surfaces of large neutral
molecular clusters. This work relies on the technique of rotational coherence
spectroscopy (RCS) which Felker helped develop in his lab at UCLA. The new
studies include the addition of mass selection and ionization-detected Raman
spectroscopy, fully quantum multidimensional calculations of potential energy
surface via a collaboration with Prof. Zlatko Bacic of NYU, and examining very
large cluster sizes (in some cases, greater than 20 moieties). Information will
be obtained on geometries, potential energy surfaces, and the vibrational
dynamics of the large clusters. %%% By exposing molecules in the gas phase to
short, sharp pulses of laser light at the proper frequency, Prof. Felker can
obtain information about the geometric structures of a relatively small,
controlled number of interacting molecules. This information is very useful for
understanding how molecules behave in the initial stages of a wide variety of
chemical reactions. In addition, molecular clusters also exist in nature, such
as in the atmosphere as well as in combustion flames. These experiments will
thus provide information relevant to atmospheric as well as combustive processes
and will also permit tests of various theories of intermolecular interaction.
Ultimately a more detailed understanding of chemically significant systems will
emerge which is relevant to areas such as the environment or biology.
