Surfaces of many engineering structures are designed as doubly curved shapes to
fulfill functional requirements such as hydrodynamic, aesthetic, or structural.
Experiments have shown that it is feasible to laser form 3D shapes such as
doubly curved shapes, but forming accuracy issues need to be better understood
via enhanced process prediction capability. Similarly, the process synthesis
schemes developed for laser forming (LF) of simple shapes need further
advancement for 3D LF process. This project is aimed at significantly advancing
the state of knowledge LF technology, from idealized to more practical shapes,
and from analysis to synthesis. The modeling and synthesis efforts will be
accompanied by an experimental program including pre- and post-forming
microstructure and mechanical property characterizations. Other high temperature
deformation processes will be able to leverage upon the improved understanding
and synthesis capabilities to be developed in the project. Practically, the
success of the project will open-up new opportunities for manufacturing of high
performance but conventionally hard-to-form materials, leading to innovative
applications, thus opening new design options. The development of reliable
process synthesis schemes will enable the process make its way to industrial
applications, as a rapid prototyping tool for high production volume and a
flexible manufacturing tool for low production volume sheet metal working. The
results will have a significant impact on the economy and industry
competitiveness since sheet metal working is so pervasive. Results from this
project will be integrated into a graduate level course. Efforts will be made to
involve undergraduate students, and to identify and recruit qualified students
from traditionally underrepresented backgrounds.&lt;br/&gt;
