The long term goal of this project is to determine the nature of site specific
structural and functional interactions of transfer RNA (tRNA) with other nucleic
acids and proteins particularly with regard to the structure found around the
modified nucleosides. Site specific heteronuclear enrichment of modified
nucleosides combined with proton and heteronuclear NMR techniques (for the
probing of local conformations and structure not readily accessible by other
methods) will be carried out. A unique E. coli plasmid has been constructed into
which any chemically synthesized tRNA gene can be placed for overproduction of
the tRNA in vivo. Both 13C-enriched wild type and designed mutant tRNAs with
site selected nucleoside changes can be produced in quantity for analysis of
biochemical function and for NMR studies. The interaction of tRNA with proteins
and nucleic acids depends upon the tRNA molecule's conformation in solution and
its specific flexibilities, neither of which are fully understood. A study of
tRNA conformation and site specific mobility is also important for a comparison
of E. coli and yeast tRNA structures. The advantage of NMR over other physical
techniques in studying macromolecules in solution is that signals are obtainable
from reporter groups in many different parts of the molecules simultaneously.
