This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). Nearly hundred years after the debut of Einstein's theory of
general relativity, gravitational waves are viewed as one of the most intriguing
but still elusive astrophysical phenomena. They are expected to be emitted by
extreme astrophysical sources such as merging black hole binary systems,
spinning neutron stars, gamma-ray bursts or supernovae. Superb and finely tuned
gravitational-wave telescopes are required for detection and astrophysics
investigations. This award will enable members of the Columbia Experimental
Gravity group to participate in activities to improve the performance of the
LIGO gravitational wave detectors. Group members will focus on mission-critical
activities directly affecting the sensitivity of the LIGO Scientific
Collaboration's searches for cosmic gravitational waves such as detector
diagnostics and calibration. A well characterized and precisely calibrated
detector in turn could enable the data analysts to execute searches that see
farther, see more, produce fewer false alarms and extract more information from
plausible future detections. Students from high school through graduate level
will have the opportunity to participate in this research. In addition, the
urban setting and existing outreach infrastructure of Columbia University will
enable unique educational and outreach activities based on this research that
target schools not only in the local community but also in the greater New York
City metropolitan area.
