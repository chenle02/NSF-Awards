Westminster College requests support from NSF for connection of its campus
network to WESTnet. Westnet is the midlevel network located in the state of Utah
which will provide operations management and information services and it will
give Westminster College a 56 thousand bits per second connection to the NSFNET,
a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National Backbone network. The
College needs greater functionality and network speed to be able to access
supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers along with being able to
implement a more reliable mail system. Students and faculty research will
benefit from the link. This is also a unique opportunity for the school to
explore innovative educational resources.
