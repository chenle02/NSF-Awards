This project establishes an I-Corps Site at the University of Massachusetts
Lowell&lt;br/&gt;(UMass Lowell). The Site builds on existing programs while
establishing/strengthening existing collaborations with The University of
Massachusetts Medical School, University of Massachusetts Boston, and Middlesex
Community College. Activities of the site will include: training teams,
nurturing and mentoring teams, awarding grants for customer discovery, and
facilitating follow-on support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSF Innovation Corps
(I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose
purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their
technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice,
resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable
groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps
Team applicants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of the strengths that this
institution brings to the I-Corps Site Program are: UMass Lowell has a
percentage of 1st time in college students that is significantly higher than
most private universities; the programs that will be associated with the I-Corps
Site have a track record for attracting women and minorities into their
programming; a clear methodology for tracking and evaluating team success is
provided that captures various aspects of performance and other programmatic
characteristics; and, based on the description of existing programs and
initiatives at the institution, there appears to be adequate resources in place
to carry out the proposal. The project plans to engage a wide variety of
institutional partners while also targeting women, first-generation students and
students of color for participation in the Sites program. The potential to
realize broader impacts is a definite strength of the proposal.
