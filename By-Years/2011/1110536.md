This doctoral dissertation improvement project will study factors causing algal
blooms in lakes and reservoirs. An experimental approach in which the absolute
concentration of phosphorus, the amount of phosphorus relative to nitrogen, and
the amount of light are manipulated will be used to assess how these factors
affect the occurrence and abundance of algal species. The study will also assess
what combination of factors lead to toxin production by blue-green
algae.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many inland waters are impacted by excessive
nutrient input, which can lead to surface scums of algae. This cultural
eutrophication can lead to decreases in property values and recreational
opportunities, and in some cases can result in disruptions of drinking water
supplies. Understanding the factors leading to algal blooms is important in
developing strategies to mitigate the effects of nutrient pollution in surface
waters.
