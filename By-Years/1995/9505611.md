This meeting, Columbia University Theory Days, is a meeting which has been held
twice per year, once in the fall and once in the spring, for the past twelve
years. This continuing conference attracts 150 -- 200 researchers, mostly from
the Metropolitan New York City Area. Each theory day consists of four one-hour
invited talks, with scheduled discussion session after each talk. There are two
primary goals which have been accomplished by the previous twenty-four theory
days: (1) The opportunity for theoretical computer scientists to meet and
exchange ideas; (2) Permit those researchers in allied areas to learn of new
theoretical results and to encourage theoreticians to help solve problems in
these applied areas. The mailing list contains more than 700 names of
scientists, students and computer professionals with an interest in theory. The
speakers of the first twenty-four theory days included such theoreticians as A.
Shamir, S. Micali, M. O. Rabin, R. Karp, A. R. Meyers, J. D. Ullman, C.
Papadimitriou, N. Lynch, S. Goldwasser, S. R. Kosaraju and J. Feigenbaum. The
Department of Computer Science at Columbia University covered the expense of the
first five years, and the department together with the National Science
Foundation covered the expense of the following seven years. The National
Science Foundation is providing partial support for the next six Theory Days.
