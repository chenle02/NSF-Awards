Computer Science (31)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the need to
include underrepresented persons in the technological workforce, focusing on
students in the New Jersey City University (NJCU) Opportunity Scholarship
Program (OSP) who plan to major in computer science. It adapts constructivist
educational principles to develop an integrated learning environment for these
students that supplements an existing pre-freshman summer
program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project develops curricula and materials for
two courses: a basic Introduction to Computer Science, and Mathematics for
Computer Science. These courses are closely linked and emphasize the connections
between specific mathematics skills and particular computer science problems.
The courses are enriched with journal writing and online collaborative learning
to build students' metacognitive skills to monitor their learning. The
integrated, interdisciplinary nature of this project with its emphasis on
developing metacognitive skills will enhance the effectiveness of the students
as lifelong learners.
