Air-sea fluxes of three atmospherically important gases (carbon dioxide,
dimethylsulfide, and acetone) will be measured aboard a ship platform using the
technique of eddy covariance. In addition, the water concentrations of these
species will be quantified. From the gradient in air and sea concentrations, and
the observed exchange flux, it will be possible to derive gas exchange
coefficients. The gases have very different seawater solubilities, so comparison
of these coefficients under a variety of biogeochemical, oceanographic, and
atmospheric conditions will provide significant insight into the mechanism of
air-sea gas exchange.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of this work include
contributions to the understanding of processes affecting atmospheric reactivity
and climate change by helping to quantify important sources and sinks of these
species. The data acquired in this study will be valuable for testing models of
the budgets of these species. This project will also provide support for a
graduate student to carry out dissertation research.
