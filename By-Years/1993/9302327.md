A theoretical, computational and experimental research program will be
undertaken to develop a new framework for plasticity which will be capable of
describing the deformation process when the length scale over which there are
high strain gradients is too small for the conventional continuum theory of
plasticity to explain, yet is large compared to the size of the relevant
microstructure (e.g., dislocation structures or particles). The main focus of
this investigation will be on the flow strength of materials containing elastic
reinforcements (i.e., metal-matrix composites) and the manner in which these
reinforcements interact with the matrix flow field over a wide range of size
scales.
