This proposal is for a continuation of work to develop optical wave guidelines
for high rate optical signal processing. The previous work led to the
development of a nonlinear optical interferometer capable of performing logical
functions at, potentially, extremely high rates. The proposed project seeks to
use this interferometer (or a suitably modified version of it) to perform
fundamental quantum measurements, in particular, to provide for lossless taps on
light propagation in an adjacent fiber guide. Although it is hard to say how
wide spread the application of the proposed research will be, it is certain that
the outcome of this research will broaden the understanding of how to make
measurements on quantum systems without substantially altering the features one
is trying to observe. The PI is considered to be extremely well qualified to
carry out the proposed research and I recommend funding of this project for
three years in accordance with the budget submitted with the proposal.
