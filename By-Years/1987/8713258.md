Proposed is research on the processing of powder materials by high-pressure
shock compression. Exothermic chemical reactions to aid sintering are induced in
a powder mixture by shock wave pulses passing through the mixture. This process
is applied to several metallic systems including those where efforts on powder
consolidation have proven to be difficult. Intermetallic alloys such as titanium
aluminide and nickel- aluminide are explored to determine the effects of this
type of processing on their properties. The feasibility of scaling up these
shock-induced reactions for engineering applications is part of the program. The
ultimate aim is to model the consolidation process, coupled with the synthesis
by chemical reactions, to gain predictive capabilities. The research is
performed at New Mexico Tech. (high-pressure impact, scale-up), Los Alamos
(modeling), Sandia (shock-wave facilities, modeling), and California Institute
of Technology (shock-consolidation theory). This is an excellent area of
research, where the U.S. is lagging international competition. The research has
potentially high pay-off with the capability to produce new materials. Modeling
of the process variables is needed to permit the scaling up of the process to
larger sizes and more complex shapes.
