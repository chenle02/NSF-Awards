This project, the Scholars in Math and Science (SIMS), addresses the continued
under representation of minorities in both the STEM and health science fields.
Two cohorts of six to eight students are granted scholarships; the first group
for four years and the second for three years with the last year paid for by the
school. Based on a comprehensive literature review, seven key actions are done
to ensure student recruitment and success. These are (1) target recruitment at
partnering high schools with help from guidance counselors and at the area free
clinic, (2) pre-freshman orientation and first-year seminar, (3) a bridge
program between high school and college, (4) mentoring, research or internship
experience, (5) tutoring, in this case peer led learning sessions for gateway
courses such as general and organic chemistry, physics and calculus, (6) career
counseling and awareness, and (7) financial assistance. The broader impacts are
that students in the same courses as the Scholars benefit from the same support
services and the results of this project are being professionally disseminated.
