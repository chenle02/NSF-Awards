This project in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program involves
study of electron nuclear dynamics in molecules. Most previous work has assumed
electronic and nuclear motions to be separable. Here, new theoretical and
computational methods will be developed to allow study of the coupling of these
motions. Applications will be made to problems of current interest where such
effects are important. These include nonadiabatic couplings in molecular spectra
and the time-dependent dynamics of electron transfer processes.
