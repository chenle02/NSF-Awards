A computer lab/classroom in which all students in all appropriate upper-level
mathematics courses at Franklin College are being provided with daily computer
access, with the software program, Mathematica, providing a common thread
throughout these courses. The development of curriculum materials for the
project has already been funded through a Curriculum Development Grant from the
Lilly Endowment, Inc. This program, based on incorporating the principles of
discovery learning and collaborative learning into the daily classroom
activities, has been built by starting with the introduction of a laboratory
component into the freshman calculus sequence, continuing with the
implementation of computer-based activities into many upper-level courses. The
equipment provided allows the program to develop a coherent overall structure so
that it can provide a model of program integration for other colleges to follow.
