International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) is organizing a series
of three International Conferences on Phase Equilibrium and Related Property
Data to be held in Paris, France, September 4-11, 1985. Partial travel support
is provided for 4-6 participants from U.S. universities to attend these
meetings. Participation of top U.S. researchers is helping to maintain direct
knowledge of the future trends in experimental methods and measurements of these
critical physical properties.
