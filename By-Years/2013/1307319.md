In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry
(MSN) program in the Division of Chemistry, Qian Wang of the University of South
Carolina will develop a new strategy to synthesize functional polymer-protein
core-shell nanoparticles. Specifically, the project will focus on the design and
synthesis of biocompatible and biodegradable polymers for the fabrication of
polymer-protein core-shell nanoparticles. The assembly process will be
characterized quantitatively using solution small angle neutron scattering,
fluorescent microscopy, isothermal titration calorimetry and quartz crystal
microbalance techniques. Finally, in order to validate the synthetic chemistry,
a model core-shell nanoparticle system will be created for delivery and release
of a molecular payload. The broader impacts of the project involve the
interdisciplinary training of project participants, ranging from high school
students to undergraduate and graduate students. The project will enable them to
develop advanced research skills and provide international networks that will
serve students well in their future careers under the ever-growing situation of
economic globalization. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project will uncover
new ways to create small particles with nanometer dimensions that are hybrids of
synthetic materials and proteins. Such knowledge is essential for the
development of low-cost, structurally well-defined particles that could be used
for applications ranging from drug delivery, to protein pharmaceuticals, and to
the stabilization and support of enzyme catalysts.
