0134503&lt;br/&gt;Weiss&lt;br/&gt;Under this CAREER Award, methods from
theoretical and computational mechanics will be combined with pattern theory to
directly incorporate medical image data into the analysis of deforming
biological tissues. Results will provide new finite-element based tools that use
image data to track three-dimensional kinematics and nonlinear strain in
deforming tissues and to register anatomical structures appearing in image data
sets. Two applications would be targeted: in vivo measurement of strains in the
beating human heart and in situ measurement of strains in ligaments. The
techniques and resulting software, which will be made available to the public,
are expected to be applicable in numerous other areas including geophysics,
manufacturing engineering design, biology and computational medicine.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational component focuses on three areas:
bioengineering outreach to Utah high school students through a summer institute;
developing an integrated biomechanics curriculum built around three core
courses, and training undergraduate and graduate students in conjunction with
research objectives.&lt;br/&gt;
