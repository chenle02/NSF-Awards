Abstract

Award: DMS-0401925 Principal Investigator: Lars Andersson

This award provides partial support for graduate students and early career
researchers attending the Miami Conference on Geometric Analysis, Nonlinear Wave
Equations, and General Relativity.

Much of the mathematics relevant to the study of gravitation from geometric
points of view also appears in other problems, especially the study of nonlinear
differential equations modeling wave motion. This conference at the University
of Miami is the first of a projected series on important problems and recent
developments in these areas.
