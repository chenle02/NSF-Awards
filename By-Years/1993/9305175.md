Understanding the growth and development of faults is one of the classic
problems of geology, rock mechanics, and engineering geology. Existing theories
are based mainly on short-term, lab bench size laboratory experiments that are
then scaled to geologic time-scales and map scales. This approach has been far
from satisfying. This projects seeks to continue theoretical and field studies
directed at developing models that describe the growth and development of
faults. Creation of successful models will have tremendous implications in terms
of allowing for the prediction of the location of fractured hydrocarbon
reservoirs, the direction of propagation of fractures along loaded fault
segments, and analyzing ancient fault motions.
