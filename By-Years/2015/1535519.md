This grant supports the theoretical study of an electrical discharge phenomenon,
called multipactor, that occurs in a broad range of microwave devices.
Multipactor is a pernicious electrical discharge that can damage or destroy
accelerator structures and microwave components and related electronics, such as
antennas, satellite payloads, or radar systems. Despite decades of study,
especially in connection with rf systems for particle accelerators, it remains a
problem, and no consistent way has been found to eliminate it. The improved
understanding anticipated from this work will enable more compact and higher-
gradient particle accelerators. Many accelerator applications stand to benefit
from this, such as compact medical accelerators, accelerator-based neutron and
light sources used for basic research, and accelerator-based nuclear energy
generation and transmutation of nuclear waste. Space and satellite
communications will further benefit from this study. The grant will support one
graduate student, and will contribute to the literature, course material, and
further educational outreach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective is to analyze
multipactor in multicarrier systems using a novel multipactor theory based on
techniques from nonlinear dynamics and chaos. Multipactor in the presence of
multiple carrier rf signals (i.e. multiple rf frequencies) is an especially
challenging problem that has almost no theoretical studies. The new approach
aims to identify multipacting region boundaries and stability by globally
analyzing the structure of dynamical space. The theoretical results will be
tested against computer simulations using a particle-in-cell code, and against
experiments conducted by our collaborators at ValSpace Consortium in Valencia,
Spain.
