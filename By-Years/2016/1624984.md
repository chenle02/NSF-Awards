An award is made to the University of New England (UNE) in Biddeford, Maine, to
acquire a FlowCam Imaging Particle Analysis System to strengthen instrumentation
for multidisciplinary research and teaching at a primary undergraduate
institution. The FlowCam system will allow multiple faculty to extend their
current work to the "plankton/particulate" level, and/or start new
plankton/particulate-oriented projects. The FlowCam will also be used in
teaching of multiple classes in several departments, in local high schools, and
will support undergraduate research projects in context of a current NSF IUSE
grant. Every year more than 430 undergraduates in at least 7 courses at UNE and
at least 120 high school students at 2 high schools will work on FlowCam
projects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phytoplankton, zooplankton and detritus play
important roles in the oceans food webs as primary producers and key food
sources at the base of the food web. Including plankton/particulate-level
analyses in studies on the reproduction of invasive species, fish diversity,
bivalve feeding and growth rates and more will significantly increase our
understanding of the respective processes and benefit several key local marine
issues. Research projects will include such diverse areas as: interactions
between two invasive crustacean crab species, a long-term biomonitoring study on
phyto- and zooplankton, ichthyoplankton distribution and diversity in a small
river plume, field investigations of the use of detritus by bivalves, plankton
composition and structure in four lakes as it relates to climate change and
watershed perturbations, and flow imaging technology for evaluation of elastin-
like polymer coacervates.
