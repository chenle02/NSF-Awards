0853691 &lt;br/&gt;Schatz&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs plan novel laboratory
tests of a new and fundamentally different theoretical view of wall turbulence.
Organized flows (coherent structures) near smooth walls play a central role in
turbulence production over a wide range of Reynolds numbers. Recent theoretical
work with large scale numerical computation has revealed a class of unstable,
exact Navier-Stokes solutions termed "exact coherent structures" (ECS), which
capture essential features of classic coherent structures. In particular, theory
suggests ECS can be used construct simplified descriptions of wall turbulence.
While theory/numerics have made a compelling case for an ECS-based description
in highly idealized turbulent flows with periodic boundary conditions, very
little is known about whether this viewpoint can describe turbulence in the lab.
The PIs plan experimental studies of ECS in circular Couette flow where
turbulence is initialized by precise, optically-imposed disturbances and
measured by 3D velocimetry. The PI's unique method of optical distributed flow
actuation has already been tested in other flows; thus, the experiments will
focus directly on flow physics instead of actuator development. Laboratory
testing of an ECS-based description will begin first with the adaptation of
theoretical state space visualization techniques to experiments. The experiments
will then identify important ECS. In particular, the PIs will focus on the Lower
Branch ECS, which appears to play a key "gatekeeper" role in the transition
between laminar and turbulent flow. Characterization of Lower Branch ECS will
set the stage for novel approaches to turbulence flow control. Turbulence is a
major consideration in the design of transport vehicles on land, at sea or in
the air. In practical applications; even modest improvements in turbulence
control could have enormous economic impact. The tools of dynamical systems are
becoming ever more important in solving engineering problems. Thus, our planned
work will implement a laboratory module on state space visualization of pendulum
dynamics that will be included in a novel introductory calculus-based
engineering physics curriculum at Georgia Tech and at Spelman College, the
country's leading Historically Black College/University for women.
