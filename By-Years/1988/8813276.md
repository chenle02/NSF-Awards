A group travel grant will permit seven U.S. scientists to attend the 9th
International Conference on Spectral Line Shapes in Torun, Poland, July 25-29,
1988. The conference will cover aspects of physical processes associated with
the formation of spectral-line profiles as observed in the absorption, emission
or scattering of radiation by plasmas and neutral gases. Emphasis will be placed
on pressure broadening and other fields where the coupling of collisional and
radiative processes is of major importance, with a special session on collision-
induced phenomena.
