*** 9704451 The increasing importance of an annual meeting of researchers funded
by the Interactive Systems Program of the National Science Foundation is
underscored by a national agenda that views improved interfaces as vital to our
Nation's economic competitiveness, that proposes universal access to the NII by
every citizen, and that hopes to place computers in every classroom with network
access. Attendees of the First Grantees Workshop (in November 1995) reported
uniformly positive experiences. Researchers were delighted to meet and interact
with colleagues working in related fields, and to learn first- hand about the
research and challenges in each others' areas. The proposed venue for the Second
Grantee Workshop is in Oregon from August 16th through August 18th, dates which
have been found to be in minimal conflict with other meetings and which allow
for economical pricing of rooms. The proposed workshop agenda will be developed
by a steering committee, with feedback from participants of the last Grantee's
Workshop. The paramount goals will be to foster fruitful exchange of ideas and
to stimulate interaction among colleagues. The workshop will also produce an
HTML document, modeled on the previous effort, which summarizes the different
projects supported by the Interactive Systems Program.***
