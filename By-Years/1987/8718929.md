The actions of prolactin (PRL) are characterized by cellular differentiation and
the changes of gene expression that underlie that differentiation. This research
is directed toward understanding the induction of altered gene expression in
pigeon crop tissue by prolactin. This model is especially useful because the
tissue organization and development is relatively simple, and the changes
prolactin induces are profound and rapid. Various molecular approaches are used.
Specific prolactin-induced gene products have been identified by us through in
vivo and in vitro protein synthesis, cloning, differential hybridization,
immunochemical probes, and hybridization with known genes. The mechanisms
responsible for PRL-induced gene expression will be the subject of the
experiments described in this proposal. Sequencing of the major PRL-inducible
cDNAs from the crop will be completed to examine possible relationships of these
genes with genes of known function. These data will also be useful later in
making predictions about sequences involved in the regulation of the genes.
Nuclear run-off transcription assays and mRNA turnover measurements will be used
to determine whether the regulation of PRL- inducible mRNAs is primarily at a
transcriptional or post- transcriptional level. Based on data thus far it is
expected that a large part of the regulation will be post-transcriptional. If
so, the biochemical nature of the factors responsible for controlling PRL-
inducible mRNA decay will be studied by reconstituting either native or cloned
PRL-inducible transcripts with cytosolic factors from crop tissues. Decay of the
products will be measured by either hybridization or electrophoresis of end-
labelled transcripts. If transcription is the primary mechanism of PRL control,
the genomic structure of one or more of the PRL-inducible genes will be
determined by Southern analysis, genomic cloning, S1 mapping and sequencing. The
proposed experiments will provide an understanding of the mechanisms and
substrates of prolactin stimulation in the crop tissue model, and will
contribute to the general understanding of the mechanism of action of this
important hormone.
