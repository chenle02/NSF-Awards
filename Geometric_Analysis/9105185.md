The uniformization theorem of one complex variable completely classifies the
one dimensional simply connected complex manifolds. There is no corresponding
result for higher dimensional complex manifolds and it is important to try to
find some method which will provide a substitute classification. The principal
investigator will try to classify those higher dimensional complex manifolds
which satisfy a pinched curvature condition. Classification of a set of objects
which satisfy a common property or condition is one tool mathematicians use to
understand structures and their relationships. If one can list all objects which
have a restricted common property, then one better understands the property and
the objects. The principal investigator will attempt to do this with manifolds
or surfaces whose curvature falls between certain bounds.
