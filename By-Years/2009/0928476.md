The Maine Mathematics and Science Alliance is partnering with Augusta School
District, Lake Region School District (Maine SAD 61), Messalonskee School
District (Maine SAD 47), Southern Maine Community College, University of Maine
at Augusta, and the University of Maine at Farmington highlighting the
connections between Maine's Energy Future and Maine's Educational Future (MEF2).
The partnership is further supported by the Maine Departments of Education and
Labor as well as the Maine STEM Collaborative and the Gulf of Maine Research
Institute. MEF2 is preparing 6th to 9th grade science teachers to address the
need for students to develop "energy literacy" by going beyond traditional
course boundaries to 1) provide a deep understanding of energy processes and
resources and 2) demonstrate how these energy principles translate into energy
jobs in a state with abundant natural renewable sources of energy (i.e. wind,
wave, solar and biomass). The MEF2 project through its governmental partners is
informing statewide educational and workforce policies as well as demonstrating
the potential of STEM partnerships to bridge the gaps between teachers,
scientists from community and four-year colleges, and teacher
educators.&lt;br/&gt;
