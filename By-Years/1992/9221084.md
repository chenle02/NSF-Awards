Deuterium labeled potential biosynthetic precursors will be prepared for a study
of the mechanism of defensive carboxylic acid biosynthesis in carabid beetles.
These precursors will include specifically labeled examples of a number of amino
acids, such as L-valine, L-isoleucine, and L-leucine. Exploratory studies are
also planned on the biosynthesis of the azamacrolides and related beetle-
produced alkaloids. %%% This research on the defensive chemistry of insects
should make significant contributions to our understanding of both biosynthesis
and chemical diversity. The phyletic dominance of insects on earth is at least
in part related to their "skill" in synthesizing a variety of highly effective
defensive chemicals. Knowledge of how these chemicals are produced should give
insights into insect chemistry, which may in turn have practical implications,
and also reveal some new aspects of fundamentally important biochemical
mechanisms.
