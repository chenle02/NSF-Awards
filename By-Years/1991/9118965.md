In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry program of the Chemistry
Division, Professors Bevan and Lucchese of Texas A&amp;M University will use
pulsed lasers to characterize hydrogen bond dynamics of gas phase systems. By
making use of modern high resolution spectroscopic techniques applied to
relatively simple diatomic and triatomic systems, it will be possible to test
quantitative models for fundamental hydrogen bond properties at a level of
detail not suitable for more complex situations. %%% Hydrogen bonding is one of
the most significant interactions between molecules. This kind of interaction
influences such diverse properties as the boiling and freezing points of water
and the structure of genetic material (DNA). The time course of rapid hydrogen
bond formation can best be investigated in simple gas phase systems which are
amenable to detailed theoretical calculations. Professors Bevan and Lucchese
will conduct experiments and develop appropriate theory for such systems, and
the result will be a deeper understanding of the ubiquitous hydrogen bonding
process.
