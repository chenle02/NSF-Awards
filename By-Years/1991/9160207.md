As an alternative to mercury-cadmium telluride (MCT), this program will
investigate the optical properties of a recently invented class of type II
strained-layer superlattices made of (GA,As) related compounds. The new concept
has advantages compared with previous efforts in that small band-gaps may be
achieved with sufficiently thin repeating layers in the superlattices so that
they have good optical absorption properties and favorable electrical transport
properties original calculations have indicated Ga1-xInxSb/InAs to be the best
choice for such application. Very recently it has been shown to have the highest
absorption coefficient at 10um wavelength compared to all other superlattice
materials. To explore the potential of this material system, the investigators
will fabricate the detector device structures by a multi-process molecular beam
epitaxy technique in which the detector layers, passivation and metallization
are all done in-situ.
