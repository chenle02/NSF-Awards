This is to organize and provide travel support for a two day workshop near the
Washington DC area to explore the utility, challenges and interest level for
science investigations enabled by regular in-situ profiling of the upper
atmosphere. Multiple companies are currently in the process of developing
commercial reusable suborbital spacecraft. While these companies originally
targeted space tourism as the primary customer base, it is rapidly becoming
apparent that this dramatic increase in low cost access to space could also
provide revolutionary opportunities for scientific research and STEM education.

The workshop is planned for the spring of 2013. It will be widely publicized
within the relevant scientific communities, including via aeronomy community
mailing lists. Featured participants, and student participation will be
particularly solicited with a focus on under-represented communities, and a
modest participant support budget is requested to defray the costs of these
individuals. Results of the workshop will be summarized in a report and the
workshop will also be used as the basis for the formation of an informal working
group that will continue to organize the community around this topic.
