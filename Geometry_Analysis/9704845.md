Some counting problems admit extra symmetries, such as invariance under actions
of a semisimple Lie group. These problems can sometimes be solved by techniques
involving ergodic theory. We are working on examples from number theory,
geometry and dynamics. The phenomenon of symmetry is central to certain counting
problems. Typically these problems cannot be solved unless all of the hidden
symmetry is exploited. The proposed methods consist of studying the interplay
between the symmetric patterns and the chaotic phemomena of ergodic theory.
