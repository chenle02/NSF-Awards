Analytical chemistry provides the basic mechanism for the control of chemical
and biological processes. Major increases in productivity can occur when these
analytical techniques can be developed to provide on-line control of continuous
chemical processes. A planning grant was awarded to the University of Washington
to study the potential for a Center in Process Analytical Chemistry. The study
showed that a Center was needed and has the potential to become self-sustaining
through industrial support. Thus, a Center for Process Analytical Chemistry is
initiated at the University of Washington as an experiment in
university/industry interaction. Research will be responsive to industrial
supporters.
