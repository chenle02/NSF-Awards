Tufts University will explore the feasibility of engineering instruments for
audio composition to broaden participation in computing and engineering design.
The Tufts project staff, in collaboration with Dr. Rebecca Fiebrink at
Goldsmiths College, University of London, will investigate how participation in
the development and use of a programmable instrument construction toolkit for
audio composition and accompanying pedagogy can increase interest, engagement,
and learning by underrepresented youth females, African-Americans, and Latinos
in computing and physical engineering. The team will develop and evaluate
physical and virtual kits that enable teens to design and build their own
physical input devices, then to program electronic synthesizers that translate
manipulations of those devices into audio compositions. WeJam uses design-based
research, incorporating methods from participatory design and the learning
sciences, to investigate how to refine these tools and the pedagogical
activities that draw upon them in order to maximize interest, enjoyment, and
learning by the target populations.
