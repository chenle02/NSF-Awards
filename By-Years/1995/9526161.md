An ab-initio quantum chemistry program MELD will be maintained, updated and
distributed without charge. New features such as a parallel computer direct
configuration interaction method with importance selection will be implemented.
An improved eigenvalue method will be developed and distributed in a stand-alone
form for incorporation with other programs. Applications will be made to
interesting problems in spectra, reactivity and structure. The collaborations
will continue with the ESR studies, the EMS studies and the PES studies. The PI
will also continue studies of organic reactions involving biradical
intermediates. A part of this research will be the development of tools to
better study iron sulfur complexes of importance to biology. Modern quantum
chemical theoretical methods will be developed and used to study a variety of
reactions of importance in both chemistry and biochemistry. In particular these
methods will be extended to enable the study of large systems on new and
emerging massively parallel computers. The methods involve the sophisticated
evaluation of accurate energies and structures for a number of iron-sulfur
containing compounds which prove particularly challenging theoretically.
