A theoretical and numerical study will be undertaken for the development of
microscopic models for foam rheology. The connection between the foam structure
and macroscopic properties will be developed starting from idealized situations.
The model includes the role of interfacial rheology and film-level flow. The
research will be conducted in collaboration with A. Kraynik of Sandia national
Laboratories. The project has long term applications in oil production and
manufacturing of plastic and cellular plastics.
