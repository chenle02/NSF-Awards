Self-organizing particle systems consist of numerous autonomous "particles"
(individuals) that move through space in a coordinated fashion, guided by
influences that they exert on one another. Past computational methods based on
such particle systems have primarily been used to produce striking computer
animation effects, such as movement of a flock of birds or a school of fish, and
to control movements of experimental robot teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal
of this project is to extend the methods currently used in particle systems to
produce a goal-directed and adaptive collective intelligence. The individual
particles have a limited capacity memory, prioritized goals, a repertoire of
sequential movement patterns, and the ability to learn. The specific objectives
are to create benchmark test problems for evaluating particle systems that have
been extended in this fashion, to implement a goal-driven control mechanism for
individual particles, to give particles the ability to learn during problem-
solving, and to apply evolutionary computation approaches to create alternate
control mechanisms. The methods used in this research include computer
simulation, machine learning and evolutionary computation. The primary expected
result is the creation of a multi-agent team that will function as an effective
problem-solving system. In addition to providing insight into the fundamental
computational principles underlying this approach to machine intelligence, the
results from this research will have substantial practical value in developing
natural scene computer animation, guiding the design of multi-robot teams, and
suggesting ideas to biologists studying self-organizing processes in nature.
