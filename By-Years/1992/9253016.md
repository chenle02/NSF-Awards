Clark Atlanta University (CAU) has established a High Performance Polymers And
Ceramics (HiPPAC) Research Center. The center consolidates and expands existing
polymer and ceramic research capabilities through the development of
interdepartmental and interinstitutional research anbd education clusters. To
donduct basic and applied research in high performancepolymers and ceramics in
the Center, major equipment and instrumentation are required. In this proposal
we request funds to acquire a thermal analysis system to support research
projectrs conducted in the HiPPAC Center. This instrumentation will provide the
HiPPAC Center investigators with the ability to examine th conversion of
preceramic materials to ceramic materials, and the characterization of ceramic
materials, in addition to the ability to characterize high performance polymers.
The growth in research and education programs in the materials area at CAU. and
in particular expansion into the preceramic and ceramic area, necessitates the
acquisition of a thermal analysis system- that includes a high temperature
TG/DTA and DSC and TMA with programmable temperature conteol for below ambient
conditions and higher operating temperatures and is capable of high throughput
and state of the art diagnostic capabilities. The research projects that the
thermal analysis system will support are part of CAU's strong commitment to
enhance its overall development of research capabilities, strengthening minority
faculty and student experiences, establishing interinstitutional research
alliances with other HBCUs and major research universities, and strengtrhening
its undergraduate and graduate science degree programs.
