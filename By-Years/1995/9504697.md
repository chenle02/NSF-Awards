Dr. Charles H. Martin has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship
in Chemistry. Dr. Martin received his doctoral degree from the Universityof
Chicago under the supervision of Professor Karl Freed. Dr. Martin will continue
research at the University of Illinois at Urbana/Champaign under the sponsorship
of Professor Klaus Schulten. His postdoctoral research will target theoretical
biophysics utilizing high performance computers and quantum mechanical methods
using improved semiempirical model Hamiltonians to model biological processes.
His research will couple the correlated, effective valence shell Hamiltonian
electronic structure method with simulation techniques and computer programming
to understand the experimental absorption spectrum of retinal embedded in
transmembrane protein bacteriorhodopsin and to facilitate future quantum
mechanical/molecular dynamics studies of this system. The research will increase
our understanding of the quantum mechanical aspects of the retinal-
bacteriorhodopsin interactions and lay the foundation for dynamical simulations
of retinal photoisomerization and proton pump processes. The Postdoctoral
Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as an important
infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge and experience of new
Ph. D.s and attract them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical
research and teaching.
