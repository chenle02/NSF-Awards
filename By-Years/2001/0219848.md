The goal of the proposed research is to efficiently exploit on-chip parallelism
via the design and evaluation of a dynamically tunable clustered multithreaded
(DT-CMT) architecture. &lt;br/&gt;The proposed architecture will combine the
utilization advantages of simultaneous multithreaded architectures (SMTs) with
the speed advantages of chip multiprocessors (CMPs). &lt;br/&gt;The PIs will
design an architecture that can be rapidly configured into a restricted number
of organizations (so as to minimize speed and density impact) in order to
balance instruction-level parallelism and thread-level parallelism to maximize
utilization and minimize energy. &lt;br/&gt;Key to this approach will be the
development of software systems (compilers, runtime systems, multiprogramming
and multithreaded support) that analyze application requirements and combine
this&lt;br/&gt;knowledge with feedback mechanisms from the hardware. The
performance and power saving potential of this approach will be characterized
via simulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has the potential to
significantly impact the microarchitecture and software of future server and
network processors, and will help train the graduate students in the design of
future increasingly process technology-aware architectures. The proposed work
will allow dynamic tailoring of the processor&lt;br/&gt;architecture in order to
meet the needs of increasingly diverse applications, thereby allowing future
processors to scale as process technology
improves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
