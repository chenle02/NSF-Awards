This award will be used to acquire computer hardware and general- purpose
peripherals to be incorporated into a panchromatic data reduction and analysis
facility to meet the needs of the ground- based astronomy programs at the Center
for Astrophysics and Space Astronomy. By emphasizing the "panchromatic" needs of
modern astronomical research, this facility should have the ability to reduce
and analyze area-format data regardless of wavelength and, moreover, should have
the ability to intercompare these data as driven by scientific objectives.
Because this facility is being designed to meet the needs of both ground- and
space- based observations, funding for this facility is split among NSF, NASA,
and the University of Colorado. Currently, the data load has far outstripped the
capabilities of the current system, based upon a micro-VAX II, so to be that a
system with superior computational power and input/output implemented bus speed
is now required. The system is based upon the recent purchase by the University
of an Alliant FX/8 and allows an elegant solution to 2-D data reduction needs.
Peripherals will be added to the Alliant to provide the computational power
needed for major manipulations involving large format area detectors (e.g. bias
subtraction and flat- fielding of CCD images and sorting, Fourier-transforming
and "cleaning" of VLA images). A workstation is also needed to allow transfer of
reduced data from the Alliant to CASA for image display, analysis and final
output. Thus, this proposed facility neatly separates the CPU intensive tasks
from the I/O intensive ones and provides the most efficient machines to deal
with each.
