The goal of this research program is to fabricate semiconductor devices small
enough that new quantum-mechanical phenomena can be observed. Silicon MOSFET's
will be produced with narrow 25 nm width gates. The conductance of these devices
will be studied at low temperatures and high magnetic fields. Recent results
indicate that electron-electron interactions may be altered in such confined
geometries. To better understand the nature of the high-conductance state
observed at high magnetic fields, a variety of split-gate devices will be
fabricated with various widths but with constant ratio of length to width. By
keeping this aspect ratio constant on passing from very narrow to wide devices,
the researchers expect to observe the evolution of the high-field state in the
confined geometry into the quantum Hall state. In this way, the dependence of
the properties of the high field state on width can be measured. Experiments on
the magnetic field dependence of the step-gate devices will be carried out of
the Francis Bitter National Manget Laboratory.
