The proposal seeks to strengthen the collaboration between the PI's research
group and that of Karl Leo at the Technical University of Dresden in the area of
molecular beam epitaxy. The two groups have complementary capabilities in the
ultra-high vacuum deposition and characterization of crystalline organic dyes on
a variety of metals and optical quality single crystal substrates. The Dresden
group has made substantial progress in the interpretation of high energy
electron diffraction data by developing software models that account for all
atoms in the organic monolayer. That modeling capability will be transferred to
the U.S. research group in the course of this work. The experiments to be
performed are significant for both chemical sensor and light emitting diode
applications of organized thin films. Significant cross-disciplinary training is
expected for the students involved.
