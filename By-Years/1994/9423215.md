9423215 Riess This research will specify and estimate new empirical models of
entry and exit. The proposed empirical models fit into a developing literature
that explains the evolution of industrial concentration and its effect on
interfirm competition. A long-run goal of this research is to address
competition issues that arise in antitrust economics, industrial policy, and
international trade. The proposed models distinguish between technological,
demand, and strategic factors that affect entrants' willingness to compete with
established firms. An important goal is to model the effect that product
differentiation has on the extent of competitive entry. The research also
addresses dynamic issues, including the role of sunk costs in the timing of
entry and exit. The research will use unique data on the location and sales of
new and used car dealers to test the models. The empirical analysis will
illustrate the applicability of the proposed methods. The specific results will
provide information about the role of dealer systems in promoting retail
competition. As part of the proposal, the author will assemble new information
on consumer search patterns and transactions prices. These data will permit
desegregate studies of substitution patterns among overlapping brands and
dealers. It also will provide useful information about how consumer behavior is
influenced by market structure. ***
