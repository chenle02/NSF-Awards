In the data processing industry, an acute competition exists for devising novel
schemes for obtaining greater storage densities while at the same time realizing
rapid file access rates and reliable data retrieval. The major goal of the
proposed research is to develop an optical imaging system based on correlator-
based spatial filtering concepts for parallel processing of the read-back data
in optical magnetooptical data storage devices to realize high data rates and
improved Signal-to-Noise (SNR) ratio. The analytical development of the
processing system by employing the newly developed Synthetic Discriminant
Function concept will be conducted. An appropriate coding scheme for its
implementation will be developed and a laboratory demonstration of the
performance characteristics of the processing system will be conducted.
