&lt;br/&gt;The PI proposes to conduct experiments on the melting of peridotite
in order to quantitatively determine the effect of melt structure on trace
element partitioning at the peridotite, solidus at pressures of 1.5 to 3.0 Gpa.
The experiments will test the hypothesis that isobaric differences in trace
element partitioning can be related to differences in the extent of
polymerization of the melt-to be evaluated with new measurements of viscosity.
The experiments will be carried out on appropriate bulk compositions doped with
a few ppm of the elements of interest (a range of REE, LIL, and I-IFSE), with
analyses of partitioning to be done with the ion microprobe on cpx, opx, and
garnet and glass in quenched experimental charges. The results will have
numerous applications to melting in the earth's mantle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
