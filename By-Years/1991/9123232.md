This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work of Professor
Steven Bachrach at Northern Illinois University. Professor Bachrach will use
molecular orbital calculations and a topological electron density analysis in
order to examine organic reaction mechanisms. A series of electrocyclic
reactions involving phosphaalkenes and phosphaalkynes and nucleophilic
substitution reactions at heteroatoms will be examined. These studies will test
the concept of the transferability of mechanism type from element to element and
will offer assistance in the modification of reactants to facilitate these
reactions. %%% Calculations will be utilized to determine the energy content and
the electron distribution of the highest energy point between the starting
material and product in reactions involving organic compounds containing
phosphorus, oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur. The reactions chosen for study
represent an important class of reactions and will assist the developing
synthetic work in this area.
