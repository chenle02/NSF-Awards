This project supports a 4-day conference on "The geometry and topology of
3-manifolds" to be held May 25-28, 2018 at the Okinawa Institute of Science and
Technology on the island of Okinawa in Japan. This conference will bring
together a distinguished international group of about 60 participants to discuss
recent developments in this area. The participants will be a diverse group of
prominent researchers and promising junior mathematicians from Asia, Australia,
Western Europe, and North America, with most participants being from Asia and
the US. This award will provide funding for ten US based graduate students or
recently graduated postdocs to attend the conference.

The study of 3-manifolds from the classical topological viewpoint and its study
from the geometric viewpoint have been increasingly overlapping. Among recent
well-known results in the area are Perelman's solution of the Geometrization
Conjecture (2006) and Agol's solution of the Virtual Haken Conjecture (2012).
These results explore the interactions between the geometry and topology of
3-manifolds, but raise even more questions about the nature of these
interactions. The conference will be devoted to new work that sheds light on
this picture. Topics covered will connect to hyperbolic geometry, algorithmic
methods, computational geometry, knot theory, geometric group theory, and new
invariants. This workshop will provide a venue for an exchange of ideas between
prominent Western topologists and leading researchers from Asia. It will feature
approximately 16 speakers presenting recent research progress. Additionally,
there will be a public lecture aimed at a general scientific audience.
