The proposed research will extend the Hawaii MF radar data set (compiled since
September, 1990) and provide for its analysis in several collaborative efforts
with other instrumentation and scientists. MF radar data, available for all
CADRE measurement campaigns and the ALOHA-93 campaign, will also provide an
extended overlap with data from similar radars at other locations. Possible
studies address topics ranging from gravity wave propagation, filtering, and
forcing of the middle atmosphere to tidal and two- day modulation and
interactions.
