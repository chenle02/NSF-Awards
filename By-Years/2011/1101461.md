This project is concerned with the further development of certain aspects of
multivariable operator theory, especially its connection with function theory in
several complex variables. The basic point of view of the theory is that one can
profitably study analytic functions by considering their action on matrix or
operator inputs, rather than just scalar inputs. Over the last half-century this
viewpoint has been extensively developed in the one-variable setting,
establishing deep connections between complex function theory, operator theory,
and functional analysis; von Neumann's inequality and the Sz.-Nagy Dilation
theorem are fundamental results in this area. Particular problems that will be
investigated in this project include the failure of von Neumann's inequality in
several variables, function-theoretic aspects of analytic functions realized as
transfer functions generated by operator tuples, and the analysis of functions
of positive real part in terms of "noncommutative spectral measures," that is,
positive functionals on operator systems. A unifying theme will be the theory of
composition operators in several variables, especially compactness questions.

The project belongs to the branch of mathematics known as Operator Theory.
Originally developed as the mathematical language of quantum mechanics, over the
last century it has expanded to influence many other areas of science and
mathematics. It has found many applications in engineering, for example in the
design of robust control systems for aircraft and spacecraft; the analysis of
acoustical scattering data; and more recently in the study of linear matrix
inequalities, which lie behind many optimization problems. Conversely, problems
in engineering and mathematical physics have raised new questions in operator
theory; one related to the project is the description of the electrostatic
properties of composite materials.
