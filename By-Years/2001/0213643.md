This investigation is part of a larger project involving a survey of a random
sample of contributors to each of the nine candidates who raised over five
million dollars before July 31, 2000 and who sought either of the two major
party nominations. This survey is the first of its kind to include both large
($200 and more) and small (under $200) donors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main
theses being investigated involve the representativeness of the contributor pool
as a subsample of the public, the impacts of candidate and contributor attitudes
on the contribution decision, and the motivations for contributor' political
activism. The central theoretical claims of the research promise to enhance
substantially our understanding of this topic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These funds
allow the investigators to ensure that the completed questionnaires that they
have received can be coded promptly, facilitating timely analysis of the
data.&lt;br/&gt;The dataset to be produced will be of significant interest to
numerous scholars interested in this topic.&lt;br/&gt;
