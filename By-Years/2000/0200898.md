The PI requests support for continuing his research activities at the Super-
Kamiokande experiment. His activities will be concentrated in the area of lower
energy solar neutrinos to study the long-standing problem of the solar neutrino
deficit. The Detector has suffered an accident that will disable the Detector
for about two years. The group, however, is obligated as a collaborator to
participate in the repair and recovery effort that is scheduled to be completed
by the end of November of 2003. Bulk of the funding for repair and restoration
will be provided by the Japanese Government with some support from DoE. This
proposal would also allow the Maryland group to continue to analyze the data
collected up to the time of the accident and operate the experiment after
restoration.
