Drs. Coplan, Moore and Tossell from University of Maryland are supported by a
grant from The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to perform (e,2e)
spectroscopy on a number of weakly bonded chemical systems. This unique
experiment permits the direct observation of single molecular orbital momentum
wavefunctions from which much information about the nature of the chemical bond
can be obtained. This laboratory is the only one in the United States which has
the capability of performing this very unique type of spectroscopy. The proposed
research is directed at an enhanced understanding of the the way in which the
outermost electron orbitals of two isolated species are modified upon the
formation of a weak bond. By considering a variety of such interactions of
carefully chosen strengths and geometries, these investigators plan to chart the
interactions and relate them to the dynamics of chemical reactions. Five major
classes of weakly bonded systems will be studied: 1) Lewis acid-base complexes,
2) Hydrogen bonded molecules, 3) Dimers, 4) Transition metal organometallic
complexes, and 5) Molecules containing lone pairs and pi orbitals.
