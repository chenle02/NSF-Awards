The body of literature relating to the population- community interface in marine
soft-bottom systems falls roughly into two classes. The more common view has
been to approach the interface from above, by studying patterns of community
structure and function and relate these patterns to theories concerning the
interactions between populations and how species life histories relate to the
nature of the environment. The other class of studies approaches the population-
community interface from below by examining details of selected populations of
organisms and relating theses patterns to theories concerning the interactions
between populations and the nature of the environment. This research provides a
direct assessment of the contribution that population-level processes, including
life history dependent demographic dynamics, make to key processes controlling
infaunal community structure. More generally, it will add significantly to our
understanding of infaunal demographic dynamics and how they vary with habitat
conditions. In addition it will provide population-level information with
bearing on other areas of benthic research such as secondary production,
foraging tactics and deposit feeding.
