This project focuses on addressing three critical science issues regarding
aerosol climate forcing, response, and feedback: (1) the impacts of carbonaceous
mixtures on the formation and radiation of water and ice clouds in addition to
the direct radiative forcing of aerosols; (2) the climate responses reflected in
the changes of clouds and precipitation caused by anthropogenic aerosols through
both optical-dynamical (direct) and cloud microphysical (indirect) connections;
and (3) the nonlinear effects arising from the coexistence of non-uniformly
distributed anthropogenic aerosols and relatively well-distributed greenhouse
gases, and from the coexistence of absorbing and scattering aerosols. To address
these science issues, the PI and his team will specifically improve three
aspects of our aerosol-climate model: (1) the formation, physiochemical
conversion, and optical properties of carbonaceous aerosols; (2) the treatment
of cloud processing and recycling of carbonaceous contents through cloud and
precipitation evaporation; and (3) the impacts of anthropogenic aerosols
particularly carbonaceous mixtures on ice nucleation.

These improvements with designed long ensemble integrations and special
sensitivity simulations would enable the study of several key but still poorly
described processes in the models, and thus to better understand the climate
responses to anthropogenic aerosols both through the direct and indirect
effects. The model developed by this program will be provided to the community
after the completion of the project, as a unique option to the current CESM
aerosol models, for conducting climate response/feedback study with a size- and
mixing state-dependent aerosol representation and a good computationally
efficiency. Thus the broader impacts of the project are high.
