This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral Dissertation Program.
This study will examine how two low income Mexican-American communities use
social networks to deal with day to day economic issues. Theoretical issues
focus on how social capital that is manifested through social networks
facilitate or constrain economic participation. Fieldwork has been completed in
the first community, made up of Mexican migrants living in San Jose. Funding is
requested for establishing residence from which to conduct participant
observation of a second community, made up of Chicanos in Los Angeles. %%% This
research will contribute to sociological understanding of poverty and urban
life, immigrant communities, and the economy and it will provide policy makers
with information about the ways to promote economic resources in poor
communities. In addition to the scientific gains to be achieved by the research,
this award will materially assist a highly promising student in completing
research for the Ph.D. dissertation. Thus it contributes to the future
scientific manpower of the national and the thorough training of the next
generation of social scientists.
