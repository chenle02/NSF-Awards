To develop new methods beyond the classical method of group- invariant
solutions for finding explicit solutions to systems of partial differential
equations, and apply them to physically important systems and boundary value
problems. The methods to be investigated will include non-classical symmetries,
partially invariant solutions, partial symmetries, the Clarkson-Kruskal direct
method, and weak symmetry groups. These methods can all be subsumed through the
general theory of "side conditions" and overdetermined systems of partial
differential equations. The emphasis of this project will be on the
determination of new exact solutions to physically important boundary value,
Cauchy and mixed problems for partial differential equations.
