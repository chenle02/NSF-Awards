9528888 Vernon-Gerstenfeld This is an award to support a project the objective
of which is to determine the progress toward the application of two concepts for
management of wastewater treatment residues and to identify further research
needed to address issues that have precluded their more widespread adoption in
environmental engineering practice. The concepts to be studied include use of
ionizing radiation for disinfection of residuals and the use of these residuals
in production of ceramic building materials. This project, as was the prior one
in 1988, will be conducted through the Worcester Polytechnic Institute's
Washington Project Center. Since the prior study in 1988, there has been a
strong movement toward recycling of used materials to minimize impact of their
processing and disposal on environmental quality. Three undergraduate students
will assist the Principal Investigator on this project to fulfill the
requirement of their having conducted an Interactive Qualifying Project that
links science, engineering and technology to societal needs and concerns.
Results are expected to assist in providing a basis for determination of
research needs and thus be useful for program planning purposes.
