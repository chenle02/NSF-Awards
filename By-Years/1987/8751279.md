This project will enable the formation of a committee of physicists who will
lead a thorough reexamination of the undergraduate introductory physics course.
Over a period of two years the committee will consider issues relating to the
introductory course and hold meetings, often in conjunction with major meetings
of the American Association of Physics Teachers and the American Physical
Society, in order to encourage discussion of the issues in the physics
community. It will sponsor two conferences of physicists which will develop a
variety of ways to design introductory courses to reflect the needs of students
of physics and to reflect the current way physics is done. Through meetings and
reports the committee will establish a consensus in the community about what
kinds of approaches are valuable, and it will encourage the development and wide
distribution of courses based on these approaches.
