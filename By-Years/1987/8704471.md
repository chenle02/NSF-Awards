Dr. Dworzecka is a major contributor to the field of heavy- ion collisions at
low energy. She and her collaborators at the University of Maryland have
developed a number of models for explaining the experimental data in this field.
She is now proposing to extend her work to the following three areas of
investigation: (1) the understanding of the nuclear exchange process and its
relation to energy dissipation in damped heavy- ion collisions, (2) the
microscopic study of nuclear dissipation and its relation to phenomenological
models and (3) the study of collective motion within mean field dynamics. The
purpose of the proposed research is to study the dynamical properties of nuclear
processes as observed in heavy- ion collisions (i.e., nucleus-nucleus
collisions) at low energy. This work will help us gain an insight into the
mechanisms of reactions between complex nuclei and of the associated modes of
excitation produced in damped nuclear collisions. This will be accomplished by
concentrating on an understanding of the physical processes and on studying the
physical observables in these processes and how they are related to the
assumptions made in the models used for describing these processes. Dr.
Dworzecka has worked on these problems for a number of years and has produced
useful and internationally recognized results. She can be expected to make new
advances in her proposed research, which will also involve undergraduates at
George Mason University.
