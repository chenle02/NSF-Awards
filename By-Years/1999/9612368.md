9612368 Butler Funding is provided to continue the work of the IRIS/JOI Cable
Steering Committee (CSC) and for continuing operation of the TPC-1 Cable which
runs from Guam to Nimomiya, Japan. The CSC also provides coordination with other
national and international groups, technical advice to existing and planned
cable programs, and outreach to the broad scientific community. The coordination
role has three facets: liaison with national and international groups for which
cable applications are pertinent, specific liaison with the extensive Japanese
cable program, and regular contact with industry and industrial organizations.
The purpose is to ensure that cable applications to long-term seafloor
observations are treated in a technically accurate manner and that interested
investigators around the world are aware of ongoing or planned scientific
programs which involve submarine cables.
