The Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division is
supporting a research project at Emory University under the supervision of
Professor Joel M. Bowman in which he is doing accurate calculations of the
vibrational energies of unusual molecules, including open-shell complexes such
as NeOH and NeCN, electronically excited complexes, and heavy-light-heavy
reactive systems such as IHI and BrHI. Both dynamical and spectroscopic
information is being obtained. %%% A new approach to understanding the forces
which bind molecules and control their flexibility is now available through the
computational evaluation of molecular potential energy surfaces and vibrational
force fields. In this project, Prof. Bowman is applying this technique to study
a number of simple molecules with unusual structural and dynamic
characteristics.
