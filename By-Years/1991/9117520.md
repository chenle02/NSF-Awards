A state-of-the-art electron microprobe will replace the University of Hawaii's
12-year old instrument. The new microprobe will provide an enhanced beam
stability for long duration, trace element analysis; improved backscatter
detector and analog-to- digital image capabilities; stage automation for
detailedmineral profiles; and computer automation for data/image collection and
processing. The University of Hawaii will provide $250,000 and NASA an
additional $150,000.
