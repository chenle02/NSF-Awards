This research will deal with the properties of information as used in model
selection. New information criteria have been developed which deal with
situations of multiple data sets and/or with models which may have the same
dimension. This research will expand on recent results for these criteria, and
in particular will establish asymptotic properties. This research will deal with
statistical model selection. The area, generally speaking, is concerned with the
choice of the best model to fit a dat set among a set of candidate models.
Issues of interest include problems of overfitting and the selection of
variables in regression.
