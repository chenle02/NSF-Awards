Ammonia is an important gas in the lower atmosphere. It plays a crucial role in
the formation of particles and it is a neuturalizing agent of acids. Ammonia is
also an important species in the cycling of fixed nitrogen, which is a vital
nutrient for life, through the atmosphere and biosphere. However, reliable
measurements of ammonia have proven difficult to obtain because of its affinity
for acids, water, and surfaces. The goal of this project is the field deployment
of the Georgia Tech Vacuum UV/Photofragmentation Laser-Induced Fluorescence
(VUV/PF-LIF) ammonia sensor for the Winter 1989 NOAA (National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration) Intercomparison Program. This intercomparison effort
is currently scheduled for Winter 1989 near Boulder, Colorado. The primary
purpose of this intercomparison is to test and evaluate the performance
characteristics of instruments capable of measuring ambient ammonia
concentrations near background continental levels.
