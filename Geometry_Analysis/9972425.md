Abstract: We consider the asymptotic behavior of the geodesic flow and Laplace
eigenvalues on manifolds of nonpositive curvature with an emphasis on aspects
related to metric variation. For example, the billiard ball flow of a rational
polygon belongs to a natural moduli space of flows, and the system's periodic
asymptotic behavior can be deduced from knowledge of the moduli space. Although,
the geodesic flow and the Laplace spectrum are known to be related via trace
formulae, physicists have long believed in a more direct relationship provided
by the `correspondence principle'. This relationship will be considered in the
context of the moduli space theory.

The objects under study are models for physical systems. In particular, we
consider here the asymptotic behavior of particles, both classical and quantum,
under varying conditions. The systems we consider exhibit a high degree of
chaotic behavior as is often the case in the real world. Although these systems
are simple abstractions, they represent a testing ground for further
understanding of real world systems. Eventual 'downstream' applications could
include high energy physics and cryptography.
