Professor Amy Howell in the Department of Chemistry at the University of
Connecticut is supported by the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program for
her research into the synthesis and reactivity of 2,3-dimethylenoxetanes and
1,5-dioxaspiro[3.2]hexanes. The conversion of 2,3-dimethylenoxetanes into highly
functionalized ketones and enynols will be studied and these key intermediates
will be used in syntheses of rubifolide, a furan cembrane, and a new approach to
enediynes. The 1,5-dioxaspiro[3.2]hexanes will be utilized as intermediates in
the preparation of nucleoside analogs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the support of
the Organic and Macromolecular Program, Professor Howell is developing novel
methods by which certain highly strained organic compounds can be further
converted to nucleoside analogs and other natural products. The nucleoside
analogs may have potential applications as new chemotherapeutic agents.
