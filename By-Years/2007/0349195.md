The investigator develops analytical and numerical&lt;br/&gt;reconstruction
techniques to recover quantities important in&lt;br/&gt;theoretical biophysics.
The systems considered all include&lt;br/&gt;stochastic effects, and the
measurements to be considered are&lt;br/&gt;distributions of first passage
times. Developing physical,&lt;br/&gt;statistical mechanical models, he uses the
first passage time&lt;br/&gt;distribution function to construct parameters or
functions in the&lt;br/&gt;physical model. Of particular interest is the
reconstruction of&lt;br/&gt;macromolecular potentials from bond-breaking times.
An analysis&lt;br/&gt;of bounds and how measurement errors affect the stability
of&lt;br/&gt;reconstructed quantities is undertaken.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The
investigator develops mathematical tools, theoretical&lt;br/&gt;and
computational, that allow quantitative reconstruction of&lt;br/&gt;unknown
quantities from measured data in fluctuating, random&lt;br/&gt;systems. This
class of problems is called stochastic inverse&lt;br/&gt;problems. Two examples
are how molecular bonds break, and how&lt;br/&gt;chemical reactions progress.
Typically, for the bond-breaking&lt;br/&gt;problem, the detailed molecular
interactions are assumed known,&lt;br/&gt;from which the behavior of the bond
(e.g. how likely it is to&lt;br/&gt;break) is theoretically predicted.
Similarly, in chemical&lt;br/&gt;reactions, specific reaction rates and chemical
networks are&lt;br/&gt;assumed. One then solves the rate equations with these
"given"&lt;br/&gt;parameters to find, say, the concentration of a chemical
species&lt;br/&gt;as a function of time after the start of a reaction. In
the&lt;br/&gt;formulation of the inverse problem, we do not know
the&lt;br/&gt;intermolecular forces, or the rates of chemical
reactions.&lt;br/&gt;Rather, we measure the lifetime of a bond before it breaks,
and&lt;br/&gt;from these data, infer the microscopic molecular interactions.
&lt;br/&gt;In chemical reactions, we attempt to use the
measured&lt;br/&gt;concentrations to deduce the chemical reaction rates. These
and&lt;br/&gt;related inverse problems have wide applicability in
numerous&lt;br/&gt;disciplines, and can potentially optimize and simplify
industrial&lt;br/&gt;processes such as drug design and drug delivery. Moreover,
the&lt;br/&gt;techniques can provide valuable theoretical tools with which
to&lt;br/&gt;probe fundamental genetic regulation processes inside
cells.&lt;br/&gt;
