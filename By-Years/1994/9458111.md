9458111 Povinelli This award provides support to Dr. Daniel Povinelli under the
National Science Foundation's Young Investigator Awards program. The objective
of this program is to recognize outstanding young faculty in science and
engineering, to enhance the academic career of recent PhD recipients by
providing flexible support for research and educational activities, and to
foster contact and cooperation between academia, industry, and institutions that
support research and education. Dr. Povinelli has already made significant
research contributions to the field of physical anthropology, and he has the
potential to become a leader in academic research and education. This award will
allow the investigator to build on his existing research on self-awareness and
to undertake series of studies of chimpanzees and young children's understanding
of agency, intention, and knowledge and belief, in both themselves and others.
The research holds promise of making considerable progress toward constraining
our interpretations of the psychology underpinning complex social behavior in
chimpanzees. Furthermore, it will allow a determination of the extent of overlap
in human and chimpanzee cognitive development related to mental state
attribution. This will allow evolutionary biologists to produce more precise
reconstructions of the primitive cognitive features of the great ape-human
clade, as well as a determination of the more derived features of human
cognition.
