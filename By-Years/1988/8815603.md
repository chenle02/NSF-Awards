The recent successes of theoretical chemistry with improved programs and faster
computers have generated the need for still faster machines. Experienced users
wish to solve larger and larger problems of more and more relevance to the
experimental chemist. Similarly, experimental chemists, seeing these results,
are compelled to become new users. The acquisition of state-of-the-art computing
equipment is essential to the modern chemistry department carrying out frontier
research. The Department of Chemistry at Columbia University will use this award
from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program to help upgrade an extant
Convex minisupercomputer. Among the areas of chemical research that will be
enhanced by the upgrade are as follows: 1) Quantum solvation and dynamics 2)
Theory of reactions in solution 3) Molecular dynamics in constrained geometries
4) Real-time many-body quantum dynamics via phase-space representations of
density operators 5) Frequency locking and dragging 6) Spectroscopy and dynamics
of isolated molecules or ions in crystals, glasses, liquids, or on surfaces 7)
Molecular recognition 8) Polyether antibiotic synthesis 9) Graphically based
molecular modeling.
