This project will provide information on scientist, engineer, and technician
(SET) employment in industry. It will develop national estimates from the
ongoing Occupational Employment Statistics Survey of the Bureau of Labor
Statistics (BLS) which provides annual information on employment in detailed
occupations by industry. The OES survey is a Federal-State cooperative program
in which State Employment Security Agencies collect data following BLS
specifications. Data collection occurs on a three-year cycle, sequentially
covering manufacturing, nonmanufacturing, and trade and regulated (commun-
ications, public utilities, and transportation) industries and colleges and
universities. The OES data help NSF meet its mandate under the National Science
Foundation Act to develop and maintain a data base of demographic, educational,
and employment information on SET. The OES surveys are a key part of the system
for developing such information. Thus, the survey data: a) help in developing an
accurate profile of U. S. SET personnel; b) are used in projecting supply and
demand for scientists and engineers; c) are used to develop current estimates of
SET employment in total and by detailed SET field and industry; and d) allow
identification of SET growth fields, and those in decline or otherwise changing.
