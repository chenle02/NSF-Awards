9316008 Klemperer In September, 1993 the Southern Sierra Nevada Continental
Dynamics (SSCD) project acquired "axial" (north-south) and "transverse" (east-
west) wide-angle reflection/refraction seismic profiles across the southern
Sierras and western Basin and Range Province. Based on modelling studies at
Stanford, the SSCD detonated and recorded four additional fan shots into the
planned receiver arrays. One of the fundamental uncertainties about the Sierra
Nevada batholith is the extent of the root to this mountain range; how thick (if
it is present) and where (localized beneath the present mountains or also
continuing east beneath the extended fragments of the batholith in the western
Basin and Range). This project involves support for one year of graduate student
effort to carry out three-dimensional modelling of the data that has been
collected. If successful, the results of this project will shed light on two
fundamental issues of continental tectonics; the crustal structure of
batholiths, and the kinematics of extensional tectonics. ***
