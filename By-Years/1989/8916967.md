Female northern elephant seals have a distinctive diving pattern. They dive
deeper than other marine mammals (maximum depth of 1250 m), spend brief periods
on the surface between dives (less than 3 minutes), and dive continuously for
three months at sea. The present studies will determine whether a cross section
of adults, juveniles and pups exhibit the same pattern, test for the effects of
pregnancy on diving performance, delineate the bioenergetic consequences of
extreme sexual dimorphism on foraging, and provide vital information on the
development of diving. Hypotheses concerning metabolism, energy expenditure, and
foraging strategies will be tested by measuring swim velocities, matching these
to other dive characteristics, and relating surface interval duration to diving
effort. Six different diving instruments will be used to record dive depth, dive
duration, surface interval duration and swim speed. Changes in physiological
variables associated with the development of diving performance (e.g., blood
volume, myoglobin concentration, hematocrit and oxygen utilization) will be
monitored in pups and yearlings in the field and in diving tanks in the
laboratory. Prolonged, continuous deep diving is unusual and challenges several
long held interpretations of diving performance. The present studies will
clarify diving adaptations in pelagic seals. These studies have important
implications for how seals partition oxygen stores during foraging, manage
anaerobic metabolites, and cope with compression effects.
