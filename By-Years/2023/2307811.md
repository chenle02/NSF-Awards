Over the past decades, the study of the motion of a viscous liquid interacting
with solid bodies has become one of the main focuses of applied research. The
objective of this project is to address two fundamental aspects in this area.
The first regards the vibration-induced motion of a rigid body in a viscous
liquid, when the vibration is produced by a time-periodically displaced mass
inside the body. The wide area of applications of this phenomenon includes
biomedical engineering and design of micro- and nano-technological equipment.
The second aspect concerns the effect of flow-induced oscillations on a spring-
mounted structure. These type of questions are of the utmost relevance in the
study of the equilibrium and stability of suspension bridges and, in some cases,
of their collapse, like in the notorious Tacoma Narrows Bridge disaster. This
award will also provide opportunities for the involvement of graduate students
in the project's research.

Both projects fall into the realm of non-linear analysis and their study
requires the use of fresh mathematical ideas that, possibly, will be employed
also in other areas of applied nonlinear PDE's. First and foremost is the
investigation of (local and global) Hopf bifurcation in a liquid-solid
interaction problem in presence of a continuum spectrum of the relevant
linearized operator. To date, this question represents an entirely uncharted
territory. Another and not less important mathematical feature of the proposed
research consists in the detailed study of the range of nonlinear elliptic
operators (related to Navier-Stokes-like boundary-value problems) that are
Fredholm of negative index. Interestingly enough, this kind of analysis may lead
to the rigorous quantitative understanding of how and why a vibrating sphere can
move in a viscous liquid.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
