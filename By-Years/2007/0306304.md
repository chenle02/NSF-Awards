DMS-0306304&lt;br/&gt;Diagnostics for Structured Data and Quality
Improvement&lt;br/&gt;Douglas M. Hawkins, University of
Minnesota&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator
and his collaborators and thesis advisees develop diagnostic methods for a
variety of problems linked by their use of data having structure beyond that of
a univariate random sample. Examples include the identification of outliers and
unexpected parameter changes in multiple regression, multivariate time series
data, and large rectangular data arrays. Application of these methodologies to
statistical quality improvement resolves many deficiencies of current approaches
and provides high performance charting methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data sets
keep growing in size and complexity. Proteomics and microarray experiments
routine provide data sets of a size scarcely imaginable a decade ago. This
creates a need for sturdy statistical methods to extract information without
manual checking and in the face of a fraction of erroneous or missing readings.
The research addresses these needs, by developing appropriate statistical
methods and effective ways of implementing them. At the other end of the size
spectrum, just-in-time and the ability to customize in manufacturing create a
need for statistical quality control tools able to react quickly, and to
relatively small departures from specification. Change-point methodologies
provide sharp tools for this detection and diagnosis.&lt;br/&gt;
