A new, finite-element-like computational methodology called Variable-Element-
Topology Finite Element Method (VETFEM) is being developed that accounts for
applications in solid mechanics that involve a change in the topology of the
material domain. Such problems include: fracture, penetration, material removal
such as machining, shape optimization, metal forming, etc. The VETFEM does not
require topologically similar elements and thus allows suitable meshes to be
formed from a predefined distribution of node points. The VETFEM is being
developed for large dynamic deformations and inelastic response. The validation
is done using problems drawn from areas of material failure and manufacturing
processes.
