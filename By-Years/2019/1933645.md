The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project relates to the
emerging "electronics skin" application. Adapting the technology towards early
detection of pressure ulcers for at risk individuals with diabetes will result
in prevention of amputations for persons with healed diabetic foot ulcers to
less than 1%. In particular, a pressure ulcer is a skin injury resulting from
prolonged pressure on the skin, often complicated by diabetic's common inability
to feel pain due to nerve damage and blood circulation problems reducing the
body's ability to heal and increasing risk of infection. Thus, early detection
of pressure ulcers is important to prevent worsening conditions that necessitate
amputation of limb(s). The technology from this project will result in a low-
cost continuous monitoring system that is seamless to one's body and daily
activities, enabling improved care for at risk individuals with
diabetes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the technology
that combines electrically conductive nanomaterials with a flexible, rubber-like
polymer platform in a novel design. The stretchable and flexible electrodes are
composed of vertically aligned carbon nanotubes partially embedded in a
polydimethylsiloxane substrate, which facilitates reliable and stable devices
under both stretching and bending. As a proof-of-concept, the sensor was
successfully tested for measuring biological signals of a person. This
technology will directly impact the development of sensing and electronic
storage devices toward medical and e-skin applications. In particular, the
resulting endeavor will directly benefit the medical field, providing greater
insight into prognosis and pattern recognition at critical wound development
stages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
