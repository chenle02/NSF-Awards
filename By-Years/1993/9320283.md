9320283 Steward Localization of determinants in the oocyte and the early embryo
represents a fundamental step in embryonic patterning in both Xenopus and
Drosophila. In both organisms the localization of determinants is achieved
through mRNA targeting. While several localized RNAs have been identified and
studied in Drosophila and in Xenopus, the mechanisms responsible for this
localization are largely unknown. The Bicaudal-D protein plays a role in the
localization of mRNAs during oogenesis. It appears to be transported from the
cystocytes to the pro-oocyte in early oogenesis. It may function either in the
transport or tethering of RNAs in the oocyte. Dr. Steward proposes experiments
addressing these basic questions: How does Bic- D function to localize RNAs?
What is the function of the localized Bic-D RNA, and what factors interact with
the RNA localization sequences in the Bic-D RNA to achieve its localization? ***
