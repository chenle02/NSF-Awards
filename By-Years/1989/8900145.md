The main objective of this project is to improve our understanding of the
causes for various optical emissions in the visible and EUV spectrum of the
aurora. The approach to be used is a combined theoretical simulation with
previously obtained rocket observations. Among some of the items which will be
determined are the detailed altitude profiles of the various optical emission
features in the visible to EUV wavelength region as a function of particle
energy input and atmosphere structure, a multi-dimensional radiative transfer
analysis of the auroral 1304A OI emission, the importance of the N2(A-state) in
the production of the 5577A OI auroral emission, the energy dependence for the
N2(2P) bands and the analysis of the 834A O+ emission in the aurora.
