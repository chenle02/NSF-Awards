SGER: Behavioral Authentication of Server Flows for Detection of Anomalous
Communication Patterns

The goal of this project is to develop methods for analyzing traffic behavior of
server flows to detect anomalous communication patterns. Prior work in data
mining applied to computer security was geared at finding attack packets,
whereas this research aims to find patterns of traffic that indicate anomalous
behavior of an application-layer protocol. Traditional methods for determining
traffic type rely on the port label carried in the TCP/UDP packet header. This
method can fail, however, in the presence of proxy servers that re-map port
numbers, or host services that have been compromised to act as back doors or
covert channels. The basis for this exploratory project is the classification of
TCP server stream traffic using features that capture stream behavior. The
features are independent of port label, and therefore, provide a more accurate
classification of traffic type in the presence of malicious activity. An
exciting new direction in this research is the authentication of server flows to
detect anomalous and potentially malicious behavior. This research addresses the
need for authentication of the application-layer protocol. Because most
intrusion detection systems and firewalls rely on knowing the application
protocol for determining whether to permit the traffic and for discovering
malicious behavior, this research fills a critical gap in current information
security technology. The expected results will have broad impact in a wide range
of applications that critically depend on reliable, effective and efficient
information security. Results of this project will accessible on the project web
site http://mow.ecn.purdue.edu/~lrn/, and disseminated at Security Conferences.
