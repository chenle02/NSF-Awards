Funds are provided for participant support for the SnowPAC 2017 Workshop
organized by the University of Utah. The award will support participation (via
lodging and registration subsidy) by 30 individuals who would otherwise be
unable to attend the meeting, with a particular emphasis on broadening
participation by junior researchers and groups traditionally underrepresented in
astronomy and astrophysics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SnowPAC workshop is an
international meeting that reviews recent developments in particle astrophysics,
dark matter, dark energy, astronomy, and cosmology. It seeks to establish new
connections between these disciplines and establish new collaborative ties
between individuals working in these research areas. This workshop focuses on
Lyman-alpha emitting galaxies (LAEs). These galaxies are studied individually
and in large ensembles to yield insight into such problems as cosmic re-
ionization and the nature and composition of the matter between galaxies.
