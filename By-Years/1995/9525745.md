9525745 Abdel-Malek In adopting flexible manufacturing technologies, companies
must design new machines, processes, and systems that can produce different
products in different volumes and mixes with shorter production leadtimes. This
project aims to develop a process to manage the design, justification, and
implementation of affordable technological solutions that will enable flexible
manufacturing. Two industrial partners will collaborate in collecting
organizational, technical, operational, and economic data; forming case studies
of activity based costing in past technology projects; and validating the
analytical approaches in the flexibility models that result from this research.
While the results should be generally applicable in many industry sectors, the
emphasis will be on traditional manufacturers of electro-mechanical assemblies
and products such as pumps, motors, aeronautical sub-systems, and farm
equipment. This project will result in a new process for designing effective and
affordable flexible manufacturing solutions that individual firms can use to
foster innovative design in their own factories. The framework will be tested
and fine-tuned in collaboration with industry, and simple software for managers
will be developed.
