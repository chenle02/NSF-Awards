This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). The proposal requests operating funds to continue supporting
the Antarctic Marine Geology Research Facility (AMGRF) at Florida State
University, the largest repository of Southern Ocean piston cores in the world.
The Facility has been receiving, describing, and archiving cores for the past 48
years, at the same time supporting extensive marine geological research. The
services and programs provided by the Facility include: (a) numerous technical
services to the Antarctic and Earth Science investigators to work with the
stored cores and samples; (b) archiving and curating more than 21,000 m of cored
sediments and more than 5,000 kg of sea bottom samples collected by the U.S.
Antarctic Program vessels; (c) maintaining the core and sample database covering
the period from 1944 to present that is accessible via the Facility's Web site,
and (d) services and equipment for the benefit of the Antarctic marine geology
research community. Continued reliance on students' involvement in the Facility
operation and research provides a broader impact and firmly grounds this effort
in its educational mission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
