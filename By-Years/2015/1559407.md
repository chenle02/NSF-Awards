This project will develop a new method for the analysis of mathematical models
of the economy. The key feature of the new method is that it will give
economists new tools to build and analyze models that include not just changes
over time (dynamic models) and the possibility that chance plays a role in this
changes (stochastic dynamic models) but models in which the probability of a
change can itself vary over time (nonstationary stochastic dynamic models). The
project has clear potential to improve the methods economists currently use to
answer research questions calling for these nonstationary stochastic dynamic
models. In addition, the project has transformative potential; the new methods
may mean that economists will be able to tackle new research problems that were
impossible to answer with previous methods. If this project is fully successful,
economic policymakers in the US will benefit from better scientific advice about
the effects of their decisions on the US economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
overall goal is to develop the extended function path (EFP) method for
calibrating, solving, simulating and estimating non-stationary and unbalanced
growth dynamic stochastic economic models. The key feature of EFT is the notion
of semi-Markov processes in which transition density functions are time
dependent while also memoryless with respect to the specific history that leads
to a current state. The PI team plans to apply EFP to a collection of examples
that do not admit conventional stationary Markov solutions. Among these examples
are two research projects. The first uses the method to analyze unbalanced
growth patterns in the U.S. economy between 1963 and 2012. The second project
will attempt to explain the recent economic crisis in the context of a new
Keynesian model with a Taylor rule for nominal interest rates and possible non-
Markov changes in government policies.
