Fruits are major components of the human diet contributing a large portion of
vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and fiber. While flavor and nutrition
composition have clear potential for positive human benefit, they have proven to
be difficult traits to modify via traditional breeding due to their generally
complex biosynthetic and regulatory pathways. "Flavor" in many fruits is the
product of a complex interaction among sugars, acids and multiple volatile
compounds. Synthesis and accumulation of these compounds is the result of
coordinated activity of many genes. In many cases, the pathways for synthesis of
these compounds have yet to be established. This program will focus on the
expression of the genes critical for metabolism of these compounds so that key
regulators of fruit flavor and nutrient composition can be identified and
eventually manipulated via the many possible routes available.

Specifically, the program will apply gene expression profiling to an extensive
set of germplasm to 1) map regulatory circuits controlling the levels of
important components of flavor and nutrition, and 2) identify genes encoding
enzymes involved in metabolism of these components. Levels of expression of most
of the genes expressed during tomato fruit ripening will be correlated with the
abundances of specific metabolites in a diverse set of germplasm consisting of
mutants, transgenic and recombinant inbred lines. Bioinformatics will be used to
identify genes whose expression is linked to appearance of target compounds. The
value of these markers as predictors of chemical composition will be tested by
genetic mapping and transgenic manipulation. These experiments will have broad
impact by 1) mapping critical steps controlling flavor and nutrition metabolic
pathways, 2) identifying specific genes involved in either regulation or
metabolism of critical components of flavor and nutrition, 3) providing useful
tools for breeding and engineering improved fruit quality, and 4) establishing a
correlative public database of metabolites and global gene expression that will
be accessible for a broad array of ripening-related studies.
