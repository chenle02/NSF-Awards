This project focuses on the interpenetration of science, education, and
entertainment in the study and promotion of animal behavior research by Gladwyn
Kingsley Noble and William Douglas Burden at the American Museum of Natural
History from roughly 1928 to 1950. Adept entrepreneurs, both Noble and Burden
recognized the importance of film in behavior research and its significance as a
medium for educational and promotional purposes. The development of film
represented an important technological breakthrough in the study of behavior,
for the biologist could now isolate animal motion and behavior on a medium that
could be studied and manipulated at will. Natural history films, however, served
a dual function, for these films could be shown to the public as education and
entertainment, a marketing strategy that Noble and Burden employed in promoting
their Department of Experimental Biology, founded at the American Museum n 1928.
The interplay of science and entertainment in the careers of Noble and Burden
reached its culmination in the late thirties with the establishment of
Marineland, the first multi-species oceanarium of its kind, 18 miles south of
St. Augustine, Florida. Serving as a research center, entertainment park and
film studio, Marineland represented a new approach to selling science in 20th
century American culture fed on mass media. The object of study was also an
important tool in generating mass appeal. Capitalizing on the popular image of
the dolphin as a "friend to gods, children, and men," Marineland cultivated the
dolphin itself as a marketing ploy. As a case study, this project bears directly
on the history of animal behavior studies in America and on issues regarding the
use of mass media in the popularization of science within 20th century American
culture.
