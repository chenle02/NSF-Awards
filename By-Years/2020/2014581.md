The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project is to regenerate coral reefs on the brink of extinction. Approximately
one-quarter of the worldâ€™s coral reefs have disappeared and almost two-thirds
are at risk today. The innovation introduces a scalable method to plant heat-
resistant corals to rejuvenate dying reefs. The technology is a multi-arm
dexterous robot crawler. Planting one nursery coral every 10 seconds, with a
cluster of three robots, the technology is capable of planting 100x faster than
any method currently in use. This intervention will have a direct and beneficial
impact on environmental restoration, marine ecosystems, and the tourism
industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase I project will design a coral
planting robot that traverses the ocean floor and performs complex tasks.
Challenges include creating an autonomous wet chain and producing a wet chain
sled, as well as addressing recharging difficulties. Planting must take place
where the coral is bound sufficiently so that it is not dislodged by waves or
currents. Other technical challenges include identifying exposed hard surfaces
as well as healthy coral to leave it undisturbed. This project will enable
reintroduction of key species with different environmental
tolerance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
