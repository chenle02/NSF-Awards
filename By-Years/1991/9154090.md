This project is initiating an attempt at a major reform in the content and
methodology of teaching geometry in American high schools. The intent is to give
average students a richer understanding of geometric facts and methodologies,
mathematical concepts at the heart of geometry, visual thinking, and the way
that applications of geometry affect their lives. Author teams consisting of a
content geometer and a high school teacher will develop 20 modules from which
alternative curricula can be constructed. This design is to permit teachers
flexibility in testing and implementing the modules. These varied experiences
will inform the development of a high school geometry textbook. Four or five
12-15 minute video segments featuring applications of selected module topics
will also be produced. A GEOMAP Inservice Leaders' Handbook will be prepared to
facilitate use of the modules in teacher enhancement programs. Initial project
materials will be peer-reviewed by reviewers recruited through calls in
consortium. Revised materials will then be extensively field-tested across the
country. Final products will be disseminated nationally through COMAP and a
commercial publisher. //
