With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at Middle Tennessee State University will acquire a 400
MHz NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will enable researchers to carry out
research on a) synthesis of biologically-active organic molecules; b) synthesis
of organic and inorganic materials and their precursors; c) kinetic analyses;
and d) binding studies involving biomolecules. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear
Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools
available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is
used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential
to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR
studies will have an impact in synthetic organic chemistry and biochemistry.
