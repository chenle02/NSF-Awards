Time effects in soils such as creep and relaxation cause long-term deformation
and pressures on buildings, bridge abutments, earth retaining structures, and in
slopes. Excessive deformation with time may cause structures to fail. While
creep and stress relaxation are caused by the same phenomenon, namely grain
crushing followed by grain rearrangement, the prediction of one phenomenon can
apparently not be accomplished on the basis of the other. Several series of high
pressure triaxial compression tests will be performed to study strain rate
effects, creep, and stress relaxation on Virginia Beach sand. Thus, the time to
fracture of these particles depends on the proximity of the stress state to the
short-term fracture strength. Once fracture takes place, rearrangement of the
grain structure will occur due to sliding and rolling of grains. Each of these
types of mechanical behavior are time dependent, and together they constitute
the phenomena of time effects in sand. This is quite different from the viscous
effects seen in clays.

The proposed research will contribute to establishment of more realistic
modeling of sand behavior as it occurs in-situ. Real sands show time effects as
they are deposited or loaded to higher stresses or if they are disturbed, thus
creating fresh contacts between the particles. This real time behavior is most
often assumed to be nonexistent, and a number of observed behavior patterns of
geotechnical structures are therefore not predicted correctly. The benefits of
the proposed research to society will be improved predictions of the behavior of
geotechnical engineering structures and soil-structure interaction as well as
consequent greater safety and economy of construction.
