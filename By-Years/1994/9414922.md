Trinity University and the National Science Foundation will jointly support the
renovation of facilities devoted to Laser Spectroscopy, Atmospheric Chemistry,
and Capillary Electrophoresis and Chromatography in the Marrs McLean Science
Center. The renovation will substantially upgrade the current facilities, built
in 1953 and 1959, to meet the challenges of contemporary science. The NSF-funded
effort will be part of an estimated $5 Million renovation of the entire science
center undertaken by the institution. All three laboratory spaces will be
completely renovated including demolition of existing non-bearing walls,
provision of new electrical ground and filtered electrical power lines,
installation of new HVAC and back-up air conditioners for essential climate
control, installation of computer network and telephone ports, shielding from
elecro-magnetic interference (Laser Spectroscopy Lab), a new fume hood,
deionized water system and vacuum system (Atmospheric Chemistry Lab), and a new
fume hood and vacuum, compressed air and natural gas lines (Capillary
Electrophoresis and Chromatography Lab). The renovation will also permit the re-
design of laboratory bench space for increased efficiency in research
operations. The completed effort will encourage student discovery of
contemporary science and assure a much safer and efficient environment in which
to work. It will facilitate new experiments which have not been conducted
previously at Trinity. Trinity is highly ranked nationally on its programs in
undergraduate science, mathematics and engineering education. It seeks to
include geographic distribution of students and to include under-represented
minorities and women who constitute in excess of 10% and 44% respectively in
these programs.
