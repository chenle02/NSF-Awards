William Miller of the University of California, Berkeley is supported by an
award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program to
develop new, simple and computationally efficient approaches to studying
electronically nonadiabatic chemical processes. Such processes occur when there
is a coupling between the motion of the atomic nuclei, for example molecular
vibrations, and motion of the electrons. They involve transitions between
different electronic states, for example, the ground (lowest energy) state and a
state in which the electrons are excited. These processes have relevance for
many important technological applications relevant to solar-to-electric energy
conversion, in both inorganic nano-materials and in photosynthetic systems, and
the field of "molecular electronics", e.g., the transmission of electrons
through various molecular structures that are junctions between electrodes.
Although nonadiabatic processes are inherently quantum mechanical, Miller and
his group have found that they may be modeled by a simple and purely classical
treatment of the coupled dynamics. The goal is to have an approach that can be
integrated into large scale simulations of realistic systems with many degrees
of freedom. The PI has contributed broadly to the training of many in the field
and the long term scientific impact of this work is expected to be significant.

Miller and his research group continue the development of a purely classical
approach to treating electronically nonadiabatic processes, building on the
symmetrical quasiclassical procedure (SQC) which "quantizes" both the initial
and final electronic action variables in an equivalent fashion, thus insuring
microscopic reversibility. The method has its roots in the much earlier Meyer-
Miller (MM) and Miller-McCurdy (MM) representations of electronic degrees of
freedom in terms of classical action-angle variables. Recent applications have
given encouraging results for benchmark models. The goal of the current research
is to explore a range of possibilities for further developments of the SQC/MM
methods.
