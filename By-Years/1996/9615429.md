ABSTRACT PROPOSAL # : DEB-9615429 INVESTIGATOR(S) : GLASER et al. INSTITUTION:
UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA TITLE: Hydrologic Drivers for the Carbon Dynamics in
Large Peatlands The large peat basins of North America represent an important
reservoir in the global carbon cycle and a significant source for greenhouse
gases. The development of regional groundwater models as part of this research
should provide a powerful method to quantify the impact of climatic change on
the water and carbon flux of these peatlands, because these groundwater models
can be realistically calibrated by field observations, digital elevation models,
and remote sensing. These models will be developed and tested in the Glacial
Lake Agassiz region of Minnesota. The design of this research is
interdisciplinary and combines field measurements, modeling, and remote sensing
to determine 1) the regional topography of the water table and is response to
short- and longer term climatic changes, 2) the effect of water table
fluctuations on flow systems, solute transport, and carbon flux through these
ecosystems, 3) the frequency and magnitude of carbon losses from peat fires, and
4) regional estimates for the water and carbon balance. The design includes
investigation of the apparent inconsistency between the relatively high rates of
peat accumulation in the region combined with high emission rates for methane in
a fairly dry regional climate.
