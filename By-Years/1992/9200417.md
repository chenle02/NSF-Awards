This award provides funds to continue a successful Research Experiences for
Undergraduates program at The Whitney Laboratory, a research institute of the
University of Florida, located on the Atlantic Coast. The program provides
research training for undergraduates in cell and neurobiology using marine
animals. Ten faculty members will train students throughout the year in modern,
experimental techniques of anatomy, biochemistry, molecular biology,
pharmacology, toxicology and electrophysiology, for which the facility is
exceptionally well equipped. Students are recruited nationwide and special
efforts are made to attract women and minority students. The students live on
the campus of the Laboratory, have access to all facilities, and become full
partners in the ongoing research efforts of their faculty advisors. Student
independence will be encouraged, and they will receive full credit for their
work in publications. In addition to their practical research training, the
students' intellectual growth will be stimulated through participation in the
Laboratory's regular seminar series, a special student seminar series and
research tutorials and discussions provided by each member of the faculty.
