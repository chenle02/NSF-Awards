This award provides support for acquisition of a modern capillary DNA sequencing
instrument capable of determining nearly 200,000 bases a day at 98.5% accuracy,
and also capable of high throughput fragment analysis including that of
microsatellites and single nucleotide polymorphisms. The instrument will be used
in a number of ongoing projects, including an NSF-funded Tree of Life sequencing
project aimed at producing a molecular phylogeny of all birds. The instrument
will be used. In addition to its role in research, the instrument will be used
for training at the high school, undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral
levels. The instrument will replace an existing slab-gel instrument that has
been heavily used for studies of population genetics and evolutionary genomics
of avian systems, co-evolutionary genetics of mammals and their parasitic lice,
and evolutionary genetics of reptiles and amphibians. The new instrument will
provide a several-fold increase in the sequencing capacity that can be brought
to bear on these and other projects at the Museum of Natural History.
