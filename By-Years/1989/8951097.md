The main purpose of this project is to introduce research expertise to
undergraduates through a design/research laboratory course. The design/research
laboratory in which a broad-based, hands-on approach is taken enables the
students to teach themselves either traditional or fiber optics systems,
optoelectronics and Gaussian beams, or lasers and quantum electronics. The
intention is to motivate students to continue in this new technology focussing
on topics that intrigue them. A prototype with a minimum of equipment is
currently in operation. Equipment to develop a full-scale laboratory from this
prototype is provided. This development would double the size of existing
facilities and student-handling capabilities. The key feature of the laboratory
is the addition of an argon/dye laser and an optical multichannel analyzer which
dramatically increases the substance of the experiments performed by the
students. By operating year round (2 semesters and summer) at full
implementation, the new laboratory can accommodate 100 students.
