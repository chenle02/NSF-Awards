Approximately twenty five scholarships in amounts ranging from $5,000 to
$10,000, based on the cost of attendance, are being awarded annually to
academically talented, financially needy students majoring in biology,
mathematics or computer science. An emphasis is being placed on computational
biology thus, complementing the thriving industry in North Texas that is built
upon these skills. The student body at the institution is over ninety percent
female and approaching fifty percent underrepresented minorities. Consequently,
the project is a significant force in the national effort to increase the
participation of members of these groups in STEM fields.
