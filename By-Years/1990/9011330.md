This project is part of the NSF/USGS initiative within the National Earthquake
Hazard Reduction Program (NEHRP) to investigate the effects of the Loma Prieta
earthquake of 17 October 1989. The strong ground motions recorded in the San
Francisco Bay Area during the Loma Prieta earthquake exceeded the levels
predicted by standard empirical attenuation relations. A preliminary analysis of
these records suggests that this may have been a result of critical reflections
of the seismic waves from the base of the crust. The objective of this proposal
is to perform further analyses and simulations using an expanded data base that
includes recordings of other events of the earthquake sequence in order to
rigorously test this and other explanations for the large ground motions
observed. Evaluating the cause of this observed departure from predicted levels
of ground motion has important implications for estimating ground motions from
future large earthquakes on the San Andreas and Hayward faults. It also has
implications for other regions in the United States such as the Seattle-Portland
region where crustal earthquakes having deep focal depths may similarly elevate
ground motions to damaging levels at distant locations; and in the Seattle, Los
Angeles, Salt Lake City and other regions where basin response effects are
expected to be significant.
