This study will undertake a small experimental effort to test some of the
physical basis for the principles of an inverse free-electron laser accelerator
(IFELA). The principle of the IFELA is to use an intense laser beam to
accelerate a group of electrons. The Columbia free-electron laser will be
configured as an IFELA, in which its intense laser wave is used to trap and
bunch electrons that in the presence of a suitable undulator may be accelerated
to higher energy. This study will be a proof of principle experiment using a
two-section undulator: the first section causes laser oscillation at high power
level while the second is for the acceleration. The FEL is configured as an
autoaccelerator which increases the energy of one group of electrons at the
expense of the remaining group. The laser oscillates at a wavelength of 2mm and
the electron beam energy is 800kV; the accelerated particles will have an energy
of approximately lMV, well resolved from the unaccelerated group. Diagnostics
include an array of power and spectral instruments, which are used to understand
the stimulated absorption of the laser, together with a new electron momentum
analyser which will be constructed at Columbia. Theoretical studies include one
and two dimensional numerical simulations, as well as a continuing examination
of how the use of a background plasma may be used to improve the acceleration.
