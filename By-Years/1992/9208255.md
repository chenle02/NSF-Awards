The most recent classification of the red algae (Rhodophyta) recognizes one
class and seventeen orders, the largest being the Gigartinales with over forty
families. For the most part, growth takes place by means of apical cells and the
plant body is composed of branched filaments linked by pit connections. This
feature makes it possible to describe vegetative and reproductive development
cell by cell, event by event using morphological and cytological markers seen
with light microscopy. Growth is punctuated by discrete events and transitional
stages that bracket each phase of development. These include formation of :
juvenile uprights, adult thalli, reproductive organs, and filamentous structures
employed in nutritional strategies for fruit development and spore production.
Characters used in classification are resolvable into component ontogenetic
sequences. Primitive and advanced character states are readily polarized,
apparent reversals resolved, and instances of convergent evolution (homoplasies)
identified. Analysis shows that every red algal order can be defined by its
basic developmental plan, except the polyphyletic order Gigartinales. This study
investigates the developmental morphology of family clusters in the Gigartinales
to complete a phylogenetic analysis of the group.
