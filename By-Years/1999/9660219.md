*** ABSTRACT 9660219 DeCramer This Small Business lnnovation Research Phase I
project addresses the development of automated manufacturing for high frequency
(5 MHz to 1 GHz) transformers and inductors. Current manufacturing processes are
labor intensive. Magnetic core and wire diameters are very small (2.5 mm and
0.075 mm) making machine assembly impractical. The proposed approach uses
automated techniques similar to semiconductor manufacturing to deposit, etch,
and coat patterned layers of magnetic, conductive and insulating materials. This
automation will significantly reduce labor content, further reduce device size,
and enable economic production in the United States rather than offshore.
Research objectives include completion of electrical and mechanical transformer
design and fabrication of prototypes. Fundamental phenomena underlying device
operation and electrical performance will be evaluated. Commercial applications
include high frequency transformers and inductors for data and video
transmissions, hybrid circuits, and related circuitry. Beyond existing markets,
this new approach will enable development of miniature products in data and
personal communications. ***
