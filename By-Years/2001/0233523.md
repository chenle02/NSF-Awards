The project will undertake laboratory reactor experiments that seek to recreate
the photochemistry of the upper atmosphere in order to solve existing dilemmas
regarding the modeling and understanding of recent and new atmospheric
measurements. Although lower pressures and longer times pertain to the real
atmosphere, computer modeling we can be used to design the virtual atmosphere
experiments so that they are sensitive to the same chemistry and photolysis. The
chemistry of the upper stratosphere and mesosphere to be explored by the study
is dominated by reactive oxygen- and hydrogen-containing species, many of which
we will measure with great sensitivity and selectivity using a series of laser
diagnostics. This concept will provide a new technique to validate our
understanding of the photochemistry of hard-to-access regions and uncover any
unknown features. The experiments will be conducted in a large reactor bulb with
quantified inlet and outlet flows of oxygen, nitrogen, ozone, and water,
operating near 1 torr with 3- to 6-minute residence times, and subject to
ultraviolet photolysis with well-characterized lamp or laser radiation. The
appropriate operating conditions and diagnostics will be combined to address
specific topics of current interest, debate, or measurement activity, including
the failure of current mesospheric models to predict observed OH and HO2 levels,
and the role of excited oxygen and hydroxyl states in the heating, signatures,
and chemistry of the upper atmosphere.
