This research will undertake comparative ethnographic investigations of the
homeless in Los Angeles, Paris, Sao Paulo, and Tokyo using local research teams.
The long range goal is to explore why homelessness emerged in each of these
global cities at similar times in the last quarter of the twentieth century.
Descriptions of street life will look for similarities and differences across
the four cities: Who constitute the homeless: how do their age, gender, racial-
ethnic, educational, disability, and work statuses distinguish them from the
domiciled? What are the survival strategies of the homeless? How do they account
for their homelessness? What have been the political responses to the emergence
of homelessness? The research teams will each explore these questions in their
own cities and meet for comparative analyses in Sao Paulo.
