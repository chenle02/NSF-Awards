This award funds the research activities of Professor Simone Giombi at Princeton
University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the key developments in string theory
has been the discovery of surprising dualities relating quantum gravitational
theories to gauge theories. Professor Giombi's research program is aimed at a
broad and thorough study of various aspects of the gauge/gravity duality. This
work will deepen our fundamental understanding of the physics underlying the
relation between gauge and gravitational theories, and exploit the gauge/gravity
duality in order to develop a powerful toolbox for answering non-perturbative
questions about strongly coupled gauge theory or the nature of quantum gravity.
This project consists of three key areas. The first one is devoted to a deep
study of the gravitational theories involving massless higher spin fields and
their role in the gauge/gravity duality; the second is to better understand the
quantization of string theory in Anti de Sitter (AdS) backgrounds, and the third
involves the study of certain supersymmetric subsectors of non-abelian gauge
theories where exact results are possible by the method of
localization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is also expected to have a
number of broader impacts. While working on specific research problems, graduate
students and postdoctoral fellows will receive extensive mentoring and training
which will positively contribute to their formation as future independent
scientists. The PI intends to develop special classes for graduate students and
advanced undergraduates about recent trends in theoretical physics research, and
to lecture at schools for students and young researchers held at international
institutes. The PI also plans to become active in various outreach programs,
such as giving public lectures and communicating recent research advances to
non-technical journals.
