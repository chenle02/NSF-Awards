9424231 Hagan The REU Site in the Center for Research and Education in Optics
and Lasers (CREOL) will expose ten undergraduate students per year, recruited
nationally, to twelve weeks of research experiences in lasers and optics. A
primary emphasis of these programs will be on encouraging talented undergraduate
students, in particular women, minorities and persons with disabilities, to
pursue graduate studies in the field of optics and lasers. Ten internationally
recognized faculty in the CREOL will be Research Supervisors in this project.
CREOL is a world-leading center of excellence in optics and laser research. The
program will include: (1) An introductory course in the basic principals of
optics and lasers; (2) Weekly Undergraduate Research Seminars by the CREOL
Faculty; (3) Bi-weekly industrial visits to the numerous optics and laser
companies in the Orlando area; (4) Weekly classes and discussions sessions on
issues of ethics in engineering research, research group tutorials; and (5)
Continuous monitoring of the students' progress by the principal investigators,
primarily via twice-weekly tutorial discussion sessions. The program will be
followed up by helping students get into graduate school with scholarships and
by tracking their career progress. ***
