This proposal requests travel support for U.S. participants in the
International Seminar-Cum-School On Macromolecular Crystallographic Data that
will be held in Calcutta from November 16th to the 20th, 1995. This workshop
focuses on the use and implementation of structural biology databases and their
application to research problems such as structure-based drug design, protein
engineering and structure analysis. This workshop is sanctioned by the
International Union of Crystallography Commission on Biological Macromolecules
and is part of efforts to insure that all of the international community has
access to the repositories and contributes to the development of these critical
resources. The workshop will focus on teaching the most current methodology and
techniques for deposition, validation, retrieval and use of macromolecular
structural data, and the application to specific research problems that include
drug design and protein engineering. The workshop in India is timely because of
the recent expansion of Indian scientists will enhance the developing research
programs and provide scientists from throughout the world access to data that
results from the success of these efforts.
