This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a
cost-effective procedure for the production of soluble single-walled carbon
nanotubes (SWNT) in commercial quantities. Phase I results demonstrated
dissolution of full-length SWNTs in common organic solvents by exfoliation and
covalent functionalization. It has been found that the purity of as-prepared
SWNT (AP-SWNT) soot greatly influences both the cost and quality of the final
product. The major emphasis for the project will be directed towards the
synthesis of byproduct-free AP-SWNT soot, in purification of the SWNTs and in
optimizing and scaling-up the dissolution step.

The dissolution of carbon nanotubes can greatly enhance the processability of
this unique material and facilitate the entry of SWNTs into commercial
applications requiring high strength light weight materials, electromagnetic
shielding materials, conductive composites and nanoelectronics. The development
of the solution chemistry of SWNTs will facilitate applications in polymer
science, and in medicine.
