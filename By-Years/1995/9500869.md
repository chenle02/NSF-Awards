9500869 de la Llave The project involves a broad based approach to problems of
dynamics using methods from K.A.M. theory, hyperbolic dynamical systems and
numerical exploration. In particular, we plan to study questions such as
breakdown of invariant curves, rigidity of hyperbolic systems and variational
methods. A study will be made of the long term behavior of systems whose
evolution is known. The plan uses a broad based approach that combines
analytical techniques and numerical explorations in such a way that they
complement and reinforce each other. Many of the concrete problems that will be
studied are motivated by hydrodynamics, for example, to compute the smallest
amount of stirring that guarantees a thorough mixing. ***
