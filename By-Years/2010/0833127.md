Howard University is requesting CREST resources for proposed CREST Phase 2,
operation as the CREST Nanoscale Analytical Sciences Research and Education
Center. In Phase 2 the CREST Center focuses on four basic Subproject areas
including: (1) the characterization and measurement of the molecular composition
and structural factors dictating the unique physicochemical properties of
nanomaterials, (2) surface enhanced separation, identification and metrology of
nanomolecular species in complex systems, (3) the fabrication and
characterization of nanostructured materials and films for nanoscale separation,
high resolution microscopy and infrared detection, and (4) development and
transfer of education technology utilizing nanomaterials and nanodevice
technology as tools. This research has the intellectual merit of providing the
basic knowledge for elucidating chemistry at the nanoscale, and creates the
analytical chemistry knowledge-base underpinning advances in nanotechnology.
&lt;br/&gt;The rationale for the above focus of activities is that for the
foreseeable future, nanoscience and engineering will continue to create
frontiers for interdisciplinary research in nanomaterials, bionanotechnology,
environmental science, and nanoelectronics. Executing leading-edge research in
these areas will require analytical chemistry research as a pivotal discipline
for advancement. Research outputs will be integrated with education to develop a
modernized nanoscale analytical sciences doctoral program to provide the broader
impact of educating future generations of minority characterization scientists
for careers in the US nanotechnology enterprise. The CREST Center?s strategic
plan for sustainment beyond Phase 2 is the continued validation of its pivotal
role in the accomplishment of Howard University?s major education and research
goals. This achievement is providing momentum for underpinning the launching of
a Howard University NanoTechnology Initiative, which targets the provision of
funding beyond NSF Phase 2. The strategy also includes expanding multi-year
research funded partnerships with corporations; obtaining intellectual property
in subproject areas; and initiating CREST faculty participation in SBIR
programs.&lt;br/&gt;
