This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
will assist the Department of Chemistry at the University of Denver in the
purchase of an upgrade of its existing EPR. This equipment upgrade will enhance
research in a number of areas including the following: 1. Electron Spin-Electron
Spin Interactions 2. Alzheimer's: The Role of Radicals 3. Mechanisms of
Myocardial Reperfusion Injury 4. The Environments of Metals in Metalloproteins
5. EPR Imaging 6. Coordination versus Ion Pairing 7. The Active Site of T7 RNA
Polymerase 8. The Nature and Reactivity of Soot 9. Probing the Palmitoylation
Site of Rhodopsin with Spin Labels An electron spin resonance (ESR) spectrometer
is an instrument used to obtain information about the molecular and electronic
structure of molecules. It may also be used to obtain information about the
lifetimes of free radicals which are often essential for the initiation of tumor
growth and/or a variety of chemical reactions.
