Accurate measurements of precipitation spectra are critical to understanding
the initiation and evolution of natural precipitation; they are also essential
for calibrating rain intensity using meteorological radars. Dr. Lawson will
redesign an existing device to enable a wider range of drop sizes to be sampled,
and at a greater sampling rate. The completed device will be suitable for
mounting on a research aircraft.
