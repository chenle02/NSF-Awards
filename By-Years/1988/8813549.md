Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy gives the chemical
investigator a powerful tool to probe systems as diverse as matrix-isolated
nucleic acids and metal clusters. When combined with a magnetic field, the
technique can be used to obtain detailed information about the electronic and
magnetic properties of individual clusters. This award from the Chemistry Shared
Instrumentation Program will be used by the Department of Chemistry at the
University of Florida to help acquire a spectroscopic system consisting of a
vacuum FTIR/Raman spectrometer and a superconducting magnet. The acquisition
will enhance the research being conducted in the following areas of chemistry:
1) Far-infrared studies in magnetic fields using FTIR and ESR 2) Magnetic
circular and linear dichroism in the infrared 3) Nucleic acid bases and their
interactions.
