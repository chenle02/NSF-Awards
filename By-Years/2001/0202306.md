This project will develop a generalized model for the equilibrium conditions for
the Earth's magnetic tail during conditions when the magnetosphere is
characterized by (1) quasi-steady convection, (2) the growth phase of magnetic
substorms, and (3) directly driven solar wind effects. It will use analytic
methods in conjunction with a computer simulation code that will ensure
appropriate topological conditions and conservation of flux and/or entropy. The
result will be an equilibrium model that can be embedded in a Geospace General
Circulation Model, or other global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the
magnetospheric system.
