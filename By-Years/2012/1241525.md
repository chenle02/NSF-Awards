This project aims to expand the existing CyberCorps(R): Scholarship for Service
(SFS) program at Florida State University (FSU) to new MS Computer Criminology
degree program. Most professionals who enter the cybersecurity field have only
training in technical aspects with the common educational background being
Computer Science (CS). While such skills are crucial, there is also a need to
have a broader understanding of the threat model for cyber applications
particularly when the adversary can be an insider. Criminology studies the
extent, causes and nature of criminal behavior in the individual, society or
nation-state. Understanding the motivation for criminal behavior leads to better
methods for the prevention of cybercrime and, when complemented with the
appropriate CS technical skills will provide assurance in a much more realistic
threat model. Thus, CS and Criminology provide complementary knowledge skills.
FSU has created a new MS Computer Criminology degree program to meet these
needs. Another key aspect of this project is to increase female and minority
participation in cybersecurity attracting students that would have normally
majored in criminology or related majors.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The proposed
project has an important mission of preparing cybersecurity professionals for
positions in agencies of the Federal, state, local and tribal government. Using
knowledge and skills obtained in the program, the graduates are well prepared to
meet challenges of protecting the information and infrastructure resources of
our Nation.
