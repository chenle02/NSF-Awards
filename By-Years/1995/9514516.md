The "Northern Caddoan Dictionaries Project" will complete reference
dictionaries of Arikara and Pawnee, closely related American Indian languages of
the Caddoan family. Today these languages are spoken by fewer than a dozen
elderly tribal members in North Dakota and Oklahoma. The project will complete
compilation of three databases from which the dictionaries will be generated,
for Arikara, Skiri Pawnee, and South Band Pawnee. Comprising each of those
databases will be both written and sound material. Each of the databases will
provide material from which the project will generate three products for each of
those three groups. The first is a conventional printed dictionary. The second a
valuable and innovative product in the documentation of endangered languages is
a multimedia dictionary for use with personal computers. The multimedia
dictionary will be published in CD-ROM format and present the same information
as the printed volume. In addition, it will provide sound recordings of every
word main entry and grammatical and other illustrative forms and offer many
useful features for searching and cross-referencing. A third product is
development of an enduring, non-proprietary method of storing the dictionary
databases that is accessible to a broad range of operating systems and hardware
platforms and that will allow dissemination and publication of research in a
format that will not be rendered technologically obsolete. The dictionaries,
each to contain approximately 10,000 entries, will draw upon all available
lexical and textual materials: data collected by the PI over the past twenty-
five years; data collected by anthropologists earlier in the century; and data
in historical sources. Ten months of additional field work are necessary, most
of which will be with Arikara and the South Band dialect of Pawnee. The project,
part of a larger effort to document the Pawnee and Arikara languages as fully as
possible, will result in the first reference dictionaries ever compiled for
them. The dictionaries, moreover, will provide essential data for the
comparative study of the Caddoan language family and the interrelationships of
the Caddoan languages with other genetically related language families in the
New World. Because Pawnee and Arikara are complex polysynthetic languages, these
dictionaries will be of particular interest to typologists and theoreticians.
They will also serve as reference tools for scholars and in language classes
taught in the Arikara and Pawnee communities.
