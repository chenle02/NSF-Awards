Dr. Theresa C. Kavanaugh has been awarded a Postdoctoral Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Kavanaugh' doctoral degree was from MIT with Professor Robert
Silbey. She intends to continue research with Dr. Richard Stratt at Brown. In
his laboratory, she will learn about liquid structure and cultivate an
understanding of semiconductor liquids. This will build on the knowledge she has
gained on non-linear properties and prepare her for her long range career goals
of understanding surface effects of semiconductor clusters through the use of
theoretical studies. %%% The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is
viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge
and experience of new Ph.D.'s and attract them into meaningful careers in
contemporary chemical resesearch and teaching.
