This proposal is to study the role of a specific neural pathway in the spinal
cord and medulla of the brainstem in the control of the sympathetic nervous
system. The uniqueness of this proposal is that the PI can identify a specific
neural pathway by two chemical identifiers. Some pathways contain serotonin and
some contain thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) but only one pathway contains
both and it is by the combined use of these transmitters that the pathway can be
recognized and defined. The study should add greatly to the accuracy of our
understanding of brain control of the sympathetic nervous system.
