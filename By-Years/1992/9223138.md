The ability to plan, control and predict software processes is facilitated by
the measurement of software development artifacts, even though construction of
quantitative models from these artifacts is a difficult task. Explanatory
variables are potentially numerous and heterogeneous; data sets are replete with
outliers; the quality of the data collection may be questionable; and often only
partial information is available for building the model. Even so, there is a
need for customized modelling techniques, procedures, and tools to facilitate
the construction of local tools within a specific development environment.
Stochastic modelling is needed for three kinds of activity within the
development process: planning, monitoring and control, and post-mortem analysis
and evaluation. Models are used to enable managers to plan and to take
corrective actions to meet budget, schedule and quality requirements. This
research is aimed at continuing the development of an approach called Optimized
Set Reduction with the aim of addressing the specific constraints and needs of
software engineering.
