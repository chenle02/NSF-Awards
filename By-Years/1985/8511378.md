Continuous casting is considered to be the major growth area in the U.S. steel
industry. It combines the casting and hot rolling operations, saving energy and
handling costs. The heat transfer and solidification phenomena need to be better
understood to perfect the design of the casting machines and prevent formation
of defects in the cast metal. The purpose of this work is to generate the
knowledge required. The approach is to extend previous modeling efforts, using
ANSYS software for heat transfer calculations, along with material property data
generated in the laboratories of Inland Steel Corporation. A model will be
developed to simulate the continuous casting process. The model will calculate
the temperature distributions in the casting mold and the solidifying steel,
using an assumed set of heat transfer coefficients. The temperature solution
will be used to compute the distorted shapes of the mold and billet. From the
distorted shapes, a new set of heat transfer coefficients will be determined for
the temperature problem. This procedure will continue until a consistent set of
temperature and thermal stress fields is obtained. The work will be extended,
using a super-computer, from two-dimensional to three-dimensional cases. Phase
changes, convection, and temperature-dependent elastic-plastic effects will be
considered.
