A multidisciplinary study of the Strand Fiord and related volcanics is planned
to address several questions of Arctic tectonic evolution and global change,
taking advantage of the exposed sections to obtain high-latitude paleomagnetic
data. The following five questions will be addressed through the collection of
new paleomagnetic, radiometric and geochemical data: (1) What is the exact age
and duration of the Strand Fiord volcanics, and do these flood basalt correlate,
as do others (Deccan and Siberian Traps), with a global extinction event? (2)
What is the relationship between the Strand Fiord volcanics and the older
Isachesen volcanics, and can any of these units be used to constrain the
geomagnetic timescale? (3) What is the relationship between these volcanics and
mantle plumes such as Iceland,and a larger scale activity such as the
"superplume"? (4) Can a paleomagnetic record from the Strand Fiord volcanics
answer the Nares Strait problem? (5) Can the Strand Fiord volcanics provide
geomagnetic paleointensity information for the Cretaceous Normal Polarity
Superchron? The study of these geological and geophysical questions is linked
through a common sampling scheme: the flow-by-flow sampling of long, continuous
volcanic sections for paleomagnetic and geochemical analyses.
