The International Conference on Computational Advances in Bio and medical
Sciences (ICCABS will provide funds to cover the travel expenses of students and
post-doctoral fellows. These students and fellows will have an opportunity meet
senior researchers and industry experts and research results. They will also
have an opportunity to present their own work. The conference proceedings are
used to support course work and selected papers will be used to develop two
special issues of BMC Bioinformatics and BMC Genomics
journals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ICCABS has the goal of bringing together
scientists in all the three areas and hence serving as a collaboration platform.
The strength of this conference lies in its ability to bring together scientists
in various areas of bio and medical sciences and fostering collaborations among
them. Collaborations across these domains have a record of leading to the
discovery of novel techniques for solving challenging problems at the interface
of computing and the biomedical sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
