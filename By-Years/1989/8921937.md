The Marine Sciences Research Center at SUNY Stony Brook will acquire new
instrumentation to upgrade a specialized seagoing microscope system for
quantitative epifluorescence and microspectrophotometry. The microscope system
is operated and maintained as a shared use facility. Funds will be used to
purchase hardware and software for the computer that controls the microscope, a
VCR for time-lapse research, a video camera, and a controller unit. The
equipment will be maintained for use by all investigators and it will especially
benefit NSF-sponsored research concerning species specific growth rates of
phytoplankton, single cell pigment content, DNA content, bacterial counts,
binding of fluorescent antibodies, and micro-distribution of oxygen.
