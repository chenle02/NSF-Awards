The objective of this research is to develop techniques for the automatic
generation of sculptured surface models in a spatially constrained environment,
subject to specified intrinsic shape properties. Spatial constraints will be
characterized by a distance metric relating surface points to polyhedral models
which represent either components in the vicinity of the surface, or the
boundaries of regions that the surface must avoid. The shape of the surface will
be governed by constraints based on intrinsic properties such as tangency and
curvature, which will be derived from general characterizations of design
intent. To simultaneously address the independent goals of global obstacle
avoidance and local control of intrinsic shape properties, surface synthesis
will be formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem to be solved via
simulated annealing (SA). Preliminary experiments with this technique are very
promising. Some of the research issues to be addressed include: synthesis of
general non-uniform rational B-spline surfaces; derivation of analytical surface
design constraints based on objective characterizations of manufacturability and
functional requirements, and from subjective measures of surface aesthetics;
optimal estimation of parameters associated with the SA algorithm for surface
synthesis; problem formulation for multiple spatial obstacles; possible hybrid
SA/classical optimization techniques; performance oriented variations of the SA
algorithm; and, user interface design and implementation. Automated surfacing
capabilities will facilitate simultaneous engineering and provide product
designers with a rapid analytical prototyping facility. Given the wide spectrum
of potential applications, this research may have a profound impact on the
efficiency of the development process for many products.
