9321602 Muhleman The Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO) 5-element millimeter
array will be activated in July of 1994 to observe the Jovian atmospheric
effects of the impact of the fragments of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9. The instrument
will be operated in the continuum mode near a wavelength of 3 millimeter. The
primary atmospheric effect expected is a strong disturbance in the ammonia layer
within and above the ammonia ice clouds on Jupiter. The measurements offer a
unique way to sense the impacts and to estimate the energy release.
