This award by the Chemical Catalysis Program in the NSF Division of Chemistry
supports the research of Dr. Bradford Wayland of Temple University, who pursues
new classes of catalysts for the selective reduction and conversion of carbon
monoxide and carbon dioxide into useful organic materials. These chemical
transformations can be used to solve major contemporary issues in energy
research. The research includes the pursuit of catalysts based on earth-
abundant, first transition series metal complexes. Realization of the objectives
of the research will advance areas of chemical technology important for long
term stability in the production of economical, liquid fuels and chemical feed
stocks. The students involved in this research receive excellent training in
chemical synthesis and characterization, and chemical catalysis.

The core objective of the research is to utilize bimetallic complexes containing
metal-centered radicals to accomplish thermodynamically challenging
transformations of carbon monoxide and dioxide. The selection of the metal
complexes is guided by thermochemical criteria and DFT computations. The ability
to attain productive intermediates for catalysis in mild conditions is tuned by
the ligands, which are designed to support bimetallic complexes with minimal
metal-metal bonding. Schiff base macrocyclic ligands are being developed as
easily prepared, low-cost substitutes for porphyrins. Non-macrocyclic
tetradentate ligands provide pathways for migratory insertions that are
inhibited in complexes with macrocyclic ligands. A series of anionic tridentate
pincer type ligands with pyrrole and imine donors are designed to form metal-
centered radicals in which the metal has a d7 or d9 electron configuration. The
Pd(I) and Pt(I) derivatives afford the best opportunities to expand the current
limits of carbon dioxide activation reactions. The complexes of Ni(I) and Fe(I)
are leading candidates to accomplish catalytic conversion of carbon oxides using
earth abundant first transition metals.
