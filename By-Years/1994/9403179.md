9403179 Booksh Dr. Karl S. Booksh has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral Research
Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. Booksh received his doctoral degree from the
University of Washington under the supervision of Professor Bruce Kowalski. Dr.
Booksh will continue research at the University of South Carolina under the
sponsorship of Professor Michael Myrick. His postdoctoral research will provide
him with the techniques and knowledge necessary to design and construct
environmental and process sensors. Longer term, he plans to apply his knowledge
of chemometrics to the development and calibration of in situ sensors that rely
on mathematical and physical separation of the analyte signal from the
background signal. With appropriate probe design and proper use of calibration
algorithms, sensors will be built that optimize selectivity, dynamic range and
speed. The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry is viewed as an
important infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge and
experience of new Ph.D.s and attract them into meaningful careers in
contemporary chemical research and teaching.
