At the University of Montana (UM), the Advancing Research through Network
Improvements (ARNI) project provides dedicated high speed desktop and building
level connections for several key sites housing active research requiring large
bandwidth. This project removes an identified bottleneck and allows researchers
to take advantage of the Northern Tier Network (NTN), a 10Gb network path
spanning Seattle to Minneapolis. ARNI is a key component of a 10 year UM
Information Technology Office (ITO) cyberinfrastructure improvement effort which
developed a high-speed, high availability network path from the campus edge to
the national information superhighway, and a resilient campus core network. ARNI
greatly extends the ability of UM researchers to participate in their sphere of
science, work in collaboration with other partners and disciplines at national
and international levels, and extends the impact of these research efforts to
students and to a broader research community. ITO, in collaboration with the
Social Science Research Laboratory (SSRL) and researchers from the Division of
Biological Sciences, Geography, and Geosciences, identified multiple scientific
research projects that benefit directly from ARNI. These include projects that
employ genomics methods in biological sciences, geodynamics research on
earthquakes in East Africa and Central Asia, and a prototype system for
predicting insect and climate-induced impacts on fire hazards in the western
United States. A special aspect of this project is the direct association
between IT professionals and the campus scientific research community which is
providing sound IT solutions that are critical for future competitiveness in
grant funding and academic contribution.
