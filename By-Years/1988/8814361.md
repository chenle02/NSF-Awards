A study of inelastic collision dynamics in state-selected alkali atoms will be
continued. In the new grant period three major projects will be undertaken: (1)
energy transfer cross sections as a function of velocity and polarization of the
reactant atom; (2) Associative ionization in lithium atom collisions as a
function of velocity and polarization; (3) Associative ionization in collisions
at ultra-cold temperatures using a single atomic beam and acousto-optic
modulated Doppler spectroscopy. These studies will explore the nature of atomic
interactions in new detail in new regions of velocity, and will allow comparison
with theory over a correspondingly broader range of parameters.
