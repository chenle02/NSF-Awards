A new and novel technique will be developed for the determination of amorphous
silica in marine sediments. It is based on the high temperature titration of
amorphous silica with added calcium carbonate according to the reaction: SiO2 +
CaCO3 ----- CaSiiO3 + CO2. The proposed research will proceed along three lines:
1. Further development of the method. Preliminary pyrolysis experiments were
done at 500oC for three days. Subsequent work was at 700oC for one hour. These
new conditions necessitate the repetition of many experiments to determine the
optimum temperature and time and the dependence of the reaction on mineralogy,
water content etc. for the optimum conditions. 2. Revaluation of the marine
silica budget. Preliminary work indicates that calcareous oozes and continental
shelf sediments are much more important sinks than previously believed. 3. The
use of the &amp;18O of the product CO2 as a measure of the &amp;18O of amorphous
silica and the paleocean from which it was deposited. //
