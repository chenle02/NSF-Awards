This research considers the general stochastic infinite horizon optimization
problem. This sub-class of optimization problems includes most production-
inventory, capacity expansion and equipment replacement problems, as well as
many others. The proposed approach has three steps: (1) Given the stochastic
problem, determine when there exists, and how to obtain, an equivalent
deterministic problem, where equivalent means having the same optimal solution
as the adaptive (closed-loop) solution to the stochastic problem; (2) Given the
infinte horizon deterministic problem from above, determine when there exists,
and how to obtain, anequivalent finite horizon problem, where equivalent means
agreement in the initial decision; (3) Determine how to solve the finite horizon
problem in an efficient manner. Although the equivalences in parts 1) and 2)
need not always exist, preliminary work suggests a wide class of practically
interesting problems for which this approach would be successful.
