Reinforced concrete composite sandwich wall systems are becoming very popular
due to the many benefits of combining lateral, gravity and in-plane loads along
with the thermal benefits of the insulated sandwich construction. These walls
typically consist to two layers (wythes) of reinforced (or prestressed) concrete
sandwich around a middle layer of insulation, providing sufficient R-rating for
thermal efficiency. In order to maintain the insulated rating and to prevent a
thermal short-circuit, non-metallic tie connectors, such as fiber-composite ties
are required. The objective of this research is to determine the amount of
composite action resulting in the sandwich system subjected to lateral and
bearing loads. This objective entails the development of the commensurate
analytical tools coupled with the experimental tests to verify the theory.
approximately 32-ft long wall tests subjected to lateral or bearing loads will
be conducted. Industry collaboration and cooperation is a key element in shared
cost and participation in this project. This research is expected to result in a
theoretical model for analysis os future walls, behavioral characteristics
(including amount of composite action), design recommendations, and potential
provisions for inclusion in new design standards.
