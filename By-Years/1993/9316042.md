9316042 Dallmeyer Recent petrological, geochronological and structural studies
of the Eastern Alps and Carpathian Mts. suggest that a separate Mesozoic
collisional event occurred in this region between the Adriatic microplate and
the overridden European plate. The precise timing of collisional events in this
area is unknown, and this project will provide systematic 40Ar/39Ar mineral and
whole rock ages along three traverses across the Internal Alps and Carpathians.
A special emphasis will be the dating of muscovite from mylonitic deformation
zones. Collaboration with scientists in Austria, Hungaria, Romania and Slovakia
will provide the structural and geological framework. The results will provide
tight constraints on the timing of individual collisional and extensional events
during the evolution of this important sector of the Alpine- Himalayan orogenic
chain and will have implications for tectonic reconstructions of the region.
