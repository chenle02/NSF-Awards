This award supports cooperative research on the regulation of hormone secretion
in amphibian endocrine cells to be carried out by Illani Atwater and other
researchers at NIH and Veronica Nassar-Gentina and her co-workers at the
University of Chile. The co-workers are from the Faculty of Sciences in Montemar
and the Faculty of Medicine in Santiago. Stimulus-secretion mechanisms in
tadpole amphibian adrenal medulla and pancreatic cells will be compared to the
same mechanisms in adult cells. Changes in cell membrane potentials and ionic
channel activity will be measured and combined with measurements of hormone
release in vitro. Many similarities exist between adult amphibian and mammalian
hormone release patterns so it is important for this reason to establish a
convenient non-mammalian animal model system. Part of the experiments will be
carried out at the two Chilean laboratories and the rest at the Laboratory of
Cell Biology and Genetics at NIH in Bethesda. In this way, the two countries
both contribute facilities and personnel and derive the mutual benefits of the
collaboration between teams of scientists on both sides. The partial support of
the Chilean researchers helps fulfill the objectives of the Science in
Developing Countries Program.
