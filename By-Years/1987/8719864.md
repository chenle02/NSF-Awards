Stable isotope analysis of bone collagen is a new technique being developed by
the investigators to provide answers to a number of archaeological questions. In
this project, it will be used to trace the development of marine resource use by
prehistoric southern California populations from San Clemente Island. The
investigators will test new techniques for the study of sulfur isotopes which
they have developed in order to estimate the extent of marine foods in the diet
under conditions where carbon and nitrogen data are equivocal. There is great
promise in this research in that the technique will provide evidence of
individual as well as cultural variations in diet and resource use.
