This is a fundamental engineering research project to characterize the material
properties of a calcium- phosphate/collagen composite. A better fundamental
understanding of this type of material, which may be very similar to biological
calcium-phosphate/collagen, could accelerate the development of coatings for
dental and prosthetic implants.
