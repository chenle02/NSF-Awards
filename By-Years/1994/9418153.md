9418153 This award supports a program aimed at providing research experiences to
a broad range of undergraduate students. The program sill allow for active
participation by undergraduate students in ongoing marine geologic research in
Antarctica. Students will be recruited from institutions across the United
States and will participate in a preparatory seminar on Antarctic science prior
to the field season. This program will integrate undergraduate participation
with existing marine geology and geophysics projects aboard either of the two
United States Antarctic Program research vessels, the RV Polar Duke and the RVIB
Nathaniel B. Palmer. Research topics will be related to the stratigraphy and/or
evolution of the Antarctic continental margin, topics of increasing importance
to both Antarctic and global geology. Students will have a full year following
their field experience to conduct follow-up research via a senior thesis. This
program is intended to provide better educational experiences to promising
undergraduate students and to stimulate those students to pursue advanced
degrees in geology and geophysics. ***
