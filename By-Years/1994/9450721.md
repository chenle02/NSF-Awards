9450721 Banchoff Third semester calculus of two and more variables can be taught
most effectively when classroom lectures and texts are supplemented by
interactive computer graphics laboratories. The laboratory materials already
developed at Brown University for introductory differential geometry using a
network of SUN workstations can now be redesigned, using recent electronic book
technology, so that it can run on Macintosh level computers. This will make the
visualization software available to a much larger range of institutions and
students, in engineering, natural sciences, life sciences, and economics, as
well as computer science and mathematics.
