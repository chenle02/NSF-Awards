Steven A. Buechler's research project is in stability theory, a subfield of
model theory. In recent years several general model- theoretic problems have
been systematically approached via the stability hierarchy. Even though the
problem itself may not involve stability-theoretic notions, considering
separately the cases: omega-stable, superstable, etc., brings into play a mass
of technical machinery. Such is the case with Vaught's conjecture, which was
proved by Shelah for omega-stable theories. The next step is to consider all
superstable theories, but this has proven to be too difficult. Buechler will
approach this problem by separating the superstable theories according to their
"geometrical" properties. The first case to consider is when the universe has
Shelah rank 1. Buechler has already made progress on this problem.
