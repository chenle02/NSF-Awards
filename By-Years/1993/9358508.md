CTS-9358508 University of California-Davis Stephanie R. Dungan ABSTRACT This NSF
Young Investigator award supports the research and teaching interests of
Stephanie R. Dungan at the University of California-Davis. A teaching objective
of the recipient includes incorporating more quantitative study in her
Department of Food Science and Technology at the undergraduate level in line
with the present needs of industry. Additionally, she plans to develop a course
in colloid and interface science with a laboratory component for students from
chemical engineering, where she holds a joint appointment. In her research, the
awardee will examine the partitioning of hydrophobic flavor and preservative
agents in micelles and microemulsions in line with an emphasis on transport
kinetics and its influence on flavor perception. S PRE .N T" AUTOEXECBAT X J
