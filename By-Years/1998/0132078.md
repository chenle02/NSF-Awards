This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop
advanced carbon electrode materials for ultracapacitors. Presently,
ultracapacitor voltages are limited to 2.3 - 2.7 V/cell. New carbonaceous
electrode materials are expected to increase cell potential limits to >3.6 V.
Given the quadratic dependence of energy density on cell potential, these
materials will increase ultracapacitor energy storage by >100%. The increased
cell potential will reduce device size and cost by reducing the number of cells
required to attain a given voltage rating. Phase II will demonstrate that these
materials can withstand extended charge/discharge cycling to high voltage. A
scalable process will be developed to produce the new carbon electrode
materials. Prototype ultracapacitors will be produced to support customer
demonstrations.

The commercial potential of this project is for ultracapacitors that are used in
portable electronic devices, power conditioning (UPS), and electromechanical
actuators. Additional applications include hybrid electric and conventional
vehicles to service intermittent high power loads (e.g. regenerative braking,
engine start, electromechanical valves, and electric power steering).
