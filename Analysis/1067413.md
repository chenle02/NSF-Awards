The main goal of this project is to study the long-time behavior of certain
linear and nonlinear evolution equations. In the linear case, the problems of
interest include the following: the long-time behavior and growth of Sobolev
norms of solutions to evolution equations when the value of the coupling
constant is generic; applications to multidimensional scattering for Schrodinger
operators with slowly decaying or random potentials; the analysis of the spatial
asymptotics of Green's function for Schrodinger equations; and sharp results for
the dynamics in one-dimensional wave equations with decaying potentials. The
nonlinear evolution equations to be studied in this project have their origins
in two-dimensional incompressible fluid dynamics. Specifically, the equations to
be studied are the Euler equation and the surface quasigeostrophic equation. The
project will address the issue of instability for these equations. In the case
of the Euler equation, the problem of optimal growth of the Sobolev norms of
vorticity will be studied, while in the quasigeostrophic setting the scenario of
blow-up in finite time will be considered. To make a progress, the principal
investigator will use the tools of harmonic analysis (multilinear operators,
potential theory, harmonic measure, singular integrals), approximation theory
(polynomials orthogonal on the circle and on the real line), probability (Ito's
calculus), and spectral theory for self-adjoint operators and hyperbolic
pencils.

This project will focus on mathematical problems that are central to quantum and
fluid mechanics. Quantum mechanics, which was created and developed in the last
century, is a basic branch of the modern physics, and the dynamics of fluids is
another branch of physics studied as early as the eighteenth century by Leonhard
Euler. The analysis of evolution equations and wave propagation in the presence
of rough or random medium suggested in this project is a central problem of
quantum mechanics, so this research has a potential impact on the development of
that field. One of the most intriguing problems in fluid dynamics is the problem
of singularity formation. This phenomenon is ubiquitous in nature and one goal
of this project is to study its mechanism mathematically by focusing on some
simplified two-dimensional models. To accomplish these goals, tools from various
areas of mathematics will be refined and applied, which will advance these
fields as well. The work on the project will include mentoring graduate students
and coaching undergraduate research teams. This will have an additional impact
on human resource development.
