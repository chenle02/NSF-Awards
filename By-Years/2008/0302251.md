0302251 Song Involuntary subject motion often impairs image quality in MRI. The
problem is exacerbated in high-resolution imaging due to the long scan times and
small voxel sizes. Displacements during data collection even on a sub-millimeter
scale can often cause significant degradation of image quality and can prevent
the images from being analyzed quantitatively. In order for in vivo micro-MRI to
become practical, in which the resolution is in the submillimeter range (100 -
300 um), a robust motion compensation scheme is necessary. The principal
objective of the proposed research is to develop improved motion correction
techniques for in vivo MR micro-imaging. The work is based on a retrospective
data correction technique referred to as "autofocusing," which is an iterative
technique that does not require additional data to compensate for motion.
Widespread application has been hampered, however, by long data processing times
and suboptimal performance, particularly when image signal-to-noise ratio is
low. The goal of this project is to develop efficient autofocusing algorithms to
detect and compensate for both translational and rotational motion, and to
improve its current performance, with particular focus on high-resolution images
that are often corrupted by noise. Although the focus of the proposed work is on
in vivo micro-MRI, the anticipated result may have broader impact by improving
image sharpness and thus achievable spatial resolution not only in high-
resolution images, but in any MR imaging application in which subject motion
causes image degradation.
