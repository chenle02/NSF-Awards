This award will support collaborative research between Dr. David S. Hinds of
California State University at Bakersfield and Dr. R. V. Baudinette of The
Flinders University of South Australia. This research is to measure maximum
metabolism, as well as the ratio of maximum to minimum metabolism in marsupial
species during treadmill locomotion and exposure to cold. The results will be
compared with data from placental mammals. The research tests the hypothesis
that maximum metabolism during locomotion in placental mammals will be elevated
above that in response to cold, but not to the extent observed in marsupials.
The findings will provide insight into the maximum performance abilities of
mammals generally regarded as the most evolutionarily conservators of living
mammals and exhibiting many of the attributes of ancestral mammals. The project
continues the excellent and productive collaboration between the Australian
group and its interest in thermoregulation in marsupials and the Hinds work on
metabolism in birds, monotremes, marsupials, and eutherians. This is important
fundamental work on the absorption of heat and cold by mammals, as well as
having potential for major advances in comparative physiology and evolution.
