The Center for Limnology's Trout Lake Station provides access to a region with
one of the densest concentrations of lakes in the world. Aquatic systems within
the Highlands include a broad diversity of trophic, hydrologic, and edaphic
conditions ranging from temporary forest ponds to large lakes. Many of these
systems lie within protected, uninhabited watersheds. Research at the station
has an extensive history, and within the past decade has grown and diversified
dramatically. Current programs include several multi-investigator, ecosystem
level projects, and smaller-scale projects involving population, community and
behavioral ecology, groundwater hydrology and basic limnology. This project will
provide funds to improve the station's capacities in basic data management and
in three core research areas: 1) real-time sensing and sampling of aquatic
habitats, 2) analytical facilities for biological parameters, and 3) controlled
environmental systems for experimental work. Improvements will add significantly
to the national and international use of the Trout Lake Station as a center for
aquatic research and will directly assist several major, ongoing programs.
