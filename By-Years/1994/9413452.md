This award from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at Indiana University-South Bend acquire an
electrochemical workstation which will be used in research. The research
activity to be supported includes an investigation of the electronic properties
of a series of metal cluster compounds which contain ligands, and the
investigation of the electron transfer and redox properties of arsenite oxidase.
An electrochemical workstation allows researchers to employ commonly used
electrochemical techniques such as cyclic voltammetry and anodic stripping
voltammetry. These techniques study phenomena associated with electron transfer
at the interface of an electrode and solution.
