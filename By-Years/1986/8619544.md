The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will acquire several items of
oceanographic instrumentation to be placed in a pool of shared use equipment.
This equipment is maintained for use on or in association with the research
vessels operated by the institution. A substantial part of their operating
schedule is in support of NSF-sponsored research projects. The instrumentation
will also increase the capabilities of the ship and of the institution to
support research and engineering activities. The instrumentation includes: 15
5-liter Niskin water sampling bottles, a titroprocessor, a CTD deck unit and
associated peripheral equipment and software, a box corer, rock- thin sectioning
equipment, and a bulk data storage recorder.
