This project will study a number of risk management problems in finance
requiring efficient computation of optimal trading decisions that are designed
to account for various "frictions" found in modern markets. Some examples of
common frictions investigated here are: uncertain volatility, influence of
competition for resources, and trading restrictions. The results will be
implemented as software that can be downloaded, tested and implemented by
interested parties, which may range from large trading institutions to
individuals with pension funds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The spectacular growth in
the size of the derivatives market over the last twenty-five years (currently it
has a turnover of trillions of dollars in the US), plus recent infamous (and
equally spectacular) risk (mis)management disasters, such as the Barings, Orange
County and Long Term Capital Management fiascos, have created an urgent need for
smart mathematical and computational models to quantify the respective risks and
rewards of such investments. This project aims to build on the methodology
introduced by Black, Scholes and Merton, to take into account the fluctuating
nature of market volatility and other frictions. The main mathematical tools are
in the realm of stochastic control and asymptotic analysis.&lt;br/&gt;
