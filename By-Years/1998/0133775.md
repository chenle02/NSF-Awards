0133775&lt;br/&gt;Fu&lt;br/&gt;Under this CAREER Award, efforts will be made to
systematically understand the structural mechanisms of microvessel wall
controlling the transport of water, molecules and cells in order to design new
drug and drug delivery methods. In particular, the proposal focuses on
developing approaches to investigate the mechanisms by which VEGF induces
permeability of individually perfused microvessels in frog mesentery and how
that permeability is influenced by cAMP. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational
component of the plan focuses on creating research education seminars and
conferences, supervising graduate students, creating new graduate level courses,
relevant introductory undergraduate courses and providing research training for
undergraduate and high school students, including outreach efforts to women and
minorities and developing international research/education collaborations with
West China Medical University and the National University of
Singapore.&lt;br/&gt;
