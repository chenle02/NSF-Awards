This project is investigating the design, implementation, and use of a family of
family of massively parallel computers that use one processor per digit. A first
generation design, completed in an earlier project, contains 16,384 fine grain
processors on a single board. The processors contain a small number of parallel
logic circuits and a configuration memory that controls the logic and
interconnect. The entire machine is programmed for a problem by setting all
configuration registers to transform the machine into a special-purpose computer
for the problem. By improving the density of processors on chips and the speeds
of interconnect and interface, this project is increasing the operation rate of
the machine by a factor of 4 to 10. In addition to the design and implementation
of architectures, this project is developing both high and low level programming
tools for the machines. Finally, algorithms for solving compute intensive
problems on these machines are being developed and tested.
