This proposal is a request for support of an annual symposium on a topic of
current interest, by the Society of General Physiologists. These meetings are
held at the Marine Biological Labs in Woods Hole, MA, where 200-300 participants
gather in an area isolated from other diversions. The meeting this year is on
the control of secretion, which involves the molecular mechanisms which induce
and bring about secretion, as well as the physical processes which occur within
the cell - compartmentalization, vesicle fusion and endocytosis. New technology
has led to investigations on calcium and other ion channels in the stimulus and
secretion. Many aspects of these processes, in a variety of cell types, will be
discussed at this meeting. The meeting is open to students as well as senior
investigators, and there are plans for publication of the talks. This is an
important area in biology, which because of technical developments is likely to
provide new information.
