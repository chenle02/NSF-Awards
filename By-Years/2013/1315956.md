The underlying mission of the Infrastructure for Broadening Participation in
STEM (IBP-STEM) initiative is to increase diversity in the Science, Technology,
Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) workforce. The Institute for Broadening
Participation (IBP) operates on a model of targeted activities supported by
strategic infrastructure to support underrepresented students in their efforts
to seek and successfully apply to research, funding, mentoring, and professional
development opportunities, and succeed in their chosen academic and career
pathways; assist faculty and administrators in their efforts to support and
mentor students, build partnerships, and contribute to the pool of best
practices; and grow diversity awareness and cultural competency in programs,
departments, and institutions. IBP's four-pronged approach to broadening
participation and increasing diversity in STEM includes: (1) Catalyzing
partnerships to cultivate a community of practice and culture of diversity,
reduce isolation among diversity practitioners and increase information sharing;
(2) Extensive face-to-face and virtual outreach to draw constituents to the
resources available via IBP that support students and faculty through the entire
STEM pathway; (3) Creating and maintaining strategic web resources, open to all
members of the STEM academy nationally, to make resources and information on
programs, best practices, and references easily available and accessible; and
(4) Synthesizing information to compile and translate research and best
practices into materials and resources that are engaging, usable, and directly
relevant to a broad constituency of STEM faculty, administrators, program staff,
and students.
