Protoporphyrinogen oxidase, an enzyme in heme and chlorophyll synthesis, is
being characterized in plant systems. The initial experiments focus on the
mechanism by which diphenyl ether herbicides, recently identified as inhibitors
of this enzyme, affect protoporphyrinogen oxidation by extracts of plant
organelles and by the purified enzyme. Inhibition of protoporphyrinogen
oxidation by these herbicides is being examined in chloroplasts and mitochondria
from barley, which is sensitive to diphenyl ethers, and soybean, which appears
to be resistant. The red pigment of blood and the green pigment of leaves were
shown to be related to each other structurally more than 100 years ago. They
both contain organic portions called porphyrins. Although our knowledge of the
synthetic pathways in animals is quite extensive, our knowledge of how plants
(and bacteria) make porphyrins is still quite limited. This project focuses on a
very important but difficult to study enzyme of the plant pathway. A new tool
has become available for the study in a herbicide which inhibits the formation
ofchlorophyll. This promises new advances in a somewhat intractable area of
plant biology.
