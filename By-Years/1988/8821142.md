In this project in the Theoretical and Computational Physical Chemistry Program
of the Chemistry Division, Professor Parr will investigate alternative
techniques for treating molecular electronic structure. Density functional
methods will be used to develop new, computationally efficient methods for
calculation of molecular properties and correlation energy. Electronegativity,
hardness and softness, local hardness and softness, and reactivity index are
chemical concepts derivable from density-functional theory to gain more insight
into HSAB theory. The Harris-Pratt-Yang path integral approach to Kohn-Sham
density-functional theory will be developed, as well as ensemble description of
individual molecules. Entropy considerations and information theory will be
used, along with the second order density matrix, wherein the cusp condition is
used to advantage.
