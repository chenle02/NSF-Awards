This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will demonstrate and
test a compact, low cost and ultra-narrow bandwidth ( 0.3A) prototype
holographic grating filter system for solar observing at the UV Ca K line
(3933A). This technique developed during Phase I addresses a key requirement for
narrow bandwidth filters in the UV wavelength because of the difficulties in
fabricating Lyot and similar interference filters with sufficient spectral
resolution and optical quality. During Phase II, suitable recording materials
will be optimized and used to record volume gratings using holography techniques
developed during Phase I. The prototype filter system will be tested at Big Bear
Solar Observatory or other suitable test sites. This Phase II program will
enable sub-Angstrom passband filters to be constructed for field testing and
provide further technical improvement for commercialization of this new
technology. Potential commercial applications of this new technology include
optic receivers for optical remote sensing; pollutant, chemical, metal and
mineral detection; solar-blind filters for free-space optical communications;
high density optical disks and holographic data storage; and UV optical
projection lithography.
