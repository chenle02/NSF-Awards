The sorting of proteins to lysosomes is studied because this is presently the
best understood sorting process. Upon arrival in the Golgi complex, newly
synthesized lysosomal enzymes acquire a mannose 6-phosphate (man6P) moiety that
enables these enzymes to bind to man6P-specific receptors. The man6P receptor-
enzyme complexes are then delivered by transport vesicles to an acidic
prelysosome, where the enzymes are released; the man6P receptors then return to
the Golgi complex for another round of transport. The biochemistry of this
delivery process is being studied by reconstituting the vesicular transport of
the man6P receptor from prelysosomes back to the Golgi complex in a cell free
system. Now the project will define the molecular components that are used by
the cell to form transport vesicles, target them to a specific destination, and
enable them to fuse. Since almost nothing is known about the molecular
components that facilitate intracellular transport, it may be possible to
identify new proteins that mediate this vesicular transport process. To
streamline operations, eukaryotic cells have devised a set of compartments that
carry out specialized tasks, and therefore must be supplied with a unique set of
proteins. The goal of this research is to understand, in molecular terms, how
cells establish and maintain distinct membrane-bound compartments. This will
lead to an understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which proteins are
targetted to specific intracellular estinations.
