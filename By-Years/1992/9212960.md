The Department of Electrical Engineering at the University of Minnesota will
purchase a wavelength tunable sub-picosecond Ti:Sapphire laser system for our
research program in semiconductor nanostructures and ultra-fast devices. The
equipment is critical to more than seven ongoing research projects that are
conducted by four faculty members and nine graduate students in the department.
The projects include, in particular, study and characterization of (1) new
semiconductor nanostructures, (2) band-gap engineering materials, (3) high-speed
(&gt;100 GHz) FETs, (4) tera-hertz metal-semiconductor-metal photodetectors, (5)
tera-hertz planar modulators, and (6) self-electrooptic-effect devices.//
