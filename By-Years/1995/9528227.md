95-28227 Terndrup, Donald Dr. Terndrup's project is a combination of both
observation and theory to discern the relative importance of core/envelope
interactions, disk/envelope locking and angular momentum loss through winds,
which can be disentangled by observations which measure rotation over a large
range of mass and age. The yield should be a large data base on rotation periods
and rotation speeds for low mass stars in several clusters with ages 1-100 Myr.
Measures of Li abundances will also be obtained, as a measure of the amount of
mixing in the outer stellar envelopes and how that mixing depends on rotation.
Theoretically, the project will continue and expand current efforts to include
the effects of disks, winds, and magnetic fields in models of stellar evolution.
