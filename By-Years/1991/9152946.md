The objective of this project is to consolidate the present departmentally
diffused programs in control systems into a common program emphasizing basic
control theory; modeling, simulation and optimization issues; computer-aided
control system design methodology; laboratory techniques; and computer- aided
visualization. In order to accomplish this objective a number of laboratory
experimental stations are developed which directly support the revised
classroom/workstation course materials; characterize typical computer-in-the-
loop control systems design problems a variety of disciplines; can be expanded
and integrated with the full spectrum of control systems design and analysis
tools; introduce the student to modern measurement and actuation techniques; and
are readily modified to respond to the needs and development of future controls
technology.
