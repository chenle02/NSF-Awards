Evidence from young primates indicates that even a brief period of separation
from the mother or other attachment figure can have a number of physiological
consequences for the infant. These effects include increases in sympathetic
activity, changes in neurotransmitter levels, and increased activity of a
neuroendocrine system associated with stress--the pituitary-adrenal system. In
the past, it has been possible to study such questions only in primates because
other commonly studied species (e.g., laboratory rodents) were not thought to
show true infant-mother attachment. With the expense of primate research, the
increasing demand for primate subjects, and the dwindling populations of wild
primates, an alternative animal model would be beneficial. It appears that
guinea pig mothers and infants may display a "true" attachment. Moreover, both
infant and mother guinea pigs exhibit activation of the pituitary-adrenal system
during brief (30 minutes) separation. The studies in the current research will
further explore this question. Several issues will be addressed within this
research, including the ontogeny of the separation response, the effect of
environmental variables in determining responsiveness, and the specificity of
the mother's response to infant separation. These studies will contribute to our
understanding of the consequences of mother-infant separation and the processes
of attachment and elucidate the nature of the stress response in young animals.
