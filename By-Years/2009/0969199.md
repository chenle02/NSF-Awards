This award allows the University of Washington Eot-Wash Group to develop ultra-
sensitive torsion-balance instruments capable of detecting the ultra-weak forces
suggested by modern ideas in theoretical physics, especially attempts to unify
gravity with the other three fundamental forces. In particular, instruments
&lt;br/&gt;will be developed that: &lt;br/&gt;1) probe for ``large'' extra
dimensions by testing Newton's inverse-square law down to length scales
substantially smaller than the diameter of a human hair, &lt;br/&gt;2) test
Einstein's Weak Equivalence Principle with a sensitivity fifty times better than
previously published results, &lt;br/&gt;3) look for quantum gravity effects by
testing Lorentz symmetry or charge-parity (CP) and charge-parity-time (CPT)
violation,&lt;br/&gt;4) search for the force produced by axion-like particles
with masses around 1000 micro-eV, &lt;br/&gt;5) operate at temperatures close to
absolute zero to study factors that limit torsion-balance
sensitivity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Eot-Wash Group has consistently provided
the most precise studies of the broadly interesting issues they investigate.
This required technical innovations that have found applications in other areas
such as ground and space-based gravitational-wave detection. The Group's results
are used by elementary-particle, gravitational and cosmological theorists to
constrain interesting new ideas, are widely disseminated through publications,
review papers, colloquia, invited talks, lab tours and public lectures, and are
featured in magazine and newspaper articles in this country and in Europe. The
variety of scientific issues addressed by the Group and the many experimental
challenges involved provide an excellent education in experimental physics for
graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, as well as unusually attractive
opportunities for undergraduate research projects.
