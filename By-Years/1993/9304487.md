9304487 Markson This project involves investigating use of an electric field
radiosonde (Electrosonde) carried aloft by a weather balloon to measure the
potential of the ionosphere, which the PI postulates is controlled by tropical
temperature. Such data may provide a new way to monitor global temperature and
test numerical models. Each single measurement provides a proxy index of the
integrated temperature and convective activity over the Earth at tropical
latitudes, the region which controls global temperature, the general
circulation, and various other global aspects of the weather. Another advantage
of this technique is that a naturally occurring phenomenon is being observed -
integrated deep tropical convection - vs. existing methods for observing "global
warming" involving thousands of temperature measurements with associated
uncertainties. The results of the Phase I effort were that a reliable electric
field instrument was developed and 31 V1 soundings were obtained. The
temperature - V1 relationship was significant at the 99% confidence level. In
Phase II, 3 widely separated stations will be used for simultaneous measurements
and to sample different air masses. The measurement of air conductivity will be
added to the electrosonde to detect aerosols and radioactive material, each of
which can affect the global atmosphere. ***
