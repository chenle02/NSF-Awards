Late Pleistocene small mammal faunas from North America are used extensively as
proxies for climate changes during the last 20,000 years. The dominant
characteristic regarding these Pleistocene biotas is their high species
diversity, the existence of non-analog communities (disharmonious faunas), and
the individualistic response of species to regional climate change. Because the
concept of disharmonious faunas is critical to modeling climate change and the
development of biotic communities, this hypothesis must be tested quantitatively
---by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) C dating of individual fossil species
that are now allopatric. The goal is to AMS C date 140 fossils from three
stratified caves along an environmental transect: Hall's Cave, Texas; Peccary
Cave, Arkansas; and Baker Bluff Cave, Tennessee. In addition, approximately 20
pairs of disharmonious fossil species from single-component sites will be added
to the data set. The C dates will 1) evaluate if disharmonious assemblages are
natural occurrences, 2) provide chronologies for species migrations and 3) will
improve significantly the chronologies for biotic changes during the past 20,000
years. Ultimately, the C dating will provide quantitative data on background
levels of faunal change-- data presently unavailable to ecologists.
