Representation theory is a branch of algebra studying symmetries, especially
symmetries of linear mathematical structures, using groups of invertible
matrices. In this project the linear structures are themselves finite matrix
groups, or more generally matrix groups whose entries satisfy divisibility
properties with respect to a fixed prime number. Geometrical and combinatorial
techniques will be brought to bear to study representations of these groups,
especially in the important case when the representing matrices themselves have
entries that satisfy divisibility properties.

This research project will advance the representation theory of reductive
algebraic groups. The PI will study questions stemming from a promising new
method using the notion of categorical centers, as well as questions related to
unipotent representations and character sheaves, canonical bases of Hecke
algebras, "almost characters" of p-adic groups, and W-graphs associated to
involutions.
