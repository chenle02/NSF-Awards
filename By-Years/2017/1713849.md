Although genes within living organisms generally interact in mutually beneficial
ways, opportunities also exist for "selfish" conflict between genes, when some
genes direct their own survival, possibly to the exclusion of other genes. This
project will investigate the possibility that such "warfare" between genes in
the nuclear DNA and genes in the separate plastid (chloroplast) DNA is
responsible for very fast evolutionary changes in protein sequences that have
been observed in many groups of flowering plants. The research activities will
provide training opportunities for student and postdoctoral researchers in
advanced techniques in biotechnology and computational genomics. This research
and training will be integrated with educational workshops that will expose
early-stage undergraduates to career opportunities in the field of
bioinformatics. Students will also help organize workshops in Mexico; these
international service-learning experiences will be designed with the goal of
boosting recruitment and retention at the US universities of underrepresented
minority groups in technical and quantitative
disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research project will focus on a protease
enzyme complex (Clp) in plastids that exhibits accelerated evolution and extreme
signatures of positive selection in both plastid- and nuclear-encoded subunits.
Biochemical and phenotypic consequences of changes in protein sequences will be
investigated by modifying the plastid genome in the Nicotiana tabacum model
system. Proteomic techniques will be used to assess assembly of the enzyme
complex and effects of the protease on plastid protein content. Finally,
comparative genomic approaches will be used to analyze correlated rates of
protein sequence evolution to discover previously unrecognized interactions
between plastid and nuclear genes. Collectively, these lines of investigation
will test the hypothesis that antagonistic plastid-nuclear interactions have
driven accelerated evolution of the plastid Clp complex.
