9409209 GORNET For (M,g) a closed Riemannian manifold, denote by spec(M,g) the
collection of eigenvalues with multiplicities of the associated Laplace-Beltrami
operator acting on smooth functions on M. Gornet's research focuses on the
question "What geometric information is contained in the spectrum of a
manifold?" In particular, she has developed a new construction for producing
pairs of isospectral Riemannian nilmanifolds. This construction has produced new
pairs of isospectral manifolds exhibiting many properties not previously found.
Such examples are the only way to discover properties not determined by the
spectrum. Geometric properties Gornet is currently studying include the length
spectrum (the collection of lengths of closed geodesics) and the marked length
spectrum (which also includes information on the free homotopy classes of the
closed geodesics.) Techniques used in Gornet's research come from Riemannian
geometry, representation theory, and Lie groups. Gornet proposes to use the
Research Planning Grant to explore new techniques in representation theory and
in the study of closed geodesics to supplement her current background in
spectral and Riemannian geometry. ***
