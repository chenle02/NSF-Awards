SBR-9520338 Kate A. Berry, Principal Investigator (PI) University of Nevada,
Reno Native Cultures and Water Distribution: A Comparative Analysis of
California, Ecuador and New Mexico This Research Planning Grant for new women
researchers will examine the historic evolution of government policies and
practices that influence the distribution of water to American Indians and will
trace the spatial patterns of water distribution for American Indians from the
onset of Spanish colonization to the present for three regions: coastal
California, sierran Ecuador, and northern New Mexico. The research uses a
comparative analysis to contribute to knowledge of the geographic differences in
actual water distribution practices over a four century period as well as expand
understanding of natural resource use and distribution relations between native
cultures and European migrants.
