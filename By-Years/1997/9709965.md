Dr. Deborah Tahmassebi, Department of Chemistry, University of San Diego is
supported by the Organic and Macromolecular Program of the Chemistry Division
under a Research Planning Grant to explore the synthesis of new pyrene-based
fluorescent DNA base analogues. Commercially available, fluorescent pyrene based
aromatics will be halogenated, converted to the corresponding Grignard reagent,
and reacted with cadmium chloride to afford the organocadmium derivative.
1(alpha)-chloro-2-deoxy-D-ribofuranosyl bis(p-toluate) will be synthesized from
commercially available 2-deoxy-d-ribose and reacted with the organocadmium
derivative to achieve the desired fluorescent nucleoside. By eliminating the
flexible hydrocarbon link to the lumiphore, this methodology removes the
ambiguity inherent in currently available probes. The spectroscopic properties
of the fluorescent nucleoside will be established and compared to those of the
nucleoside incorporated into DNA to probe the micro-structure and -environment
of the nucleic acid in solution. Given the interest in determining the solution
phase structure of DNA, a Research Planning Grant at this point in Dr.
Tahmassebi's career will provide the basis for a competitive NSF proposal.
Molecular structure is a significant determinant of the properties of a
molecule. Large biopolymers, such as DNA, possess flexible structures that
assume different configurations, and hence different properties in fluid
solution. The synthetic methodology developed here will afford a series of
fluorescent nucleosides that can be incorporated into DNA. The fluorescence of
the incorporated molecules is then used as a spectroscopic probe of the dynamics
of duplex DNA formation and the structure of the biopolymer in fluid solution.
