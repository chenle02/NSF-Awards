This award will fund a combined observational and theoretical study of luminous
blue variables, which are massive stars experiencing strong mass loss and
evolving to be red supergiants. They are widely believed to the progenitors of
core-collapse supernovae, but many of these may not explode if the mass lost
during their lifetimes is high enough. This team will conduct long-term
observations of these variables in several nearby galaxies, in order to get an
improved census of these objects, elucidate the mechanisms that may be
responsible for giant eruptions, and to better understand the mechanism of mass
loss and how stars evolve as they experience episodic (rather than steady) mass
loss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modern supernova surveys are finding a number objects
in nearby galaxies which are not true supernovae, the "supernova impostors,"
which may be objects like eta Carinae that shed 10-20 times the mass of our Sun
in a few years. The final stages of these most massive stars are important for a
valid picture of stellar astrophysics and they are increasingly significant in
cosmology. They are the likely progenitors of Gamma Ray Bursters used as
cosmological probes, and many of the first stars in the universe are thought to
have been very massive.
