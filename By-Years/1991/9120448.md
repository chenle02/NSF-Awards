Spectral numerical modeling is to be carried out to simulate
magnetohydrodynamic flows of electrically conducting liquid. The regime to be
studied is for intermediate strengh magnetic fields, neither so strong as to
suppress inertia effects nor so weak as to modify flows only slightly. The
analysis will be applied to crystal growth configurations with transverse
magnetic fields. The configurations to be modeled has the potential for
achieving greater uniformity in crystals grown for various semiconductor
applications. Results will have utility in defining optimum growth conditions.
