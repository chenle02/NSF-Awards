Algebraic Geometry is the study of systems of polynomial equations. As such, it
has broad applications not only within mathematics but also in many fields of
science from medicine to physics. The subject has developed for over 200 years,
but there are many fresh problems and new directions. Commutative algebra is a
subject that lies at the intersection of algebraic geometry and number theory.
Since the advent of powerful and easily available computing resources, the
possibilities for experimentation within commutative algebra, algebraic
geometry, and their applications has multiplied. A byproduct of this project
will be the further development of these computational tools. Cohen-Macaulay
modules and sheaves play a role in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry
that is a natural analogue of the role of finite dimensional representations in
the case of finite dimensional algebras. The Principal Investigator will work on
projects in commutative algebra, algebraic geometry, and computational methods
that center around the theory of Cohen-Macaulay modules over particularly
interesting classes of varieties: Toric varieties, complete intersections, and
residual intersections. The PI will also continue to train graduate students in
related research fields and actively be involved in several highly recognized
outreach activities.

The Principal Investigator will work on Ulrich modules and Clifford Algebras.
Cohen-Macaulay and Ulrich modules over quadratic hypersurfaces are well-
understood from work of Knoerrer (over algebraically closed fields) and
Buchweitz-Eisenbud-Schreyer over arbitrary fields. The PI will investigate
deeper questions about Ulrich modules and other maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules
on complete intersections of two quadrics using Clifford algebra techniques,
extending Miles Reid's thesis, and making explicit work of Bondal-Orlov and
Kapranov, as well as the theory of maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules over complete
intersections developed by the proposer with Irena Peeva. Finally the PI will
work on the cohomology of sheaves on toric varieties, extending techniques from
exterior algebra algebras introduced in joint work with Daniel Erman and Frank-
Olaf Schreyer for cohomology of sheaves on projective space and successfully
extended to products of projective space to all toric varieties.
