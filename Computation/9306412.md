9306412 Dieci Luca Dieci will work in the area of computational equations. The
PI and his collaborators will undertake several projects, centered around the
following two: (1). Numerical Solution of Matrix Differential Equations; (2).
Numerical Approximation of Invariant Tori. More in particular, Luca Dieci
expects to continue working on differential Riccati equations (DREs) and on
applications related to these equations. Algorithmical and theoretical work is
specifically planned for the numerical solution of symmetric DREs, a common
occurrence in Engineering applications. The main effort here will be in studying
stable indirect solution strategies for the DREs, rather than direct
discretizations. Luca Dieci intends also to continue studying numerical
questions connected to the integration of matrix equations whose solution is a
unitary matrix. He plans to devote time and resources to the approximation of
Lyapunov exponents, an issue which provided the motivation for studying matrix
equations with a unitary solution. Finally, he intends to continue the work on
approximation of invariant tori dynamical systems. In particular, he expects to
extend and improve upon the previously studied PdE approach. Here, the main
directions of research will involve theoretical and practical study in order to
complete the approximation theory for the nonlinear case, and in order to free
the numerical procedures from the explicit knowledge of a coordinate system in
which to parametrize the tori. The main plan consists in using the continuous
theory of Fenichel and in making it into a numerical procedure, and in carefully
studying the associated implementation details. The above projects have a strong
computational component and aim at developing reliable and rigorously justified
algorithms for important problems in computational ODEs. ***
