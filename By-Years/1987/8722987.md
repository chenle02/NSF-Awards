Description: This is an award to extend the study of the geochemistry of an
estuary in Malaysia to the major river of Burma, the Irrawaddy. Dr. Bruce Nelson
of the University of Virginia will first conduct a pilot study on one of its
tributaries, the Rangoon River, including salinity and suspended sediments
during the monsoon and post-monsoon periods. The physical measurements will
combine chemical studies with hydrographic and sediment transport measurements.
The Burma Ports Corporation will provide boat transport for field research, and
a shore laboratory for sample preparation and simple analyses. Most analyses
will be conducted at the University of Virginia, in the trace element
laboratories, with a range of instruments. Scope: Geochemical calculations are a
significant part of the scientific basis for a program of marine pollution
monitoring. The United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) and the
Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) have emphasized the importance
of fundamental understanding of river inputs to the sea. There are few studies
in tropical estuarine systems. Their work on small Malaysian rivers shows that
there is a store of fundamental information to be gleaned from a careful study
of tropical estuaries. This research can also be applied to practical
development needs, by providing information on harbor siltation. It is
recommended under the Science in Developing Countries Program.
