This project focuses on learning expectations of market participants about
probability distributions of future asset returns from the current prices of
options on those assets combined with assumptions and historical data about the
underlying risk-return trade-offs in the economy. Risk assessments are based on
historical data. The limitation of the historical approach is in potentially
underestimating the probability of events that did not occur in the historical
data under consideration. The goal of this research is to improve probability
models of markets by developing theory and methods for calibrating them to
additional sources of information in addition to historical data. This will help
put risk management and investment decision making on a more solid foundation
and will aid the financial services industry and market regulators in extracting
implied probability distributions from market prices of options to improve risk
management. The project is interdisciplinary, drawing on the fields of
operations research, economics, probability theory and mathematical analysis and
will have a positive impact on education and human resources
development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The methodology is based on far-reaching
extensions of the recent Recovery Theorem of Ross that shows that when all
uncertainty (risk) in the economy is modeled as a discrete-time irreducible
finite-state Markov chain and the stochastic discount factor is transition
independent, then there exists a unique recovery of the Markov chain's
transition probability matrix from options prices. We aim to extend the recovery
methodology to general classes of continuous-time Markov processes, including
diffusions and jump-diffusions. On the other hand, we aim to relax the
transition independence assumption by building on the fundamental work of Hansen
and Scheinkman on long term risk. Our approach aims to combine structural
assumptions on the stochastic discount factor drawn from the macro-finance
literature with the joint calibration of the resulting models to currently
observed market options prices together with historical time series data on the
underlying asset returns. This will involve analytical development of the
spectral theory for Markov processes and computational implementations of
recoveries in specific classes of models.
