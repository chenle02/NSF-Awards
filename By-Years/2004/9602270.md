The Department of Biology at the University of New Mexico is on the threshold
of an historic advancement in the development of scientific team-approaches to
multi-disciplinary, complex biological problems. Over the last decade, faculty
researchers have developed strategies to address complicated environmental and
biological problems at local, regional, and national levels. Having fostered an
atmosphere for collaborative studies, as evidenced by the successes of the
Sevilleta Long-Term Ecological Research Program (LTER), and the Museum of
Southwestern Biology (MSB), the dispersal of researchers and students over three
buildings has prevented the Department from benefiting from new advances. The
National Science Foundation and the University of New Mexico will establish a
partnership to provide a state-of-the-art research center in ecology, evolution
and systematics. Funds from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program and the
State will be used to renovate space needed to create a multi-disciplinary
program that consolidates the specimen-based research materials of the MSB with
the ecologically based data of the LTER program. In conjunction to providing the
necessary infrastructure, the facility will conform to ADA, fire and OSHA
standards. A freezer room, fume hoods, and cabinetry will be installed in the
renovated laboratories. Upon completion, the renovated facility will merge
programs within a single building, thus raising the capabilities of the biology
research group to a level that will permit and promote highly sophisticated,
integrated analyses of complex problems by collaborating teams of scientists.
The facility will be a major asset to the department's research training
programs, which includes an NSF Research Training Grant in Ecological
Complexity, a Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site Program, and an
Undergraduate Mentorships in Environmental Biology Program for minority
students.
