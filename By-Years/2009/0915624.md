This research will explore a specific marginalized population--the urban
homeless in the U.S.--as a lens through which to pursue both a broadening of the
methodological repertoire of Human-Computer Interaction as well as specific
technological innovations aimed at overcoming aspects of the digital divide in a
community. This research will provide a source of primary empirical data through
ethnographic inquiry focusing on both the urban homeless and the social service
networks that support them; this empirical dataset will be used to drive the
creation, deployment, and evaluation of a series of technological interventions
that leverage mobile technologies for collaboration between services and their
homeless clients, personalized information delivery, and user-generated content
creation and dissemination.

Research in human-computer interaction has long focused on "environments of
plenty" such as workplaces with dedicated networks and computers, and trained
support staff to ensure that everything works as intended. Recent work, however,
has pointed out the degree to which focusing outside this narrow slice can
result in innovative technology that is more broadly useful. This research
project will substantially contribute to this thread of work by exploring the
challenges and opportunities for technological intervention in a community
outside the "environment of plenty": focusing upon the urban homeless in the
U.S. This research will provide important data about the opportunities for
technology use among the homeless and those who work with them; it will also
lead to the creation of new technology and services to support mobile phone-
based information delivery. This research will further broaden our understanding
of the role computing can play in under-served communities.
