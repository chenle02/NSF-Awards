This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a method
to lower the practical quantitation level of arsenic using a novel instrumental
improvement to existing Inductively Coupled Plasma - Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS)
and Atomic Emission Spectrometry (AES) techniques. by replacing the standard
sample introduction nebulizer and spray chamber used in ICP-MS and ICP-AES with
the Nanomiser. device and thus lower the detection limit of arsenic and other
elements. The Nanomiser enables very fine atomization of solvent/analyte
mixtures with exceptional control over size, while maintaining a narrow size
distribution. Results to date show that this breakthrough technology leads to
the generation of a monodisperse aerosol with a mean diameter in the sub-micron
to micron-range. Furthermore, this technology provides high residence time (due
to low and independently controlled carrier gas velocity), which is, together
with the small particle size, one of the main requirements for adequate thermal
evaporation and dissociation of aerosol particles. The independence of gas flow
and atomization will help to significantly increase the ionization of elements
with higher first ionization energies, such as arsenic, by allowing for longer
residence time in the plasma. The development of a reliable sample introduction
technology can significantly improve the detection limits of conventional
systems for atomic spectroscopy. Furthermore, the small size and compact design
of the Nanomiser device will allow this technology to be easily retrofitted into
existing AES and MS systems in collaboration with major instrument
manufacturers.
