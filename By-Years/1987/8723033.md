Professor Hohenemser will examine the effects of non-trivial randomness, finite
size dynamics, and the role of magnetism in high temperature oxide
superconductors as parts of the research on novel forms of magnetic order. The
Mossbauer spectroscopy and perturbed angular correlations of gamma rays are
techniques where the investigator has shown their usefulness to study magnetic
order and which can be complementary to inelastic scattering. Specifically the
research will include: 1) measurements to fit the random field Ising model in
Fe1-xZnxF2 below Tc; 2) magnetic order for competing random anisotropy
interactions in rare-earth intermetallic compounds; 3) finite size dynamics in
graphite intercalated magnetic compounds and; 4) magnetic order in La2 La2CuO4-x
and related compounds. xxx
