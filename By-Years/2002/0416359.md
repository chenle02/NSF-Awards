This research program focuses on the development of versatile methods for the
preparation of well-defined polymer bioconjugates by conjugating activated
homogeneous polymers to biomolecules and initiating controlled polymerization
from proteins in aqueous solution. New bifunctional initiators for atom transfer
radical polymerization will be used to prepare monodisperse polymers that react
with specific protein residues, and controlled polymerization initiated by
modified proteins in aqueous solution will generate bioconjugates in situ.

With the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor
Heather D. Maynard, of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the
University of California, Los Angeles, is developing new methods to prepare
couple conventional polymers with polypeptides (proteins). Material properties
and applications of such protein-polymer "conjugates" in nanostructured
materials, drug delivery, smart materials, and therapeutics are critically
dependent on having well-defined polymers and specific points of attachment, yet
these are extremely difficult to achieve by conventional means. Professor
Maynard's research targets the development of novel new approaches for the
synthesis of such structurally and functionally well-defined conjugates.
