The overall objective of this project is to develop a model system for the
study of the mechanism by which egg associated factors modulate sperm cell
function and, potentially, regulate fertilization. Speract, a peptide isolated
from the jelly coat which surrounds the egg of the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus
purpuratus, binds to specific receptors on the plasma membrane of homologous
sperm cells and initiates changes in sperm cell behavior and metabolism.
Previously, Dr. Dangott identified and purified a 77,000 Mr glycoprotein as the
speract receptor. A full length cDNA clone has been isolated which codes for the
receptor protein. Using antibodies, nucleic acid probes and recombinant speract
receptor proteins now available in his laboratory and others to be prepared, he
proposes 1) to express recombinant speract receptors in heterologous cells in
order to test and analyze the protein's function as a peptide receptor and
signal transducer, 2) recombinant chimeric receptor proteins will be engineered
and expressed by standard molecular biological techniques in order to
characterize the structural basis for the receptor's peptide binding specificity
and interaction with putative components of the signalling system, 3) prepare
polyclonal antibodies to the speract receptor in rabbits that will be used to
purify the receptor from sperm plasma membranes, and 4) proteins associated with
the receptor will be identified, purified and primary amino acid sequence
determined. The proteins will be characterized for any biochemical activities
and evaluated for any role in possible signal transduction pathways.
