The psychology students will be provided with exposure to a variety of basic
scientific laboratory situations involved in the experimental study of behavior.
A computerized biofeedback system designed to measure human physiological
responses (skin resistance, muscle activity, heart rate and brain waves) is
providing students with the opportunity to study experimentally and clinically
significant phenomena such as conditioning, emotionality, stress, anxiety and
the effects of theraputic interventions such as biofeedback. Additionally, four
custom circuit cards, complete with interface relays and switches, are being
used in conjunction with the microcomputers and other hardware. The devices are
designed specifically for the psychology laboratory and are facilitating the
integration of the microcomputers into the undergraduate laboratory courses.
Such integration provides students with first hand experience in using computers
to control experiments and record and store data. The equipment is also being
used in support of undergraduate student research projects.
