The principal investigators will study minerals and mineral stabilities in the
chemical system iron oxide-titanium oxide- alumina-silica-water. In particular,
the thermochemical and mixing properties of Fe-staurolite, the stability of Fe-
cordierite, and the hematite-ilmenite solvus will be investigated. The
staurolite and cordierite results should yield geothermobarometers useful in the
study of pelitic rock metamorphism. The hematite-ilmenite work will allow
estimates of oxygen fugacity and hence water fraction of fluids in graphitic
pelites. It may also allow estimation of oxygen fugacity for rocks in which
hemoilmenite occurs. Overall, this research will allow geologists to better
estimate the conditions to which aluminous rocks have been subjected during
metamorphism.
