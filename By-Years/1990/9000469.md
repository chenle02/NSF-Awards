Stong will continue his study of applications of elliptic curves and elliptic
function theory in algebraic topology, a joint project with Peter S. Landweber
(Rutgers University). A new family of periodic cohomology theories has been
shown to exist, whose coefficient rings are rings of modular functions for the
well-known theta group. The main problem is to determine the intrinsic geometric
nature of these cohomology theories; this appears to be very difficult, and at
present a number of leads that appear promising are being explored. A prominent
role in this study is played by the formal groups of Jacobi quartics and the
Legendre polynomials which enter as coefficients of the invariant differential.
Theoretical physics will probably be the first area outside the mathematical
sciences to benefit from the study of these rich structures.
