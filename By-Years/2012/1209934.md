This action funds Nicholas Cornell of University of Texas at Dallas to conduct a
research project, entitled "Investigating superconductors with coexisting
ferromagnetism," during the summer of 2012 at Zhejiang University in Hangzhou.
The host scientist is Huiqiu Yuan.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to better understand the
interactions of coexisting phases in a class of iron based superconductors
called pnictides. This includes synthesizing new materials of different
compositions, measuring them, and making adjustments with the goal of improving
their critical temperature and allowing them to withstand stronger magnetic
fields while remaining superconducting. Increased magnetic field tolerance would
increase their industrial applications and allow them to operate in more
environments.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
