This project will develop new methods to mitigate adverse human health impacts
from power sector emissions through the targeted use of grid-connected energy
storage. Energy storage devices, such as batteries or pumped storage hydropower,
can shift both the time and location of power sector emissions based on their
charging and discharging strategies. The overall human health impacts of
criteria pollutants such as sulfur dioxide (SO2) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx)
are closely related to the both temporal and spatial distribution of emissions.
The overarching research question that will be addressed is: Can operational
strategies for grid-connected energy storage yield cost-effective reductions in
the human health impacts associated with power sector
emissions?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To answer this question, the research team will
develop a unit commitment and economic dispatch model with energy storage to
determine optimal power system operations and provide unit-level SO2 and NOx
emissions. A state-of-the-science air pollution chemical transport model and
sensitivity analysis technique will be used to provide spatially- and
temporally-resolved PM2.5 and O3 concentrations stemming from power plant and
energy storage dispatch decisions. Human health damage cost estimates will
determine the health response from changes in exposure to these secondary
pollutants, coupling those results with the value of a statistical life and
determine the unit-level marginal health damage costs associated with the
primary emissions. Those costs then serve as inputs into the power system model
to allow real-time decision making, effectively internalizing the externality
costs of the emissions and yielding the optimal charge/discharge behavior of the
energy storage to cost-effectively reduce human health
impacts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
