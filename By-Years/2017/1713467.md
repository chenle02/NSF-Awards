By combining ground-based optical and near-infrared data of type Ia supernovae
with UV data from NASA's Swift satellite, the research team will check the
intrinsic brightness of nearby supernovae after accounting for a newly
discovered sub-grouping of type Ia supernovae. This information will be used to
verify the distances to faraway galaxies and thus the amount of acceleration of
the expansion of the Universe. This will test the amount of dark energy inferred
by that acceleration. New observations of supernovae will be distributed to the
public via a Twitter feed, and the PI will produce teaching modules for middle
school and high school that include exciting concepts from this
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key to this project is to revisit the methods
employed to determine the line-of-sight dust extinction to each supernova and
the absolute magnitude of each supernova, this time with an emphasis on near-UV
versus optical region bi-modality. Techniques that avoid using colors to
estimate extinction are emphasized as the fundamental finding is a color
difference between the two groups. These findings will then contribute to a
better theoretical understanding of supernova explosion physics.
