In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry
Division, Vaccaro will study the spectroscopy, relaxation, and chemical
reactivity of rovibrationally excited polyatomic molecules as a function of both
the magnitude and type of excitation of the molecular framework. The first
state-to-state measurements of polyatomic reaction dynamics will be performed.
Novel multiple-resonance laser techniques will be used to prepare molecules in
specific rotation-vibration states. %%% Studies of the reactivity of polyatomic
molecules which contain chemically significant quantities of energy of
excitation are important because of the information they can reveal about
aeronomic and combustion-related processes. On a fundamental scientific level,
these transient species can reveal much regarding the nature and origin of such
phenomena as mode- or bond-specific chemistry and quantum chaos.
