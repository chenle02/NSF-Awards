The College of Oceanography at Texas A&amp;M University will acquire several
items of oceanographic instrumentation to be placed in a pool of shared use
equipment. This equipment is maintained for use on or in association with the
R/V GYRE, a research vessel operated by the University. A substantial part of
the ship's operating schedule during 1989 is in support of NSF-sponsored
research projects. The instrumentation will also increase the capabilities of
the ship and of the institution to support research and engineering activities.
The instrumentation includes: -Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler for making
continuous measurements of subsurface circulation features, and a
-Transmissometer for measuring chlorophyll concentration and other optical
properties in the water column. The instrumentation described above will
increase the capability of the organization to support NSF-sponsored research
and engineering projects.
