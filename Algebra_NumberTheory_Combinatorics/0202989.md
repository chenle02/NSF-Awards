The investigator proposes to study arithmetic questions arising in the theory of
automorphic forms and linear algebraic groups, especially in the context of the
Langlands program. As an example, it is well-known that a wealth of arithmetic
information is contained in the Fourier coefficients of a classical modular form
on the upper half plane. The investigator has an ongoing project (with B. Gross
and G. Savin) to develope a theory of Fourier coefficients for certain modular
forms on the exceptional group G2 and to extract arithmetic information from
these coefficients. The investigator is also interested in constructing and
classifying arithmetically interesting cusp forms on reductive groups, and
relating them to certain influential conjectures of Arthur. He intends to
exploit the exceptional theta correspondence for the construction of some of
these cusp forms.

The theory of automorphic forms is one of the main themes of modern mathematical
research. Besides being a beautiful subject in its own right, it is intimately
connected with other important areas of mathematics such as number theory (the
study of properties of numbers, with applications to cryptography) and
representation theory (the study of symmetries, with applications to physics).
Often, it has surprising applications to concrete problems, such as the
construction of Ramanujan graphs which are of great interest in communication
and network theory. Particularly important and elusive in the theory of
automrophic forms are certain primitive objects known as cusp forms. The
investigator hopes to further our understanding of these basic objects by giving
explicit constructions of some of them.
