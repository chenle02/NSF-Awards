This project provides students in Electron Microscopy and Computer Science
exposure to the use of microcomputers and array processors as a modern means of
data collection and mathematical manipulation of data in the context of image
processing. The use of a microcomputer interfaced to the scanning electron
microscope (SEM) extends the instructional capabilities of the instrument and
exposes the students to computers in new scientific applications. Microcomputers
interfaced to a computer with an array processor allow the use of fast fourier
transform (FFT) processing of images obtained from the SEM. Student instruction
is enhanced by the extended capabililties of the instrument: increased
resolution, improved signal-to-noise ratio, and operation at low beam currents.
The grantee provides funds for this project that are an equal match for the NSF
award.
