Boston University is being supported to establish a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) SITE. The purpose of this SITE is to provide meaningful
hands-on research opportunities in contemporary chemistry for outstanding
undergraduate students under the supervision of experienced research chemists.
The program will support 8 students for the summer of 1987, of which almost half
will be recruited from other institutions. Research activities will include the
following: o X-ray Diffraction Studies of Metal-Amino Acid Complexes o Mechanism
of DNA Template Inactivation by Chemotherapeutic Agents o Photochemical Electron
Transfer Involving Biopolymers o Synthesis of Carbapenem Antibiotics
