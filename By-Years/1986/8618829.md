The proposed continuation of studies of the three-dimensional structure of the
mantle expoit the large data sets created under previous funding, and the
inversion techniques which have been developed, to recover more complete
information on mantle heterogeneity and to quantify the uncertainty of the
resulting models. It is proposed to study the P-wave heterogeneity of the upper
mantle, to assess the requirement for anisotropy and to implement a number of
extensions and enhancements of present techniques aimed at increasing the
information which can be extracted from the data.
