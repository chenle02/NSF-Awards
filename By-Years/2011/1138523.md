SEES Workshop: Natural and Engineered Carbon Sequestration&lt;br/&gt;Bradley
Sageman, Northwestern
University&lt;br/&gt;EAR-1138523&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt; The Science,
Engineering, and Education for Sustainability (SEES) investment area was
established in FY 2010 in an effort address challenges in climate and energy
research and education. The initial RFP encouraged near term activities, such as
interdisciplinary workshops, that would help inform the development of SEES
activities. This proposal outlines a plan to hold a workshop in association with
the 2011 Annual meeting of Geological Society of America in Minneapolis, MN. The
objective of this workshop is a community-wide gathering of researchers whose
work relates to the natural and engineered components of the global carbon
cycle. Given that observational evidence and model predictions suggest that
significant global warming is already underway, and the prospect of widespread
conversion to low- or no-carbon energy sources is likely many decades in the
future, mitigation of greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere is a major
priority. The development of effective and safe engineered carbon sequestration
carries one set of research challenges. Progress in such areas should be matched
by improved understanding of natural carbon sequestration processes, largely
derived from research on ancient episodes of major perturbation of the carbon
cycle (e.g., PETM). The workshop will draw broadly on different research
communities in an effort to highlight leading problems and approaches, focus
collaborative efforts, germinate proposal concepts, and provide a summary of the
major research efforts that are already underway, as well as those that should
be initiated.
