9355683 Cristini Ramapo College of New Jersey Revitalizing Science Teaching
Using Remote Sensing Technologies (RST)2 This project works with 180 teachers
and 30 supervisors from 90 schools in the New York, New Jersey area on
incorporating remote sensing data and techniques into their science classrooms.
The classes targeted are grades 4-5 and most topics specifically relate to earth
science. Teachers receive instruction in the science and mathematics content
needed to use real and timely data and to analyze images. The approach includes
collegial teams with shared tasks. Communication among the teachers is
encouraged and teachers share their work and resources over the Internet. Cost
sharing is estimated at 13%. ***
