Chemistry (12) This project's primary goal is to improve our undergraduate
curriculum in NMR spectroscopy by providing students with hands-on use of a
modern Fourier-transform Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (FT-NMR) Spectrometer. With
the upgrade of our continuous wave (CW) spectrometer by Anasazi Instruments,
chemistry students at Roosevelt University have early and frequent access to a
FT-NMR with multinuclear capabilities. Faculty at nearby high schools and
community colleges also visit the campus and have access to the instrument for
their own courses and students. FT-NMR experiments are being integrated into
undergraduate service courses. Students are introduced to 13 C-NMR early in
general chemistry, leading into more detailed applications of NMR in the organic
chemistry sequence. Advanced FT-NMR techniques including correlation experiments
and spin-lattice relaxation measurements are being adapted into upper-level
courses and undergraduate research. This project impacts many underrepresented
students in terms of gender, ethnicity, and class and thereby better prepares
them for scientific employment and graduate and professional studies. It also
fosters pedagogical collaboration between an undergraduate institution and
nearby community colleges and high schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
