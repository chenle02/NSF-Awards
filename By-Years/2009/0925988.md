&lt;br/&gt;"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment
Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this
research is to fill the technological "gap" at the THz spectral region, by
developing the first generation of THz graphene-based photodetectors with
exceptional sensitivity, dynamic range, response rate and non-cryogenic
operating temperatures. The approach is based on monitoring conductance change
induced by THz radiation in graphene in quantum Hall states, and/or in double
quantum dot single electron transistors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual
Merit&lt;br/&gt;This research exploits graphene's exceptional electronic
mobility, long ballistic length and unique relativistic band structure, which
could enable new detectors of THz radiation. Graphene THz detectors will be
explored as functions of bias, device geometry, temperature, charge carrier
density and magnetic field, for evaluation of crucial device parameters such as
operating temperatures, selectivity, tunability, sensitivity, and noise levels.
The long-term goal of this research is the development of THz imaging systems at
non-cryogenic temperatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impact&lt;br/&gt;Successful implementation of this research program will provide
significant advancement to fill the technology "gap" at the THz region, which
has vast application potential ranging from semiconductor industry, biomedical
research, space exploration to tools for study of fundamental processes in
materials. The program also provides an ideal platform to integrate physics
education and outreach with research efforts, by involving high school,
undergraduate and graduate students, by encouraging participation of women and
underrepresented minority students, and by outreach to local communities with
ethnically diverse populations.
