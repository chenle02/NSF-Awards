The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development of a technology that has potential applications in integrated
circuits for the internet of things (IoT) as well as for military use. The
applictions seeks to enable the design of a full radiofrequency transceiver (or
components) that can be tuned across a wide frequency range to meet multiple
wireless standards with a single reconfigurable design. This transceiver has the
potential to reduce costs and increase markets. The proposed commercialization
effort represents an opportunity to increase the reach of wireless technologies
broadly while bolstering US growth in this crucial
area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the development of a
widely tunable and reconfigurable “on-chip” radio integrated circuit. The
innovation that makes this possible is a novel tunable resonant element that can
be fabricated on-chip. Wideband radio components that can accommodate a range of
carrier frequencies do not enable high performance since they sacrifice gain,
sensitivity, linearity, noise, and power efficiency to achieve functionality.
Existing tunable narrowband solutions make similar tradeoffs due to the lack of
a tunable inductive element that can be easily and cheaply integrated into a
commercial process. The proposed technology may be used to construct tunable
amplifiers, oscillators, and other basic analog components that are used in
commercial radios. This team proposes to explore the market for reconfigurable
radio frequency integrated circuits while developing a prototype system
demonstrator for a full transceiver.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
