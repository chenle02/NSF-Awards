This award from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program
is in the area of organometallic chemistry. The focus of the project is the
mechanisms of reactions of new compounds in which two iron atoms are held
together by a hydrocarbon bridge. Such compounds are important reagents for the
synthesis of a wide variety of organic compounds, and information about their
reaction mechanisms is expected to lead to improvements in synthetic
methodology. The reactivity of new diiron compounds with bridging hydrocarbon
ligands will be explored, and the mechanisms of new reactions of these compounds
will be explored in depth. It is anticipated that this study will lead to
several new carbon-carbon bond forming reactions of potential use in organic
synthesis. In order for this synthetic potential to be realized, ways of
cleaving the bridging hydrocarbyl group from the diiron complex will be
explored. The mechanism of cyclopropane formation in the reactions of metal-
carbene complexes with alkenes will be studied, and an attempt will be made to
generate the suggested intermediates in cycloproponation reactions to see if
they lead to cyclopropanes. The reactions of metal carbene complexes which are
neither strong nucleophiles nor strong electrophiles will be explored to fill an
important gap in the understanding of metal-carbene complexes.
