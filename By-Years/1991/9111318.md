The aim of this research is to understand the flow mechanism of microphase-
separated block copolymers in the strong-segregation limit (SSL). Microphase-
separated block copolymers are chemically composite materials which play a
prominant role in the formulation of many advanced materials. New material
design requires an in- depth understanding of the physics of the component
materials and of the interaction of their physics with processing. The research
focusses on three tasks: First, they intend to observe directly the flow
morphology of block copolymers in the SSL using small-angle neutron scattering.
Second, they will do a comprehensive comparison between the rheological
properties of samples with macroscopically ordered mesophases versus isotropic
materials. Third, they will elucidate the impact of mesophase shape on linear-
viscoelastic properties. Since microphase- separated block copolymers are very
much like well-mixed incompatible polymer blends, the experiments performed will
also bear on general questions in polymer thermodynamics, such as whether
shearing a binary mixture can affect its phase diagram.
