This project uses an innovative approach to upgrade the welding curriculum by
offering a new course teaching the principles and application of robotic welding
and by introducing the latest welding technology through a multidisciplinary
team approach, simulating an industrial automated production environment.
Students, using a robotic system, synthesize conventional welding theory and
skills training with automated application. The robot, indexing fixture, and
power sources, when integrated are capable of replicating the automated
production welding processes found in industry. The final project exposes
students from welding, machine tool, computer-assisted design, automated
manufacturing, computer-integrated manufacturing, and mechanical engineering
technology programs to a realistic manufacturing exercise. Students use
knowledge gained from their curricula as they work together in teams
(manufacturing units) to develop and manufacture a product (project). A project
of this magnitude, involving teamwork, electronic communication, planning, and
problem-solving is invaluable to students entering an industrial/manufacturing
environment.
