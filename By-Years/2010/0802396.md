The project is developing and implementing a Nanotechnology Technician Education
degree program by adapting existing curricula and developing new curricula. The
program is a third degree track in the college's Advanced Manufacturing
Technology degree program (the other two tracks are Manufacturing Engineering
Technology and Polymer Manufacturing Technology). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new
degree option is strongly supported by regional organizations and industry. The
42 project partners include 29 industry partners who are supporting curriculum
development and/or are providing internship and employment opportunities for
students. In addition to developing new curricula for this program, the college
is adapting elements of a nanotechnology undergraduate program developed by
project partner University of Virginia, which is also providing training
equipment and curriculum development support. The primary audience for the new
program is graduating high school seniors, as well as local adult workers who
are seeking career re-training due to loss of a great number of the region's
traditional jobs in textiles manufacturing and tobacco.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Nanotechnology Education degree program is being
managed by Danville Community College's Workforce Services and housed in its
Regional Center for Advanced Technology and Training, a new 24,000-square-foot
high-tech facility designed to support high-level scientific training programs
such as nanotechnology education.
