This is an award under the Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER). It is
a study of newspaper coverage of public protest during a democratic transition
in Belarus. Belarus has begun to allow public demonstrations of protest and the
government now issues permits for peaceful demonstrations. The study has the
quality of a natural experiment, in which the researchers will be able to obtain
data both before and after the permitting system. The study will contribute to
theories about the relation among protest, media coverage, and state activity
and about the process of democratization. Analysis is based on a systematic
review of police records and major newspapers from 1988 to 1995. %%% This
research will contribute to a sociological understanding of the efforts to
control violent conflict through government permits allowing peaceful
demonstrations and of newspaper bias in how such demonstations are reported. An
examination of these events in Belarus will demonstrate the conditions that
contribute to the development of democratic institutions. In addition to the
scientific gains from this research, it will develop scientific ties with
researchers in Belarus.
