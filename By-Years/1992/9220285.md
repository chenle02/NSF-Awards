This U.S.-Poland Research project between Drs. Wojbor A. Woyczynski and Robert
Simha of the Center of Stochastic and Chaotic Processes in Science & Technology
and the Departments of Mathematics and Statistics and Macromolecular Science at
Case Western Reserve, and Professors Alexsander E. Weron, K. Weron, and A.
Janicki of the H. Steinhaus Center for Stochastic Processes in Science &
Technology, Wroclaw Technical University, is on "Stochastic Models of Relaxation
Phenomena in Polymers and Dielectrics." The researchers will pursue four lines
of research: (1) Probabilistic methods in the statistical mechanics of systems
occurring in surface chemistry; (2) Random graph and statistical mechanical
models of polymerization; (3) Foundational problems related to the theory of
stochastic integration; and (4) Roughness of surfaces (a topic which keeps
cropping up in a huge variety of scientific problems from surface chemistry and
the theory of liquid crystals, to analysis of oceanic flows over bottoms with
rough topography). This project in mathematics and statistics fulfills the
program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts
in Poland and the United States to combine complementary talents and pool
resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
