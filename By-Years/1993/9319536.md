9319536 Simasko The objectives of this project are to biophysically characterize
a background conductance in pituitary cells and to determine the physiological
role of this conductance. The investigators believe this background conductance
(Na+ selective or non- selective cation) provides the depolarizing drive
necessary for activation of voltage-dependent calcium channels. Activation of
voltage-dependent channels leads to a calcium influx which in turn stimulates
hormone secretion. The investigators plan to characterize the conductance by
patch clamp electrophysiological techniques. The role of the conductance in
cytoplasmic calcium regulation will be determined by single-cell Ca2+
measurements using the fluorescent calcium indicator fura2. The role of this
conductance in regulation of secretion will be determine din single cells by
membrane capacitive measurements and by reverse- hemolytic plaque assays. If
this conductance is found to have the physiological function hypothesized by the
investigators, it will be an important step in understanding how hormone
secretion is regulated. ***
