9503918 Ritchie Research will be carried out leading to photo-production of eta
mesons at the CEBAF electron accelerator. The data will be used to test quark
models of mesons and nucleons. In addition, measurement of the pi-meson beta-
decay will be carried out at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland with
significant improvement in precision over previous measurements. The latter
measurement will permit important tests of quark-lepton universality to be
carried out, as well as resolving discrepancies relating to unitarity of the
Cabibbo-Kobayashi- Masakawa matrix describing weak quark decays and transitions.
Both experiments are high priority activities in contemporary nuclear physics
and studies of fundamental symmetries. Development, construction, and
utilization of major state-of-the- art equipment is integral to this activity.
Education of graduate students is a strong component in every aspect of this
grant. ***
