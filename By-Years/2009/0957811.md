In this project the PI will study the mechanisms by which opposite polarity
motors communicate and how their function is regulated inside living cells. The
standard genetic and biochemical assays will be combined with high speed imaging
as well as quantitative optical trap measurement of motor forces in living
Drosophila embryos and in purified systems from different genetic backgrounds.
This research project is motivated by preliminary data showing that purified
cargos carry opposite polarity motors that engage in a stalemate in vitro and do
not move long distances in the absence of cyotsolic extracts. The central
hypothesis is that regulatory proteins coordinate bidirectional transport and
that force generation in opposite directions alone does not account for the
observed bidirectionality. The rationale for these studies is that the
identification of the mechanisms by which motors of opposite polarity cooperate
would lead to a fundamental framework for eventual understanding of how failure
of these mechanisms is linked to disease. The principal investigator has, and
will continue to disseminate the findings of his research program among the
general public through high school student internships in his laboratory and
through lectures to the students and their teachers in Austin high schools.
