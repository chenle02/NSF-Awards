National Video Resources, in collaboration with the American Library Association
and the History of Science Society, is developing and implementing six-week
discussion programs at 100 libraries across the country. The "Research
Revolution and the Shaping of Modern Life" discussions will illuminate the
organization and goals of scientific-technical work, the critical outcomes of
research and development, the material and social byproducts of such work, and
the ethical issues that sometimes result. During the program participants will
screen and discuss documentary films on topics such as: an introduction to the
rise of organized laboratory research and its results; new developments in
quantum technologies and nanotechnology; recent developments in materials
science and how artificially created materials have defined a modern way of
life; the impact of genetic engineering and the Human Genome Project; medical
imaging from x-rays to MRIs and CT-scans; and the science of meteorology and the
problems of global climate change. Discussions will be lead by local scholars
from Universities and research laboratories located near a participating
library.
