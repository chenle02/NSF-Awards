Investigations are carried out on two aspects of atom-cavity emission. One
research area will be the resonance fluorescence of a single atom coupled to a
degenerate optical resonator mode. Such a system exhibits two resonant peaks,
one near the free- space atomic resonance frequency and a second near the empty-
cavity frequency. These peaks evolve into the normal mode splitting when the
cavity frequency and the atom frequency coincide. A detailed study of this
behavior, both on and off resonance, will provide information on micro-dynamical
quantum processes. Effects of stimulated emission and absorption will also be
studied. A second area of study will be the emission of an atom-cavity system in
which the atom (or atoms) is prepared in an inverted state. The gain for such a
system can be large, and emission rates and linewidths will be studied to
observe the transition from enhanced spontaneous emission to stimulated emission
("atom-cavity laser"). Photon statistics will also be studied.
