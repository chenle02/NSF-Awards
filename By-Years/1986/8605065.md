This research involves integrating multiple robotic sensing devices to perform
such tasks as object recognition, inspection, and grasping. The robotic sensing
devices to be used are a high speed pipelined image processor and an intelligent
gripper with tactile sensing capability. Methods for integrating touch and
vision to perform these tasks in real time will be explored, as will algorithms
for fast stereo matching and surface interpolation from sparse sensor data.
