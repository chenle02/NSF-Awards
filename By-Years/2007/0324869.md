Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Researchers at The University of Michigan, Arizona State
University, and Princeton University&lt;br/&gt;will, during the next four years,
explore core technologies for the next generation of computer&lt;br/&gt;systems,
suitable for untethered pervasive computing. The requirements of the computing
sub-strate&lt;br/&gt;in such devices is mind boggling, and so we have collected
our research under the title of&lt;br/&gt;Mobile Supercomputing. We believe this
phrase captures the need for the order-of-magnitude&lt;br/&gt;increase in
performance need by such systems, while maintaining the minimal power budget
that&lt;br/&gt;is essential for mobile computing systems. The core technologies
are a synergistic combination of&lt;br/&gt;novel co-design and circuit
techniques that integrate into a generic platform architecture
for&lt;br/&gt;mobile supercomputing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The significance of
this work for the user of tomorrows pervasive mobile computers will be
that&lt;br/&gt;that they will provide a highly versatile light-weight computing
and communication device with&lt;br/&gt;hands-free user interfaces such as
speech recognition, gesture recognition, facial expression,
and&lt;br/&gt;streaming voice/video. This will allow the user to perform stand
alone computing, communicate&lt;br/&gt;with others in a number of ways, and
provide a sophisticated portal to the internet and other&lt;br/&gt;remote
computing resources.
