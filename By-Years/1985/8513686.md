Work is continued on establishing a theoretical basis for analysis viscous flow
in reacting and non-reacting systems. Previous efforts have included (and will
continue to include in this work) both theoretical analysis and its experimental
verification. The starting point is a course segregated mixture consisting of
striations of large blobs. In reactive mixing the fluids interdiffuse and
undergo chemical reactions that might or might not be controlled by the fluid
dynamcis. Three time scales have to be taken into account: diffusion, reaction,
and local fluid mechanical time factors. In non-reactive flows only the first
and last are considered.
