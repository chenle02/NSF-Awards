Sea turtle hatchlings emerge from underground nests on sandy oceanic beaches,
scramble to the sea, and swim toward the open ocean in a migration lasting
several days. During the migration, hatchlings quickly establish a seaward
course, then hold this heading even after they swim beyond sight of land. Little
is known about how hatchling sea turtles can maintain a straight course through
a vast ocean that contains no obvious landmarks. Recent experiments have
revealed that hatchling loggerhead sea turtles from the Atlantic coast of
Florida can detect the magnetic field of the earth and use it as a cue to guide
their migration. Dr. Lohmann's experiments are designed to study the newly
discovered magnetic compass sense of sea turtle hatchlings and to provide
insight into how sea turtles use magnetic cues in navigation. All species of sea
turtles are now either endangered or threatened. Dr. Lohmann's research is
expected to provide information useful to conservation workers trying to save
sea turtles from extinction. In addition, it is expected to help scientists
understand how other migratory animals (such as birds, fish, and whales) use
information from the earth's magnetic field to navigate.
