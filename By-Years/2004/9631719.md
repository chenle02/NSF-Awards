9631719 Petersilia Public opinion polls have indicated that the public's fear of
crime is rising and people are taking behavioral precautions to avoid being
victimized by serious crime. According to police reports, gang-related crime is
also escalating and becoming more violent. However, crime rates are not
increasing at a level to warrant the degree of fear currently being seen in the
public. This research proposes to study the congruence between levels of gang-
related crime, community characteristics (i.e., social and physical "disorder,"
community decline, racial heterogeneity) and the public's fear of gangs in
Orange County, California. Methods will include analysis of officially-recorded
crime statistics, focus group discussions on the fear of gangs, and videotaping
of actual community characteristics which may predict gang-related fear (e.g.,
graffiti the presence of loitering youths). At the completion of the project,
there will likely be a deeper understanding of the factors that drive fear of
crime, and the research will likely have immediate theoretical and practical
importance. Specifically, it will attempt to further refine the four dominant
theories in the fear of crime literature and will inform those who are
attempting to devise sensible justice policies. %%%%
