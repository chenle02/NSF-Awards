The primary objective of this US-Poland Cooperative research project is to
support the travel of Prof. A. K. Oppenheim, Mechanical Engineering Department
of the University of California, Berkeley, to work with Dr. Bogumil
Staniszewski, Institute of Heat Engineering, Warsaw University of Technology, on
a study of fundmental principles for controlled combustion engines. Dr.
Oppenheim developed a simpler generator than the somewhat awkward valve-operated
prechamber of the LAG engine. The basic task of the experimental program is to
assess the characteristic properties of combustion in pulsed jet plumes under a
variety of operating conditions. Funds for this research are awarded through the
Maria Sklodowska-Curie Joint Fund II, Warsaw, in accordance with established
guidelines.
