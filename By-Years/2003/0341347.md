Neurovisions is creating, evaluating and disseminating a prototype lesson called
"The Path to Recovery". The prototype helps integrate technology into
undergraduate education and responds to a need for resources that incorporate
neuroimaging into neuroscience curricula. NeuroVisions involves students in
discovery-based explorations of addiction, memory, language, emotion, and
consciousness with real data provided by leading neuroimaging scientists.
Students formulate hypotheses, design experiments, process and analyze brain
imaging data, perform statistical analyses, draw conclusions based on their
analyses, and write up findings in research reports. NeuroVisions employs
WebImage, a Java-based image processing and analysis program developed by key
personnel on this project, as an educational technology. WebImage enriches the
undergraduate educational experience by giving students a chance to examine real
data, make their own discoveries, and see neuroanatomical structures and
neurophysiological processes first-hand. The lesson is being tested in
undergraduate research methods, neuroscience, and general psychology courses,
and changes in student understanding about neuroscience, neuroimaging, and
research methods will be measured. Evaluation results will be disseminated in
journals and at a Society for Neuroscience meeting; a plan will also be devised
to evaluate NeuroVisions in courses taught by members of the Faculty for
Undergraduate Neuroscience.
