The World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) is a principal component of the
World Climate Research Programme (WCRP), an international effort to understand
the climate of the earth. This proposal is to support the continuation of the
planning of the US contributions to the WOCE, to foster the international
activities associated with the experiment, and to provide the community support
for meetings, publications, and other planning needs. An implementation plan has
been completed, and will be initiated in FY90, coordinated in larger part by
personnel associated with this project.
