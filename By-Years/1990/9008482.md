This project in theoretical high energy physics will deal with quantum
chromodynamics (QCD), the theory of interactions of quarks and gluons,
topological aspects of field theory, and superunification theory. The project is
divided into three parts: (1) a study of various topological aspects of quantum
physics (quantum mechanics and field theory, particle and condensed matter
physics), a study of fundamental problems in superstring theory, and a study of
some phenomenological consequences of superunification; (2) a study of the long-
range structure of the QCD plasma and its phenomenological consequences for
heavy ion collisions, the evolution of the universe, and the dynamics of neutron
stars; (3) a study of the phenomenology of confined QCD. All of these studies
deepen and broaden our understanding of the fundamental interactions of matter.
Several of them are quite important to our understanding of the strong (nuclear)
interactions of quarks.
