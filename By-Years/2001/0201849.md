0201949 Edwards Catastrophic iron corrosion sometimes occurs in the presence of
SRB with profound consequences. A theory of SRB induced iron corrosion is
proposed based on the observations that reduced phosphorus species such as
phosphine (PH3) can catalyze the rate limiting reaction in iron corrosion, and
that phosphates added to iron metal or drinking water as corrosion inhibitors
can serve as the source of catalyst in the presence of sulfides.&lt;br/&gt;Three
phases of experimental work are planned to examine aspects of reduced phosphorus
species chemistry. This includes 1) development of analytical protocols and a
survey of reduced P occurrence, 2) examination of the aqueous chemistry of
reduced P and pathways leading to its production, and 3) defining the role of
reduced phisphorus in iron corrosion.&lt;br/&gt;This research, although
fundamental, has important applications to the engineering community. The
investigators note that there is ample evidence supporting the idea that reduced
phosphorus could catalyze iron corrosion under conditions present in water
distribution systems. Therefore, where these forms of phosphorus are present,
there can be high costs associated with pipe replacement. &lt;br/&gt;
