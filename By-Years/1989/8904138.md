Microtubules are required for chromosome motion and directed cell locomotion.
Recent experiments had demonstrated that microtubules are dynamic polymers and
that dynamic behavior is modulated throughout the cell cycle. A major aim of
these experiments is to quantitate microtubule dynamic behavior throughout the
cell cycle and to examine the function and regulation of microtubule dynamics.
To address these questions, fluorescent or biotinylated derivatives of tubulin
will be microinjected into living cells and the rate and pattern of microtubule
turnover examined using fluorescence or electron microscopy. Microtubule dynamic
behavior will be examined in interphase and correlated with cell motility. The
dramatic reorganization of the interphase microtubule array at the transition
from interphase to mitosis will be examined in living cells. Spindle fiber
formation during prometaphase will be characterized; particular attention will
be paid to the interaction of the kinetochore with spindle microtubules. Does
capture and release of microtubules within the kinetochore fiber occur during
prometaphase? The half-time of kinetochore-microtubule interactions will be
measured to determine if the affinity of microtubules for the kinetochore
changes during mitosis. Finally, experiments will be initiated to identify
regulatory molecules involved in modulation of microtubule dynamics in living
cells. The results of this, research will provide significant new insight into
the mechanisms of cell motility and mitosis.
