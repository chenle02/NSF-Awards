9506494 Holloway This research will provide data on the solubility of CO2 and
H2O in andesitic composition melts and on the stability of hydrous minerals in
the three prominent rock types in subducting slabs - metasediments, metabasalts,
and hydrated peridotites. The experiments to be conducted will use a combination
of high pressure systems covering the range 20 Mpa to 20 Gpa. The solubility
experiments span the temperature range 1100o to 1450o. The hydrous mineral
stability experiments will cover the range believed appropriate for subduction
slab materials, generally 550o to 1200oC. Where possible, experimental results
will be analyzed in context of available theoretical models and the results
applied to interpretation of subduction zone processes.
