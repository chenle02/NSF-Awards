The availability of large-scale computing provided by platforms reduces the
costs of exploiting compute-intensive analysis in support of strategic decision
making. Computational infrastructure developed by the project team provides
middleware that shields the user from such concerns, and thus can provide a
valuable gateway to the cloud for simulation-based decision support systems. The
approach is founded on an emerging methodology for strategic reasoning based on
empirical game-theoretic analysis (EGTA). EGTA combines massive simulation and
other empirical methods with concepts from game theory to support decisions that
anticipate strategies and reactions from other agents (e.g., competitors,
customers) in a complex environment. The approach aligns the simplicity of
agent-based modeling with the principled analytic basis of game theory. The
technology developed promises to dramatically increase the scale and fidelity of
EGTA studies, extending the scope of game-theoretic reasoning from stylized
domains to real-world problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many problem environments
faced by firms, individuals, and society are fundamentally strategic, in that
the outcome of one agent's action depends pivotally on the choices of others.
Improving strategic decision making in complex domains offers benefits for many
economically important applications, for example, supply chain risk management,
infrastructure and location planning, and technology adoption and
standardization. Facilities developed in this project will broaden access to
large-scale distributed computing resources, leading to significant efficiencies
in utilization of computational infrastructure.
