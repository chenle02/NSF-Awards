The friction and vibration and their interaction in slider- crank mechanisms
will be studied. Experimental results will be supported by analytical models
based on EHD lubrication for the slider and mixed lubrication for the rings. The
possibility of affecting and controlling friction by imposing vibrations on the
system will be evaluated.
