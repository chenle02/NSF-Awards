This award was made to Professor Olmer at Indiana University, as part of the
Research Experiences for Undergraduates program. It will support undergraduates
working with research scientists on research projects of mutual interest. This
program is designed to encourage further study in the sciences by
undergraduates. It is a response to the growing need for trained scientists and
engineers.
