9401924 Fletcher This Americas Program award will support Dr. Neil Fletcher, of
Florida State University, Tallahassee, in a research collaboration in nuclear
physics with Dr. Jacinto Liendo, Instituto Venezolano de Investigaciones
Cientificas, Caracas. The main objective of the project will be to measure the
alpha- particle widths of several states near breakup threshold in 13C, with the
goal of further understanding the cluster structure properties of the states and
improving the obtainable energy resolution. In this, they will have access to a
new high- resolution nuclear spectroscopic tool developed by the two
researchers. The original detection method for low energy nuclear physics,
resonant particle decay spectroscopy, has not been utilized for ultra-high
energy resolution in nuclear reactions. One of the primary aspects of this
research will be to apply this method, and the researchers' newly discovered
angular correlation property, to problems in the structure of states in p-shell
nuclei. The results will be of high interest, both for the specific information
obtained and as a demonstration of a potential new tool in nuclear astrophysics.
