ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Establishing a Digital Library for Earth System
Education (DLESE)&lt;br/&gt;Evaluation "Toolkit" and
Community&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops an Earth systems education
evaluation resource for users of the Digital Library for Earth System Education
(DLESE) and other geoscience educators. The resource, conceptualized as an
accessible evaluation "toolkit", is grounded in the needs of Earth system
educators, and provides a virtual home for a geoscience education
evaluation&lt;br/&gt;community. An evaluation resource specifically tied to the
needs of Earth systems education will enable principal investigators to infuse
evaluation into their projects more readily, and will provide knowledge about
how best to engender learning in Earth systems education. This project
establishes a forum and community for evaluation dialogue within DLESE and
provides a robust collection of evaluation resources useful for Earth systems
educators. The resource will be disseminated through the DLESE infrastructure
and through professional society meetings and workshops.&lt;br/&gt;
