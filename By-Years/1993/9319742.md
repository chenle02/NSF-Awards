This research is on techniques for testing circuits having random pattern
resistant faults. The focus is on methods for synthesizing random pattern
testable circuits. The synthesis algorithms being developed include algorithms
for design of random pattern testable two level and multi-level combinational
logic; extensions to some classes of sequential logic are also being
investigated. Two methods being pursued are weighted cellular automaton, and
fixed bit biased pseudo-random pattern generator.
