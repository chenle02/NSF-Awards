Taylor will do practical and theoretical calculations for group rings of finite
groups. He intends to study classification of manifolds and their neighborhoods
via approximate fibration theory. He intends to study Pin structures on
manifolds with special attention to the low-dimensional cases. Finally, he
intends to calculate invariants for function spaces and related objects. Dwyer
will study the uniqueness of classifying spaces and, indeed, any space whose
loop space is a finite complex. He intends to develop the theory of pi-algebras
as a tool in homotopy theory. He intends to study various realization problems
via a lifting of diagrams approach. He intends to study Andre-Quillen cohomology
and apply the results to the Lie ring analyzer of M. Barratt. Williams hopes to
prove an equivariant A-theory Novikov conjecture, as this would give a proof of
the L-theory Novikov conjecture. He will study the forget-control map in
approximate fibration theory and intends to use such results to study various
geometric questions. He intends to use approximate fibrations to study manifolds
and their neighborhoods, in particular, the equivariant and codimension-2 case.
He intends to modify surgery theory to give calculations of the group of
automorphisms of a manifold rather than the group of blocked automorphisms. The
totality of investigations, by the three faculty members involved cut a wide
swath through topology. Some topics attempt to enhance the algebraic machinery
for classifying manifolds. Others are more directly geometric. Problems range
from targets of opportunity, which arose in the course of the investigators'
recent work, to a famous conjecture by the Russian topologist S. P. Novikov,
which has resisted many attacks for years but has recently shown some chinks in
its armor.
