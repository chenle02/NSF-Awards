Biotic interactions of sessile colonial invertebrates are often mediated by
inducible structures that are locally deployed on the colony. In no other group
of animals is there likely to be such a tight relationship between the function
of ecological interaction and underlying physiological constraints. Colonies of
the marine bryozoan, Membranipora membranacea, specifically change morphology
with changes in the biotic environment: spines are induced by predators, and
stolons by some conspecifics. Previous work has shown that the spines exact a
fitness cost and this project will test the hypothesis that the mechanism
underlying the cost is disruption of colony-wide translocation and metabolic
patterns. Although inducible defenses are common in marine, terrestrial, and
freshwater organisms, and costs have been frequently demonstrated, no studies
have elucidated mechanisms underlying costs of defense. The current hypothesis
of this project is based on the concept of a simple source-sink model
controlling the basic process of translocation in bryozoan colonies and linking
physiological function with ecological performance. This project will attempt to
develop radioisotope methods using 14Carbon and 35Sulfur to test the hypothesis.
