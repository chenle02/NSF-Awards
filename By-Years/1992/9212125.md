This award, for $390,000, is for the development of the integration of sensors
into the Electrical Engineering curriculum. A collaborative effort involving
university, government, and industrial researchers will take place to accomplish
this integration. This effort will foster the transfer of sensor research
expertise into the curriculum. The transfer will be accomplished by three new EE
courses and an undergraduate sensor laboratory.
