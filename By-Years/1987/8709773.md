This award allows the investigator to do a three month pilot study in Kenya.
The primary goal is to test a theory of fertility, namely Caldwell's (1982)
wealth flows theory. This theory posits that people plan their family size in
response to their appreciation of their economic and social responsibilities,
which change with their level of income and access to superior education and
training. The higher their income, the better their training/education, the more
their responsibilities towards family focus upon the nuclear rather than the
extended family, and the less they need to rely upon numerous offspring to look
after them in their old age. The research hypothesizes that wealth flows theory
will explain the demographic situation among the Maragoli of Viyalo Sublocation,
Western Province, Kenya better than an alternative model known as the "economic
value of children" perspective. The researcher will collect time allocation data
and demographic information to test these hypotheses. The area has been studied
by a Kenyan collaborator since 1975, so this research will build on a
longitudinal data base for this community. This research is valuable because
improved understanding of the causes of lowered population growth in the
developing world is of critical importance. This pilot project will yield
valuable information towards that goal.
