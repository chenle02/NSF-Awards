Abstract Boersema

This proposal is for partial support of the 12th West Coast Operator Algebra
Seminar (WCOAS), to be held at Seattle University on October 23 - 24, 2004. The
WCOAS has become a tradition among the operator algebraists in the western
United States and Canada. The expected number of participants is approximately
40-50, including graduate students, postdocs, and faculty researchers coming
from all over western North America. The seminar will feature several hour-long
talks on current topics given by both established and younger researchers in the
region and beyond. The intellectual merits of the West Coast Operator Algebra
Seminar are that (1) it is an opportunity for researchers to disseminate their
own results; (2) it is an opportunity for researchers learn about recent
research of others and to stay abreast of current work; (3) it fosters
collaborative research by giving researchers the opportunity to meet and discuss
their work with each other. The broader impacts of WCOAS are that (1) it will
encourage and nurture graduate students and postdocs by giving them the
opportunity to present their own work, learn about recent work, and meet
established researchers in operator algebras; (2) it creates a cohesive regional
community of operator algebraists; (3) it fosters connections between the
faculty and students at research universities and those at primarily
undergraduate institutions. The proposal is for partial support of the
Southeastern-Atlantic Regional Conference on Differential Equations that has met
annually since 1981. The primary objective of the meeting is to bring together
graduate students, young investigators, and more senior researchers. The program
features plenary talks by eminent mathematicians, with parallel sessions of
contributed papers by younger participants. The funding will be used primarily
for the travel support of graduate students and young PhDs.
