The mechanism controlling vortex-induced motion of marine cables and tethers is
of great interest to those who work in the ocean. In almost all marine
applications, the fluid flow, which induces themotion, is sheared due to local
current variations or is effectively sheared due to curvature of the cable.
Shear flow causes the amplitude response of a tow cable to be modulated by a
traveling wave. The basic mechanism affecting the formation ofamplitude-
modulated traveling waves in a tether subjected to a shear flow will be
investigated. Experiments will be performed on a cylinder that is forced to
oscillate with a modulated motion, measuring simultaneously the motion of the
cylinder, the forces acting on the cylinder, and the amplitude and phase of the
fluid forces. One application of such information is in the prediction of the
forces on long cables. The experimental will include numerical calculations of
two-dimensional flow around a cylinder that is forced to oscillate with
amplitude-modulated motion. The coupling of experimental measurements and
numerical calculations should lead to an improved understanding of how shear
flows and slender cylinders interact.
