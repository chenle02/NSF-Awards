The proposed research seeks to investigate how people use graphic information in
making judgments and decisions. Research on human judgment has become
increasingly concerned with the compatibility between the manner in which
information is portrayed and the associated information processing strategies
invoked in making a decision. However, relatively little is known about the
effects of information display on decision making. The two basic concepts behind
the research are the lens model paradigm and the compatibility hypothesis. The
plan of the research is to undertake a series of empirical studies to examine
compatibility effects between the form of the graphic information display and
the context of the judgment tasks. The lens model framework is used to
conceptualize the relationship between human judgmental processes and the
elements or cues in the stimulus environment. Graphic displays will be
constructed using varying display characteristics. An important task variable to
be studied is time pressure. The research will advance both the development of
descriptive theory of human decision behavior and the development of decision
aids to improve decision making.
