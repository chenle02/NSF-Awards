This project, sponsored by the University of Alabama- Birmingham, provides a
six week summer workshop integrating the topics of middle-school mathematics and
science followed by a series of follow-up Saturday workshops during the
subsequent academic year. The 50 participants in the summer workshop will be
paired with another teacher at the home school and both will participate in the
academic year program. The courses will be taught by teams consisting of a
mathematician and a math educator and a scientist and a science educator. The
courses will emphasize both content and pedagogy with hands-on laboratory and
field experience. In addition the teachers will be instructed in how to carry-on
leadership out-reach activities and techniques of teaching minority students.
The target schools have a high percentage of minority students and teachers. The
NSF funds are being matched by funds from the University, the State of Alabama
and the Mott Foundation in an amount equivalent to about 16% of the NSF grant.
