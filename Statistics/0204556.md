Abstract

DMS-0204556 PI: Jianhua Huang

Longitudinal data, which involve variables observed repeatedly over time, are
common in biomedicine, epidemiology, economics, sociology, and many other
fields. Nonparametric and semiparametric statistical methods provide effective
tools for extracting useful information from this type of data. These methods
allow scientists, policy makers and researchers to draw conclusions from their
data without depending on pre-specified assumptions that may be too restrictive
to their settings. The objective of this proposal is to develop systematic,
theoretically well-founded, and more efficient such methods.

The focus is on the following five topics: (i) further theoretical and
methodological development of the spline-based approach to time-varying
coefficient models; (ii) estimation of covariance structures; (iii) extension of
time-varying coefficient models to generalized linear models; (iv) extension of
time-varying coefficient models to take into account accumulative covariate
effects; (v) semiparametric efficient estimation in partly linear models. These
projects involve developing novel estimation and inference procedures, providing
theoretical justification, and discussing their theoretical and practical
importance to the advancement of biomedical and statistical science. The
research approach will be a combination of theoretical asymptotic analysis,
Monte Carlo simulations and real data analysis. Global smoothing techniques with
spline functions will be used.
