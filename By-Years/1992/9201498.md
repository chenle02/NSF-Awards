The Center for Theory and Simulation in Science and Engineering at Cornell
University (Cornell Theory Center) proposes a collaboration with the Center for
Research on Parallel Computation (CRPC), headquartered at Rice University, for
research in the development of scaleable parallel programs in a scientific
programming environment. Ken Kennedy;s research group at Rice has developed a
prototype parallel programming environment called ParaScope ?4,5,6!. Cornell is
one of about twenty sites that have received this software for testing and
evaluation. We propose to work together to evaluate and deploy this software.
The goal of the proposed research is twofold: (1) to see how useful such an
environmen is for scientific programming, and (2) to determine how extensible
such and environment is, in scaleability and retargeting to different manchines.
The time is ripe for such a study because of the tool's maturity and because of
the growing need to retarget user programs quickly to new systems. The High
Performance Computing and Communications Initiative will further encourage the
proliferation of parallel systems as new approaches to parallel computing are
explored. For the next five years, rapid change in our field demands parallel
programming tools such as Parascope that can be quickly adapted to support new
target parallel architectures.
