The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on using analytics and technology to
drive greater efficiency and effectiveness in healthcare. Recent legislative
changes are driving all players within the healthcare ecosystem toward greater
accountability. This Phase I project specifically includes technologies to
automatically assess patient risk and thereby reduce post-discharge readmissions
rates. This Phase I project has the potential to support a broad range of
customers across both the provider and the payer landscape, by providing cost-
effective readmissions control solutions that respond to new legislative
pressures. In terms of commercial potential, the Institute of Medicine of the
National Academies has estimated that preventable hospital readmissions account
for $20 billion/year in wasteful healthcare spending. The addressable market for
the proposed Phase I proof-of-concept for patient risk stratification to support
readmission control is approximately $100MM. In the future, this research
project will serve as a foundation to support broader population health
analytics, the addressable market for which exceeds $500MM/year and is growing
at a rate of 24% annually.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project aims to
develop a data mining system to capture and analyze information from electronic
medical records in order to risk-stratify patients after they have been
discharged from hospital. Leveraging interoperability standards that are
required by federal regulation, the system will seamlessly aggregate data from
multiple electronic medical record systems in a vendor-agnostic manner. A custom
analytics engine will detect emergent patterns and draw inferences about each
patient?s risk of readmission. If successful, this research will validate the
end-to-end concept and suggest the broader applicability of this approach to
some of the greatest challenges in population health.
