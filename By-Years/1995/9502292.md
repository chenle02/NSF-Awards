9502292 Bramley The work proposed here involves research and teaching in
scientific computation. The research primarily uses partial orthogonalization
methods for solving applications that include incompressible fluid flows. First,
a new class of incomplete orthogonalization preconditioners that preliminary
results have shown to be more effective than standard preconditioners will be
further developed and analyzed. Secondly, methods for solving constrained
systems using orthogonal projectors will be further developed, and extended to
nonsymmetric (full Navier-Stokes equations) problems, and other problems in
fields such as electromagnetics. Both as a tool and a separate research interest
a unified package of methods for computing orthogonal projections will be
developed and distributed.
