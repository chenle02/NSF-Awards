A system for the characterization of adsorbed species on powder catalysts under
operating conditions is being assembled. Components include a Fourier-transform
infrared (FTIR) spectrometer, a diffuse reflectance (DRIFTS) attachment, mass
flow controllers, and a temperature controller. This equipment will be used in
several studies, with emphasis on abatement of nitrogen oxide emissions from
stationary power sources. The studies include decomposition of nitric oxide and
nitrogen dioxide on manganese oxides, reduction of nitric oxide by methane ovre
lanthana or doped magnesia, and characterization of carbon-supported palladium
using adsorbed carbon monoxide.//
