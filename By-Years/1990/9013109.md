The focus of this research is to develop a working experimental understanding of
photopolymerization processes initiated with visible light initiators and using
visible lasers. The principal application of interest is three-dimensional
imaging: using a laser to control the formation of contour or a shape. Thus, a
target of the work is to understand, eventually, the formation of shapes from
crosslinked gels and to understand how photopolymerization rates effect the
dimensions. Another goal is to expand studies of photochemical polymerization
processes to systems that can be used to unique advantage in altering or
controlling the outcome of a chain reaction, such as under harsh conditions. The
specific goals for this research are: 1) To optimize initiators which function
at 488 nm, 514 nm, 632 nm and &gt; 720 nm and cause controlled polymerization
"at depth". 2) To optimize dimensional control in laser initiated acrylate
photopolymerization, and develop techniques which form contours. 3) To develop
time-resolved photopolymerization experiments such that the rates of
photopolymerizations can be evaluated as a function of initiator, monomer, light
source, in the dimension Z. 4) To optimize property control and photospeed in
laser- initiated acrylate photopolymerization. 5) To develop techniques for the
formation of composite materials using laser-initiated acrylate
photopolymerization. 6) To develop techniques for the formation of composites
and polymers by laser-initiated polymerization under harsh conditions. 7) To
develop monomer systems, other than acrylates, that can be efficiently
photopolymerized with visible lasers.
