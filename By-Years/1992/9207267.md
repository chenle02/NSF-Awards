Sarrafzadeh The research is in four areas of geometric algorithms for design
tools. The research topics are: 1. floor planning by graph dualization; 2.
placement of modules by exploiting circuit regularities; 3. rectilinear Steiner
tree problems; and 4. point dominance problems. In floor-planning, topological
aspects of the problem are considered and geometric issues such as sizing are
explored. A clustering technique for module placement, that exploits
regularities in circuit structures, is being investigated. In this way natural
clusters that reflect the hierarchical perspective of circuit connections can be
built automatically. Problems in approximate designs for global and single layer
routing using Steiner trees are being investigated. Point dominance, from
computational geometry, is being applied to circuit layout problems.
