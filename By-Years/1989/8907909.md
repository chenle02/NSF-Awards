Professor Suda will investigate a new class of local area network architectures
that use collision avoidance switches. The switches allow the implementation of
random access protocols without the penalty of collision among packet. They
combine the benefits of random access (i.e. low delay when traffic is light;
simple distributed, and therefore robust protocols) with excellent network
utilization and concurrency of transmission. In this research project, the
principal investigator will investigate (1) several variations for station
protocols and switch architectures, (2) design and prototype implementation of a
switch using photonic devices, and (3) performance (e.g. delay and throughput)
of the network architectures through analysis and simulations.
