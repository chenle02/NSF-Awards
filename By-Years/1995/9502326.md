9502326 Lu The knowledge of constitutive behavior of a powder compact is import
in the manufacture of many material systems which involve the sintering of
inhomogeneous particle packings. However, experimental data on the constitutive
behavior of these complex systems are scarce and theoretical models predicting
the behavior differ significantly from one to another. In this research project,
a new experimental method based on noncontact optical techniques will be
demonstrated and further developed to gain a fundamental understanding of
constitutive behavior of powder compacts. %%% A new experimental method, based
on noncontact optical technique, will be developed to gain a fundamental
understanding of constitutive behavior of powder compacts. The applicant's
career goal is to pursue teaching excellence as well as research excellence in
the field of Materials Science and Engineering. By teaching fundamental
principles and problem solving skills and promoting active learning through
curriculum innovations, it is expected that graduates will be better equipped to
develop new intellectual skills, increase their technical knowledge, and make
technology innovations that will serve our societal needs and national goals.
