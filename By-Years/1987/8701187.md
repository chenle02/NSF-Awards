Phase I of this SBIR research project has demonstrated the technical
feasibility of a novel new approach to separation of micron sized particles
which is based on differences in their surface characteristics. The new method
employs an adaptation of electrostatic coalescence technology now widely used in
desalting and dewatering of petroleum feedstocks. In the Phase II effort, ETCI
will build a batch operated laboratory test cell for use in studies of the
physical, chemical and electrical parameters of the separator. Several different
methods of preparation of feed to the separator will be investigated. Studies of
the physics of capture will be undertaken using a novel separator built on the
stage of a microscope. This work will use thin film deposition technology to
simulate sources of intense electric capture forces. Particle capture will be
studied using very small monosized spheres made of glass or latex. In the later
stages of the Phase II effort, ETCi will build a batch operated laboratory scale
prototype separator and demonstrate the new separation process in beneficiation
of micronized coal. The principal investigators are well qualified to conduct
this research, and a grant is highly recommended for Phase II of the Small
Business Innovation Research Program Solicitation.
