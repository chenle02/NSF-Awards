This project seeks to help support student attendance at the ACM Annual
Symposium on the Theory of Computing (STOC) in Palo Alto, California, June
1-June 4, 2013, the 45th annual occurrence of this meeting. STOC, together with
the IEEE FOCS meeting, are the premier conferences on the Theory of Computing in
North America. In recent years the attendance at STOC has consistently exceeded
300 people. A large fraction of the attendees have been students, for whom the
conference serves as a valuable educational experience, both as regards the
technical content of the talks and the opportunities for networking that it
provides.
