9417214 Zafiriou To better understand the mineralization of dissolved organic
matter (DOM) this study will assess the CO cycle, a key species in the marine
organic carbon, by evaluating independently its sources and sinks. CO serves as
a tracer for budgeting other substances in the equation:
1O2+aDOM+xhv---&gt;dHOOH+eCO+fCO2+chv-DOM (hv=photons, hv-DOM=light altered
dissolved organic matter). CO production and CO losses by microbial oxidation
and gas exchange in the mixed layer can be equated. Thus mixed- layer CO can be
calibrated as a tracer in marine geochemical units via its sinks, and in
photochemical units via its source. Then determining the terms a-f in the
equation permits using their ratios to budget other photo-reactant and photo-
product terms. Cruises constraining CO microbial oxidation, and sampling for
laboratory studies of a-f will cover varied sites to allow generalizing
globally. Time-series studies will be done in local coastal waters influenced by
high- latitude rivers, the N.Atlantic gyre where optical properties driving
photoprocesses vary seasonally (Bermuda) and on CALCOFI transects in productive
coastal (California) waters. A Seattle-Hobart cruise will add a large-scale
Pacific data set (NOAA/RITS). CO gas exchange will be estimated by traditional
methods; CO microbial oxidation will be measured in incubations as CO loss or
conversion of 14CO2.
