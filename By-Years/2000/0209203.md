ABSTRACT Bresler, Yoram 0209203 U of Ill

Tomography, or the reconstruction of an object from a collection of its line
integrals from various directions (known as its x-ray transform) is a well known
problem. Perhaps most importantly, it is the principle underlying most of the
key diagnostic imaging modalities including x-ray Computed Tomography (CT), PET
and SPECT, certain forms of MRI, and emerging techniques such as electric
impedance tomography (EIT) and optical tomography. Tomographic reconstruction is
also widely used for nondestructive evaluation (NDE) in manufacturing, and has
been recently proposed for safety screening of passenger luggage in airports.
Tomography is also the fundamental principle in numerous other problems and
applications in science and engineering from electron microscopy of subcellular
structures through geophysical exploration and environmental monitoring, to
remote sensing by synthetic aperture radar (SAR). In cone-beam tomography,
projections are acquired by an area detector, using a source of divergent rays
traveling on a one of several possible trajectories. It is already used in
current PET and SPECT scanners and in NDE, and because it appears to be the only
practical method for rapid volume acquisition, it will be the basis for the next
generation of diagnostic CT scanners. This will allow to use CT as a dynamic
imaging modality for cardiac imaging or for real-time surgical guidance in
medicine, or as a high-throughput NDE system in manufacturing.
