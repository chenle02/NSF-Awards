Carlson will work on the following four problems and related issues: (1) Do the
strongly meager sets form an ideal? (2) How far along the inner model hierarchy
do strong covering lemmas hold? (3) Is Fraisse's conjecture on models with many
isomorphic substructures consistently false? (4) Can the existence of medial
limits be proved in set theory? These are technical questions lying at the
foundations of axiomatic set theory. One wants to know under what assumptions
they are true, whether there are models of set theory in which they fail and
others in which they hold. It is subtle questions such as these that allow us to
explore the limits of the axiomatic systems upon which all of mathematics
logically rests.
