In 1987 a Long-Term Ecological Research Project in Agricultural Ecology was
initiated to examine basic ecological relationships in row crop ecosystems
typical of the U.S. Midwest. The project's original goal was to test the basic,
long-term hypothesis that agronomic management based on knowledge of ecological
interactions in cropping systems can effectively replace management based on
chemical subsidies. The same overall goal guides the project today. In order to
test this hypothesis an experimental site was established in which different
cropping systems, corresponding to different levels of agronomic/ecological
disturbance, are used to test a series of working hypotheses. Working hypotheses
are built around the general topic areas of nutrient availability/ retention,
plant competition, and consumer (insect, pathogen) dynamics. Over the initial
award period substantial progress has been made towards meeting the short-term
goals of establishing a secure agricultural research site with long-term
potential, of putting in place an integrated sampling program to address
important long-term questions in both ecology and agronomy, and most
importantly, of testing and refining the initial hypotheses. In this new project
period the aim is to extend plot-based research to the regional landscape and to
address seven basic ecological hypotheses that are critical for understanding
the ecological underpinnings of modern agriculture and for providing the
knowledge needed to sustain future agricultural production.
