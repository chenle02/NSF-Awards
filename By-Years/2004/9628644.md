Johnson 9628644 The PIs propose to investigate the viscous properties of the
crust by extending geodetic measurements made from 1969 through 1987 in the area
of the 1968 Borrego Mountain earthquake (M=6.5). The PIs will collect an
additional set of GPS observations in the area, and will use the resulting
28-year span of these measurements to determine the time-dependence in strain
rate caused by fault afterslip and inelastic crustal rheology. This research
will provide new data essential for the analysis of crustal viscosity and its
relation to earthquake deformation.
