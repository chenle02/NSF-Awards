As technology advances toward devices that demand increased dimensional
stability across a wide variety of temperatures, the need for thermally
compensated materials and structures grows. Researchers plan to further develop
a technology that produces strong and ductile alloys with tailored thermal
expansion properties, even in the negative regime. This is achieved using simple
alloy processing techniques such as cold rolling and wire drawing. The newly
discovered mechanism to explain the tailored thermal expansion phenomenon
enables thermal expansion design purely through material processing. This new
mechanism allows the team to predict and control the unique thermal expansion
properties not only of metals, but also of low symmetry crystalline ceramics
such as perovskites and titanates. All current methods for thermal expansion
control rely on changing material chemistry or creating composites with
complicated geometries and material components. This limits their widespread
utility due to high material costs and complex manufacturing procedures. By
using simple processing techniques such as cold rolling, a 16th century
technology, the team can design materials from the bottom up to enable great
advances in 21st century technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This technology will
advance knowledge and understanding within its own field and across different
fields by bringing new insights into thermal expansion mechanisms in all
material classes and driving new areas of application-based research. Also, the
potentially transformative concept of obtaining tailored thermal expansion in
structural materials solely from mechanical processing will change the way
scientists and engineers design for thermal compensation. Embedding tailored
thermal expansion coefficient materials in power transmission lines can
significantly reduce energy losses. This has the potential to mitigate future
energy crises with the nation?s ever growing energy demands. Other examples
include improved microprocessor performance and stable telescope focal lengths
by compensating thermal expansion between dissimilar material components.
