Non-technical Description&lt;br/&gt;Lake Champlain and its surrounding watershed
are important to Vermont for tourism, agriculture, natural resources and
drinking water. This region has recently suffered severe economic and
environmental damage due to flooding, snowstorms, and other extreme weather
events. In addition, storm runoff has impeded ongoing efforts to improve lake
and drinking-water quality. Seven academic institutions within Vermont will
leverage existing and new investments in technology, computational resources and
human resources toward developing predictive and decision-making tools for
improving drinking-water quality and protecting natural and human infrastructure
in the face of increasing extreme weather events. Physical, biological and
social scientists and engineers will collaborate in interdisciplinary teams to
understand and model the Lake Champlain basin as a complex hydro-ecological-
social system. Highly sophisticated physical and social models will be employed
to better understand interactions between the natural and human components of
Lake Champlain and the surrounding watershed. Team members will develop and
provide hands-on educational opportunities and STEM training for middle-school,
high-school, and undergraduate students and support research training for
undergraduate, and graduate students and post-doctoral researchers. Early career
professional development will target graduate students, post-doctoral
researchers and early career faculty to further improve the STEM workforce
within Vermont.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description &lt;br/&gt;Research
teams will apply a systems-based, highly integrated approach to determine when
and where impacts of extreme events cascade through the combined social-
ecological system. Extensive water- and soil-sensor networks will provide data
to develop and validate physical models of the watershed. Surveys, workshops and
interviews of stakeholders and governmental agents will be used to provide data
for the social-science models. The social-science models will employ Deep
Knowledge Neural Networks with dynamic algorithms to incorporate land-owner,
land-user and policy-maker opinions and responses. An integrated model of the
watershed will be used to test management scenarios and identify strategies for
maintaining infrastructure, environmental health and drinking water quality in
the face of extreme weather events.
