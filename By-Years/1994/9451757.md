9451757 White This proposal is for a CNC lathe to enable junior mechanical
engineering students to conduct their own SPC experiments. The major application
of the lathe will be in a required junior level mechanical engineering course
titled Manufacturing Methods. The proposed CNC lathe would be used in the SPC
module of this course. Using the lathe, student teams will conduct an experiment
to determine if a manufacturing process is capable and in control. Each student
team must determine what should be measured and how to make the measurements.
The CNC lathe permits the timely replication of a sufficient number of parts
required for these experiments. Additionally, the CNC lathe requested has an on
board computer which can be programmed to produce "good" or "bad" identical
parts. This latter aspect is a necessary ingredient for the students to be able
to determine the effect of variables, such as feed rates and spindle speeds, on
process control. This is a unique approach (and something that is lacking) from
most current mechanical engineering curricula. Knowledge and practical
experience in CNC/CAM and SPC are critical tools for today's mechanical
engineering graduates planning to pursue a career in manufacturing.
