This Americas Program award will support the first U.S.-Mexico bilateral
symposium on the physics of complex fluids, organized by Dr. Philip Pincus of
the University of California, Santa Barbara and Dr. Magdaleno Medina-Noyola, of
the Universidad Autonoma de San Luis Potosi, Mexico. The primary objectives of
the symposium are the development of specific collaborations between U.S. and
Mexico; the establishment of an organizational framework for nurturing
continuing exchanges; and the development of a plan for fostering mutual access
to special facilities and instruments in both countries. The complex fluids
field, a developing multidisciplinary scientific area involving physics,
chemistry and biology, has applications to a diverse range of technologies,
including, among others, enhanced oil recovery, processing of high performance
structural ceramics and polymers, biomolecular materials, and microreactors.
Consequently, the symposium will involve representatives from academia and
industrial laboratories as well.
