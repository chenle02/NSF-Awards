This award by the Instrument Development for Biological Research (IDBR) program
in the Division of Biological Infrastructure (BIO Directorate) is co-funded by
the Particulate and Multiphase Processes (PMP) program in the Division of
Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems (CBET,
Engineering Directorate).

Non Technical Abstract The primary aim of this project is to create a novel
high-speed atomic force microscope (AFM) imaging system with frame rates of on
the order of 100 frames/second. While the creation of this instrument may have a
significant impact on a broad range of application areas, the primary target is
the study of biomolecular processes. The extremely fast frame rate and long
range will allow for the direct visualization of dynamic process that previously
could be studied at best only through indirect means. The interdisciplinary
nature of the project provides excellent opportunities for both graduate and
undergraduate student training as well as outreach to middle- and high-school
age students through summer programs on nano- and biotechnology.

Technical Abstract The speed gains of the instrument will be achieved in two
ways. The first way is to replace the standard raster-scan of AFM with a
feedback algorithm that steers the tip to stay in the region of interest. This
will reduce imaging time by reducing the amount of scanning to be done, with the
tradeoff that the sample to be imaged must have an underlying string-like
structure such as is found in biopolymers. The second way is to create dual-
stage scanning systems that will allow the non-raster scanning to be performed
at ultra-fast speeds. A prototype system will be built and demonstrated on a
variety of standard samples before being deployed to study the dynamics of the
molecular motor myosin V. The instrument and underlying techniques will be
disseminated through journal publication and conference publication and through
collaboration with an existing AFM company to integrate the techniques in their
next generation devices.
