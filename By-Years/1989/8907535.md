This is a grant to study El Nino-Southern Oscillation mechanisms and
predictability using relatively simple coupled atmosphere-ocean models. The
goals of this research are to: 1. Test and implement a new atmospheric model for
the surface winds based on boundary layer considerations. The atmospheric model
will involve modeling the time dependent behavior of the atmospheric boundary
layer over the ocean. 2. Couple the new atmospheric model to an existing ocean
model and examine the mechanisms for ENSO in this new coupled model 3. Conduct
stability and predictability studies on the new coupled atmosphere-ocean model.
4. Examine the adequacy of the simple ocean model by coupling simple atmosphere
models to general circulation models of the ocean. This research is important
because it seeks to enhance understanding of the dynamics of the interactions of
oceans and the atmosphere and how these interactions modify the earth's climate.
