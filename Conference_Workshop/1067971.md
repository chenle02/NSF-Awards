Penn State University's Conference on Undergraduate Research in Mathematics, 4-5
November 2011

This conference provides a venue for undergraduate students to communicate the
results of their research and/or to learn about ongoing research and future
careers in all areas of the mathematical sciences. They will give 20-minute
talks in parallel sessions with breaks for meals, snacks, discussion, a visit to
the Penn State Creamery, and a tour of the Pritchard Fluid Mechanics Laboratory.
Two invited speakers, Annalisa Crannell and Francis Su, who are well-known for
successfully engaging undergraduates students, will give mathematics talks aimed
at the undergraduate audience.

The objective for the students is two-fold: to experience the intellectual
thrill of sharing research experiences, and to network with faculty who can
answer questions about graduate education and future careers in the mathematical
sciences as well as concerns of a more personal nature, such as issues facing
women mathematicians. Our hope is that students will make friends with other
students who like math; that they will experience and enjoy ``talking math'',
and want to continue doing so in a graduate program; and that they will receive
recognition for the hard work they put into their research. The objective for
the faculty who are involved is that they learn more about undergraduate
research possibilities and the rewards of mentoring undergraduate research; that
they learn how mentoring undergraduate research can enhance their teaching
missions, both in and out of the classroom; and in general, that they network
with others who can share ideas and best practices.
