The Nation's community and technical colleges are recognized as key institutions
in the development of a globally competitive science and engineering technician
workforce. The project will bring together a team of community and technical
college faculty and administrators, curriculum developers, and evaluators in an
effort to adapt and implement instruction that develops and enhances students'
spatial skills. The curriculum materials and instructional strategies will be
adapted to an online environment for students in technician programs in advanced
technology fields in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM.
The project team will examine how student demographics and student performance
on a test that assesses mental rotation are related to student success in
introductory courses that require spatial ability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project will focus on selected programs at the following partner institutions.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;*Tidewater Community College (Computer Aided Drafting and
Design, Civil Engineering Technology, Electronic
Technology);&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;*McHenry Community College (Applied Science in
Construction Management, Architectural and Engineering Design Technology,
Applied Science in Engineering Technology, Applied Science in Manufacturing
Management, and Applied Science in Robotics Systems
Engineering);&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;*Tunxis Community College (Engineering
Technology and other programs in the engineering
disciplines);&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;*Del Mar College (Engineering Technology,
Game Technology and Simulation, Geographic Information Science and Cartography
Technology).
