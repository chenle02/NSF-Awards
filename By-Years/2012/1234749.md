This award provides funding for Sherlock, a Cray YarcData uRiKA data appliance
consisting of a next-generation Cray XMT supercomputer (NG-XMT) running the
uRiKA application architecture and augmented by Cray XT5 compute nodes to
broaden the range of relevant applications to address the challenges of graph-
based data analytics. The system will be deployed at the Pittsburgh
Supercomputing Center (PSC). The Cray NG-XMT is a massively multithreaded
supercomputer, based on the Cray XT5 infrastructure and specialized for
analytics. Its Cray-proprietary Threadstorm 4.0 processors implement multiple,
powerful features to support lightweight multithreading, latency hiding, and
advanced memory interfaces with AMD HyperTransport-attached SeaStar2
interconnect chips to provide a flat, globally-addressable memory. This will be
the first system of its kind to be available to the NSF research community.
