This project will study the regulation of gene expression by RNA polymerase II,
an enzyme that carries out the first decoding step from the DNA into RNA for
eventual production of proteins in the cell. The model organism Saccharomyces
cerevisiae (baker's or budding yeast) will be utilized for all the research. The
primary questions will be tackled using biochemical and genetic tools--these
questions focus on a particular protein, TFIIS, that regulates the progress of
RNA polymerase II as it moves along DNA carrying out the decoding reaction
referred to as transcription. Multiple proteins are involved in regulating the
transcription process, and the project will identify which of those proteins
functions in partnership with TFIIS. The identification of the proteins is only
the first level. The more interesting questions then move toward understanding
how these proteins work in concert with TFIIS to increase the activity of RNA
polymerase II in transcription of the correct genes at the correct times in the
cells. In addition to looking at those proteins that partner with TFIIS, this
research will identify the full spectrum of genes in this model organism that
are responsive to the effects of TFIIS. This work will have implications well
beyond this model organism, as TFIIS is a highly conserved protein that also has
relatives that function similarly in many other types of organisms. Indeed, RNA
polymerase II is itself a highly conserved protein, and what this project learns
about its regulation will be transferable almost directly to knowledge about the
regulatory action in other organisms. Much of this research will include the
direct laboratory participation of high school and community college faculty in
order to draw them into the larger scientific research community; their
experiences are expected to enrich their teaching and thus the success of
students in their classrooms.
