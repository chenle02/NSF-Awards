Abstract DBI 9750255 Gail Rocheleau This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral
Research Fellowship in Biosciences Related to the Environment for 1997. This
fellowship provides an opportunity for the Fellow to gain additional scientific
training beyond the doctoral degree and to pursue innovative and imaginative
into the fundamental mechanisms underlying the interactions between organisms
and their environment at the molecular, cellular, organismal, population,
community and/or ecosystem level in any area of biology supported by the
Directorate for Biological Sciences of the National Science Foundation. Each
fellowship supports a research and training plan to be carried out in a
sponsoring laboratory. The research and training plan for this fellowship is
entitled "Molecular analysis of evolutionary and environmental relationships of
plant and animal viruses." Amino acids and nucleotides important for plant viral
RNA-protein complex formation are being identified using biochemical and genetic
methods. The role of the environment in virus evolution is being assessed by
biochemical approaches that examine relationships between two viruses in the
Alphavirus superfamily and by constructing an evolutionary tree.
