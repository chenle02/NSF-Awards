This is a Career Advancement Award in the area of condensed matter physics. This
research investigates the processes that cause transition-metal ions to lose
excitation nonradiatively, rather than radiatively. The nonradiative decay is
relevant to efficiencies of tunable solid-state lasers employing trivalent
chromium, titanium, and divalent cobalt. Such lasers have industrial,
environmental monitoring, and medical applications. Optical and resonance Raman
spectroscopy will be used to measure the vibrational spectra of several
trivalent chromium-doped crystals and glasses that differ in the amount of
energy the chromium ion loses nonradiatively. Relationships between the
vibrational spectrum and the nonradiative rate will be sought. This will add to
the understanding of the electron-phonon interaction in transition-metal ion
doped solids, and may determine which ion/host combinations are likely to
produce better tunable solid-state laser.
