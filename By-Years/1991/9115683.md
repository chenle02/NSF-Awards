The PI will perform rock magnetic and physical properties measurements on
sediments of DSDP Site 317 on the Manihiki Plateau to determine the relationship
between fast plate motion and mantle plume volcanism during the mid Cretaceous.
The results will help test various models proposed to explain the super fast
plate velocities.
