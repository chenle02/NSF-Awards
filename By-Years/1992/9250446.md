The aim of this project is to broaden and strengthen the training of students in
modern light and electron microscopic approaches in biology. The requested
equipment will expand the range of techniques introduced and used in laboratory
exercises and independent research in our Electron Microscopy course, and
increase the available research approaches and sophistication of independent
student research projects. The equipment will also allow the expansion of
instruction in modern cell biology in other advanced courses in our curriculum
as well as in introductory biology courses. Project participation will result in
better education of our upper level students through collaborative
student/faculty research and, an increase in the enthusiasm of our introductory
biology students for science
