This project targets three courses for advancement in educational standards
using alternative teaching methods and integration of computer interactive
media. Students taking general human anatomy, human physiology, and more
advanced anatomy and physiology, use these required courses towards their
ultimate goal of completing vocational and technological schooling. Students
learn by cultivating hands-on skills through finely-tuned contemporary course
laboratory work and interaction with advanced computerized technology. New
exercises, for example, are being introduced in pulse oximetry, oxygen and
hemoglobin dissociation curves, ECG and EMG studies, actual cadaver dissection,
computer-guided and simulated dissections, and programmed histological studies.
