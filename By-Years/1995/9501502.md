ABSTRACT Greiner CTS-9501502 U/Nevada-Reno This work will provide experimental
data and numerical modeling for the heat transfer and pumping power in passages
with transverse grooves. Such grooves have been shown to augment heat transfer
without a commensurate increase in pressure drop, a long-sought-after effect, as
in most cases the increase in heat transfer effectiveness is overridden by high
pumping costs to overcome the commensurate increase in pressure drop.
Applications are in compact heat exchangers for aircraft and other high-density
heat transfer equipment and in industrial scale heat exchange equipment.
