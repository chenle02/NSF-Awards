Orthosis devices (to correct disorders of limbs or spine) currently being
provided to patients are very unappealing. The devices are heavy, large
mechanisms that are excessively restrictive of motion, painful, dangerous, and
slow to provide results. This I-Corps team has developed fiber-reinforced
elasto-fluidics orthosis devices that are lightweight, low cost, soft, and safe
for human interaction. The fiber-reinforced elasto-fluidic systems are soft
mechanical devices that act much like the arm of an octopus. The device can be
made small enough to maintain a low profile while generating sufficient
corrective force. The proposed technology also enables the remaining degrees of
freedom of the body to be unrestricted. This technology provides the opportunity
to develop a wide range of applications that provide solutions to existing
problems, novel applications, and enhancements to existing
designs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on the development of fiber-
reinforced elasto-fluidic technology for applications and markets that it can
benefit. The fiber-reinforced elasto-fluidic systems combine the high strain
energy utilization and flexibility of fibers, the versatility and compressive
load abilities of fluids, and the continuum nature of soft materials, exploiting
the best features of each. These properties and others combine to make elasto-
fluidic systems without contact friction and losses, free of joint backlash,
scalable in size, safe for human interaction, resilient to impact, adaptable to
external forces and constraints, low cost, and high in power density. These
systems have a wide range of forces and motions, are able to be combined in
parallel, form complex shapes, and eliminate the need for subsequent mechanisms
for geometric or mechanical advantage. The elasto-fluidic technology developed
at the University of Michigan converts fluid pressure into a wide range of
forces and three-dimensional kinematic motions well beyond the scope of existing
pneumatic muscles.
