This research will improve the practice of terrestrial remediation by developing
a tool to help engineers design sequential ex-situ remediation. Ex-situ
remediation is one of the fundamental strategies for remediating terrestrial
contamination, but is infrequently considered because it is believed to be
inappropriate or prohibitively expensive. However, there are situations where
ex-situ remediation can be an excellent choice, including sites with numerous,
distributed zones of contamination or Brownfield sites dominated by the problems
of `old` soil contamination. Ex-situ containment avoids the expense of
individual campaigns against distributed sources, and allows reuse of large
portions of sites while small areas accomplish remediation. Ex-situ containment
also allows use of aggressive processes that would not be advisable in situ. For
cases where sequential ex-situ remediation is appropriate, it can improve the
degree of remediation, reduce the cost of remediation and improve the confidence
that performance goals have been achieved. Unfortunately, the greatest
impediment to implementing ex-situ remediation is the lack of a design/analysis
tool to help engineers identify opportunities and to help configure and control
a sequence of ex-situ remediation steps. This research will develop an analysis
tool to help engineers examine the merits of a sequence of remedial actions
applied ex-situ at low cost. This will be designed as a simulation engine
interfacing with a large set of remediation process subprograms. The simulation
engine will define the structure of the problem (geometric containment, soil
structure, barrier systems, environmental interfaces, state variables, etc.).
The subprograms will implement a wide variety of remediation processes (vapor
extraction, bio-venting, bioremediation, soil washing, soil leaching, etc.) from
arbitrary conditions and material fluxes provided by the simulation engine. The
package will help engineers configure treatment sequence, and design control
strategies for sequence operation. This will be a microcomputer analysis package
constructed to run at acceptable speed on conventional `advanced`
microcomputers. The package will be designed with user-friendly interfaces, with
graphical data displays and with extensive report authoring capabilities.
