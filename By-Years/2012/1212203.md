The investigators plan to significantly improve measurements of stellar
temperatures and radii using optical interferometry of 425 giant stars, whose
distances are accurately determined from a recent reanalysis of the Hipparcos
dataset. Through direct measurements of effective temperature, linear radius and
limb darkening, models that indirectly predict such values will be calibrated.
They will use angular size data from the Palomar Testbed Interferometer (PTI)
and Navy Optical Interferometer (NOI) in conjunction with spectrophotometry to
directly determine temperature, radius, and stellar structure for the giant
stars at unprecedented levels of accuracy. Optical and nearinfrared data will be
used to constrain the bolometric fluxes, which in combination with PTI angular
diameters will provide direct measures of temperature.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will have broader impacts to many fields of
stellar astrophysics, including structure, modeling, evolution, galactic
spectral synthesis, exoplanetary science and planet/star formation theory. They
will also participate in a public outreach program with Lowell Observatory.
