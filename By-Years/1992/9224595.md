9224595 Lin Internal gravity waves are ubiquitous phenomenon in and around deep
convective storms. Their influence on local weather conditions, however, has
still not been fully investigated. In this study, the Principal Investigator
will use theoretical studies and numerical model to improve scientific
understanding of the dynamics of mesoscale thermal or mechanical forcing in
shear flows with critical levels. To accomplish this objective the following
specific questions will be addressed: What are the transient and nonlinear
responses of a shear flow with a critical level to thermal forcing? How does the
wave-outflow interaction affect the formation of a density current in a
structured atmosphere? What is the ducting mechanism and the nonlinear effects
of a structured atmosphere with a shear layer and critical level? What is the
condition for wave trapping in a structured atmosphere with jet-like basic flow
and forcing existing in the vicinity or above the critical level? What are the
moist and rotational effects in a shear flow with thermal forcing? ***
