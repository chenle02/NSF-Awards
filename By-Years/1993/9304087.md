Professor Anatol M. Zhabotinsky is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to study spatial pattern formation in chemical
reaction-diffusion systems (RDS). A major goal of this research is to study new
types of chemical wave patterns and ultimately to compile a comprehensive set of
experimental examples of the basic types of wave patterns in chemical RDS which
are supported by a kinetic analysis of the corresponding reaction mechanisms.
The research has two immediate objectives: 1) a search for wave patterns
emerging in uniform stable RDS via the wave (Turing-type 2) bifurcation; and 2)
a study of chemical wave propagation and interaction resulting in new types of
pattern formation in chemical RDS with parametric gradients or anisotropy. The
latter line of work originates from new wave patterns discovered by the
Principal Investigator and collaborators in the Belousov-Zhabotinsky RDS with an
oxygen concentration gradient. %%% Spatial pattern formation in chemical
reaction-diffusion systems (RDS) is an important problem in modern macroscopic
chemical kinetics. Chemical reaction-diffusion patterns constitute the most
convenient analog models for pattern formation in neurobiology, morphogenesis,
chemotaxis, and ecology. A number of oscillating chemical reactions are
important in the functioning of living organisms, and pattern formation is
essential to such fundamental biological functions as cardiac stimulation.
Zhabotinsky's research in this area will provide many important mechanistic
insights into these processes.
