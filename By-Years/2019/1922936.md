#1351981&lt;br/&gt;P.I.: Audrey Ellerbee&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary
research objective of this CAREER Development Proposal (CDP) is to investigate
the potential of morphological and biomechanical characteristics to predict
viability in the early-stage embryo. This CDP incorporates a well integrated
plan for research and education, and biomechanical characteristics to predict
viability in the early-stage embryo. The broadly construed aims include: a)
hardware development, b) software development, c) scientific experimentation, d)
curricular enhancement, e) educational outreach, and f) science policy: This CDP
will produce new hardware and software technology to investigate and fundamental
questions about changes to the Aphysical properties of the embryo in the moments
and hours following fertilization and early development, as well as use that
technology to answer some such questions. Together with my collaborators, I will
perform the first-in-human studies necessary to validate the relevance and
significance of this methodology to address questions regarding fertility that
are of broad interest to developmental biologists. In view of recent evidence of
the predictive power of imaging-based markers for assessing the viability of
embryos, the results of this CDP will likely transform the clinical practice of
fertility treatments like in-vitro fertilization.
