This research will develop techniques to provide seamless and transparent access
to databases on the deep web. In particular, the project will build a metaquery
system that helps users to find and query the databases. The specific tasks will
include source discovery and modeling, semi-structured unified schema
construction, dynamic source selection, metaquery language definition, and
metaquerier system development. The career development plan will include
modernizing the database curriculum as well as promoting interdisciplinary
research.
