This award will enable junior researchers to attend the
upcoming&lt;br/&gt;symposium on spin physics to be held at the University of
Washington. &lt;br/&gt;The meeting will bring together many experts in the field
to discuss&lt;br/&gt;present results and future plans, which will capitalize on
several&lt;br/&gt;experimental facilities that have recently become
available.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
