This Engineering Faculty Internship Initiative proposal addresses a topic of
very high national interest and exposure. It deals with research aimed at
mitigating EMF via redesign of transmission conductor structures. This research
has the potential of expanding the PI's awareness of a troubling issue, and at
the same time will help the PI develop a long-term relationship with an
industrial partner. The project contains matching funds from the industrial
partner.
