This project seeks to sponsor engineering students to attend the 2001 American
Control Conference sponsored by the American Automatic Control Council. The
conference will focus on theoretical issues, engineering methodologies and
industrial applications in every aspect of control research and development. The
goal of this proposal is to develop an opportunity for engineering students to
be informed about the most recent advances in the areas of control theory and
practices. Travel support for student attendance will be advertised nationwide
and women, minorities and disabled students will be especially encouraged to
apply for sponsorship.
