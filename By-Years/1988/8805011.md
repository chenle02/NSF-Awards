This award provides funds for the purchase of shared instrumentation for protein
and DNA chemistry, DNA, plant containment, and biological computing. The
instrumentation will benefit 157 members of the biotechnology community on the
campus of the University of Florida whose research includes: molecular and
genetic characterization of starch genes in corn; structure, function, and
evolution of mammalian mitochondrial ribosomes; molecular enzymology and protein
structure/function; modulation of membrane function by complement; factors
controlling nuclear gene regulation; regulation of mammalian and plant
mitochondria transcription and replication; genetic analysis of mammalian
mitochondrial inheritance; replication of RNA viruses; molecular biology of
higher plant mitochondria; and cell culture, somatic cell genetics and
transformation of grasses. The investigators are doing good research in both
plant and mammalian molecular biology of mitochondria, are productive, and well
funded. //
