In recent years theoretical linguistics has shown increased interest in
compounds, a phenomenon which can be used as a testing ground for different
models of grammar because it lies at the interface of different linguistic
components: phonology, morphology, syntax, and semantics. The focus of this
workshop is a particularly interesting type of compound which has been largely
neglected in the literature: phrasal compounds, illustrated by the German "ein
Lass-mich-in-Ruhe-Blick" and its English counterpart "a leave-me-alone-look".
This type of compound has mixed grammatical properties of both phrases and one-
word lexemes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support U.S. participation
in an international workshop funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, to
be held at the University of Mannheim, Germany, in June, 2013. Workshop
participants will discuss phrasal compounds from a theoretical and cross-
linguistic perspective. The workshop will facilitate the development of a new
long-term international collaboration between researchers at Syracuse University
and the University of Mannheim. The core collaboration and the resulting
research road map will catalyze further work on typologically diverse languages:
Japanese, Turkish and additional Turkic languages, and other Altaic languages
such as Mongolian, in addition to the languages and language families addressed
by the workshop presentations: German and Germanic, Italian and other Romance
languages, as well as Modern Greek.
