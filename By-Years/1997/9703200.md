The project objective is to develop a visual based project control system for
public sector agencies using design-build acquisition techniques. At the core of
the tool is an integrated analytical model which identifies primary control
criteria, analyzes their status from real time data, and provides 3-dimensional
visual feedback. The model will be built using case studies from previous
design-build projects of the Building Research Board and the Design-Build
Institute of America member agencies. 3D animation and a web-based information
system will organize, analyze, and disseminate control reports. Rigorous testing
of the new paradigm will be performed by comparing model results to actual
project performance. Project control in the public sector has not changed
appreciably in the past 25 years. New delivery mechanisms such as design-build
and advances in 3D computing capability merits investigation into new paradigms
of project control. A 3D visual-based control paradigm will significantly
enhance current control systems resulting in improved public sector performance.
