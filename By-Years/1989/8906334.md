Funds are provided for the purchase of an oscilloscope, a displacement
transducer and instrumentation for crack growth studies. This equipment will be
used for high strain rate materials properties testing. Projects on the strain-
rate behavior of fibre-cement composites and interface mechanics at high rates
of loading will be the initial users.
