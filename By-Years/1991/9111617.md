The research combines the expertise of a chemist, Dr. Joseph Justice, and a
biobehavioral scientist, Dr. Darryl Neill, in the study of the relationship
between neurochemistry and behavior. A long standing impediment to understanding
the brain has been the inability to actually observe the changes that occur in
the chemistry of the brain during behavior. To address this problem, the
investigators have developed a new methodology for in vivo measurement of the
neurotransmitter dopamine. They will continue to develop this sytem and apply it
to neurchemical dynamics. Sensors which sample the chemical environment of the
brain will be used to observe neurochemistry during behavior. These studies will
contribute fundamental knowledge about the relationship between the
neurochemisrty of identified neural systems and well characterized behaviors.
