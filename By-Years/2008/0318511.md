0318511&lt;br/&gt;Kirby&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports the acquisition
of a laser diffraction-based automated grain size analyzer in the Geology
Department at Cal State Fullerton. The grain size analyzer, manufactured by
Malvern Instruments, Inc., consists of an optical bench with variable wavelength
laser light sources, a large volume sample dispersion cell, a PC computer for
control, and software for data analysis. The instrument will support regional
faculty and student research in paleolimnology/paleoclimatology. Grain size
analysis of lake sediments helps to interpret the hydrodynamic, local tectonic,
and regional paleoclimate conditions under which the sediments were deposited.
The instrument will find immediate use for faculty and undergraduate student
investigations of clastic-dominated lakes of the southwest U.S. and will yield
proxy data of particular significance to understanding Quaternary and Holocene
climate dynamics in this populated and semi-arid
region.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
