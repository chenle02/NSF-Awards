9408718 Abstract This project is a continued exploration of the use of
Drosophila in genetic approaches to the nervous system. The analysis is applied
to problems in development, including the assembly of the eyes and in the
formation of their connections to the brain. Special attention is paid to the
role of glial cells in these processes, and in their interaction with neurons in
maintenance of the integrity of the brain. Genetic analysis is applied to the
mechanism of transmitter release at synapses, characterization of the proteins
involved, and the effects on behavior of mutations that alter synaptic proteins.
In addition, new molecular genetic techniques are described for isolating
mutations in selected genes that are expressed in specific parts of the nervous
system, and for generating monoclonal antibodies and associated cDNAs for the
corresponding gene products. %%% Given the numerous molecular homologies between
the fly and other organisms, including mammals, Drosophila serves as a model
system for understanding basic mechanisms in the relation of genes to behavior.
