9528855 Smith This project will analyze side-scan sonar (TOBI) DATA from eight
segments of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge between the Atlantic and Kane fracture Zones
in order to document the small-scale (10-100m) morphology of volcanic features.
Maps will be compared with those of fault distribution to identify changes in
pattern of volcanic construction and the relationship of volcanism and faulting.
