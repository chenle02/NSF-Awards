The research component of this program has two major thrusts: 1) an
investigation of the mathematical and computational aspects of the multiframe,
bilinear image- recovery problem; and 2) the development and application of
solutions for problems in the areas of high-resolution transmission electron
microscopy, and ground- and space-based astronomy. Theoretical advances in this
program are providing a unified approach to many imaging problems in which
intensity data are recorded, including those for which satisfactory solutions
have not been previously discovered. Collaborations with materials scientists on
problems such as the study of atomic scale processes in solid batteries are
providing exciting applications for which new methods developed in this program
are being used to enhance the resolving and information-gathering powers of
electron microscopes. Through the teaching component, an educational program is
being established with emphasis on 1) the development of a multidisciplinary
laboratory in which faculty and students from many departments jointly explore
problems in remote sensing and imaging; 2) the development of multidisciplinary
courses in remote sensing and imaging in which students from many departments
are included, and the educations goals for each student - ranging from
theoretical foundations to specific applications - are tailored to his or her
individual needs; and 3) the use of a strong research-teaching exchange in which
cutting-edge technology is used in the classroom and laboratory as a tool to
excite, motivate, and retain enthusiasm in the students
