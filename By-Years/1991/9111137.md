The objectives of this project are to characterize the important soil
weathering processes associated with the transport and/or retention of
radionuclides in soils, to determine the role of various soil constituents in
providing sites for radionuclide accumulation, and to develop radiation
potential maps which augment existing soil and geological maps. The work will be
accomplished in two phases: a field study relating soil properties to
radioactivity levels, and a laboratory leaching experiment which simulates
weathering of soil materials belonging to a representative range of
radioactivity-level groups.
