For many years, society has treated the atmosphere as an infinite reservoir for
diluting emissions from our factories and automobiles. we now know that sulfur
and nitrogen oxide emissions have resulted in the phenomenon of acid rain, which
is detrimental to plant and animal life as well as some building materials.
Atmospheric chemists are engaged in studies of the processes by which these
compounds are oxidized to sulfuric and nitric acids. such chemical information
is necessary if we are ever to predict, for example, the geographical pattern of
acidity reduction which would result from diminished emissions. This project
focuses on hydrogen peroxide, which has been identified as a key oxidant for
dissolved sulfur dioxide. Atmospheric hydrogen peroxide is believed to originate
from hydroperoxyl and superoxide radicals. The production of hydrogen peroxide
has been studied in the laboratory by observing the disappearance of the free
radicals at relatively high concentration in carefully purified solutions. In
this project, cobalt-60 radiation will be used to generate the radicals in
cloudwater at levels characteristic of the ambient atmosphere. Samples will then
be analyzed for the concentration of hydrogen peroxide and the rate of its
formation in the presence and absence of common atmospheric contaminants. The
experiments will help establish the appropriate reaction rates to use in models
incorporating aqueous atmospheric processes.
