9500744 Solomyak This proposal involves the investigation of Bernoulli
convolution measures, self-similar fractal sets and tiling dynamical systems. In
the last 15 years, infinite Bernoulli convolutions have become important in
smooth dynamics and dimension theory. Using recent progress in understanding
these measures, the project will initiate new directions of attack on several
interrelated problems, among them a problem of Palis and Takens on the
morphology of arithmetic differences of Cantor sets. Tilings are used as models
of quasicrystals and a knowledge of their spectrum is important for
applications. The project involves developing a framework for the study of
general hierarchical tilings which would include the notions of a self-similar
tiling. An investigation of spectral properties of old examples and the
construction of new examples will be made using ergodic theory and harmonic
analysis. Finally an investigation will be made of a well-known example of two-
dimensional shift of finite type - the "golden mean" shift. The goal is to
compute the entropy of this shift. Ergodic theory in general concerns
understanding the average behavior of systems whose dynamics is too complicated
or chaotic to be followed in microscopic detail. Tilings and repeated
convolutions can be viewed as dynamical systems. In this way, ergodic theory
makes contact with geometry and analysis. This project involves ergodic theory
problems along the interface with these areas. ***
