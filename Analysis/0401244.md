Abstract for the Summer Symposium in Real Analysis

During June 8-13, 2004, Slippery Rock University will host the Summer Symposium
in Real Analysis XXVIII. Real analysis was formerly considered just a collection
of facts and techniques. Recent results and directions of research have given
new vibrancy to several classical areas of pure and applied analysis and to the
newer arenas of dynamical systems and the study of fractals. Reasons for this
are directly related to the increasing importance of research in classical real
analysis across a broad spectrum of its subdisciplines. Summer research
conferences such as the 2004 Slippery Rock symposium have been a primary vehicle
for exchange of current ideas and directions of this research.

The Slippery Rock Symposium will highlight lectures by both leading experts and
up and coming new researchers. Hour-long lectures will be given by Slawomir
Solecki (University of Illinois), Udayan Darji (University of Louisville), and
Erik Talvila (College of the Fraser Valley). There are also many slots for
twenty-minute contributed talks and there is an evening research problem
session. The symposium will culminate with the traditional banquet and the
awarding of the Andy Award.
