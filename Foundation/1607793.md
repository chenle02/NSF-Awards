The principal investigator plans to organize two 5-day long workshops at the
Centre de Recerca Matematica (CRM) in Bellaterra, Spain, as part of a program in
large cardinals and strong logics at CRM. The program will take place from
September 5 to December 16, 2016, and will comprise lectures and workshops. The
award is intended to support a unique opportunity for active participation of
twelve early-career researchers and graduate students from the U.S. in regular
weekly seminars, workshops, and intensive courses, as well as four established
researchers. The geographical area of the conference, Catalonia, is very strong
in the area of general logic, set theory, and model theory, and the location is
a natural focal point for researchers in Europe and the United States. to
attend. The program's web page is at
http://www.crm.cat/en/Activities/Curs_2016-2017/Pages/IRP-Large-Cardinals-and-
Strong-Logics.aspx, which contains the full program, list of invited
researchers, and scientific events. All CRM activities are posted in the AMS
calendar and EMS website among other web pages.

The thematic program is an opportunity for the dissemination of the results
obtained in the area of strong logics and large cardinals to the broader
mathematical community, and as an invaluable instrument for the consolidation of
a new field of interdisciplinary research. One of the planned workshops is
entitled "Set Theoretical Aspects of the Model Theory of Strong Logics," which
will take place at the beginning of the program, and the other is entitled
"Applications of Strong Logics in Other Areas of Mathematics," which will take
place towards the end of the program. An advanced course aimed at junior
researchers is planned during one of the workshops. The proposed list of
speakers contains the most distinguished international speakers in Set Theory,
Model Theory and Logic, and the program includes the most cutting-edge
developments in research the area.
