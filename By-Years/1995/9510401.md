9510401 Setton This project is a Research Planning Grant made to help increase
the number of new women investigators participating in National Science
Foundation (NSF) research programs, and to facilitate preliminary studies and
other activities related to the development of competitive NSF research
proposals. This project will seek to quantify the state of swelling- induced
residual stress and strain in the anulus fibrosus, a part of the intervertebral
(spinal) disc. Disc degeneration causes great discomfort to a large number of
individuals and results of the investigation are expected to generate new
knowledge for consideration of appropriate tissue substitutes or chemical
treatments to alleviate disc degeneration. The Principal Investigator is
expected to submit a full research proposal to NSF subsequent to the completion
of this project. Gilbert B. Devey August 16, 1995
