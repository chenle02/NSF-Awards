The objective of his research is the development of a consistent theory of the
natural rainbow. This will be achieved, in part, by making new observation with
a spectroradiometer which should enable a useful discrimination to be made
between existing theories. In addition, the inverse problem - the structure and
evolution of raindrop spectra - will be pursued to determine the character of
useful meteorological information which might be extracted from natural rainbows
and a consistent optical theory.
