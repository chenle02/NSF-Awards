This award provides partial support for the 5th NSF Large Facilities Operations
Workshop, which will be hosted by Michigan State University on the site of the
National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL), April 24-26, 2012. The NSF
Large Facilities Operations Workshop has been held annually since 2008 and
provides a forum for discussing best practices and sharing lessons learned from
operational experiences at the NSF-funded large facilities. The workshop will
emphasize fostering close interactions and making new contacts to facilitate
continuous improvement efforts in operational aspects of NSF large facilities.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will address long-term issues such as
workforce development. It is also an excellent venue for cross-fertilizing best
practices at facilities representing a wide array of NSF disciplines.
