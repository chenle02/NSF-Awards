Dr. Narayan S. Hosmane of the Chemistry Department, Southern Methodist
University, is being supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and
Organometallic Program to synthesize extended cage carborane species and
characterize their electrochemical, structural, and spectral properties. These
novel compounds will contain main group and early transition metal elements
"sandwiched" between carborane cages which are linked to form chains. To
accomplish the synthesis, Hosmane will take advantage of the stabilization
afforded carborane cages by attachment of the C-trimethylsilyl group. Stable
carborane carbanions are to be generated by stepwise removal of these silyl
groups. In addition, metallocarborane cages linked by pyrimidine will be
synthesized. %%% The compounds to be prepared are unusual in terms of bonding,
structure, and reactivity. As a result, production of stable species with
interesting electronic properties is a possible outcome. More importantly,
fundamental information will be obtained on the electrochemical properties of a
class of compounds which has not been studied previously. Also, designed
synthesis of extended arrays and development of a means of activating carborane
cages are important developments in borane and carborane chemistry and have
implications for transition metalloborane and metallocarborane cluster
chemistry.
