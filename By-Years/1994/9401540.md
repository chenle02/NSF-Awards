9401540 Smith During the past few years the theory of operator algebras, both
selfadjoint and non-selfadjoint has evolved at a rapid pace. Recent developments
by many researchers are providing further ties between the selfadjoint and non-
selfadjoint aspects of the theory. The proposed work focuses on the theory of
tensor products of operator algebras, complete boundedness for operator
algebras, cohomology theory, and its connection with algebraic topology. Schur
multiplier theory, the structure of derivations and automorphisms of non-
selfadjoint and selfadjoint algebras and compact ideal perturbations in
semifinite algebras will also be studied. Operator theory is concerned with
infinite generalizations of finite matrices. When operator multiplication and
addition are defined on a collection of operators the resulting collection is
called an operator algebra. Cohomology is a theory that examines when local
pieces can be put together to form a global object. This project is concerned
with cohomology on operator algebras. The goal is to contribute to an old
conjecture which asserts that certain cohomologies of operator algebras are
trivial. This would mean that local objects can always be pieced together into a
global object. ***
