This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of
2021 (Public Law 117-2). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To achieve a net-zero emissions
goal by 2050, the United States is prioritizing decarbonization of the
transportation, aviation, and energy-generation sectors. Hydrogen fuel holds
great promise as a clean alternative to fossil fuels. However, hydrogen is now
produced primarily through steam methane reforming (SRM) and coal-gasification
processes that both emit significant CO2, exacerbating climate change. This
Engineering Research Initiative (ERI) project is designed to address two major
environmental threats simultaneously: eliminating CO2 from clean hydrogen fuel
production pathway while reducing the amount of waste mixed plastics now
disposed of in landfills. Specifically, this project will develop methods to
produce carbon-neutral or carbon-negative, hydrogen-enriched syngas. Successful
results will contribute to national health, prosperity, and welfare by advancing
clean energy technology and to national security by moving toward energy
independence. The project will also provide hands-on training in experimental
and modeling approaches to graduate and undergraduate students, who will learn
to work and communicate effectively in diverse teams. Their research engagement
will prepare them for further education and careers as leaders of the 21st-
century clean-energy workforce. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will produce
clean, hydrogen-enriched syngas through the co-gasification of biochar with
waste mixed plastics. The specific objectives are: 1) to modify a fixed-bed
reactor to generate fundamental data on hydrogen-rich syngas production using
catalytic steam co-gasification of biochar and mixed waste plastics; 2) to
identify the optimal catalyst-to-feedstock and steam-to-feedstock ratios to
improve hydrogen content in syngas; 3) to determine the effects of temperature
and feed composition on syngas yield and composition, cold and hot gas
efficiencies, tar content, and carbon-conversion efficiency; and 4) to develop
numerical models to predict and optimize syngas composition from co-gasification
of biochar and mixed waste plastics. A laboratory-scale, fixed-bed, batch-
gasification system will be used to accomplish the objectives. Numerical models
will be developed using commercially available finite-element analysis (FEA)
software. Research outcomes have potential applications in carbon-neutral or
carbon-negative polygeneration processes, such as power generation, and
commercial products, such as jet fuels, methanol, olefins, and
plastics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
