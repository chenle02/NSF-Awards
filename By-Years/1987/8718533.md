Under a previous RUI (Research in Undergraduate Institutions) grant, Cadmus has
established the equipment and reduction procedures needed to monitor
photometrically about three dozen semiregular variable stars. He shall monitor
those stars during the next three years, as originally planned. Cadmus recently
observed one variable star to change its period during a quiescent state.
Interesting results will also be pursued spectroscopically. Many stars grow and
shrink regularly. The observation of their pulsations has provided much
information about stellar interiors and evolution. Now interest grows in
understanding stars that appear to pulsate irregularly, perhaps occasionally
changing pulsation modes. They are likely to provide qualitatively new insights
into stellar structure. Cadmus has established a program to measure the
brightness of selected irregularly variable stars over long enough time periods
so that the causes of the irregularity may be identified. This grant supports
the monitoring program and the spectroscopic follow-up of interesting results.
Students are closely involved in this research, and support is provided under
both the Research in Undergraduate Institutions and the Research Experiences for
Undergraduates programs.
