This proposal requests partial travel support for ten junior investigators to
attend the Conference on Collective Motion in Nuclei Under Extreme Conditions
(COMEX 1) to be held in Paris from June 10-13, 2003. COMEX 1 is the seventh
conference of the Giant Resonance series as well as the&lt;br/&gt;beginning of a
new series that will provide the appropriate forum of discussion for the nuclear
structure physics community. The conference will cover new experimental and
theoretical developments in the study of collective excitations in unstable
nuclei and in nuclei at high temperature or angular momentum. The conference
organizers have committed funds to cover the local costs for ten junior
investigators from the U.S. The requested funds will support half the travel
costs for ten students who would make important and valuable contributions to
the conference, but who would not be able to participate without financial
assistance.&lt;br/&gt;
