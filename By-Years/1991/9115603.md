This research has a three-fold goal: (1) to develop tools for building
intelligent systems that require tightly coupled logical and numerical
computation; (2) to apply mathematical programming and constrained optimization
techniques to do logical inference and, (3) to test the efficacy of highly
parallel constraint logic programming systems in this arena. Constraint logic
programming (CLP) provides a natural paradigm to link logical computation and
numerical computation. This research is based on compact CLP languages which are
supersets of linear and integer programming and support the data structures
necessary for mathematical programming rather than on constraint based
extensions to Prolog. The fit between the applications and constraint logic
programming opens up several avenues for parallelism, since logic programming
systems have direct hooks into both or-parallelism and and-parallelism.
