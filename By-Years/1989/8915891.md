This proposal is to test the long-range capability for acoustic transmission
from Heard Island in the south Indian Ocean to listening stations on the east
and west coasts of the U.S. Since the travel time across the ocean is primarily
a function of the ocean temperature, the signals may be inverted for ocean
temperatures. Initially the work is to provide an acoustic signal and determine
if may be heard sufficiently well to be used as a proxy for temperature. If
successful, a long-term deployment may be considered for climatic monitoring
purposes.
