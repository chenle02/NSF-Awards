Intellectual Merit: Understanding how genes are turned on and off is a major key
to understanding life. There are many levels of gene regulation in biology, such
as the decision to copy the DNA into a messenger RNA or the decisions that
regulate how much protein is translated from the messenger RNA. This project
focuses on another level of gene regulation, i.e. mRNA stability. The longer an
mRNA stays around, the more protein can be made from it. Nonsense-mediated mRNA
decay (NMD) is a mechanism that controls RNA stability. The NMD degradation
pathway depends on the placement of signals in the RNA that stop protein
translation; the shorter the protein that is made, the less stable the RNA. One
way that mRNAs can gain stop signals is through alternative splicing;
approximately one third of the genes that undergo alternative splicing generate
an alternative messenger RNA that is preferentially destroyed by the NMD
pathway. The main goal of this project is to study the regulation of the NMD
pathway using the model organism, Caenorhabditis elegans. Specific aims are: 1)
to understand the relationship between alternative splicing and NMD; 2) to
identify molecules that control the NMD process; and 3) to probe the
relationship between translational state (whether a mRNA is making protein or
not) and efficiency of NMD. Because NMD is an important quality control
mechanism for RNA in the cell, these studies will make important contributions
to our understanding of gene regulation.

Broader Impacts: This project will provide training opportunities for both
graduate and undergraduate students. The experiments to be conducted in this
project are perfect for introducing undergraduates to the excitement of research
science. The laboratory has a history of recruiting undergraduates from
underrepresented groups and will continue to do so in this project.
