This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of
2021 (Public Law 117-2). This project addresses how prior military service
affects the appointment and performance of high-level political advisors by
developing and analyzing a new cross-national data set detailing the military
experience of political appointees around the world. The cross-national data set
includes descriptive information on political appointees post-World War II and
allows scholars and policymakers to better understand the beliefs and actions of
high-level political appointees to both military and civilian government
appointments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project compiles a database of military
experience for tens of thousands of cabinet-level officials, in more than 150
countries during the post-World War II era. It provides information on the
duration and branch of service, final rank, combat experience, commendations,
and service with rebel groups, among other relevant factors. The new data set
helps to address a range of questions regarding political appointees, including
the likelihood of veteran appointments, the effect of veteran advisors on the
hawkishness or dovishness of foreign policy, and the effect of such officials on
the probability of military victory. The complete data set advances basic
research on executive appointments, civil-military relations, and international
conflict, among other subfields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
