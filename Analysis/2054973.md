The research activities of this project will continue to deepen and broaden our
understanding of two intimately connected mathematical fields: partial
differential equations and differential geometry. The project will have an
impact in the study of special Lagrangian equations, complex Monge-Ampère
equations, and Hamiltonian stationary equations, which provide the mathematical
foundation for mirror symmetry in the string theory of modern physics, and of
maximal surface systems, which have the roots in general relativity. These
Hessian equations are also related to nonlinear elasticity theory in mechanics,
which studies the mechanisms whereby a material that is stretched returns to its
original size and shape. The project provides research training opportunities
for graduate students. The objectives for special Lagrangian equations are to
derive Schauder and Calderón-Zygmund estimates for equations with critical and
supercritical phases, to answer whether any homogeneous order two solution in
dimension five or higher is trivial, to study low regularity of continuous
viscosity solutions to the equations with subcritical phases, to investigate the
existence and uniqueness of solutions to the Dirichlet problem for the special
Lagrangian equation with continuous variable phase, and to resolve periodic
Liouville problems with constraints as well as (entire) Liouville problem for
the complex version of the special Lagrangian equation. The aim for symmetric
sigma-k equations is to investigate Hessian estimates and regularity for sigma-2
equations in dimension four and higher, to obtain Schauder and Calderón-Zygmund
estimates for 3-d sigma-2 equations, and to study the Liouville problem for
sigma-k equations. The plan for complex and real Monge-Ampère equations is to
demonstrate the triviality of any global solution to complex Monge-Ampère
equations including self-shrinking equations for the Kähler-Ricci flow with
certain necessary restrictions and to derive regularity of solutions to the real
Monge-Ampère equations under a noncollapsing condition. For the case of maximal
surface systems the goal is to study the Bernstein problems for exterior
solutions and regularity for solutions under a noncollapsing condition. The
project will also take on Hamiltonian stationary equations, where it aims to
establish existence of the solutions to the second boundary value problem and
rigidity for the Hamiltonian stationary equations.
