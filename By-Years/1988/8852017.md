Pembroke State University will purchase microcomputers, associated computer
peripherals, and physics apparatus. This equipment will be used to improve
instruction in the introductory physical science laboratory course. The
students, many of whom are prospective teachers, will learn the fundamentals of
computer assisted data acquisition and analysis. Pembroke State University will
match the NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.
