The goal of this program is the development of a novel membrane-based two-phase
flow system for the separation of enantiomers in a racemic mixture. This system
is based on the use of chiral fine particles, which selectively adsorb one of
two enantiomers from an organic solution containing the racemic mixture.
Preliminary experimental results support the proposed approach. The process
promises to offer substantial advantages over competing enantiomer-separation
processes, including kinetic resolution, diasteromeric derivatization, and
chiral chromatography. These advantages include: 1) high selectivity, 2) low
cost, 3) suitability for use on a preoperative (e.g., 1- to 100-gram) scale, and
4) wide applicability for many chiral compounds. In Phase I, the feasibility of
the process for the separation of enantiomers of propranolol, an important
cardiovascular drug, from a racemic mixture will be demonstrated. In Phase II,
the approach will be evaluated and characterized for the separation of a wide
spectrum of pharmacologically relevant chiral compounds and the process will be
optimized for a selected compound. Based on the commercial promise of this
concept, it is expected to proceed directly to commercialization of the process
in Phase III.
