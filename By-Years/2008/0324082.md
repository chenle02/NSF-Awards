This project is providing a total of 20 scholarships per year to students
majoring in either computer science or mathematics. The scholarships are being
awarded to students with demonstrated financial need and academic ability. The
project is increasing the number of majors, particularly from underrepresented
groups, in the indicated fields. A learning community is being used to increase
the graduation and retention rates in the participating programs. The learning
community is providing faculty-student mentoring, internships at local
companies, guest speakers and tours of local industry. The community is also
helping students to develop skills for learning outside the classroom. Through
this project, the institution is also developing a close partnership with local
companies.
