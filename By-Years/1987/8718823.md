This award to Stanford University will allow the investigator to conduct
research on the social history of the Ethiopian revolution as it was experienced
in a remote area of the country from 1974 to 1984. The investogator has
extensive experience in the country and will study the role of religion as it
influenced the course of social change. The hypothesis of the project is that
the "top-down" nature of the Ethiopian revolution makes it a fundamentally
different sort of social process than the "bottom- up" revolutionary experiences
of China and Russia. This research is important because it builds upon the
researcher's extensive prior experience with the Ethiopian social situation to
allow him to explain the local significance of the revolution. In a world in
which political unrest is pervasive, such a contribution to our understanding of
how revolutions are experienced will help us deal with the different countries
of the world as they work out their different political arrangements.
