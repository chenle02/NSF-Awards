Over the past two decades, several important reforms of America's public and
private child support systems have been debated, and some successfully
implemented, particularly at the state level. These reforms make a striking
difference in the ways the costs and benefits of child-rearing are shared
between parents and between parents and governments. By increasing the
effectiveness of collection systems, the reforms in the child support systems
seek to partially shift costs from mothers and governments to fathers. Some
states are also experimenting with a publicly-assured child support benefit. But
why do some states adopt innovations in child support and not others? What
explains differences in the character of child support policy across states?
This project addresses these two issues through a comparative analysis of four
states that have been among the key innovators in the child support area:
California, New York, Texas, and Wisconsin. This analysis will be supplemented
by comparisons with several states where child support reform has not occurred.
Both sets of comparisons will be structured by hypotheses drawn from studies of
the welfare state. A consideration of federal child support policy developments
will provide an understanding of the context within which state reform
initiatives take place. This study will offer an explanation for innovation and
the specific policy content of the four states on the cutting edge of
innovation. It will also contribute to our understanding of welfare policy, by
exploring the relationship between gender and social policy, an area of social-
scientific analysis which is attracting new attention. Given the growing numbers
of mother-only families and the scholarly interest in social policy, this
project should offer insights about child support policy of interest to citizens
and social scientists alike.
