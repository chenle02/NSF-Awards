The cells of mammals, birds and reptiles have as their outer edge a thin layer,
a cell membrane, that is composed of fatty molecules (lipids). The inside of the
cell has a different concentration of charged molecules from the outside of the
cell, resulting in an electric field across the membrane that changes its
mechanical properties. The mechanical properties of the cell membrane have a
profound effect upon how the cell functions. The research will determine by
experiment how the mechanical properties of a cell membrane change as the result
of exposure to electrical fields. The results of the experiments will be modeled
using the engineering methods of 'shell theory' which can model the effects of
the curvature of a thin material on its mechanical
properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An electric potential difference across the
plasma membrane is common to all living cells and is essential to physiological
functions such as generation of action potentials for cell-to-cell
communication. While the basics of cell electrical activity are well established
(e.g. the Hodgkin-Huxley model of the action potential), the coupling between
voltage and membrane deformation has received limited attention. To fill this
void, a combined theoretical and experimental study of biomimetic membranes in
externally applied electric fields will be studied. Specifically, the research
seeks to determine the relation between membrane voltage, membrane properties
such as bending rigidity, tension, and spontaneous curvature, and membrane
shape. The project integrates theory and experiment to analyze both the small
thermally-driven bilayer undulations and the large buckling-like deformations in
an applied electric field. The transformative impact of the project lies in its
pioneering research of the dynamic coupling between shape and voltage of
biomembranes; our findings will uncover new physics relevant to a broad range of
physiological processes involving excitable cells.
