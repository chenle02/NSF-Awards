The goal of the project is to provide a unique approach to instruction in all
Zoology, Anatomy and Physiology, and Microbiology laboratories at Itawamba
Community College. By utilizing video equipment in each lab, the instructor can
instruct each student more effectively. The utilization of this equipment will
provide a more effective laboratory learning experience for all biology
students, by allowing the students to see microscopic specimens more clearly,
see demonstration dissections more clearly, and will allow students to review
procedures performed as many times as he/she wishes. The new equipment will also
allow instructors to develop lab activities for students that are physically
challenged.
