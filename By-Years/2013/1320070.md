The proposal requests for travel funds to support US participants, particularly
graduate students and recent Ph.D.s, to attend the international workshop Model
Theory 2013 that will be held June 10-15 in Ravello Italy.

One of the objectives of this workshop will be bringing together researchers in
Model Theory and other areas of mathematics where model theory has had
significant applications. By presenting and discussion problems as well as
recent advances in these areas we hope to facilitate further interactions.

Another goal of the workshop is to provide an informal setting where graduate
students and younger researchers from US can learn about new trends and interact
with one another as well as with prominent senior mathematicians. There will be
three tutorials on recent developments in Model Theory given by experts and
aimed mostly at young researchers.

The workshop is expecting participation from a large number of graduate student
and recent Ph.D.s. Besides providing an opportunity for researchers to exchange
ideas and discuss open problems, another equally important goal of the workshop
is to foster interaction among graduate students and recent Ph.D by providing a
setting contacts with junior and senior researchers are naturally and easily
made.
