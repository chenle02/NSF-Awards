The coordinate expression of genes whose products act jointly in a biochemical
pathway is a focal point of regulatory biology in many organisms. The objective
of the proposed research is to characterize cis- and trans-acting factors that
control the transcriptional expression of several genes in the biosynthetic
pathway for anthocyanin pigments in maize. Anthocyanin synthesis requires the
products of both structural and regulatory genes. The results of genetic and
molecular analyses implicate two of the regulatory genes, C1 (Colored
aleurone-1) and Pl (Purple plant) as positive trans-activators that perform
analogous regulatory functions in distinct tissues to control pigmentationin the
kernel and the plant, respectively. This proposal is aimed at evaluating the
molecular interactions between C1 or P1 and the genes whose transcription they
control. Nuclear extracts from maize tissues will be used in DNase I
footprinting experiments to identify cis-acting elements in cloned target genes.
Both in vitro and in vivo assays will be performed to determine if the C1 and P1
gene products are capable of specifically binding target elements and/or
activating transcription. Molecular genetic approaches will be used to explore
the regulation of C1 and P1 themselves with the goal of identifying other
factors that mediate the tissue-specific expression of these regulatory genes.
The pathway for anthocyanin biosynthesis in maize has been the focus of many of
the extensive genetic studies in corn, primariy because of the ease of detecting
color mutants. This study will deepen our insight into how genes encoding
structural protein are regulated in their expression in plants.
