The radiative opacity of stellar material is fundamental to calculations of
stellar structure, evolution and pulsation. In 1985 M.J. Seaton of University
College London proposed an international project which would exploit modern
computing capacity to produce an up-to-date set of opacities. The calculations
are now finished and this grant will support setting up a database system to
provide network access to the results. It will also have the capability to
calculate various physical quantities from the database to the specifications of
the user.
