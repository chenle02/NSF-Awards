This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral Dissertation Research
program. It will be a study of work attitudes, contrasting male and female
workers' group orientation in Japan and the United States, based on statistical
analysis of an existing dataset of 8,302 survey respondents. Statistical
techniques such as regression and path analysis will apply four conceptual
approaches: culturalist theory, the cultural contingency model of worker
attitudes and behavior, Koike's model of skill acquisition, and a conflict model
of labor control. This research will contribute to the sociology of gender and
work roles, as well as to comparative studies of Japan and the United States,
potentially contributing to American industrial policy. In addition to the
scientific gains to be achieved by the research, this award will materially
assist a highly promising student in completing research for the Ph.D.
dissertation. Thus it contributes to future scientific manpower and the thorough
training of the next generation of sociologists.
