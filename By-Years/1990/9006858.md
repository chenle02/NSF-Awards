The goal of the proposed research is to determine the causes and consequences
of the shift by a plant parasitic fungus to new plant species that it could not
infect previously. The investigator will conduct several experiments designed to
determine whether the shift to new host species resulted from genetic changes in
the fungi or the plants, or whether the shift occurred independently of genetic
changes. Preliminary results suggests that genetic changes in the fungi allow
them to infect additional host species. In addition, he will investigate how the
new fungal/plant combinations are adapting to each other compared with the old
combinations, particularly whether the fungus differs in its pathogenicity on
the new host species. This research has important basic and applied
significance. Most previous research on host/parasite interactions has
considered association that are historically ancient. Little research has
considered biological interactions between host and parasite in the early
establishment of the relationship when important evolutionary changes are likely
to occur. This research will provide significant information about this early
stage. The research will also have important applied significance in
understanding how disease organisms gain the ability to infect new host species
that previously were resistant to infection. The movement of the AIDS virus from
primates to humans is an example of how significant this process can be. Because
the host plants in this study are grasses, our most important group of
agricultural plants, this research will aid in understanding and perhaps
preventing disease epidemics in crop grasses like corn, rice, and wheat.
