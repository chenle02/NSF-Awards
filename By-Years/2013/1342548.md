This grant supports participation of approximately 22 US dissertation-stage
doctoral students in the Organizational Communication and Information Systems
(OCIS) doctoral consortium to be held at the Academy of Management meeting in
Lake Buena Vista, Florida, in August 2013. The OCIS doctoral consortium is a
research-focused meeting that has taken place annually at the Academy of
Management conference since 2000, and has helped to launch the careers of many
outstanding researchers in organizational communication and information systems.
Goals of the workshop include building a cohort group of new researchers who
will then have a network of colleagues spread out across the world, guiding the
work of new researchers by having experts in the research field give them
advice, and making it possible for promising new entrants to the field to attend
their research conference. Student participants will make formal presentations
of their research during the workshop, and will receive feedback from a faculty
panel. The feedback is geared to helping students understand and articulate how
their work is positioned relative to other OCIS research, whether their topics
are adequately focused for thesis research projects, whether their methods are
correctly chosen and applied, and whether their results are appropriately
analyzed and presented. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The annual OCIS doctoral
consortia traditionally bring together the best of the next generation of
researchers in organizational communication and information systems, allowing
them to create a social network both among themselves and with senior
researchers at a critical stage in their professional development. Applications
are encouraged from all doctoral students whose research is OCIS-related,
regardless of the fields in which they are earning their degrees. Participants
will be a diverse group with regard to their research topics, methods,
backgrounds, and the kinds of institutions they attend.
