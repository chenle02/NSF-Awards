This is a proposal for a conference of social scientists on the topic of
computing innovations in the social sciences. The conference will be held for
two and a half days in early October 1987 at Cornell University. It is organized
and hosted by the Cornell Institute of Social and Economic Research (CISER),
under the direction of Robert McGinnis, Professor of Sociology and Director of
CISER. The conference will center on a) establishing local and regional
communication networks for social science research; b)integrating
superminicomputers into the networks; c) social science computation on
supercomputers; d) innovations in statistical packages and graphics; e) data
archiving, retrieval and network distribution. The profusion of new technologies
and software places a premium on the continuous updating of computer skills. The
conference will provide demonstrations of innovative hardware and software for
use by social scientists and will promote technology transfer both among leading
edge groups and from them to smaller academic research groups.
