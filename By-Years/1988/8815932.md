This award will enable Prof. R. David Dallmeyer of the University of Georgia to
collaborate with Dr. Akira Takasu of Shimane University, Japan, over a period of
two years. They will investigate the geochronology of a particular geological
formation on the Japanese islands of Shikoku and Honshu, using a radioactive
argon isotope dating method to verify and calibrate time-pressure evolutionary
histories of the area. The purpose of this research is to enhance our
understanding of the thermal and high-pressure phenomena which led to the
current status of the geological structure that is known as the Sambagawa
terrane in the Japanese islands. Understanding the precise timing, regional
distribution, and overprinting relationships of the metamorphic structural
events that have contributed to the formation of this terrane would enable
geologists to completely assess the thermal effects associated with the various
Japanese orogenic cycles, with resulting increase in understanding not only of
important Japanese geological events, but of such events anywhere. The U.S.
researcher is an expert in the argon dating techniques to be employed, and his
Japanese collaborator performed the original survey of the geological history of
the Sambagawa terrane.
