The Cyberlearning Resource Center (CRC) has responsibility for promoting
integrative collaboration among cyberlearning grantees (across NSF programs);
synthesis and national dissemination of cyberlearning findings, technologies,
models, materials, and best practices; creating a national presence for
Cyberlearning; helping the disparate Cyberlearning research and development
communities coordinate efforts to build capacity; and providing infrastructure
(technological and social) for supporting these efforts. Monitored through the
Cyberlearning: Transforming Education program, the CRC serves as a resource for
all NSF grantees and programs with cyberlearning components, helping to promote
synergy and integrate projects across NSF's cyberlearning investments.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Among society's central challenges are amplifying,
expanding, and transforming opportunities people have for learning and more
effectively drawing in, motivating, and engaging young learners. Engaging
actively as a citizen and productively in the workforce requires understanding a
broad variety of concepts and possessing the ability to collaborate, learn,
solve problems, and make decisions. Whether learning is facilitated in school or
out of school, and whether learners are youngsters or adults, to develop such
knowledge and capabilities, learners must be motivated to learn, actively engage
over the long term in learning activities, and put forth sustained cognitive and
social effort. Consistent with NSF's mission and strategic plan, a variety of
programs at NSF invest in research aimed towards achieving these goals. In
support of this important thematic thrust, the Cyberlearning Resource Center
works with researchers and NSF program officers to identify and disseminate
findings from across programs and projects; develop ways to broker productive
partnerships and collaborations; convene meetings for purposes of envisioning
the future, integrating findings, and building capacity,; and monitor the
cyberlearning portfolio and its influences and impacts.
