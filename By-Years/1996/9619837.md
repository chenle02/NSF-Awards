Undergraduate Research Experience in Mathematics will provide a unique
opportunity for undergraduate students to get involved in research in dynamical
systems, Algebra, and statistics. In dynamical systems, participants will
investigate stability, ergodicity and chaos of simple one dimensional nonlinear
maps as well as piecewise linear planar maps. In Algebra, students will
investigate monoids determined by Linear Diophantine equations. In statistics,
they will study regression models using the norms l_1 and l_infinity and some
statistical models for genetic linkage. Although the tools and techniques needed
are of elementary nature and accessible to the students, the problems involved
are far from being completely understood by active researchers in the field.
Hence this research program will be challenging and exciting to all the
participants. Through computer experimentation, students will explore and make
conjectures about the mathematical theory. Then they will be asked to prove it
analytically if possible.
