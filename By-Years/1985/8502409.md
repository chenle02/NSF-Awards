This project investigates the identification and characterization of the micro-
sized crystalline products formed when inorganic components are rapidly
precipitated from solution containing a specific additive component. These
precipitations are derived in most instances by homogeneous nucleation and under
conditions of large supersaturations, as two solutions are rapidly mixed in a
flow-mixing device (Nielson rapid mixing method). To broaden application of the
technique, a modification permits use of more soluble systems through secondary
nucleation mechanisms. The product crystals are characterized to determine the
extent of crystallinity and the uniformity of additive distribution by electron
microscope and X-ray methods. The underlying model visualized and employed in
devising the experiments is that continuous crystal growth occurs, i.e., the
crystal surface is diffuse. The motivation for this work is to produce uniform
solid mixtures suitable for several applications, such as raw materials for
refractory materials, catalysts, and semiconductor systems. The work also
provides insight into the basic mechanisms involved when rapid crystal growth
from solution occurs.
