Anthropological studies of health and culture change emphasize that such change
is frequently a significant source of psychosocial stress. Numerous studies have
now consistently demonstrated the negative effects of stress on human immune
function. This study proposes to introduce a developmental perspective to
anthropological studies of stress and culture change, and to incorporate
immunological measures into the anthropology of stress and adaptation.
Individuals from 6 Western Samoan villages undergoing varying degrees of
modernization will be assessed for Epstein-Barr virus antibody levels (a measure
of cell-mediated immune function), cortisol (a measure of reactivity), and
C-reactive protein (a marker of pathogen exposure). These measures will be
obtained from dried blood spots collected via finger-stick blood samples in
collaboration with the annual Department of Health filariasis survey. Data also
will be collected on multiple dimensions of stress and culture change. This
study pursues a cross-cultural perspective on the relationships between stress
and immune function and applies a developmental perspective to the problem of
modernization stress.
