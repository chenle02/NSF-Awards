Photosynthesis is the process used by plants and photosynthetic bacteria to
convert sunlight into chemical energy. This process involves light initiated
electron transfer reactions which take place in a protein complex called the
reaction center. The reaction centers from photosynthetic organisms are being
studied by a variety of biophysical and structural techniques including X-ray
crystallography. Dr. Okamura will devote a major effort of his research to the
purification and characterization of reaction centers from Photosystem II. The
cytochrome binding site will also be studied by site specific mutagenesis of
specific amino acid residues on the reaction center in order to determine their
role in cytochrome binding and electron transfer. This is an exciting new area
which should yield new and interesting results concerning the molecular basis
for photosynthesis.
