This award is to make the very large data sets collected by the antarctic
Automatic Geophysical Observatories (AGO's) available in convenient and
standardized format to the international team of AGO investigators, including
the principal investigators (PI's) of this grant. The data will also be archived
and data summary plots and data sets of key parameters will be provided to the
international AGO Data Analysis Facility (ADAF) in Frascati, Italy. The research
is on ionospheric and magnetospheric phenomena at very high magnetic latitudes,
within the polar cap. One of the PI's will be doing research using the data to
study the magnetosphere, particularly solar-wind/magnetosphere interactions,
while the other PI will be involving undergraduate students in developing new
techniques and protocols for the archiving, storage and transferring of very
large data sets. This award supports research at Augsburg College, an
Undergraduate institution.
