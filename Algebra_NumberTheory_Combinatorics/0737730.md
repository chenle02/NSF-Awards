Recent years have seen the emergence of an exciting new interdisciplinary field
situated in the area between mathematics, computer science and statistical
physics, concerned broadly with the study of "probability theory on graphs" or
"statistical mechanics on graphs" (or on other combinatorial structures). This
new field is attracting a great deal of international interest, as exemplified
by the flourishing of interdisciplinary journals such as _Combinatorics,
Probability and Computing_ and _Random Structures and Algorithms_. Very
frequently, identical problems arise independently in combinatorics and
statistical mechanics, albeit in different guises, and much recent progress has
come from exploiting the cross-fertilization of methods.

The Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences (Cambridge University, UK)
will be holding a 6-month program on Combinatorics and Statistical Mechanics
from January-June 2008. The PI is one of the co-organizers of this
interdisciplinary program. The aims of this program are to bring together
expertise in the areas of graph theory and combinatorics, statistical mechanics,
probability and computer science to attack unsolved problems that seem ripe for
solution. A further aim is attract research students and postdoctoral fellows by
providing brief tutorial lectures in each field and by offering them close
contact with leading researchers.

This is a group travel grant aimed at supporting the participation of U.S.-based
researchers, with special emphasis on those who may not have access to
alternative funding sources for their travel and subsistence: particularly young
researchers, women, minorities, and researchers based at small colleges.
