Perhaps no issue is more important for US science policy than understanding why
qualified women (and men) do or do not choose careers in science and
engineering. The quality of a nation's scientific workforce determines, in large
part, the quality of its science. If qualified women avoid careers in science
and engineering, science and the nation suffer.

Since World War Two, women have been increasingly attracted to technical fields.
Women have recently become a majority of college students and college graduates,
they represent a majority of applicants to medical school, a majority in
accounting and auditing, and they apply to law programs in numbers equivalent to
men. In addition, women have been gaining in performance on quantitative skills
tests. In 1979, women had a 2 percentile point deficit relative to men on the
mathematical ability test on the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth; but in
the 1997 cohort they had a 4 percentile point advantage. Yet women constitute
less than a third of degree holders in the physical sciences and hold only ten
percent of recent degrees in engineering.

This project seeks to understand why women have flooded into some traditionally
male fields, but not into others, despite their increasingly strong technical
qualifications. The research team addresses this question via analyses of the
effects of starting careers in science and engineering on marriage rates,
divorce rates and fertility rates. They will also consider how labor market
interruptions affect the lifecycle path of women's earnings in various fields.
These analyses directly address concerns in the literature that science and
engineering impose relatively (compared to other fields) large costs on family
formation. The researchers will compare the results from US data with results
from parallel analyses of British data conducted by collaborators in the UK.
