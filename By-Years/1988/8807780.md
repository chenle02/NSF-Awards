This conference will bring together an international group experts on various
aspects of RNA function. Some of these aspects are newly emerging areas of
intensive research, and one of them has never before been the subject of a
formally convened session. The series of conferences to which this one belongs
are noted for their promotion of lively exchange of ideas, as well as the
unusual opportunity they have provided for younger scientists (students and
postdoctoral fellows) to participate in face-to-face discussions with
acknowledged leaders in the field. The discussions at this conference will
permit exchange of ideas among experts who would not normally interact, and
should thus provide a great impetus for research in this exciting field.
