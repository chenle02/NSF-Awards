The profound effect of body temperature on physiology can have a major impact
on the ecology and survival of organisms. Consequently, global climate warming
may have manifold biological repercussions. However, the effects of climate
warming might be ameliorated if evolution can quickly alter the thermal
sensitivity of fast-breeding organisms such as insects. This project will use
two different approaches to study experimentally how fruit flies respond
evolutionary to simulated climate change in the laboratory. The first approach
uses an efficient new technique that enables us to breed flies that are very
resistant to periodic exposure to heat or cold or both. This approach involves
monitoring physiological divergence in stocks of flies that have already been
evolving at different temperatures for several years. This study will monitor
how quickly physiology responds evolutionarily to a sustained shift in (non-
extreme) temperatures. Using both sets of flies, we will determine how quickly
the sensitivity of physiology to temperature can evolve as well as any important
side effects (life history, resistance to other studies will have direct
implications for projection models of how insect populations will respond to
global climate warming.
