The small-scale structural fabric of Earth's inner core and lower mantle is
important to the understanding of mantle convection, slab cycling, plume
formation, and solidification of the inner core, including the dynamic
deformation of the inner core boundary and its relation to the differential
rotation of the inner core and mantle and the earth's magnetic field. Seismic
modeling will be performed to image the small-scale (1-1000 km) fabric of the
inner core and lowermost mantle that are important to these processes. Waveforms
of the PKIKP seismic phase will be modeled to determine the depth dependence,
lateral variation, anisotropy, and frequency dependence of inner core visco-
elasticity, and crystalline fabric to constrain models of inner core
solidification. Seismic waveform modeling will also be performed to constrain
the statistical and deterministic structure of the lowermost mantle, which can
provide important signatures that can enable a discrimination among the proposed
origins of the heterogeneous structure in this region: remnant slabs, solid-
solid phase transitions, pools of primitive mantle, partial melt, and core-
mantle chemical reactions.&lt;br/&gt;-- &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
