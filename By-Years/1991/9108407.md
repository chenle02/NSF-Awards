With National Science Foundation support, the Logan Museum of Anthropology at
Beloit College will conserve its important Old World archaeology collection. It
will renovate existing space to create a clean, secure and environmentally
stable storage and research area. The collection will be inventoried and
reorganized to make it accessible for modern research methods. New
conservationally sound storage cabinets will be purchased to house the
collections and the extensive original documentation will be preserved through
archival processing and duplication. A guide to documentation will be prepared
to enable researchers to make full use of the resource. The collection consists
of Old World archaeological material systematically assembled as instructional
material for the teaching of archaeology to students of Beloit College. It
includes over 90,000 individual specimens of stone and bone tools and faunal
remains representing 152 sites in 10 European and North African countries. A
wide range of time - in excess of one million years - is represented and it
constitutes a valuable scientific resource. Of special significance are European
Upper Paleolithic materials for these include art objects which document the
emergence of modern human culture. Because of the way they have been curated,
these specimens are in danger of deterioration and it is difficult for
scientists to study them. With NSF funds the materials will be securely housed
and made maximally available for research.
