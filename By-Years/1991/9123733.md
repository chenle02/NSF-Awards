The basic process of fertilization, fusion of egge sperm, is well known in
animals. Flowering plants also produce eggs and sperm, but little is known about
the mechanism of fertilization. Plant sperm are embedded in pollen grains and
move down the growing pollen tube to the egg. Near the egg, the pollen tube
bursts and releases two sperms. One sperm fuse with the egg to form the embryo
of the seed. The second sperm fuses with the central cell adjacent to the egg to
form a nutritive tissue for the developing embryo. A major unanswered question
in plant reproduction is how sperm recognize the egg and central cell, and then
adhere and fuse. A bioassay for sperm-egg adhesion will be developed using
frozen sections of embryo sacs, including eggs and central cells, with isolated
sperm. The bioassay will be useful to test mechanisms of sperm-egg recognition
and to determine which antibodies to sperm cell surfaces can inhibit sperm-egg
adhesion. The results will expand our knowledge of plant fertilization, create a
model system for investigating plant reproduction, and lead to identification of
key molecules in the fertilization process for future genetic transformations.
