9415287 Saito This award supports a 12-month Science and Technology Agency of
Japan Postdoctoral Fellowship for Dr. Hiroshi Saito, Department of Chemical
Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, at the National Institute
for Resources and Environment, Tsukuba, Japan. Dr. Saito will work with Dr.
Atsushi Inaba in the Energy Resources Department, on a research project
entitled, "Japan STA Program: Rapid Coal Pyrolysis for the Production of Coke."
In the production of iron, coke serves as fuel, reducing agent and binding agent
and is usually produced by carbonizing premium coal. Due to depleting premium
coal supplies, the iron industry is focusing on utilizing lower grade coals to
produce coke. A limited understanding of the requirements for making good coke
from lower grade coal restrains production despite economic motivations. Dr.
Saito and Dr. Inaba will conduct thermal coal pyrolysis using a
thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) to study the effects of pressure and
temperature on the thermal degradation kinetic rates of various grades of coal.
The team will then utilize a free-fall apparatus to examine particle
distribution and size and to simulate thermal degradation using the results of
the TGA experiments. The project will provide kinetics data, mass transfer data
and models for low grade coals which can then be used by the iron industry to
efficiently use coal as an energy and raw material resource. ***
