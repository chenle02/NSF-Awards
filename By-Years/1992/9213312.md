This award is made as the starter grant increment of Dr. Richard Gibbs'
Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Chemistry Award in support of his research
at Wayne State University. The research is concerned with chemical reactions
modifying ras proteins, which are present in virtually all eukaryotic cells and
are believed to be critical in signal transduction. The chemical reactions which
Gibbs will study are related to transformations thought to be essential to ras
protein activity in living systems, including farnesylation of a cysteine
function, cleavage of three c-terminal amino acids, and methylation of a
cysteine carboxylate function. An assay system will be developed for the
protease involved, the protease will be characterized, and an enzyme inhibitor
will be designed and synthesized. The synthesis of a Ras protease inhibitor
would provide a valuable tool for the further study of post-translational
modifications of the ras protein.
