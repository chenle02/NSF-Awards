ABSTRACT EEC-9531731 Murphy The purpose of this REU site is to expose students
to a variety of bioprocessing research projects and to motivate these students
to pursue graduate study and careers in bioprocessing research and development.
The REU program will be conducted within the Colorado Bioprocessing Center (CBC)
at Colorado State University which has a full spectrum of bioprocess equipment
at both bench and pilot scales for fermentation, cell culture and product
recovery research. Students selected for participation in the program will first
be exposed to a series of lectures conducted by CBC faculty on the fundamentals
of biochemical engineering. This will be followed by hand-on experience with the
process and analytical equipment in the CBC and the development and execution of
a focused research project under the guidance and support of CBC researchers. Up
to ten (10) are expected to participate in this program annually.
