This static/dynamic light scattering system will be used for polymer studies.
It is critically important to a number of research areas within the department
including studies of the absorption dynamics of the air/vapor interface,
adsorption of functionalized polymers on surfaces, polymer transport in gels,
studies of inonmer solutions, and local conformations of polyelectrolytes, among
many others. This capability will enhance ongoing polymer materials research in
areas such as adsorption, chain conformation, chain transport, and mechanical
properties.
