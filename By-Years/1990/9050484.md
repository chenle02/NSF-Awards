The use of computer for controlling instruments and in the collecting and
analyzing of data is an integral part of the chemistry curriculum today and
should pervade all levels of a student's experience. The Chemistry Department at
Converse College has used the HRM (Human Relations Media) Software: Experiments
in Chemistry successfully for the last five year in the upper level Physical
Chemistry Laboratory and Instrumental Analysis. The HRM software allow students
to collect real-time data using a thermistor probe or electrode, enter it
directly into the computer and graphically analyze that data. Because of its
success in these laboratories and because the department is committed to the
continuing improvement of its curriculum they obtained nine Apple IIe/HRM
computer software set-ups to be used in General Chemistry and Quantitative
Analysis for the collection and analysis of data. This has extended the use of
computer assisted labs into the elementary curriculum where is it used by
science and non-science majors alike. The institution has contributed to this
project in an amount equal to the NSF funds.
