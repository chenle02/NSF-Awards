This grant is for partial support of a conference on Variability of Active
Galactic Nuclei, hosted by Georgia State University in Atlanta, from May 2 to
May 4, 1990. One of the most rapidly evolving fields in astrophysics is that of
Active Galactic Nu- clei. This is a field in which the high level of current re-
search activity makes it very desirable to have a scientific conference on this
topic on an annual basis. The last such conference in the United States was held
at the University of California at Santa Cruz in August, 1988. It is anticipated
that approximately 100 scientists actively engaged in research in this field
will attend this conference.
