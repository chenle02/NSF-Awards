Effective communications are essential to the success of an effort to conduct
scientific investigations over an area of continental size. Communications in
the polar regions are difficult because of the often great distances involved,
the disturbed ionosphere, and the general inaccessibility of the great bulk of
satellite communications resources which are in equatorial orbit. A new class of
communication satellites, the relatively small and inexpensive "microsats", will
over the next few years provide an alternate method for communicating with
equipment and personnel in the field. Interferometrics proposes to conduct
research to adapt an existing design for a compact telemetry unit (CTU) to the
environment of the polar regions and the needs of polar science. The existing
CTU operates autonomously, gathering data as commanded. Command and
interrogation is done remotely via a digital packet radio network which can
include a data store-and-forward or relay satellite. The same system can be used
to exchange message communications. The challenge to be met is to design
equipment which will operate reliably in the particularly hostile environment of
the polar regions, while providing the required level of service. A simpler,
hand-held version of the CTU could be used for personal radiolocation if used
with appropriate satellite equipment.
