9354159 DeLoatch Morgan State University proposes to again coordinate student
component of the NSF second National Conference on Diversity in the Scientific
and Technological Workforce, which is scheduled in Washington, DC on October
28-30, 1993. The conference will focus attention on the Foundation's role in the
education of minorities who are underrepresented in science, engineering and
mathematics (SEM) fields. Conference activities will include research
presentations by more than 300 student participants in NSF- sponsored research
projects, and hearings on major issues identified in the 1992 conference Action
Plan. The university would prepare an abstract of student presentations, and
design and schedule activities to encourage student interactions with role
models and other minority SEM students, leading to the formation of a support
group to reinforce student selection of SEM majors and careers. Grant activities
also would include scheduling student travel and hotel accommodations, and
arranging transportation to the conference for local area precollege and college
students.
