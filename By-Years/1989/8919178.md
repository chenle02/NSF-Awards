The heterochromatin of Drosophila, as of other eukaryotes, accounts for a
substantial fraction of the genome, but its organization and function is little
understood. Rex (Ribosomal exchange) is one of very few heterochromatic loci
that have been identified, and its analysis will provide a significant increase
in our understanding of heterochromatin. This locus is a maternal-effect
dominant located in the basal heterochromatin of the X chromosome that promotes
recombination of the ribosomal RNA genes during early mitotic divisions in
offspring of Rex females. Molecular and genetic analysis of Rex and of Rex-
generated recombinants will focus on dissecting Rex, and on understanding the
mechanism by which it induces rDNA exchange. This project will increase our
understanding of the heterochromatic regions of chromosomes. Heterochromatin has
been difficult to analyze in the past. This project uses unique methods not
found elsewhere. An understanding of heterochromatin in fruit flies will be
readily transferable in principle to the large fraction of heterochromatin found
in all mammals including man.
