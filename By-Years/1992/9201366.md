Schwarz proposes to study various problems in quantum field theory. He will try
to construct invariants of contact manifolds and of Legendre knots in three-
dimensional contact manifolds by means of topological invariants from quantum
field theory. There will also be a study of semi-infinite cohomology of
infinite- dimensional Lie algebras and the theory of symplectic and contact
supermanifolds. These problems are related to the general theory of quantization
of constrained systems and to the superstring theory. Modern physics, quantum
mechanics and relativity, is a product of the twentieth century. It is founded
firmly in the last century's attempt to address the microstructure of matter and
to come to grips with the concepts of action-at-a distance, electro-magnetism,
and heat radiation. The mathematical foundations for these developments,
collectively called mathematical physics, ranges from detailed analysis of
Schroedinger operators, which governs the dynamics of particles, to unified
field theory, which attempts to unite the four known forces into a single
theory.
