Professor Margaret Murnane of the University of Colorado is funded by the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program to study femtosecond dynamics of well-
characterized adsorbate/surface systems using extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and
x-ray radiation. New shorter wavelengths of light produced through high harmonic
generation will be utilized to access adsorbate core levels. In particular,
charge transfer dynamics will be studied when oxygen on single crystal platinum
(111) is subjected to laser pulses five femtoseconds in length. Also, the
oxidation of CO on this same crystal face is to be examined. The ability to
measure dynamics of a surface reactant as it evolves between different
equilibrium states by photoemission has been very restricted, because ultrafast
x-ray sources with sufficient flux and short pulse duration have not been
available until very recently. The femtosecond and picosecond timescales are
appropriate to the basic atomic motions underlying surface
reactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work will increase our understanding of
charge transfer processes on surfaces. Charge transfer is a chemical phenomenon
underlying diverse processes such as electrochemistry and biochemistry. The area
of femtochemistry was recently recognized as a frontier by the Nobel Prize in
Chemistry in 1999.&lt;br/&gt;
