ABSTRACT

Building Diversity in, and through, Environmental Journalism

This award seeks to strengthen the understanding of the Earth and environment
among populations underrepresented in geosciences by improving the quality and
quantity of coverage of the environment in media that reach these communities.
The Society of Environmental Journalists and the Earth & Environmental Science
Journalism Program at Columbia University will work with minority journalists,
with journalists employed by minority-serving media organizations, and with the
professional societies of minority journalists (the Native American Journalists
Association, the National Association of Black Journalists, and the National
Association of Hispanic Journalists) to raise interest in covering the Earth and
environment among journalists of color and journalists who serve minority
communities; raise awareness among non-minority journalists and editors of how
minority audiences can be served through environmental reporting; exchange
skills and information resources for better reporting on environmental issues of
special interest to minority communities; foster grassroots collegial
relationships and collaborations between individual journalists of color and
environmental journalists; foster institutional partnerships between the
professional societies of environmental journalists and minority journalists;
showcase and reward exemplary environmental journalism by journalists who are
members of underrepresented minorities.
