This proposed project provides a microcomputer lab and software to two social
science academic departments (The Department of Sociology, Social Work, and
Geography, and The Department of Political Science) at Arkansas State
University. The microcomputers dramatically enhance access of students to
techniques of scientific analysis. Students in these departments are, with this
equipment, being permitted to learn and practice principal methods of their
respective social science disciplines (sociology, political science, geography,
and criminology) through analysis of appropriate data sets. Existing courses are
changing from the current format which is often limited to reading and writing
about social science methods with occasional demonstrations and simple
calculator assisted assignments to a format which engages students fully in the
design and implementation of research problems using real data on relevant and
timely topics with the benefit of current technology. The institution is
matching the NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.
