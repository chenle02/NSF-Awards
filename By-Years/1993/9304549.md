This research is to develop and test a new technique for using precariously
balanced rocks to provide constraints on probabilities for strong ground motion
due to earthquakes. Examples of precariously balanced rocks found in California
and Nevada will be studied in detail with both physical models and numerical
models. Based on the results, an evaluation will be made for wider application.
This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction
Program.
