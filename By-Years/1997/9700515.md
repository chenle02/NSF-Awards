9700515 Morris Most organisms live in unpredictable environments, and must make
decisions such as where and when to reproduce using incomplete information.
Despite numerous theoretical studies that have predicted how animals should
behave in the face of such uncertainty, few field studies have quantified the
ways that animals respond reproductively to mortality risks that are spatially
and temporally unpredictable. Even fewer studies have quantified how well
animals use information to reduce reproductive risks, when compared to either
naive or omniscient strategies. In a seasonal lowland rain forest in Peru, the
frog Edalorhina perezi and other amphibians preferentially lay eggs in small
tree-fall pools, where the eggs and tadpoles experience mortality risks that
differ among pools and change temporally depending on unpredictable rainfall. By
observing frog egg-laying behavior and movement among pools, I will assess how
well they distribute their offspring. My approach will combine observations of
risks and frog behavior in natural pools, an experiment using artificial pools
to test the frogs' abilities to track changing risks, and a model to determine
how well the frogs perform compared to other strategies that range in risk-
assessment capabilities.
