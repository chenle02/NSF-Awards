The goal of this project is to provide an efficient platform for browser-based,
data-driven web application computation. The platform enables cost-effective
development of fast-responding applications that adjust well to accesses from
mobile clients (e.g. smart phones, tablets). The project achieves its goal using
the following approaches: (1) designing novel high level, location-transparent,
declarative, data-driven languages that require much lower coding effort than
direct HTML5 coding in order to specify the business process and data access of
the applications; (2) developing an optimizer for low latency query execution
plans that utilize browser-based storage and asynchronous computation; (3)
developing an action scheduler that optimizes the location and execution order
of the actions described in the declarative language; (4) developing a
user/action concurrency control theory and a dependency analysis algorithm so
that the user can view and act while prior actions are still computed; (5)
prototyping an application-enabling platform that encompasses the developed
languages, algorithms and optimizations; and (6) evaluating the effectiveness of
the platform in two aspects: how much it reduces latency and how much it reduces
the coding effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project's research will have great
impacts on mobile-accessible, data-driven web applications, which, by being
written in the proposed automatically optimized, declarative languages, will
enjoy both low latency and low development cost. The project supports graduate
and undergraduate students. Lectures on the research results will be
incorporated into PI's undergraduate-level course on web application
development. Publications, software, an online service and experimental data
from this research will be disseminated via the project web site
(http://www.db.ucsd.edu/browserbasedforward).
