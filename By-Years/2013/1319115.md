Increasingly, all large-scale computing activities, including critical
enterprise, financial, and public services, are being transitioned to cloud
computing. Cloud computing is based on the technology of virtual machines, which
enforces separation between the clients of a cloud service provider. Trust in
cloud computing services depends on the security of the virtual machine
implementation, of which virtual devices are building blocks. This project
designs software tools that can automatically detect flaws in virtual device
implementations, within a virtual machine platform. The inaccessible state of
physical devices is represented as symbolic values in symbolic execution over
the virtual device code, allowing for comparison of virtual and physical device
states after subjecting each to a set of test events, without requiring
measurements that interfere with the physical device state. By detecting hidden
flaws and vulnerabilities in virtual devices, this project reduces the risk of
potential attacks that threaten the security of virtual machines and cloud
services. The release of software tools as open source allows other researchers
and practitioners to build on the results. In addition, the project integrates
the research with educational and outreach activities, including a new course on
troubleshooting in virtualized environment, recruitment of student participants
from underrepresented groups, and participation in community organizations
related to information technology and security.
