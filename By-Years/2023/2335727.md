The two-day conference supported by this proposal focuses on furthering
diversity in the emerging transportation workforce. The workshop places emphasis
on partnerships between 2-year community colleges (especially minority-serving
institutions or MSIs), 4-year MSIs, and industry stakeholders from the
transportation sector. By bringing together 2-year community colleges, MSIs,
transportation industry leaders, and government, the workshop provides an
opportunity for capacity building. It will allow for the exploration of model
programs, case studies, research findings, data, and innovative expert insights.
The convening also defines research questions and identifies potential sponsors
for a possible larger NAS consensus study on gender and racial/ethnic equity in
the transportation workforce.
