9731322 Wurzbach The Council of Chief State School Officers has been engaged in
working with states to identify new approaches to initial teacher certification
through the Interstate New Teacher Assessment and Support Consortium (INTASC).
This project will support specific pieces of that effort that target mathematics
and science. The first component trains practicing mathematics teachers in a
selected number of states to provide support to beginning teachers who are
developing mathematics portfolios and to master procedures for scoring the
portfolios. The second component focuses on refining science portfolio
guidelines based on field test results.
