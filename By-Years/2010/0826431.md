OISE-0826431 (Wang, J.J. ? Virginia Tech) IRES: Participation in an
International Student Satellite Project at KIT in Japan. This three-year
International Research Experience for Students (IRES) collaborative research
project between Virginia Tech (VT) and the Kyushu Institute of Technology (KIT)
in Japan will annually support six U.S. undergraduate and graduate students each
spending three-months at KIT to participate in a satellite project. The U.S.
student participants will work with KIT students to design, build, test, and
operate a micro-satellite. The satellite mission will investigate material
degradation in space, validate a CMOS camera module for use on micro-satellites,
and take high resolution images of the Earth from orbit. This project represents
the first ever comprehensive international collaboration for U.S. students
directly related to a space mission, and will provide the participants with a
global perspective in space exploration. The participants will broadly
disseminate their research findings to scientists and engineers working on
spacecraft environmental interactions and satellite design.
