This research program is part of the initiative to collect perishable data
resulting from the 17 October 1989 Northern California (Loma Prieta) earthquake.
The objective is to collect data on the performance of underground natural gas
distribution systems. These data include, as a minimum, information on
earthquake damage to natural gas facilities, data on the type and extent of
repairs to natural gas systems, documentation of emergency response and recovery
efforts, data on the number of natural gas-related fires associated with the
earthquake, and information on areas of severe ground displacement or
settlement. Dr. Eguchi was responsible for collecting preliminary information on
natural gas systems for the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute
reconnaissance effort for the Loma Prieta earthquake.
