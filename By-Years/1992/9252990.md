The goal of this project is to produce six additional Jasper adventures plus
video extensions for each adventure, and relevant print and professional
development teacher materials. Included with each Jasper adventure will be an
optional piece of software, called the Adventure Maker, that will allow students
to create their own adventures. In addition, the adventures and materials will
be field tested in sites across the country. This series, as with the previous
series, will be designed to be implemented at various levels of hardware. It is
designed to be used in conjunction with videodisc technology. The simplest level
of technology is with a videodisc player and a hand-held remote; the second
level is to use a videodisc player with barcode; the third level involves
computer based control of the videodisc with hypercard stacks and computational
and graphic tools. The project has an extensive research component which
includes an analysis of the reactions to Jasper characters and adventures, an
assessment of teachers' ideas for implementation, expanded assessments of
student learning, studies of the value-added of Jasper software, and research on
the Adventure Maker.
