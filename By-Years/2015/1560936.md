This workshop will bring together researchers from around the world to identify
and explore the grand challenges in experimental soft condensed matter science.
The study of soft matter embraces a vast array of topics. It includes, but is
not limited to, liquid crystals, polymers, colloids, foams and other complex
fluids, granular matter, fluid mechanics, rheology, pattern formation, meta-
materials, self assembly, active matter, jamming and glasses, surfactants, some
aspects of biological matter, membranes and nano-materials. In essence, it
includes any area in condensed matter that does not necessarily require for its
investigation the use of quantum mechanics. It has a home in physics, chemistry,
chemical and mechanical engineering, materials science and applied mathematics.
It has implications for areas of science as far afield as astrophysics on the
largest scales and nuclear physics at the smallest. This workshop, whose results
will appear in a formal report, will capture the excitement and promise of this
rapidly growing field of research.
