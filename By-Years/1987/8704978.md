The nature and rate of conformational changes that take place in transfer RNA
(tRNA) as it interacts with the macromolecular components involved in protein
synthesis remain unclear. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a powerful, non-
destructive method for studying the structure, conformation and dynamic
properties of tRNA in solution. While most NMR studies have involved protein
NMR, F-19 NMR offers the advantages of high sensitivity to detection, a large
range of chemical shifts and great sensitivity to the environment of the
nucleus. Dr. Horowitz is using high resolution F-19 NMR to probe conformational
changes in 5-fluorouracil (FUra)-substituted E. coli tRNAs as they relate to
function. Interpretation of results at the molecular level requires reliable
peak assignments; approximately half the resonances in the F-19 NMR spectrum of
the valine tRNA have been assigned. This project will be expanded to include
experiments with molecular fragments and hybrid tRNA molecules, chemical
modification studies and the investigation of tRNAs with specific FUra residues
replaced with other bases by recombinant DNA techniques. Then will be used in
assigning the remaining peaks in the F-19 spectrum.
