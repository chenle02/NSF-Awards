Abstract&lt;br/&gt;CHE-
0317114&lt;br/&gt;Pemberton/Arizona&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the support of the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, Professor Pemberton and her colleagues
at the University of Arizona are carrying out a broad based examination of
interfaces in electrochemical devices, including solid-state molecular photonics
and electronic devices. Surface vibrational spectroscopies in combination with
work function measurement, electron spectroscopy, and temperature programmed
desorption methods are used to examine the interfaces between low work function
metals and organic polymers and small molecules. Interfaces in organic
heterojunctions are also being examined. Studies of emersion are also being
carried out, in order to understand the processes of surface wetting and
electrowetting in electrochemical devices. Information obtained from these
studies is useful in the design of electronic materials processing protocols and
for the design of photonic and electronic devices.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Pemberton and her coworkers at the University of
Arizona have developed an effective combination of spectroscopic and
electrochemical tools to examine the structure and properties of interfaces in
electrochemical and electronic devices. Interfaces between reactive metals and
organic layers, between organic layers of different composition, and at the
emersed metal-electrolyte junction are being examined. The results of these
studies are useful for the design and processing of microelectronic materials
and systems. &lt;br/&gt;
