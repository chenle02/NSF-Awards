This grant in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry program of the Chemistry
Division will support faculty from Liberal Arts colleges in the southeastern
United States who wish to enhance their teaching by participating in research.
Faculty interested in analytical chemistry will congregate at Tennessee at times
convenient to them each summer, and also participate during the school year at
their home institutions as facilities, time, and interest permit. Work at Oak
Ridge National Laboratory may occur as appropriate. By bringing faculty from
many regional institutions with similar research interests to a single site,
this Research Opportunity Award will enhance collaboration among schools,
promote research, enhance the Research Experiences for Undergraduates program at
Tennessee, and thus significantly improve the competance of existing scientists
and the flow of new scientists into analytical and surface chemistry.
