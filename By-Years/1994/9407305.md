9407305 Mann ABSTRACT Reproductive experience (pregnancy and lactation) has
long- term effects on hormonal, behavioral and neurochemical endpoints in female
mammals, including affecting litter size in hamsters, timing of reproductive
events in miniature swine, salt intake in rat and maternal behavior in mice,
rats, gerbils, squirrels, ewes, and monkeys. Interestingly, reproductive
experience also alters the brain, demonstrating neural plasticity in the adult
female mammal. So far, only the endogenous opioid system has been shown to be
altered both behaviorally and physiologically by reproductive experience. The
goal of this Research Planning Grant is to utilize in situ hybridization
histochemistry (ISHH) to determine if there are permanent changes in brain
opioid prohormone gene expression as a consequence of repeated reproductive
experience. During the 18 months of the planning period the ISHH technique will
be set up and tested. When the technique has been perfected research will start
to determine the long-term effects of repeated reproductive states. The levels
of message RNA of the opioid prohormone, proopiomelanocortin (POMC), will be
examined during the estrous cycle and during pregnancy in the brain of female
rats will undergo steroid regimens that mimic pregnancy to uncover the mechanism
underlying this effect. To demonstrate that repeated pregnancies and lactations
produce long-term, possibly permanent, changes in the brain of the adult mammal
has important implications for the study of neural plasticity and reproductive
neurobiology.
