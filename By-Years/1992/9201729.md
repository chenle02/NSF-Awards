Putinar will investigate two sets of problems. The first concerns Toeplitz
operators on multivariable Bergman spaces and their relevance for the function
theory of several complex variables. He will relate the spectral problems for
this class of operators to the theory of functions in pseudoconvex domains with
L2-growth control at the boundary. The second set of problems is related to the
theory of moments in Euclidean n- space. Putinar will try to determine methods
for solving certain moment problems on semialgebraic subsets by using specific
operator theories. Operator theory is that part of mathematics that studies the
infinite dimensional generalizations of matrices. In particular, when restricted
to finite dimensional subspaces, an operator has the usual linear properties,
and thus can be represented by a matrix. The central problem in operator theory
is to classify operators satisfying additional conditions given in terms of
associated operators (e.g. the adjoint) or in terms of the underlying space.
Operator theory underlies much of mathematics, and many of the applications of
mathematics to other sciences.
