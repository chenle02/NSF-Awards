The objective of this proposal is to expand an undergraduate teaching laboratory
in neurobiology to include the exploration of fundamental molecular mechanisms
of neural signalling. The course most directly affected concerns cellular and
molecular neuroscience, which is one of two advanced core courses in a
neuroscience major now under development. The requested equipment includes
apparatus for assaying protein concentration, cell fractionation, studying
receptor binding, studying intracellular second messenger systems, exploring the
pharmacological basis of synaptic transmission, and visualizing the expression
of particular neuronal genes with in situ hybridization techniques. The addition
of these molecular techniques to the array of cellular and other methods now
supported in the teaching laboratory permit the students to experience a rich
variety of the techniques fundamental to modern neuroscience.
