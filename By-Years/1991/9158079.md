Dr. Gregory A. Voth is supported by a Presidential Young Investigator Grant in
the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to perform theoretical
studies of chemical dynamics in condensed systems. Voth's research involves the
development of both analytical and computer simulation techniques with the
primary goal of formulating predictive mathematical theories which characterize
chemical dynamical problems of interest. One major thrust of the research is to
formulate a general description of activated rate processes such as chemical
reactions in condensed phases that carefully treat quantum effects as well as
the specific microscopic interactions between reactive subsystems and the
condensed phase enviroment. A second thurst of the research is to develop a
theory for the ablation of polymer surfaces by laser radiation. %%% Research
under this Presidential Young Investigator award will provide important
theoretical insights into the molecular level understanding of the factors which
affect chemical reactions in solutions.
