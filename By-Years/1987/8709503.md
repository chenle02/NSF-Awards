Matching funds are requested for the purchase of a thermal ionization, solid-
source mass spectrometer. The instrument, to be located in the Department of
Geological Sciences at the University of Rochester, will be used in research on
the systematic distribution of Ru-Sr, Sm-Nd, Th-Pb, and Hf-Lu isotopes in
geological systems. Knowledge accrued from the isotopic analyses will be
integrated with other data to determine the age of rock formations and their
associated ores and put into a larger interpretational framework of crust-
mantle evolution through geologic time.
