The North Central Technical College requests support from NSF to connect it's
campus to the Internet. The North Central Technical College in Mansfield, OH has
approximately 9,200 students and offers 52 degree and certificates in
approximately 28 programs of study. The college intends to connect through
OARnet, a local Internet service provider. The campus needs the Internet
connection to be able to access information resources throughout the state, the
nation and the world. The connection will benefit the faculty, staff students of
this institution as well as the community in general. The award provides partial
support of the project for two years.
