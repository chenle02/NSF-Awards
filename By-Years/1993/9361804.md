9361804 DeFlaun Concern over the use of chemicals that potentially contribute to
ozone depletion and the greenhouse effect has led to a ban on chlorofluorcarbons
(CFCs) and a phase out on the use of methyl bromide. CFC replacement compounds,
the hydrohalocarbons, also have either ozone depletion potential or are possible
greenhouse gases. Preliminary studies have shown that there may be a number of
naturally-occurring microorganisms capable of degrading these compounds. %%% A
bioremediation/biorestoration system for hydrohalocarbons and methyl bromide
based on the degradative abilities of these organisms will be developed.
Successful development of this process will result in a cost-effective means to
biologically degrade ozone-depleting chemicals, thereby eliminating the health
risk to the general public. ***
