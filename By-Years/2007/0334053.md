This proposal is for two workshops on "Management and Models for
Cyberinfrastructure." The report, Revolutionizing Science and Engineering
Through Cyberinfrastructure, provides a broad vision of the future of science
and engineering research. The path forward that this report envisions -
extensive cyberinfrastructure to enable all levels of science &amp; engineering
research and education, geographic and institution independence, cross-
disciplinary sharing of data and insights, and technical depth in all dimensions
- truly has the potential to revolutionize all fields of research and education.
In addition to the sound advice offered in the report on the organizational
issues that NSF may face in implementing the report's recommendations, there is
also a need to examine the various models that might be relevant to the
management and oversight of such large-scale, ubiquitous, comprehensive digital
environments, which include distributed resources, federated facilities, people,
data, information and tools. Input and lessons learned are needed from key
stakeholders and other principals experienced in the management and oversight of
such complex enterprises. The central objective of these workshops is to
articulate the array of organizational models for large-scale, federated,
distributed scientific organizations that NSF can consider employing for
cyberinfrastructure. The benefits, detriments and possible innovations of each
model should be analyzed from several points of view including 1) governance
issues, 2) oversight potential, 3) operational effectiveness, 4) economic
efficiency, and 5) knowledge production potential. In addition, several town
hall meetings will be held to insure that all stakeholders are included.
