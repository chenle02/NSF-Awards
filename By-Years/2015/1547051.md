The University of Chicago's Center for Elementary Mathematics and Science
Education (CEMSE) is pursuing this EAGER project, "Expanding the Reach of AP CSP
Curricula," to help two of the groups that are developing curricula for the new
Advanced Placement Computer Science Principles (AP CSP) course prepare their
materials for broad use. The two curricula -- both developed with NSF support --
are Mobile CSP (developed at Trinity College) and Thriving in Our Digital World
(developed by the University of Texas at Austin). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
proposed work will focus on six areas that are critical for successful scaling
of the curricula: usability, marketability, sustainability, robustness,
standards labeling, and clarity about critical features. Researchers and
curriculum developers at CEMSE will collaborate with the AP CSP curriculum
developers to analyze their programs' strengths and weaknesses in these six
areas and to develop templates, ancillaries, correlations, overviews, teacher's
editions, and other assets that will make the curricula maximally useful and
appealing to teachers across the nation. The work will provide a model for
curriculum development for other CS courses, and may well provide insights into
possible improvements to the CS Principles course framework itself.
