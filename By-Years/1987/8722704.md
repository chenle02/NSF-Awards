The maps and studies Hastenrath has produced on the heat storage and transport
in the upper layers of the ocean have been one of most useful contributions to
tropical climatology. With this grant he will focus his attention on the Indian
Ocean. From this work monthly maps of the thermal structure of the upper ocean
at 2 degree resolution will be produced. The original datasets, after editing,
will be made available to the community through NODC. These products will be
very useful to TOGA projects. The direct application of this analysis will be a
study on the influence of oceani heat storage on the monsoon regime in the
Indian Ocean." will also be investigated.
