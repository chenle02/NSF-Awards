The purpose of this U.S.-Poland cooperative research project between Dr. Robert
Moss of Rutgers University and Dr. Marek Wlostowski of the Technical University
of Warsaw is to conduct basic research on the chemistry of reactive
intermediates, specifically carbenes. The project builds on the complementary
strengths of the two groups: the Rutgers group's expertise in direct
observational kinetic studies of carbene reaction mechanisms, and the Polish
group's work which has involved major recent innovations in synthesis of the
diazirine precursors.
