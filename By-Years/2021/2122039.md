This timely workshop addresses improving election administration, a critical
component of democracy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this workshop
series is to help understand and build confidence in the outcomes of US
elections, using the many years of scholarly study in this area as the
background. The workshop series will build upon prior work and extant knowledge
to further explore the topic in the context of the Convergence Accelerator. The
workshop discussions will be centered around the theme of “building confidence”,
where “confidence” is defined as (1) scientific or empirical certainty that the
elections were performed accurately and securely and (2) that winners
identified, in fact, received more votes than the losers, and that the election
was conducted fairly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
