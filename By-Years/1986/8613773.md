An important recent development in linear wave physics is the discovery by M.V.
Berry of Bristol Univesity, England, of an unexpected phase shift in the
adiabatic limit for the Schroedinger equation. This phase is acquired upon
adiabatic transport of a quantum system around a closed circuit in the parameter
space of the Hamiltonian, and is solely a topological property of the circuit.
These ideas have recently been extended by Professor Chiao to the field of
optics. An experiment in linear optics has shown that this phase appears as the
angle of optical rotation of linear polarization of light in a helically wound
optical fiber. The current research extends these investigations both
theoretically and experimentally to nonlinear wave propagation, with emphasis on
the propagation of linearly polarized optical solitons generated by picosecond
pulses inside a helical fiber. The question of how Berry's phase extends to the
nonlinear case will thereby be partly answered. Potential applications of this
new fundamental phenomenon will be explored.
