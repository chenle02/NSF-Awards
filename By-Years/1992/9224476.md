This grant is in the area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the
subfield of mass spectrometric studies of gas-phase metal ion cluster chemistry.
Professor Freiser and his students will use a supersonic source to generate
metal ion clusters containing multiple metal atoms. The source will be used in
conjunction with Fourier transform mass spectrometry and laser photochemical
techniques to investigate gas-phase ion-molecule chemistry. The use of
supersonic sources to synthesize ions is a powerful new concept that could lead
to significant advances in mass spectrometry. %%% Professor Freiser will use a
supersonic source for a Fourier transform mass spectrometer to create and study
gas-phase metal ion clusters containing three or more metal atoms. This
technique combined with laser photochemistry will be used to study the gas-phase
chemistry of these novel cluster compounds. The results will impact directly on
the development of improved mass spectrometric instrumentation such as tandem
mass spectrometers.
