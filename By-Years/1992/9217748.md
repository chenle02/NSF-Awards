The number of detection techniques for the hydroxyl radical has blossomed
within the last few years. In addition to long-path absorption and chemical
conversion are the improved in situ, spectroscopic fluorescence methods. Such
methods can have both the sensitivity and specificity that is required for
versatile measurements from either remote ground-based sites or from aircraft.
They have for the last two years pursued the measurement technique for detection
of tropospheric OH and HO2 by laser induced fluorescence in chambers at low
pressures. This technique is now sufficiently well developed that an instrument
can be built which can be used either from remote platforms or from aircraft.
This award will support the building of this instrument and allow a series of
ground-based field measurements and intercomparisons. This instrument will be
designed so that it can be mounted in a double rack on an aircraft. Actual use
on an aircraft will require only the design and construction of an air intake
duct and slight changes to the orientation of the air inlet.
