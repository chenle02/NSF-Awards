9350881 Priest In Fall 1989, the Miami University Department of Physics
initiated a new Introductory Level Physics Sequence of courses emphasizing
laboratory experience. Building upon the first- year course, which contains
major units on 2Oth century physics, we introduced at the Sophomore level a
course in Contemporary Physics, which focuses on recent important physics
research results obtained within the students' lifetime. The Contemporary
Physics Laboratory gives the students "hands-on" experience needed to understand
the significance of these recent results. The laboratory is organized into three
categories each having a focus: I. "Waves are Particles are Waves", Focus: The
Scanning Tunneling Microscope, II. "From Atoms to Solids", Focus: High-Tc
Superconductivity, and III. "Four, Three, Two? One? ...Countdown the Forces of
Nature", Focus: The Standard Model. This project provides instrumentation for
experiments in scanning tunneling microscopy to illustrate particle-wave duality
and tunneling through a potential barrier, and provides students with a valuable
transferable skill. The equipment is sufficiently sophisticated for use in
advanced level individual student projects, involving microscopic studies of
surfaces. ***
