The protozoan, Paramecium tetraurelia undergoes a behavioral response in the
form of backward swimming to a variety of stimuli. Backward swimming is
correlated with action potentials that can be recorded across the surface
membrane of the organism. The action potential involves four specific ion
channels, a voltage-dependent calcium channel, a voltage- dependent potassium
channel, and two calcium dependent channels, one that is selective for potassium
and the other for sodium. The overall goal of this research is to understand the
molecular components involved in the regulation of the calcium-dependent
potassium channel from Paramecium. Recent studies using the behavioral mutant
called pantophobiac have shown that the calcium-binding protein, calmodulin, is
involved in the regulation of the calcium-dependent potassium channel. To
understand more fully the molecular mechanism of the regulation of this channel
and the role of the channel in the behavior of Paramecium a combined genetic and
biochemical approach will be taken. Biochemical changes in pantophobiac mutants
that affect the channel will be characterized more fully, and calmodulin-binding
proteins involved in channel regulation will be isolated and characterized. Ion
channels in cells are generally composed of complexes of membrane proteins, and
function as gated pores for the orderly transport of ions across cell membranes.
Their function, besides being involved in the behavior of Paramecium, is the
basis for excitation in nerve and muscle and for the responses of many cell
types to environmental stimuli. The molecular mechanisms by which ion channels
function are, as yet, poorly understood. Paramecium provides an excellent system
for basic studies of ion channels because it can be genetically manipulated and
large numbers ofidentical cells can be obtained to provide sufficient material
for biochemical studies. The results of this research will provide important new
information about the molecular mechanism of regulation of the calcium-dependent
potassium channel.
