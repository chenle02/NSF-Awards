This award covers experimental elementary particle physics research on the
constituent structure of matter by a group at Penn State University in
collaboration with other NSF and DOE supported scientists. The group will
continue studying rare mesonic and hadronic states at Brookhaven and at
Fermilab. They will also study the quark structure of matter in electron
scattering experiments at HERA in Hamburg, Germany.
