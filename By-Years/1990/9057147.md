This Presidential Young Investigator Award will focus on theoretical studies of
polymeric systems; particularly, the phase and interfacial behavior of polymeric
materials. Three general subject areas will be addressed: (1) Phase behavior of
blends with block copolymers; (2) Interfacial properties of liquid crystal
copolymers; (3) Phase separation of polymer solutions under flow.
