The University of Central Florida and Martin Marietta Corporation have formed a
partnership resulting in the founding of UCF/Martin Marietta Academy. The aim is
to improve mathematics and science education in K-8 public schools in three
Central Florida counties. Thirty teachers per year for each of the 4 years of
the program will participate in the Academy. Teachers will attend the equivalent
of four semesters of courses, which will include mathematics and science
content, pedagogical aspects of teaching mathematics and science and leadership
training. Teachers will be chosen in pairs from each target school. Follow up
activities will include networking among the teachers in different schools and
with the University faculty. Teachers will receive credits towards a Masters
degree upon completion of the program. Each teacher in the program will
supervise and mentor an undergraduate education major. Active and retired
scientists will act as mentors in the schools. Cost sharing is 84%
