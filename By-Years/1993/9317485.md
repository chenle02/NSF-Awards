ABSTRACT: 9317485, PI-Vallis, "Eddies and the Large Scale Structure of the
Atmosphere": The overall goal of this grant will be to investigate the principal
factors determining the large to synoptic scale structure of the atmosphere,
with particular attention given to the interaction of synoptic eddies and the
large scale circulation. The research will consist of two main thrusts: (1) a
study of the dynamics and importance of nonlinear energy and enstrophy cascades
and (2) a study of how synoptic eddies affect the large scale mean structure of
the atmosphere. Several models of differing complexity will be used in this
studies. In addition, the PI will conduct a systematic, more generic, study of
the formulation and use of economical dynamical models for atmosphere and
climate studies.
