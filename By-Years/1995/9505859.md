9505859 Raj The objective of the proposed work is to develop predictive methods
for the design of directional microstructures for the purpose of obtaining very
high resistance to deformation and fracture at very high temperatures. The
approach is based on coupling the local atomistic mechanisms of time dependent
nucleation and growth of cavities at interfaces, and the long range relaxation
of the stress concentrations accompanying cavitation, with the stochastic
distribution of nucleation sites in the specimen. The proposed work is both
experimental and theoretical. The results will be applied specifically to high
temperature silicon nitride ceramic. %%% The proposal is aimed to develop
predictive methods for the design of directional microstructures for the purpose
of obtaining very high resistance to deformation and fracture at very high
temperatures.
