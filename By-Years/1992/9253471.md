"Stormchasers" is a 35-minute, IMAX/OMNIMAX film to be produced, exhibited, and
distributed by the Museum Film Network, NOVA/WGBH Boston, and MacGillivray
Freeman Films-the same team responsible for the critically acclaimed film "To
the Limit." "Stormchasers" is a tale of scientific discovery and natural wonder
that will take audiences on a journey around the planet to encounter the origins
of the earth's weather patterns, to experience our most extreme storms
(monsoons, hurricanes, blizzards and tornadoes,) and to witness scientists who
study and predict weather events. Using a combination of conventional IMAX
documentary filmmaking methods, computer animation, and unique photography, the
film will depict the intricate relationship between the drama of nature and the
efforts of humans to pursue the systematic understanding of the natural world.
The film and its ancillary materials will be offered to the 34 space theaters
located at U.S. science museums in 1994-1995. Educational materials will be
developed to extend the film's reach into the classroom. Special viewing
programs will be offered at science museums, targeting minority, disadvantaged,
and female youth and their teachers.
