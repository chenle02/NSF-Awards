Topology, as a branch of geometry, seeks to classify, characterize and
&lt;br/&gt;explore those abstract spaces known as manifolds. Manifolds are
locally &lt;br/&gt;like ordinary euclidean spaces(the line, the plane, etc.);
however, they &lt;br/&gt;are allowed to have global twisting, curving and holes
(e.g., circles, &lt;br/&gt;spheres, tori). They arise in many models of physical
and biological&lt;br/&gt;phenomena. Manifolds with singularities, or stratified
spaces, are even &lt;br/&gt;more ubiquitous as they appear as solution spaces of
algebraic and &lt;br/&gt;differential equations and as limits, degenerations and
compactifications &lt;br/&gt;of manifolds. Hughes has made a breakthrough in the
understanding of &lt;br/&gt;topologically stratified spaces by establishing a
theory of the&lt;br/&gt;neighborhoods of the singularities. This allows one to
use geometric &lt;br/&gt;techniques almost as if the singularities were not
present. The current &lt;br/&gt;project is largely concerned with exploiting
this technique to further &lt;br/&gt;the understanding of manifolds with
singularities. As an example, Hughes &lt;br/&gt;will investigate the extent of
periodicity near the singular sets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research
concerns the topology and geometry of manifolds, &lt;br/&gt;stratified spaces,
trees and metric spaces. The investigations are in &lt;br/&gt;the areas of
stratified spaces, trees, ultrametrics and noncommutative &lt;br/&gt;geometry
and the fundamental theorem of algebraic K-theory. The main &lt;br/&gt;tools are
controlled topology, surgery theory and C*-algebras of groupoids.
&lt;br/&gt;Specific questions concern periodicity in the neighborhood of the
singular &lt;br/&gt;set of a manifold stratified space, the classification of
stratified &lt;br/&gt;h-cobordisms and stratified pseudoisotopies, and non-
locally flat topological &lt;br/&gt;embeddings. In addition, techniques from
noncommutative geometry will be &lt;br/&gt;applied to study the geometry of
infinite trees and other non-compact spaces &lt;br/&gt;at infinity.
