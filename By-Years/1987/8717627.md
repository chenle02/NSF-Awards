The Andean orogen is the type example of a mountain range formed by tectonic and
magmatic processes resulting primarily from the subduction of oceanic
lithosphere beneath a continental margin. Knowledge of the deep structure of the
mountain range and continental margin, however, is based on only limited seismic
refraction profiles obtained in the 1960s. Surface geologic mapping in the
southern Andes indicates that the mountain belt has been produced by both
thickening and shortening of the continental crust in response to subduction
related tectonism, underthrusting of the Nazca Plate beneath South America, and
resulting magmatic activity related to this subduction. The present recommended
award will support a study of the crustal structure beneath the Andes using
marine multichannel seismic reflection techniques. Data will be acquired in
fjords which traverse the Andean range, as well as in the adjacent continental
shelf areas. These data will be compared to other studies of crustal structure
beneath mountain ranges to test models for their formation and to examine
hypotheses for the evolution of the continental crust. This is a cooperative
project involving scientists at the Univ. of Texas and Lamont-Doherty Geological
Observatory. Field data will be acquired aboard the R.V. Conrad.
