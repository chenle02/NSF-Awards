With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) and
support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program (CRIF), Professor
Patrick Farmer from Baylor University and colleagues Caleb Martin, Kevin Pinney,
Bryan Shaw and John Wood will acquire an electron paramagentic resonance (EPR)
spectrometer. This instrument will allow research in a variety of fields such as
those that provide insight on how biologically relevant species behave when they
possess unpaired electrons. In general, an EPR spectrometer yields detailed
information on the geometric and electronic structure of molecular and solid
state materials. It may also be used to obtain information about the lifetimes
of free radicals, short-lived, highly reactive species involved in valuable
chemical transformations as well as the initiation of pathological tumor growth.
These studies will impact a number of areas, from the synthesis of inorganic and
organic molecules to the development of new solid state materials to compounds
of magnetic and biological interest. Employing examples inspired from ongoing
research, this instrument will be an integral part of research and teaching at
the undergraduate and graduate levels at Baylor University as well as Austin
College, the University of Texas at Tyler and Texas Lutheran
University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award is aimed at enhancing research and
education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) investigating
biocoordination chemistry of HNO; (b) studying the mechanism of charge
regulation in superoxide dismutase-1 and other metalloproteins; (c) studying the
pro-oxidant chemistry of melanins; (d) designing, synthesizing and evaluating
bioreductive tumor microenvironment; (e) analyzing radical reactions of
trialkylborane water complexes; and (f) studying boron radicals, pyridyl
phosphine/phosphine oxide coordination chemistry.
