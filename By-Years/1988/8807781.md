Three projects are proposed concerning the theory of the interaction of intense
laser fields and atoms: (1) a new approach to the S matrix theory of multiphoton
ionization for present intense laser fields, (2) a study of effects of lasers of
still greater intensity, (3) a study of the low frequency approximation in
electron-atom scattering. Recently experimental results of high quality and
great detail have become available for multiphoton ionization of a variety of
atoms; these results can distinguish among existing theories. This work will
apply several new ideas to the theoretical description of these processes.
