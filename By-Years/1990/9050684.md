Mathematics students are using Iris Workstations by Silicon Graphics to
experiment with chaotic dynamical systems and to study fractal geometry. The
fundamental ideas of dynamical systems are studied and the experiments are
designed to lead to a rigorous analysis of the systems. The institution will
contribute an amount equal to the award.
