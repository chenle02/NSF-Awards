Ioan Andricioaei of the University of Michigan is supported by a CAREER award
from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program for research which is
developing methods for enhanced kinetics in biomolecular systems. The work is
partially supported by the Molecular Biophysics program within the Division of
Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in a co-funding arrangement. Andricioaei is
developing methods for enhanced calculations of time-correlation functions from
single trajectories. Application of these techniques to the NMR relaxation of
HIV-1 TAR RNA at short and long time scales is being made. Further work is aimed
at developing a family of methods for enhanced sampling of multiple
trajectories, at simulating single molecule manipulations numerically and at
deriving a potential of mean force to be used in a multi-approach dynamical
propagation. The work is having a broad impact on our understanding of
fundamental biophysical processes and an additional impact through Andricioaei's
involvement in the Michigan Math and Science Scholars program, designed to
expose high school students to research.
