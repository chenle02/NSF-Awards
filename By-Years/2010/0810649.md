This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I develops better gene
promoters in order to allow the creation of improved genetically modified crops
for food and biofuels. Gene promoters are a critical element of all transgenic
crops, precisely controlling when and where within the plant a transgene is
expressed. This project utilizes the proprietary root analysis system, the
RootArray platform, to identify and characterize these enhanced promoters. The
RootArray provides an unprecedented ability to monitor gene expression within
developing plant roots. The broader impacts of this research are the development
of better genetically modified crop varieties. The next generation of
genetically modified food crops will more easily withstand environmental
stresses, like drought and pests, while producing higher yields and more
nutritional value. These crops will play an important role in guaranteeing food
security. Moreover, genetically modified crops hold tremendous promise to
produce better biofuel crops to help meet the nation's growing demand for
energy. Genetically modified plants have the potential to play a key role in
reducing our dependence on fossil fuels and cutting greenhouse emissions.
Innovations in plant biotechnology - including the development of enhanced gene
promoters - will help bring these enormous benefits to society.
