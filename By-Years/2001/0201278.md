0201278&lt;br/&gt;Bornhop&lt;br/&gt;Under this exploratory research project, a
new contrast agent that specifically labels glioma cells and that can provide
both MRI and fluorescence signatures will be developed. This proposal seeks to
capitalize on the observations that human glial tumors display a high density of
peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) binding sites and that the conjugable
form of the PBR ligand PK-11195 will preferentially bind to human primary brain
tumors. Thus, a new contrast agent (Ln-Q-Y-CTMR-PK11195) that will pass the
blood brain barrier and selectively label viable glioma cells will be possible
through chemical conjugation of unique polyazamacrocyclic lanthanide chelating
agents (Ln-Q-Y-CTMR) to the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ligand, PK-11195.
Under this exploratory effort, cocktails of both the Gd 3+ containing complex to
provide macroscopic scale images by MRI, and the Eu 3+ or Tb 3+ species to give
microscopic scale fluorescence images from the same tissue will be developed.
After the synthesis has been accomplished, specific uptake by PBR expressing
glioma cells in-vitro will be established and the influence of linker chain
length on complex stability will be investigated. &lt;br/&gt;
