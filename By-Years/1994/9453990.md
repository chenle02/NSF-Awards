A Graduate Research Traineeship (GRT) program is proposed for the priority of
Geosciences are of "Coastal Ocean Processes". In the Oceanography Program of the
Graduate College of Marine Studies (CMS), we have a PhD degree program that we
propose to modify to provide an additional new specialization in "Coastal Ocean
Processes" (COP). This COP program is built on an existing emphasis in nearshore
oceanographic areas, an advanced course in coastal and estuarine oceanography,
an advanced physical oceanography course, and a course in marine policy for
oceanographers. There are 15 faculty members from the CMS who have agreed to
participate in this initial program. An additional equal number who teach and do
research in the general area of nearshore oceanography will add to the resource
base for this traineeship program; although not contacted for this program
initially, some may join later as potential advisors for the students. Over the
past decade, 17 students have received PhD degrees in Oceanography from the CMS
in which there was an emphasis in each one's dissertation research in nearshore
oceanography. The six faculty who advised these students are participants in the
new program that is proposed here. Although these previous students did not have
the same specific requirements as are proposed for the new program, many did
take one or more advanced estuarine and coastal oceanography courses and several
of the non-physicists did take advanced physical oceanography courses and used
dynamical physical oceanographic modelling in dissertations and refereed
publications. Most took a course in marine policy. We feel that we have
demonstrated the ability to give training in a coastal ocean processes
orientation for an oceanography degree and that we have the capacity to recruit
and advise the additional number of students that this GRT grant would support.
