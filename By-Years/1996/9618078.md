The proposal is to conduct a pair of linked conferences on the topic of
modelling in science, focussing on modelling in the biological, physical,
statistical and cognitive sciences. The general orientation used is an `inside-
out` approach, whereupon speakers who are established modellers in their fields
will present their perspectives on what is central to modelling in their fields.
The first conference will emphasize general methodological aspects of modelling,
while the second will look more closely at specific applications. To promote
dialog, the conference organizers will circulate brief summaries of contemporary
views prior to the conferences. A Web site and a discussion board will be
maintained on which synopses of papers will be posted and comment will be
encouraged. The central, long-term goals are to foster a research community in
the U.S. on methods of modelling and to promote links with European philosophers
of science actively working on related topics. One conference will be held in
Charlottesville, Virginia, in October 1997, and another will be held in Chicago,
Illinois, in March 1998.
