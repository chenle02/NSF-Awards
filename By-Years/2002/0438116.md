This project will address the leading deficiencies of the RegCM3 model over the
Greater Horn of Africa region. The specific goal is to investigate the causes of
the sub-optimal performance of the Regional Climate Model, version 3, over the
coastal regions of the Indian Ocean and Lake Victoria in Africa. This model will
be used to investigate the value of downscaling global climate model simulations
over the Greater Horn of Africa region. The already-established importance of
Lake Victoria in modulating the regional climate of Eastern Africa will be
further investigated by coupling the variability and predictability of the
three-dimensional circulation of Lake Victoria and the climatic conditions in
the lake basin.

This work will facilitate international collaboration between American and
African students, and is expected to contribute to stimulating learning and
education experiences for project students in the United States, while
furthering a network within the United States and the Greater Horn Region of
Africa. This work also contributes to national security by fostering
international cooperation at a fundamental level. Project activities, findings,
and curricula will be broadly disseminated through student and faculty
publications, as well as presentations and participation at research
conferences, and symposia. The research will have widespread impact on the
climate information user community through the development of enabling science
and technology for the interpretation and practical exploitation of regional
climate prediction information. The project will train 3 to 4 graduate students
and 10 undergraduate students in regional climate modeling.
