In this project, the principal investigator will study the relationship between
net surface radiation and upper ocean heat content in the tropical Pacific
Ocean. Objectives include: 1. Analysis of shortwave radiation flux variability
during two periods, the 1982-83 El Nino, and the Tropic Heat experiment in Oct,
1983-Oct, 1985; 2. Study of the role of surface radiation on the evolution of
sea surface temperature; 3. Assessment of the extent of the diurnal heating of
sea surface temperature by shortwave radiation and the effects of this process
on turbulent heat flux; and 4. Study of the relationship between the density of
convective lines in the atmosphere, and upper ocean mixing.
