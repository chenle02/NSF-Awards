The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation -
Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project is to enable the widespread adoption of
advanced nuclear reactors by providing a non-invasive and environmentally
responsible method to account for the plutonium produced during the operation of
the reactor. Nuclear reactors serve as a source of electric power but also
produce plutonium, which can be extracted from the used nuclear fuel and used
for other purposes. The proposed project will develop a next-generation
plutonium detector. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will determine
the detector performance requirements for real-world plutonium detection.
Neutrino detection can track plutonium production by measuring the effect it has
on the spectrum of neutrinos emitted by the reactor. This project will develop:
1) new readout electronics; and 2) a new cosmic-ray neutron shield to reduce the
rate of observed background events by an order of magnitude. This project
includes a field test for system validation and
verification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
