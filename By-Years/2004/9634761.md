Professor Nan Laird of Harvard University will be the principal speaker at a
conference on longitudinal data analysis. Prof. Laird will deliver a series of
lectures and prepare a monograph based on these lectures. Because of its wide
appeal and importance in applications, longitudinal data analysis has become an
intense area of statistical research. Prof. Laird has been on the forefront of
development since the early 1980's, both in methodology and application. In
addition, a number of other noted researchers in the field will be invited to
participate. The conference is tentatively scheduled to be held at the
University of Missouri-Columbia, June 3-8.
