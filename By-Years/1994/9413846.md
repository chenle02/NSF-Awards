*** 9413846 Cross This is a project to host a bilateral workshop proposed by Dr.
John Cross, the Uniformed Services University and Dr. Wilfred Tiu, the
University of the Philippines on October 16- 20, 1995 in Manila, the
Philippines. The purpose of this conference is to bring together U.S. and the
Philippine parasitologists to exchange ideas on the study of animal parasites
and their vectors, and to apply new and developing technologies to obtain a
better understanding of the parasites, their biology, life cycles and vectors.
The conference will also provide an opportunity for junior scientists to learn
about host parasite relationships and will encourage the development of graduate
programs in parasitology in the Philippines. ***
