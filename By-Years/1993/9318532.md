The three major aspects of this project are (1) comparison of CO2, water and
energy fluxes in different vegetation types and climates, (2) evaluating the
roles of water and energy fluxes as components of the coupled land-atmosphere
system, and (3) determining the relative importance of soil, root, and
aboveground components of net ecosystem CO2 flux. Fluxes will be measured in
with season-long fluxes measured in reference vegetation types by other
projects. The role of water and energy fluxes in regional climate will assessed
by land-surface model that can be coupled to a regional climate model.
Sensitivity analysis with this land-surface model will determine the major ways
in which regional climate. Labeling of soils with stable isotopes will be used
to evaluate the relative importance of roots and soil in controlling CO2 flux
from tundra. These experiments will be coordinated with measurements of soil
organic matter content and quality and of ecosystem CO2 flux made by other
projects in the Arctic System Science (ARCSS) Land/Atmosphere/Ice Interactions
Flux Study.
