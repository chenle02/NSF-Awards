Project Objectives: The primary objective of the project is to develop a
competitive research proposal on "Export Agriculture and Development: Towards a
Comparative Study." A first specific objective is to extinct and refine from the
literature a set of testable hypotheses concerning the conditions under which
export sector expansion leads to some form of development. Broader Significance
of the Project: Support of the project will assist a well trained black,
sociologist to improve his regular MRI proposal. The planning activities, if
successful, will significantly enhance the potential of the investigator to
compete for MRI and other research support.
