The Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) in the
State of West Virginia will enhance the research competitiveness of
investigators working in three research clusters: (1) Cell Regulatory Biology;
(2) Nonlinear Dynamics; and (3) Computational Materials. Three universities will
participate: Marshall University; West Virginia University and West Virginia
Institute of Technology. The West Virginia plan offers knowledge transfer
activities which will increase the number of graduate students for the
biomedical Ph.D. program, establish a graduate research seminar for students to
present their research results in non-linear dynamics, and establish workshops
with industry representatives in computational materials research. West Virginia
will continue to fund an equipment grant program to inspire undergraduate
students to continue science and engineering careers. Active participants in
EPSCoR governance will include key university administrators, State government
officers, and influential members of the private sector. Over the three-year
award period the State of West Virginia will contribute $3.6 million to ensure
the success of the EPSCoR effort.
