This award is made through the NSF Cultural Anthropology Faculty Scholars
Program, which supports specialized technical training for anthropologists with
on-going research programs. Dr. Jeremy M. Koster of the University of Cincinnati
will receive training in advanced statistical techniques that support multi-
level modeling for the analysis of behavioral observation data.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Koster will employ multi-level modeling to analyze data on
the subsistence strategies of indigenous horticulturalists in lowland Nicaragua.
Koster's research seeks to understand how individuals behave to meet subsistence
and economic needs throughout the seasonal round given variation in their ages,
wealth, skills, household composition, and social networks. The research is
important because better understanding of subsistence livelihoods can inform
interactions between the United States and countries with autonomous indigenous
populations, particularly in parts of the world that have been characterized by
political unrest and conflict. This award will allow the researcher to apply
advanced statistical techniques to a common type of anthropological data, and
the outcomes of this training will include analytical approaches that also can
be employed by other researchers.
