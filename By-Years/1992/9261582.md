The manner in which atmospheric energy is transferred to ocean surface current
is not fully understood. Measurements of surface currents cannot be obtained
from in situ sensors because of surface wave motions. Consequently, a recently-
developed radar remote sensing technique that can be used to measure ocean
surface currents is proposed, which can be used for future scientific
investigations. In this Phase I efforts, Quadrant Engineering will establish the
feasibility of a multifrequency microwave radar system to make surface current
measurements and prepare a detailed design of a prototype system that can be
built and used in a field experiment that can be carried out during Phase II.
