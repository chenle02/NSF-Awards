9403129 Geiger Dr. Cherie L. Geiger has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral
Research Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. Geiger received her doctoral degree from
the University of South Florida under the supervision of Professor Christian
Clausen. Dr. Geiger will continue research at the University of Central Florida
under the sponsorship of Professor Debra Reinhart. Her postdoctoral research
will focus on the mechanism of transport and analysis of chemicals interned at
municipal solid waste landfills. Elements of the research will include computer
modeling of gas generation and transport, improved sampling methods, and
development of GC and CG-MS analytical methods. Longer term, she plans to apply
her postdoctoral training to study subsurface contamination from agricultural
chemicals. The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed
as an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge and
experience of new Ph.D.s and attract them into meaningful careers in
contemporary chemical research and teaching.
