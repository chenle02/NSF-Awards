INT 9722782 Freericks This U.S.-Croatian research project between James
Freericks of Georgetown University and Veljko Zlatic of the University of Zagreb
will work toward uniting newly developed theoretical tools to describe how
electrons interact with phonons in real materials. Specifically, the researchers
intend to: 1) construct an accurate perturbative expansion for the electron-
phonon interaction that includes the effects of a nonconstant electron density
of states; and 2) compare the electronic spectral functions for the exact
solution of a classical electron-phonon problem to the spectral functions
determined by the conventional formalism. This should determine the effects of
nonconstant density states on the spectral features. Results are expected to
contribute to long-term efforts to construct a tunneling-inversion program that
can incorporate nonconstant electronic density of states input from first-
principles calculations. Success could be applicable to our understanding of
electron-phonon mediated superconductors. This research in materials theory
fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling
leading experts in the United State and Central Europe to combine complementary
talents and pool resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence. ??
