The GMI Engineering & Management Institute will initiate a three-week, commuter
Young Scholars project in the fields of Chemistry and Physics for 30 students
entering grade 9. The selected students will participate in hands-on science
activities involving chemical analysis and measurements, environmental
chemistry, polymer science, lasers, holography, and investigations of the
properties of light. Activities have been selected that are both exciting and
educational. Participants will be divided into small groups to conduct a short
research project. A portion of the three-week workshop will involve career
awareness activities such as question and answer sessions with visiting
scientists and engineers and field trips. The nine monthly follow-up activities
will involve hands-on science activities, dynamic speakers, field trips, and
competitive events.
