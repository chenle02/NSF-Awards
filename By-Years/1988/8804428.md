This award provides one-half the funding required to purchase a gas source mass
spectrometer. The instrument will be installed and operated by Department of
Geological Sciences at the University of Michigan. Research in progress and
planned in the Department of Geological Sciences requires many thousands of
stable isotope analyses of natural and synthetic materials per year. Emphasis
has been, and will continue to be, placed on microsampling techniques including
the use of laser ablation methods. Research projects for which the spectrometer
is needed include: 1) the isotope geochemistry of alunite, a mineral found in
association with precious metal deposits, 2) oxygen isotope fractionation during
the bacterial synthesis of apatite, useful for studies in paleothermometry of
the oceans, 3) a study of the stable isotope composition of clay minerals at the
Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary (an enrichment factor in the heavy oxygen-18
isotope could point to a glassy precursor for the clay which, in turn, would be
related to the major bolide impact that has been hypothesized as the cause of
the mysterious mass extinctions of living forms that occurred at the time).//
