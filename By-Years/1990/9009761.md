Neuropeptide Y is a 36 amino acid peptide that has been implicated in the
integration of a variety of behavioral, endocrine, and autonomic functions,
including several aspects of reproduction. It has been demonstrated that the
gonadal hormones, estradiol and progesterone can alter the hypothalamic mRNA
levels of neuropeptide Y. This project will examine the DNA sequence which is
responsible for the hormonal regulation of the gene that codes for Neuropeptide
Y. Dr. Camp will establish standard molecular biological methods to study the
mechanisms by which steroids affect gene expression in the central nervous
system. A promotor region of Neuropeptide Y gene will be used to test the gene's
responsiveness to progesterone. The result of this research will serve as a
model for exploring the methods by which hormones regulate the synthesis of
neurotransmitters in the central nervous system.//
