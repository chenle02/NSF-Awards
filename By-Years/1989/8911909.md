This research project will study the relationship between agricultural
intensification, village population size, and settlement patterns among small-
scale agriculturalists in the Peruvian Amazon. The project will use remote
sensed imagery together with ethnographic field data to investigate the manner
in which increased agricultural production for cash markets affects land use and
the exploitation of tropical forest resources. The methods include a survey of
seven villages along a small river to determine population density, land use
patterns, and market production, and intensive ethnographic interviewing to
establish the "native models" for culturally appropriate land use. Satellite
imagery will be analyzed to determine the degree of fit between the natives'
understanding of ecological processes and changes as detected from space. This
research is important because the Amazon forest is one of the most valuable
ecological resources on the planet. In order to learn how to deal with changes
we must understand how the native people who live there use the natural
environment. This sort of research, which compares native strategies with
objectively observed outcomes, can accomplish that understanding.
