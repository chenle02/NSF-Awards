The objective of the research is to improve experimental and theoretical
capabilities to characterize and understand how the nonlinearities of catalytic
reactions are manifested in reactor behavior. An integrated experimental and
theoretical approach is planned to explain the dynamics of catalytic reactions
and reactors. Catalytic reactions often have nonlinear kinetics which provide
the autocatalytic steps necessary for oscillations. The plan is to study such
systems as well as the responses of nonlinear systems to forced disturbances and
systems consisting of two or more coupled spontaneous oscillators (such systems
approximate spatial waves). The work could have substantial impact in two ways:
(1) as reactor types and operating conditions become more intricate, these
phenomena may be exploited by industry in the design and the operating phase to
improve reactor performance; and (2) aid in the design of efficient control
mechanisms for such linked systems where disturbances can propagate in
unpredictable ways.
