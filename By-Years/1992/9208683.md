This project addresses the mathematical representation of arrays of biological
neurons that are firing simultaneously with the goal of inferring their causal
connections or influence diagram on the basis of firing times. The methodology
of point processes of several types will be extended to include full likelihood
and second-order procedures to extend the results from social scientists' path
analysis and causal modeling. For small net works of two or three neurons,
partial coherence analysis and threshold modeling have proved effective;
however, for data for a larger network with eight neurons, nontrivial extensions
are needed for display and for analysis. Physiologically, neurons communicate
with each other via spike trains, emitting pulses that go on to influence other
neurons; and the neurons are themselves influenced. The goal of this research is
to infer the connection lines or "wiring diagram" of a network of neurons by
observing their individual firing times.
