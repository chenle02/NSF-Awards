This research, part of the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, is designed
to measure the time evolution of intermediate states in the multiphoton
ionization of molecules by monitoring the photoelectron spectrum of the
intermediate molecular species. The detailed knowledge of the energy states that
a molecule goes through during the process of multiphoton ionization will add to
our knowledge of chemical dynamics and our overall understanding of the
transition species involved in chemical reactions. The intermediate states,
which are probed using a probe laser, result from multiphoton ionization of the
starting species using suitable fast lasers. The resulting photoelectrons are
energy analysed and monitored as a function of pump probe delay. These data
yield the dynamic evolution of the intermediate state character and can be
measured with a time resolution dependent upon the laser width (about 5 ps.).
Interstate non-radiative transition, intramoleculear vibration redistribution
and van der Waals molecule predissociation rates will be measured using the pump
probe technique.
