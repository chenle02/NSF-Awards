Improved imaging techniques are necessary to guide and inform increasingly
complex surgical procedures. For example, cardiac bypass surgeries are required
for infants born with congenital heart defects; however, approximately 50% of
children develop brain injury perioperatively, leading to the damaging
complications for survivors of congenital heart disease. Improved cerebral
imaging techniques are needed to evaluate the effects of surgical procedures on
brain perfusion. One of the most promising techniques for cerebral imaging are
multiwave imaging methods such as photo-acoustic and thermo-acoustic tomography,
which combine properties of different waves to obtain high contrast and
resolution unattainable by traditional modalities. This project is motivated by
the possible application of multiwave imaging to monitor cerebral blood
perfusion in infants. It aims to incorporate the complexity of media properties
in the head (brain, vasculature, blood, cerebrospinal fluid, skull, skin) into
these imaging techniques, while making these techniques more robust to noise and
uncertainty.

The goals of this project are both theoretical and computational. The first is
to identify general assumptions under which the photo-acoustic measurements
render the simultaneous recovery of the internal source and the wave speed. This
will be accomplished by expanding the mathematical theory concerning the
simultaneous recovery of acoustic sources and media properties, which is one of
the main open questions regarding photo-, thermo- and magneto- acoustic imaging.
Based on preliminary work, the investigators have relaxed a-priori conditions
under which simultaneous recovery is possible. The next step is to determine
which conditions are essential and which ones can be removed. The second goal is
computational and uses the intrinsic property of the photo-acoustic effect,
which produces high contrast pressure profiles. The aim is to design novel
discontinuous Galerkin methods for accurate, low dispersion simulations of high
contrast pressure waves for use in new imaging algorithms. These methods are
designed to achieve high performance on GPU architectures in the presence of
realistic media and geometries. The third goal is to incorporate these new
developments into PDE-constrained optimization algorithms, which, in addition to
approximating the unknown wave speed of the medium, will also provide robustness
with respect to noise and lack of information.
