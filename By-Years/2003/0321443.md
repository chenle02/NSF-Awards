This U.S.-Venezuela award will support the dissertation research of Peter B.
McIntyre, Cornell University, under the direction of Dr. Alexander S. Flecker.
This project involves an assessment of how functional diversity of fishes is
related to species diversity in two tropical freshwater ecosystems. One
objective of this project is an appraisal of the importance of fishes in
nutrient recycling and the way in which recycling rates and ratios are affected
by species extinctions. Another objective is an evaluation of the relationship
between species diversity and trophic diversity of tropical freshwater fishes.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project provides a valuable perspective on the
relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning and impacts
strategies for conservation planning and management of tropical fisheries and
other natural resources. The results from this project can influence policies
that affect tropical freshwater fish communities upon which millions of people
depend for protein. This activity will give an international research experience
to a young U.S. investigator, who will work with other students in Venezuela, as
well as with subsistence fishermen.&lt;br/&gt;
