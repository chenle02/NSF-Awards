MPS-0104439 PI: Daniel J. Pisano

Dr. Pisano will carry out a program of research as an MPS Distinguished Research
Postdoctoral Fellow at the Australian National Telescope Facility. His research
will focus on the HI properties of loose groups of galaxies, in an effort to
resolve controversial models for the formation of our Milky Way Galaxy and
others more distant galaxies. Most galaxies, including our own, reside in
groups, although many properties of loose groups, such as our own Local Group,
are relatively poorly understood. It is not known whether loose groups of
galaxies are still assembling, for example, or how the environment affects
members of these groups. Some galaxy formation models suggest that hundreds of
dark matter halos should exist in loose groups. Perhaps the high velocity clouds
seen around the Milky Way are associated with these dark matter halos and are
the gaseous debris associated with the formation of the Local Group. If these
theories are correct, then the analogs of high velocity clouds and satellite
galaxies should exist in other loose groups as well. This research program will
test these hypotheses, with HI and optical observations of loose groups of
galaxies, that will search for the presence of high velocity clouds in loose
groups and detect low-mass, gas-rich galaxies. This research is funded through
the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the Directorate for Mathematical
and Physical Sciences. ***
