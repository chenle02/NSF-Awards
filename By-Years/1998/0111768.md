This Doctoral Dissertation Support investigation examines the way states resolve
trade disputes and the role international institutions, such as the World Trade
Organization, play in resolving these disputes. The investigator briefly lays
out the stages common to most trade disputes and provide evidence to highlight
the rarity of WTO trade disputes. The bulk of the dissertation involves two
primary tasks: a) to explain the reasons why states refer only a handful of
their disputes to international dispute resolution bodies, and b) to assess how
an international dispute resolution body facilitates the settlement of disputes,
both during those disputes member states take before the international body and
those disputes they settle "out of court."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To test these
research questions the investigator assembles a new dataset on trade disputes,
which includes information on disputes taken before the WTO and NAFTA, as well
as information on disputes settled without the involvement of an international
organization. A series of statistical analyses and case study evidence examines
which disputes go before international organizations and how the existence of an
international judicial body affects international cooperation.&lt;br/&gt;
