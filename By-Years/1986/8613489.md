One of the long-standing goals of the computer-aided design community is to
write computer programs that will automatically design circuits from abstract
descriptions of their desired behavior. Programs that are effective circuit
designers cannot be built until the roles of knowledge-based and algorithmic
techniques in circuit design are understood. Knowledge-based systems are ideal
for studying a large design space where the guidelines are poorly understood,
but it is nearly impossible to verify their correctness. Design algorithms are
easier to maintain and verify, but a complete set cannot be built without a more
complete and formal understanding of circuit design than is likely to exist in
the foreseeable future. Incorrect application of either method can only produce
unreliable programs or low quality designs. This research will focus on a
program for automatic circuit design that will partition the design task into
algorithmic and knowledge-based parts, generate components, and combine the
components into a single whole. The major research issues are how to partition
the original design task and how to recompose the parts into a functioning
whole.
