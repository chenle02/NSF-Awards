With support from the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry
Division, Paul N. Schatz in the Department of Chemistry at the University of
Virginia will use magnetic circular dichroism and magnetic circularly polarized
luminescence spectroscopies to study species isolated in noble gas matrices at
very low temperatures. Specifically, he plans on studying a variety of molecules
of biological significance such as phthalocyanine or porphyrin-containing
sandwich type compounds in which a metal ion is simultaneously coordinated to
two more-or-less planar and parallel phthalocyanine or porphyrin rings. By
combining magnetooptical spectroscopy with laser hole-burning techniques, it
should be possible to obtain an exceptional degree of detail about excited state
g-values, intramolecular electronic and Jahn-Teller interactions and crystal
field-type interactions.
