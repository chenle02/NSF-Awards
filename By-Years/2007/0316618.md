The foci of this research are three fold. First, Pd-catalyzed isomerization and
kinetic allylic substitution will be used to prepare oxazolines and vicinal
diamines. Second, In-catalyzed atom transfer cyclization methodology will be
studied. Third, In-mediated allylation of aldehydes and imines, utilizing Pd-
catalysis to generate reactive indium complexes, will be
developed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular
Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Gregory R. Cook in the
Department of Chemistry at North Dakota State University. Dr. Cook will focus
his work on developing synthetic methodology for the palladium-catalyzed
synthesis of aminoalcohols and diamines and on the use of indium catalysis to
develop eco-friendly processes for organic synthesis. The project could have
broader impact for the pharmaceutical industry and for green chemistry in
general. The project also presents an excellent venue for the training of
graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
