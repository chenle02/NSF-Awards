DMS-0107792&lt;br/&gt;Zoltan Szabo&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The main theme of this
project is the study of three-manifolds &lt;br/&gt;and smooth four-manifolds by
using gauge theory and symplectic geometry. The Principal Investigator proposes
to study and &lt;br/&gt;further develop a recent construction that give
invariants &lt;br/&gt;for closed oriented 3-manifolds and a related construction
&lt;br/&gt;that give invariants for smooth closed oriented 4-manifolds.
&lt;br/&gt;These constructions use handle decompositions and a
version&lt;br/&gt;of Lagrangian Floer-homology. The PI will also study
&lt;br/&gt;applications of these new techniques in 3 and 4-manifold
&lt;br/&gt;topology. In particular PI will study these invariants for three-
manifolds that fiber over a circle and symplectic
&lt;br/&gt;4-manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gauge theory is a very important
technique in smooth &lt;br/&gt;4-manifold theory. It involves the theory of
Donaldson &lt;br/&gt;invariants and Seiberg-Witten invariants. These invariants
&lt;br/&gt;are constructed by solving certain elliptic partial differential
equations inspired by mathematical physics. Both constructions &lt;br/&gt;have
ramifications for three-manifolds as well, these&lt;br/&gt;are related to
solving the partial differential equations &lt;br/&gt;over four-manifolds with a
three-dimensional boundary. &lt;br/&gt;In addition to studying these invariants
the Principal &lt;br/&gt;Investigator also proposes to study in detail a third
&lt;br/&gt;construction that involves holomorphic disks and a
&lt;br/&gt;decomposition of the manifold into elementary pieces.&lt;br/&gt;
