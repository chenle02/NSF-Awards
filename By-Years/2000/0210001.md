ABSTRACT

OCE-0210001

With this Small Grant for Exploratory Research, researchers at the University
of Massachusetts at Boston will investigate the environmental impact of the
World Trade Center terrorist attack on September 11, 2001, by studying the
chemistry and mineralogy of sediments of New York Harbor. The studies will
determine whether atmospheric and storm-water inputs of dust, debris, and
contaminants can be used with radiotracers to identify and characterize an
event-related stratigraphic imprint, assess impacts on sediment quality, and
characterize spatial aspects of sedimentation.
