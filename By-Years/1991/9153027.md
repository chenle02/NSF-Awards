This project takes advantage of using videodisc and optical disc technologies in
order to overcome obstacles inherent in teaching/learning manufacturing
processes and pavement design/construction courses in civil engineering. These
technologies are particularly effective for use in teaching manufacturing
processes and related courses since complete understanding of these subjects
cannot be gained without actually viewing the manufacturing processes.The
opticaldisc recording equipment involved in the project permits control over the
production and updating of optical discs, and the production of the
instructional material on a timely basis and at a fraction of the cost of having
the discs produced commercially.
