9417918 Morgan This research is to seismically image the crust and upper mantle
under Iceland to determine the shape of the basaltic melt source region. It will
be a collaborative study with a large part of the effort supported by the
National Environment Research Council of the UK, and participation of scientists
from the Meteorological Office of Iceland, and the U.S. Geological Survey and
Lawrence Livermore Laboratory in the U.S. Portable seismic instrumentation from
PASSCAL (35 stations) and the UK (10 stations) will be added to the 20 permanent
Icelandic stations for 18 months to use local earthquakes and teleseisms to
image the subsurface. Possible correlation with data from European stations and
U.S. Navy hydrophone arrays will extend the range of images. The results should
illuminate theories of hot spot structure and convection in the mantle which is
a major driving force of plate tectonics. ***
