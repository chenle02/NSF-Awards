This grant supports a workshop to coordinate the emerging research community
developing "algorithm auditing," a research design that has shown promise in
diagnosing the unwanted consequences of algorithmic systems. Automated software-
based systems in finance, media, information, transportation, or any application
of computing can easily create outcomes that are unforeseeable by their
designers, so algorithm auditing has the potential to improve the design of
these systems. Auditing in this sense takes its name from the social scientific
"audit study" where one feature is manipulated in a field experiment. This
workshop proposes to coalesce this new area of inquiry and to produce a report
characterizing the state of the art and potential future directions. The topic
of algorithm auditing brings together computer science, information science, and
social science in novel combinations. Participants will have opportunities to
articulate challenges that they face, to present existing methods for auditing,
and to propose research agendas that can provide new insights that advance
science and benefit society. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific issues
addressed by this workshop are key economic and social impediments to the
adoption and development of fundamental advances in information and
communication technologies. How humans think about complex algorithms is a
fundamental problem in human-computer interaction and cognitive science. There
is industrial interest in third-party algorithm auditing as a way to address
user dissatisfaction with algorithmic systems and to forestall future problems.
Recent research suggests that algorithmic decision-making using "big data" may
increase unfairness and structural inequality. Algorithmic systems form a new
avenue for the maintenance and transmission of social stratification, and may
fuel cumulative disadvantage. Unwanted behavior by algorithmic systems
contributes to major societal challenges such as anti-competitive behavior,
fraud, unlawful discrimination, and economic and social inequality.
