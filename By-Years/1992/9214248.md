Expansive soils damage to residential and light commercial occur in many parts
of the United States and it has been estimated to cause annual losses on the
order of $6-7 million. The project will test laboratory models and full- scale
prototypes of a device called foundation isolation tube which is intended to
greatly reduce damage to structure foundations caused by expansive soils. In
both sets of tests, the performance of instrumented drilled shafts constructed
both, with and without foundation isolation tubes will be monitored during
periods of soil moisture variation. Comparison of the performance of these
shafts will verify the effectiveness of this mitigation technique in reducing
axial loads due to the vertical movement of expansive soils. The results of this
research will provide an improved understanding of the nature of subsurface
moisture migration in the vicinity of drilled shaft foundations. Guidelines for
the use of this technique will be developed allowing geotechnical engineers to
design more reliable and economical foundations in expansive soils sites.
