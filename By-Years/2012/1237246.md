This I-Corps project proposes step-growth aliphatic polyesters that have
tailorable thermal and mechanical properties. The proposed liquid amorphous
prepolymer approach is a versatile method for the production of degradable
elastomeric materials. Control of thermal and solubility properties allows the
team to tune the degradation rate, with complete degradation of a material in a
period as little as thirty days. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Biodegradable polymers
are currently of great interest to both academia and industry. By further
developing and pursuing the proposed technology, which utilizes common monomers,
involves a relatively easy synthetic process, and results in a library of
amorphous polymers with various properties and uniform degradation profiles, the
proposed innovation can have a significant positive impact on both realms. The
ability to tailor properties at low cost allows the team to design materials for
specific applications and public needs. The team also identifies integrating
their insights from the I-Corps program into various entrepreneurship
initiatives at The University of North Carolina in order to further develop a
spirit of entrepreneurship across the community.
