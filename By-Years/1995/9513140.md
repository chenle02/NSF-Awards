9513140 Majda This award supports a three-year collaborative research project
between Professor Marcin Majda of the University of California at Berkeley and
Professor Yoshio Umezawa of the University of Tokyo. The goal of this
collaboration is to explore some fundamental issues in the design of selective
molecular sensors. Specifically, molecular recognition phenomena and host-guest
interactions in monolayers at electrodes will be investigated. This proposal
brings together scientists from two countries working on different aspects of
the same general problem. The US scientists will have the opportunity to use
modern spectroscopic and microscopic equipment in Japan as well as to work with
novel types of compounds synthesized in Japan. The Japanese scientists will have
a chance to use Langmuir-Blodgett and electrochemical techniques developed in
Berkeley. This collaboration should increase our understanding of molecular
recognition phenomena and result in development of new technologies for
selective sensor fabrication. ***
