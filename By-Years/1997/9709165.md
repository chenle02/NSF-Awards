This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program will assist the Department of Chemistry at the University of Rochester
in acquiring a 400 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer. This
equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including the following:
(1) bioorganic chemistry, (2) mechanisms of organic reactions involving reactive
intermediates, (3) reactivity of ion radicals, (4) parahydrogen induced
polarization, and (5) photoinduced electron transfer reactions. Nuclear Magnetic
Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists for
the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown
substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to
study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to
state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out
frontier research. The results from these NMR studies are useful in the areas
such as polymers, catalysis, and in biology.
