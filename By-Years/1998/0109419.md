This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
Two-Photon Resonant Holography (TPRH) imaging technique capable of recording
time-resolved number densities of atomic or molecular species. Resonant
holography and the innovative application of two-photon absorption and
photorefractive quantum well (PRQW) holographic devices will allow the
development of high-speed systems using only low-cost, solid-state components.
Phase I will develop the TPRH technique by constructing a prototype system and
demonstrating its operation with a selected species. The use of two-photon
absorption with resonant holography allows visible or infrared (IR) lasers to
probe species with ultraviolet (UV) absorption lines. Costly UV lasers and
optics can be avoided. The PRQW device enables high recording rates. These
devices are capable of kiloHertz or megaHertz rates with energy requirements in
the nanojoule range.

Commercial applications are expected in industrial and fundamental research
areas: combustion, plasmas, reacting flows, in vitro biomedical testing,
supersonic mixing and reacting flows, and basic research into the nonlinear
behavior of atomic or molecular electronic systems. Furthermore, TPRH may find
applications in very low cost video rate systems; lightweight, low-power
airborne or space-based systems; and multiple-view systems for tomographic
measurements.
