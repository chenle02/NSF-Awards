This research aims to contribute to the advancement of scientific knowledge by
making explicit certain aspects of the engineering design process which are
currently mainly implicit. This research will examine the general design theory
of the praxiological school of philosophy with respect to a particular control
systems design program. The principal investigator will study the mechanism
whereby the general theory of praxiology is related to the particular design
program. An articulation of this mechanism will aid the development of other
design programs.
