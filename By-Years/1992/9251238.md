It has been recognized that physics graduates progressing to careers in
experimental physics in industry or to studies for a higher degree, need on-the-
job training in the design and planning stage of experiments. More often than
not this training is haphazard, with a good chance that the trainee is self-
taught. We believe that the education of our majors will be more complete if
their first planning and design assignments are performed with an oversight and
feedback from faculty, in a formal course setting. To meet this need we have
inaugurated an experimental physics design lab for seniors. A core of equipment
has been assembled for the course, and more apparatus is being brought into the
laboratory to bring it to its planned stage. The main goals of the teaching mode
for the course are to develop initiative, and to instill in the students the
need for sound design and planning of experiments. The choice of experiments is
based on a number of factors; utilization of a physical principle or technique
of wide applicability, available equipment, and non-overlap with experiments in
preceding laboratory courses. The experiments chosen also are somewhat open-
ended, to meet the goals of the teaching mode.
