The hypothesis is that designers utilize a hierarchical sequence of mathematical
models from simple, highly idealized, cheap models towards the most rigorous,
complex, and expensive models. They stop when the idealization error is
sufficiently small or they run out of time or money. Currently, the error
estimate is usually based on the judgement of the design engineer. The objective
is to develop algorithms to automatically estimate the error and control the
analysis. The concept should be generally applicable to evaluating designs, but
to illustrate the method this research project will be focused on plate and
shell theory.
