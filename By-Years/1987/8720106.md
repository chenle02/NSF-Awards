Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
available to the chemist for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It
is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solutions. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential
to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. This award, supported by the
Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program, the Instrumentation for Materials
Research Program and the Interfacial, Transport, & Thermodynamic Processes
Program will help the Department of Chemistry at Clark University to acquire a
wide bore NMR spectrometer. The proposed instrument will serve not only the
Department but will be shared by a number of scientists in the region through
the aegis of the Worcester Consortium. The areas of research in the Worcester
Consortium that will be enhanced by the acquisition include: 1) Dynamics and
Structure in Polymeric Systems 2) NMR Studies of G Protein-Ligand Interactions
3) Effect of Immobolization of the Inherent Selectivity of Spectrophotometric
and Spectrofluorometric Reagents 4) Study of the Intracrystalline Diffusion in
Molecular Sieve Zeolites by NMR and Gravimetric Methods 5) NMR Studies on
Antibody Binding Sites
