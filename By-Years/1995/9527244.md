9527244 Roesler This project is a three-year study of what happens to solar
energy at the interface between the antarctic sea ice and the atmosphere,
specifically how the energy is apportioned among the ocean, the ice, and the
lowest air layers. It will be carried out in cooperation with the Australian
Antarctic Program, with field work on board the Australian ship Aurora
Australis. The very high reflectivity of the seasonal antarctic sea ice cover
reduces the input of solar energy at the surface, and the low thermal
conductivity of the ice reduces the loss of heat from the ocean to the
atmosphere, significantly affecting the climate of the Southern Ocean.
Information about how these processes work is needed in order to develop
appropriate and realistic sea ice models, and to integrate these into general
circulation and climate change models. Three topics will be investigated: the
distribution and types of snow and ice cover and their reflectance in the solar
spectrum, the effect of clouds in transmitting incident solar radiation, and the
distribution and absorption properties of organic material within the snow and
ice. Calibrated downward and reflected upward irradiance observations will be
used to infer the radiation balance at the surface and will be used to model the
surface energy forcing for the antarctic sea ice region. The concentration and
distribution of major organic absorbers will be determined from core samples
within the ice, and their effect on the transmittance of energy within the
visible and ultraviolet bands will be studied. Algal layers are frequently found
within the antarctic sea ice, and have been proposed as a likely mechanism for
initiating seasonal plankton blooms in the Southern Ocean. ***
