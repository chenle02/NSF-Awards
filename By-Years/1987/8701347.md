The 1987 Theoretical Advanced Study Institute in Elementary Particle Physics
(TASI-87) will be held during the four week period, July 5 to August 1, 1987 in
Santa Fe, New Mexico. The format and aims of the proposed TASI-87 are very
similar to those of previous TASI's, held at University of Michigan (Summer,
1984), Yale (1985) and University of California at Santa Cruz (1986). The
seminars and lecture series will include four courses on topics in: (1) standard
model physics, experimental tests, future facilities and detectors, and
expectations of physics in the TeV range; (2) strings, superstrings and other
efforts to find theories unifying the standard model with gravity, and the
efforts to extract predictions from these theoretical proposals; (3) present and
future experiments and accelerators; (4) grand unified theories and the
astrophysics- particle physics-cosmology connection. Seminars on a variety of
special topics will supplement the main lecture series. The local organizing
committee is composed of members of the Theoretical Division at the Los Alamos
Lab. The lectures and seminars will be held on the campus of St. John's College
in Santa Fe, which is 40 miles from Los Alamos. This Institute provides a
unique, crucial opportunity for American graduate students in theoretical
elementary particle physics to receive advanced training in the recent
developments in this field. Thus, the Institute is very important to the future
strength of the field.
