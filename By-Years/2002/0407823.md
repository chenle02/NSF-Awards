Using ground-based data from the Coupling Energetics and Dynamics of Atmospheric
Regions (CEDAR) database, and satellite data from a variety of sources
(including the Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics
(TIMED) and Dynamics Explorer satellites), a global empirical model of
thermospheric winds during magnetic storm periods is developed. The model will
elucidate the spatial, seasonal, solar activity, and geomagnetic activity
dependencies of storm-induced perturbation winds. The product is to be
integrated into the commonly used Horizontal Wind Model (HWM), for direct use by
the entire community. This model will improve the specification and forecasting
capabilities of current numerical models of the thermosphere and ionosphere by
provision of a known time-boundary condition.
