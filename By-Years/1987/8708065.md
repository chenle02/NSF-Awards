The thrust of the research program is on the analysis of the fundamental
friction and wear mechanisms of ceramic and metal-ceramic surfaces subjected to
high temperatures and large contact stresses. Particular emphasis will be placed
on examining the dependence of the tribological properties on some critical
parameters such as ceramic layer(s) thickness, temperature, magnitude of surface
tractions, interfacial "friction" conditions, and mechanical and thermal
properties of layer and substrate materials, in the light of experimental and
analytical results. The finite element analysis of layered media subjected to
mechanical and thermal surface loads, in conjunction with the experimental work,
will result in the development of the necessary criteria for the design of low-
friction and wear- resistant layered surfaces for severe contact applications.
