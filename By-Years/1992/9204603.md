Description: This project supports the travel of a delegation of U.S.
physicists to Pakistan to participate in the "Seventeenth Nathiagali Summer
College". The meeting is an annual activity organized by the Government of
Pakistan to offer to the participants a forum to discuss advances in physics and
their relationships to modern needs. The main topics for this college are:
computational physics, with special emphasis on multilevel methods, efficient
iterative techniques, and applications in fluid dynamics, radiation transport,
and phase transitions in solids; plasma physics, including high density pinches,
inertial confinement, plasma spectroscopy and diagnostics, and space plasmas.
The program is divided into two separate week-long sessions, with participants
attending either or both weeks. Short workshops following the more intense
lecture sessions are planned. This format provides for close interaction and
collaboration. It is planned to provide lecture notes to participants, and an
attempt will be made to publish the proceedings as was done in several of the
past colleges. Scope: The proposed summer college has been held annually in
Nathiagali, Pakistan, with participation from scientists throughout Asia and
Africa and with lecturers from the western world. It has received high praise in
the past from participants from these countries as well as from international
organizations such as the International Center for Theoretical Physics in
Trieste. It is receiving partial support from that Center as well as from the
Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing. This activity fits well within the
objectives of the Science in Developing Countries Program.
