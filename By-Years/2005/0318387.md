This project focuses on improving the hiring, promotion and retention of women
faculty &lt;br/&gt;members in academe. To achieve this goal the best practices
currently in use will be identified by &lt;br/&gt;conducting site-visits at 35
Research Extensive and Intensive universities and by publicly
&lt;br/&gt;recognizing departments of chemistry and chemical engineering having
positive environments &lt;br/&gt;supportive of women faculty members. In
addition, participating schools will be given &lt;br/&gt;confidential feedback
on the environment for women at their institution as well as the general
&lt;br/&gt;findings from this study. A toolkit will be developed for all
institutions to use to identify &lt;br/&gt;strengths and weaknesses in their
practices with respect to women faculty and to suggest ways &lt;br/&gt;they can
assist new and mid-career faculty members. Overall assessments of the data from
the &lt;br/&gt;on-site visits will be prepared for publication, highlighting
successful best practices, and &lt;br/&gt;presentations will be given at
national meetings of the American Chemical Society (ACS). &lt;br/&gt;
