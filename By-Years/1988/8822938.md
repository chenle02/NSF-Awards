This research deals with various uses of delocalized carbanions in polymer
synthesis. For example, they can be used for the preparation of novel monomers,
can initiate the polymerization process, or form macromers. The work to be
carried out will deal with the preparation of new silarylene and silarylene
siloxane polymers with potential utility as photoresists, membranes, and
materials resistant to extreme conditions. New catenanes will also be prepared,
as will new types of comb polymers and block polymers. The polymerization
process itself and the kinetics of propagation will be studied by advanced
nuclear magnetic resonance techniques, with particular attention to the early
stages of the reaction.
