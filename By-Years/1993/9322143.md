9322143 Sheffield This award provides funds to the Biology Department of Temple
University to continue a successful REU site for a combined academic year and
Summer program of undergraduate research. This program will draw on experience
as an REU site awardee for previous years, and also incorporates elements of
other Temple programs. It is the goal of this program to provide a rich research
environment and a sense of community among promising students in order to
encourage them to enter careers in the biological sciences. The program is
designed to help students develop self confidence that will allow them to
progress from dependence to independence in research. The Biology Department at
Temple University is in a unique position with respect to biological research
and education of underrepresented groups. As a department in a major research
university, they have an active faculty and substantial grant support. At the
same time, Temple, as an urban university, attracts a diverse student
population. Many of the students are the first in their families to attend
college. Temple was found that a large number of these students have not
considered a career in research despite their abilities. and can benefit
significantly from a program such as this. ***
