9318323 Wheat This U.S.-Mexico award will support Professor Harovel Wheat in a
research collaboration with Professor Guillermo Hernandez Duque of the Programa
De Corrosion del Golfo de Mexico in Campeche, Mexico. The investigators intend
to study several repair and protection techniques that could be useful in
minimizing corrosion damage to reinforced concrete structures in marine
environments. In this effort, techniques used at the University of Texas will be
applied to reinforced concrete samples made with Mexican materials.
Complementary techniques such as polarization resistance and electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy as well as optical and scanning electron microscopy will
also be used to characterize samples both in Texas and in Mexico. Periodic
meetings will promote the exchange of information and results. ***
