9457133 Baldick Currently, optimal power flow and other software tools in use in
the electric power industry assume a centrally dispatched and planned network.
However, with increased non-utility generation and increased trades of
electricity over larger distances, the assumption of centralized dispatch and
planning is less reasonable. I plan to incorporate models of organizational
structure, such as separated ownership, control, and planning into optimal power
flow, unit commitment, and transmission planning formulations. This work will
build on my ongoing research projects and consolidate them. ***
