The focus of this research is in gallium arsenide analog preprocessing
electronics for infrared focal plane array sensors. In particular, analog
preprocessors for high-performance read out and preprocessing functions in
linear z-dimension using gallium arsenide integrated circuits are developed.
These circuits are evaluated for applications in sensing using infrared focal
plane array sensors.
