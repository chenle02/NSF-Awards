9401215 Malikov This award supports research on the representation theory of
affine Lie algebras and quantum groups. The principal investigator will work on
(1) affine Lie algebra modules realized in multi-valued functions on a flag
manifold; (2) Wess-Zumino-Witten model at a critical level; (3) complex powers
in algebra and geometry; and (4) the Gel'fand-Kirillov conjecture for quantum
groups. Many different algebraic objects can be represented as algebraic sets of
transformations of other algebraic objects. Through these representations their
structure can be determined. This project is concerned with the representation
theory of infinite dimensional Lie algebras. The study of these algebras has
applications throughout mathematics and mathematical physics. ***
