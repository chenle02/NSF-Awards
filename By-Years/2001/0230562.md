One of the many ambitions of Arizona State University East (ASUE) faculty is to
motivate and mentor Arizona students to pursue education in science, technology,
engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Our planning strategy is to explore the
creation of a consortium of partners from educational institutions (ASUE, Pima
Community College [PCC], and six high schools in the Sunnyside School District);
the Arizona Science Center (ASC); and industry collaborators (Intel, Microchip,
STMicroelectronics, and Texas Instruments) to launch a campaign to interest
young adults in science and technology disciplines. Their objective has been to
study the creation of educational pathways and career awareness programs for
students enrolled in middle school, high school, and community college science
and math courses that culminate in the completion of a Baccalaureate Degree in
Engineering Technology/Technology at ASUE. Their goal is to improve the
educational system in the State of Arizona and to render underrepresented
Arizona populations (Hispanics, Native and African Americans, and women) better
equipped to meet the multidisciplinary needs of high technology companies.
