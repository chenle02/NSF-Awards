The objective of this research is to develop a biocompatible, fabricated
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent platform with novel properties,
including sensory capability, and potential for wide application to biomedical
research. The approach is to employ both top-down and self assembly approaches,
incorporating environmentally responsive materials, to develop a class of
contrast agents which address major limitations of currently available agents.

This project addresses the development of next generation MRI contrast agents
using micro- and nanofabrication techniques incorporating biocompatible magnetic
materials to develop a series of geometrically precise, particulate contrast
agents yielding distinct spectral signatures with multiplexing capability. In
addition, the incorporation of biocompatible hydrogels, tunable to respond to
myriad environmental stimuli, into the fabrication process will yield in vivo
biological sensing capability.

The broader impact of the proposed MRI contrast agents includes an expanded role
of MRI in biomedical applications from the bench to the bedside. Multiplexed
imaging, paired with an in vivo sensing capability, would dramatically
potentiate the study of myriad diseases using MRI. In addition to the research
impact, this project offers a rich potential for educating pre-college,
undergraduate and graduate students given its multidisciplinary nature,
integrating materials science, micro- and nanofabrication techniques, as well as
imaging science and a focus on biomedical application. Finally, the
investigators will take part in Boston University's Summer High School Honors
Program to mentor high school students on this project, a unique opportunity to
expose the top students from across the country to a rich, interdisciplinary
educational experience.
