The factors that affect the growth and decline of populations in nature remain
elusive, in part because the importance of social interactions has been
underestimated. Community nesting behavior in a salamander species and the
relation to behavior and population dynamics will be studied. Specifically, it
will be determined whether limited nest site plays a role in causing communal
nesting, and whether communal nests are the result of aggressive or cooperative
interactions. Results may indicate that existing predictive models of population
growth that ignore behavior are inadequate. In addition, data derived from this
detailed population study may provide insights into the causes of an apparent
decline in amphibian populations in eastern forests.
