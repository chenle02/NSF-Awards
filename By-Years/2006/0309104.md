Human activities are increasingly stressing the global environment, leading to a
warmer climate, increased nitrogen deposition, and the loss of biodiversity.
These global changes have the potential to significantly affect local
ecosystems. For example, climate warming can have direct effects on ecosystem
processes such as plant productivity, carbon sequestration and nitrogen cycling.
Warming can also have indirect effects on those processes via its effect on
plant species diversity and soil nitrogen availability. My research draws on
results from an on-going warming experiment, and completes a triad of climate
manipulation, pattern analysis, and plant species/nitrogen manipulations by
crossing plant species removal with nitrogen addition treatments in a montane
meadow ecosystem. I am removing those plant species with relatively shallow
rooting structures, which on the basis of the warming manipulation are the ones
most likely to be stressed by future warming. The level of nitrogen addition is
motivated by an observed increase in soil nitrogen availability in the warming
experiment. By monitoring how the loss of species and the addition of nitrogen
affect plant productivity, carbon sequestration and nitrogen cycling, my
research will improve our ability to make predictions about how the
anthropogenic stress of climate change may affect important ecosystem processes.
