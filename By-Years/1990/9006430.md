On western sides of ocean basins are strong boundary layers which transport
water and heat poleward and equatorward. Many conceptual models have been
developed to understand these processes. This effort will focus on simplified
models of the boundary layer and include topographic and inertial effects. As a
related issue, dispersion of properties will be investigated. They are dependent
on the level of turbulence which is controlled by instabilities of the boundary
flow.
