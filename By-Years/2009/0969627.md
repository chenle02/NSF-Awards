This project includes plans to increase the number of bachelor degrees in
natural science and engineering at California State University Northridge (CSUN)
by increasing retention rates of first-time freshmen and of transfer students.
The goal is to develop a support network for success based on national and
established campus best practices. Major components of the project are: 1)
fostering success in lower-division mathematics, 2) a summer interdisciplinary
team experience after the first year, and 3) career awareness activities.

Many of the additional degrees are expected to be earned by underrepresented
students given that the institution is designated as Hispanic-serving. In
addition, CSUN serves a region in which a majority of college-bound students are
economically disadvantaged and are the first generation to pursue a college
degree.
