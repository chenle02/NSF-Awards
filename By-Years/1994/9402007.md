9402007 Zingaro This U.S.-Mexico award will support Professor Ralph Zingaro in a
research collaboration with Professor Padmanabhan Nair of the Laboratorio de
Energia Solar in Cuernavaca, Mexico. The researchers intend to study the
preparation of semiconducting thin films of metal sulfides, selenides and
tellurides by chemical deposition from homogeneous solutions. These films are of
potential application to infrared detection, solar control filters, low-cost
solar technology, metal chalcogenide thin films photography and photo voltaic
and electronic device applications. The proposed work will combine the chemical
expertise and instrumental capabilities of the Texas A&amp;M group with the
expertise in solid state physics and specific instrumentation of the group in
Mexico. The deposition method chosen by the investigators has the advantage that
it is low in cost, has minimum energy requirements, does not require high
capital investment and can be utilized in locations that do not possess
technical sophistication. ***
