The present theory of our solar systemâ€™s origin involves a massive concentration
of dust and gas collapsing under gravity, forming a star that is embedded in a
protoplanetary disk of material from which planets, moons, asteroids, and comets
form. Meteorites can provide evidence of how this dust and gas formed rocky
objects in this protoplanetary disk. This laboratory and theoretical research
program will address whether fine-grained-dust rims around chrondrules in stony
meteorites can cause them to form larger objects, which become the building
blocks of asteroids. Undergraduate students at Baylor University and at the
University of Texas at Austin will be trained in modern laboratory
techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will determine the initial
structural properties of dust rims accreted by chondrules. A numerical dust
coagulation code with enhancements with to treat ellipsoidal and charged grains
will be used to determine the pre-compaction porosity, morphology, and grain
alignment of chondrule at the dust grain level. The effect of collisions on
fine-grained dust rims (FGRs) compaction will be calculated using the shock
physics code iSALE2D modified to represent porous FGRs as a result of collisions
between rimmed-chondrule or planetesimals. Numerical simulations of the passage
of shock waves through material containing rimmed chondrules will be performed.
The morphology, grain alignment, and porosity of FGRs in CO, CR, and CV
chondrites will be measured. This experimental work will examine how FGRs form
minimally altered carbonaceous chondrites using X-ray computed tomography,
electron backscatter diffraction and electron Probe microanalysis. These results
will be compared to the structural properties obtained in the
models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
