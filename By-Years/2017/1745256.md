This award provides three years of funding to help defray the expenses of
participants in the "Virginia Operator Theory and Complex Analysis Meeting," a
conference series in which the 2017 event will take place on Saturday, October
28, 2017, on the campus of the University of Virginia. In the years 2018 and
2019 the conference will take place on the campus of Washington and Lee
University. Additional information about the conference can be found on the
website https://votcam.wordpress.com/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Virginia Operator
Theory and Complex Analysis Meeting (VOTCAM) is an annual regional conference
that has taken place since 1992. It brings together a diverse group of
mathematicians whose primary research interest is in function theoretic operator
theory and related areas. A sampling of the topics presented in the 2017 event
is given by the following: quasidiagonality of C*-algebras, recovering
topological spaces from continuous functions, von Neumann algebras determined by
microstates, approximation properties and Banach spaces, commutators of singular
integrals, and multipliers on spaces of functions. The conference program
provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young
scientists to present their work.
