An important activity for any type of research is the exchange of knowledge and
information developed from research and practice. This project is in support of
the Tenth International Symposium on Transportation and Traffic Theory to be
held at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts on
July 8-10, 1987. Preliminary preparations must be conducted in advance of the
formal meeting; thus, this project will enable the researcher to commence the
activities.
