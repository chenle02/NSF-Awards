9600268 Wu This award supports a 12 month Japan Science and Technology Agency
(STA) Postdoctoral Fellowship for Dr. Honglu Wu at the National Institute of
Radiological Sciences, Chiba, Japan. Dr. Wu will work with Dr. Y. Furusawa, head
of Space and Particle Radiation Research Group, on a research project entitled,
"Heavy Ion-Induced Chromosome Aberrations". The proposed research will make use
of the Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba (HIMAC) to study chromosome
aberrations in human cells, particularly human fibroblasts. The major objectives
of this study are to analyze chromosome aberrations using state-of-the-art
techniques and to investigate the effect of shielding in reducing biological
damage. Results of the investigation will be useful for NASA and the Japanese
space agency to determine guidelines for radiation protection in space missions,
as well as for understanding cancer incidence and cancer treatment with heavy
ion beams. ***
