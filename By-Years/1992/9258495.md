This is a National Science Foundation Young Investigator Award. The goal of Dr.
Caplan's laboratory is to identify the cellular machinery involved in the
generation and maintenance of epithelial polarity. This will be done using the
powerful tools of Drosophila genetics. A screening procedure already developed
in the laboratory, together with P-element mediated mutagenesis, will be used to
identify mutants carrying genetic alterations relevant to epithelial polarity.
Genes identified through this process will be cloned and their protein products
will be characterized. %%% This is a National Science Foundation Young
Investigator Award. Dr. Caplan is interested in the fundamental and important
question of how epithelial cells "know" how to maintain a distinct "up and down"
polarity. This is a critical question, since the proper function of epithelial
cells is dependent on this polarity (e.g., pumping of ions from one side of an
epithelial cell layer to the other; secretion of hormones, enzymes, or mucous
lubricants to the appropriate place; uptake of nutrients from the alimentary
canal; etc.). Until now, cell biologists have addressed the question by direct
observation and biochemical manipulation of epithelial cells. Dr. Caplan is
developing a clever and novel approach to the problem by exploiting the powerful
techniques of Drosophila genetics, which have already proven enormously useful
in studies of development.
