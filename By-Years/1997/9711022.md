Morrison Institute of Technology will use this grant to connect to the Internet.
They have proposed to use CICNet as their Internet service provider. The
students and faculty of Morrison Institute of Technology need the Internet
connections to be able to access information resources throughout the state, the
nation and the world. The connection will benefit the faculty, staff students of
this institution as well as the community in general. The award provides partial
support of the project for two years.
