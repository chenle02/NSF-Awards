Insect herbivores are confronted with a formidable and diverse array of
naturally occurring plant toxins. We have shown that the corn earworm,
Helicoverpa zea (Boddie), a polyphagous insect, is highly sensitive to the
antimetabolic effects of 1-azetidene-2- carboxylic acid (AZC), a naturally
occurring higher plant homolog of proline. Larvae reared on a diet containing
AZC suffer developmental retardation and exhibit various developmental lesions.
AZC toxicity is typically expressed during larval molts and it is particularly
evident at the larval-pupal molt. If larval-pupal ecdysis occurs, the pupae are
frequently deformed; often exhibiting large, nonsclerotized areas. The cellular
and biochemical mechanisms for the toxicity of AZC and many allelochemicals are
largely unknown. This study of the cell / tissue morphological and biochemical
events that precede and / or accompany the symptoms of AZC toxins in H. zea will
increase understanding of the protective role of allelochemicals in plant-
herbivore interactions, and has the potential to further development of insect
pest controls which do not require industrial pesticides.
