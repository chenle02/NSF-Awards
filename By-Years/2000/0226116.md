This Collections project is developing the Advanced Technology Environmental
Education Library (ATEEL) to serve the environmental information needs of
environmental technology students, educators, and technicians as well as
individuals with an interest in or a knowledge requirement of environmental
issues. Project partners include the Advanced Technology Environmental Education
Center (ATEEC), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Partnership for
Environmental Technology Education (PETE), and the Davenport Public
Library.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Environmental technology education requires access
to reliable and up-to-date information with the demand focused in two distinct
areas: 1) college programs that offer degrees in various aspects of
environmental technology (e.g., hazardous materials, natural resources
management, pollution prevention, energy management, etc.); and 2) environmental
education required across nearly all technical fields (e.g., health care
workers, manufacturing technicians, computer/electronics repair technicians,
agriculture, etc.). Federal and state regulations change routinely and often,
and there are new discoveries and technologies that change the nature of the
skills and knowledge required of technicians. In the environmental area, large
amounts of non-proprietary materials are available on the Internet through
federal and state government agencies, as well as thousands of non-profit
agencies with an interest in environment issues. However, access to this network
for many students, teachers and technicians often finds them lost in an ocean of
data - much of which has no relevance to their job function or skill
development. Digital library technologies are ideal for providing access to and
managing these rich sources of information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This ATEEL
project is serving the environmental community by establishing an infrastructure
to support a comprehensive, interactive environmental technician education
digital library that is serving the environmental education needs of community
college students, instructors, technicians, and citizens across a broad range of
technical fields. ATEEL is creating specific resources focused on providing
links to comprehensive, up-to-date regulatory information. In partnership with
MIT, it is also creating an environmental research-scanning function to support
the integration of environmental technology research into the classroom and
community.&lt;br/&gt;
