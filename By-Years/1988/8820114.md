The 13th International tRNA Workshop will be held June 4-9 in Vancouver, Canada.
It will be chaired by Dr. Gordon Tener of the University of British Columbia.
The meeting will cover all aspects tRNA biochemistry, biophysics, metabolism and
genetics, including precursor tRNA processing and splicing, tRNA structure and
aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase structure and function, protein - nucleia acid
interaction, the structure and evolution of tRNA genes, transcription and
regulation of tRNA genes, transcription and regulation of tRNA gene expression.
With advances of methodology in molecular biology the field has taken on much
new momentum, fueled in part by other roles of tRNA. The "other roles" are many
and of major importance. This support is mostly intended for assisting young
scientists and other who lack funds for travel.
