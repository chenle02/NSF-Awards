9614133 Leggett Within the last year the phenomena of Bose-Einstein condensation
(BEC) in dilute atomic gases has been realized in three different laboratories
and many more are moving into this area. The systems in question lie in a regime
of parameters (density, temperature, isolation _.) many orders of magnitude
different from those which characterize the only previously known laboratory
system believed to exhibit BEC, namely superfluid 4He. Consequently, it should
be possible to use these systems to subject to experimental test a variety of
ideas which are believed to apply to superfluid Helium but have never been
tested there and in particular to explore the precise relation between BEC and
the complex of phenomena which go under the name of "superfluidity". Theoretical
work will be carried out, both in general and in the context of dilute atomic
gases, to examine the superfluid density and the condition for the phenomena of
zero rotation and of persistent currents, and to make predictions about a number
of interesting experiments on the subject of "quantum phase coherence" and
"phase memory" which are apparently feasible in these systems. This grant has
been co-reviewed with the Theoretical Physics program in the Division of Physics
and is being co-funded with them. %%% This grant supports the work of a senior,
distinguished PI whose many thoughtful contributions to the general area of
superfluidity and other condensed state phenomena (such as macroscopic quantum
tunneling) are well known. This project, motivated by recent experiments, takes
him back to the questions associated with relationship between Bose- Einstein
condensation and superfluidity in dilute gases. This grant has been co-reviewed
with the Theoretical Physics program in the Division of Physics and is being co-
funded with them. ***
