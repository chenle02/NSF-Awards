This award provides funds to the Department of Psychology at Oregon State
University to help purchase equipment to upgrade the laboratory with
microcomputers and sophisticated software so that students can experience the
same level of technology that is now commonly used in psychological research.
Specifically, the new microcomputer laboratory will include 18 IBM compatible
PC's, five dot-matrix printers, an IBM compatible 386 microcomputer connected to
a Sytek network, and Micro Experimental Laboratory (MEL) software. With this
setup, students will experience all aspects of psychological research. They will
use the Sytek network to access the computerized library retrieval service for
references. Instructors, teaching assistants and advanced students will use the
386 computer with MEL software to select and design experiments to be conducted.
Stimuli specified by the experimental design will be presented to the students
at their PC's who will make appropriate responses on the keyboard. These
responses will be recorded and transferred to the larger 386 computer or to the
university mainframe computer via the Sytek network for a professional-level
statistical analysis. Finally, the results will be presented on a monitor or
printer for student interpretation. The grantee is matching this award with non-
Federal sources.
