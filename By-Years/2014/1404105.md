This award funds theoretical research in several different topics in
relativistic astrophysics and general relativity, with a focus on tests of
general relativity and on sources of gravitational radiation that might be
detected by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) and
by future space based detectors. Theoretical studies of sources of gravitational
waves funded by this award will be useful to aid detection of signals from black
holes and other sources, and also to aid in their interpretation. Gravitational
wave studies can tell us about the nature of gravity, properties of black holes,
and properties of the early Universe.

In more detail, this principal research topics of this award are: (i) The
development of methods to compute the gravitational waveforms from point
particles inspiralling into spinning black holes, using a combination of
analytical and numerical approaches; (ii) The computation of the effects of
radiation reaction on the gravitational wave signals from cosmic strings, which
may have been produced in the early Universe; and (iii) The exploration of an
explanation of angular momentum ambiguity in general relativity in terms of the
gravitational wave memory effect, using approximation methods that have been
developed for asymptotically flat spacetimes.
