93-09803 Weinberg The nervous systems develops a myriad of cell types from $ !.
!. ! F a seemingly homogeneous population of cells. The mechanisms responsible
for developing these different cell types are still poorly understood. A family
of genes, achaete-scute homologues, have been identified whose protein products
appear to be involved in this process. Two new members of this family have
recently been identified and will be further analyzed in this project. These
genes are expressed in very specific regions of the developing hindbra in. These
regions contain cell that will develop neurons shortly after these genes are
first expressed. This project will seek to identify the specific cells that
express these genes and to determine whether expression of these genes is a
prerequisite for development of the specific fates of these cells. This project
should make significant inroads into understanding hindbrain development and
will offer new insights into the more general question of how different cell
types arise in the nervous system $ $ " $ !. !. !. !. !. !. !. !. !. ( Times New
