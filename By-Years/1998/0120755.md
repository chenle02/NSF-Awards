&lt;br/&gt;The proposed center's goal is to develop state of the art techniques
for micro and nanoscale contamination control, removal and characterization in
manufacturing and fabrication processes. The center will contribute to the
competitiveness of the semiconductor, information technology, pharmaceutical,
imaging, aerospace and other industries affected by particulate and ionic
contamination. The center will especially focus on surface cleaning of
patterned, structured and flat substrates. Faculty in the center have identified
mechanisms to effectively clean ionic contamination from patterned
wafers.&lt;br/&gt;
