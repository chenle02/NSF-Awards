This award provides partial support for operation and maintenance of the
world's premier tropical moist-forest research station, located on the northern
tip of a 125,000 acre national park in Costa Rica. The La Selva Biological
Station is a 4,000 acre reserve and experimental forest that is owned and
operated by the Organization for Tropical Studies, a consortium of 41 U.S.
universities and research institutions, the University of Puerto Rico and four
Costa Rican institutions on higher learning. The station is fully equipped with
scientific instrumentation, computers, etc. to facilitate a full range of
ecological research from soil gaseous fluxes involved in global warming to the
ecological and evolutionary dynamics of forest composition. Room and board
accommodations are available for 72 persons. La Selva attracts an international
clientele of scientists who use the laboratories, forest reserve and
experimental lands, and who share their expertise in basic research--some of
which has relevance to stemming the tide of tropical deforestation and its
global repercussions.
