Major tectonic deformation of mountain systems can occur as the result of
chemical dissolution that occurs under directed stress. This process creates
zones of rock that become depleted in chemical elements that are most
susceptible to removal and replacement. Quantification of the amount of strain
in rocks changed by this process is elusive because it is difficult to determine
how much material has been removed. This project will measure this effect by
comparing the bulk chemical content of deformed zones with adjoining undeformed
zones. Development of this technique will provide others with the methodology to
allow routine analysis of such rocks.
