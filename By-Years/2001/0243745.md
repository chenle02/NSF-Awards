Proposal ID: AST-0243745&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Texas at
Austin&lt;br/&gt;PI: Shetrone, Matthew&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Research
Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site will be established at the University
of Texas at Austin - McDonald Observatory in the Davis Mountains of far west
Texas. Under the direction of Dr. Matthew Shetrone, the objective of the
McDonald REU program will be to encourage student interest in observatory
support, astronomical research and engineering. For ten weeks each summer, six
students (four the first year) will be mentored by a senior astronomer or
engineer (mechanical, optical or electrical). The cutting-edge research projects
will use the McDonald Observatory's professional facilities, including the 9.2-m
Hobby-Eberly Telescope, an innovative instrument and the third largest telescope
in the world. Each REU participant will receive daily direction from their on-
site mentor and be integrated into the Observatory support and research team.
Each student will also be given an opportunity to participate in public
education programs at the recently-dedicated McDonald Observatory Visitors'
Center. At mid-summer, students will participate in an organized field trip to
other nearby observatories in New Mexico. Throughout the summer, weekly seminars
by visiting astronomers will give students exposure to a broad range of modern
astrophysical research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduate students will be
recruited from universities across the United States. An especially aggressive
recruiting campaign will target minorities at universities in the southwestern
and midwestern states. The McDonald REU program's goal will be to recruit equal
numbers of students interested in engineering and astronomical research.
