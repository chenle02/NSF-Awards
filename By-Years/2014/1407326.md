The Universe is host to myriad sources that emit electromagnetic radiation at
gamma-ray energies. These very high energy photons are produced in processes
involving particles with energies beyond the reach of any ground-based
accelerator. Gamma-ray observations can therefore be used to study the highest
energy phenomena in the Universe. With this award, the University of Minnesota
group will continue their work with the VERITAS gamma-ray observatory. The
activities funded through this award will contribute to maintaining the VERITAS
capabilities and sensitivity. This work will also contribute to the study of
known blazars and the discoveries of new blazars, a class of Active Galactic
Nuclei. The scientific goals are to study the astrophysical processes that
generate gamma-ray emission in blazars and the links to the origin of observed
ultra-high energy cosmic rays. The University of Minnesota group will mentor
undergraduate students through the university's Research Experiences for
Undergraduates program. Members of the group will continue to present VERITAS
science at local astronomy clubs, high schools and other public outreach events
such as the weekly public observing nights at the campus observatory.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The major objectives and methods to be employed by the
University of Minnesota group include: (1) development of improved analysis
techniques including implementation of a multivariate analysis toolkit and a new
effort in better spectral reconstruction; (2) scientific analysis on Active
Galactic Nuclei utilizing new spectral analysis techniques with a focus on
locating the source of gamma-ray emission in blazars and understanding the
origin of ultra-high energy cosmic rays; (3) coordination of multi-wavelength
data campaigns in conjunction with VERITAS including efforts with Fermi, IceCube
and HAWC; and (4) calibration and data quality monitoring tasks that include
improvements on understanding of the instrument energy scale through a detailed
study on the impact of atmospheric conditions on the reconstructed energy.
