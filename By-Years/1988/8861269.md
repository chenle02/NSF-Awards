This program will fabricate single crystal multiple quantum well structures and
measure the electro-optical properties of the material system. This is
significant due to the potential for its use for unique electro-optic and
optoelectronic devices operating in the ultraviolet and visible parts of the
spectrum. Phase II will involve the fabrication of a solid state solar blind UV
sensor.
