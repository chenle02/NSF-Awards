Extremal Problems in Graph Theory&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI plans to continue
his research in the area of developing&lt;br/&gt;and applying a method in
extremal graph theory based on the&lt;br/&gt;Regularity Lemma and the Blow-up
Lemma. The method finds certain&lt;br/&gt;special subgraphs in dense graphs. The
main idea of the method is&lt;br/&gt;to reduce the general embedding problem in
the original graph to&lt;br/&gt;embedding into (Szemeredi-) regular graphs. For
the purpose of&lt;br/&gt;finishing the embedding once this reduction is
achieved, a general&lt;br/&gt;tool, called the Blow-up Lemma, was developed to
find bounded&lt;br/&gt;degree spanning subgraphs in these regular graphs. The PI
proposes&lt;br/&gt;to develop this method further. He plans to improve on some
of&lt;br/&gt;earlier applications of the method, to apply the method to
new&lt;br/&gt;problems, and to extend it into new
directions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is in the area of extremal
combinatorics. The&lt;br/&gt;central question of this field has the following
form: determine&lt;br/&gt;the maximum (or minimum) size of a discrete
mathematical object&lt;br/&gt;that satisfies a certain condition. It turns out
that this general&lt;br/&gt;topic has connections to very diverse fields
(geometry, design&lt;br/&gt;theory, number theory, algebra, topology, etc.) and
to areas with&lt;br/&gt;important concrete applications in everyday life
(computer&lt;br/&gt;science, coding theory, cryptography, optimization and
scheduling&lt;br/&gt;problems, communication and networking problems, etc.).
Therefore&lt;br/&gt;the broader impact of this proposal is that developing the
method&lt;br/&gt;further and achieving results on the proposed research
problems&lt;br/&gt;will have serious implications in these applications as
well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
