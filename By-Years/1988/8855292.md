Project Discovery will bring 20 junior high school students from Missouri,
Kansas, Nebraska, and Iowa to Central Missouri State University for
interdisciplinary science exposures. The three-week program will provide
lecture, laboratory, and field experiences in chemistry, physics, biology, and
earth science. Program activities will help students determine science fields
for which they have aptitudes, to make more informed career choices. Students
will select a "discovery project" from one of the four science disciplines.
Students will be guided in application of the scientific method as they work on
their projects. Students will report their progress to their peers and, where
appropriate, will be encouraged to continue their project at their school. The
students will tour four scientific concerns in the Kansas City area to learn of
career opportunities in science. Panel discussions will be conducted during the
three-week program which will deal with research methodology, science careers,
and the philosophy and ethics of science.
