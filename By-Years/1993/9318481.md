9318481 Amasino The major developmental change in the plant life cycle is the
initiation of flowering. Genetic and physiological analyses have revealed that
many plant species have evolved the ability to regulate flowering in response to
environmental cues such as changes in temperature or daylength. However, the
biochemical mechanisms by which plants sense and respond to environmental cues
to initiate flowering are unknown. To lay a foundation for studying this process
at the molecular level, Dr. Amasino has isolated a gene from Arabidopsis
thaliana, luminidependens (LD), that is involved in floral induction. Mutations
in the LD gene render Arabidopsis late flowering; thus, the wild-type function
of LD is likely to promote flowering. Physiological analyses indicate that LD is
specifically involved in photoperiodism. Dr. Amasino proposes to characterize
the tissue specificity, developmental timing, and environmental regulation of LD
at the mRNA and protein levels, and determine the sequence of LD genes from
other species, and perform site-directed mutagenesis on the protein. To
determine the role of LD in other species, he will block expression in other
species through antisense RNA and/or co-suppression techniques. Dr. Amasino will
explore the effects of different light qualities and quantities on the phenotype
of mutant and wild-type plants to address the photoreceptor systems influenced
by the LD mutation. He will determine the interactions of the LD mutation with
other flowering mutations to define the position of LD in flowering pathways.
Lastly, Dr. Amasino will initiate the long-term goals of ident ifying
suppressors of the LD mutation and isolating genes regulated by LD. *** SOL EXE
