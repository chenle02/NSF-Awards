With NSF support, Little Priest Tribal College (LPTC) will conduct an assessment
of the institution's science and mathematics curriculum and infrastructure.
Project activities include evaluations of science and mathematics course
content, teaching strategies, use of technology for teaching and learning,
undergraduate and faculty research opportunities, student progress, and S&amp;E
programming. An external advisory committee with representation from four-year
institutions will assist College science and mathematics faculty in the
development of an institutional plan to strengthen S&amp;E teaching and
learning. In addition, the College will develop a tracking system to assess the
progress of the Colleges' science and mathematics graduates that transfer to
4-year colleges and universities.
