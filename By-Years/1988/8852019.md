A nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer equipped with a decoupler accessory is
adding to the student's laboratory experience in several levels of undergraduate
courses. New experiments are being added to the organic course to introduce the
students to the instrument. This is being followed with new experiments in
inorganic, physical, analytical and biochemistry laboratory courses. The
instrument is also providing expanded opportunities for undergraduate research.
The grantee is matching the award from non-Federal funds.
