Incorporation of interfaced computers into laboratories nationwide has been slow
because no coherent and easily adaptable package of experimental procedures
exists that shows educators how to use the new technology successfully. A
complete laboratory curriculum package will be developed for general chemistry
that uses the MSU interface and computer hardware and software. The package will
facilitate relevant and meaningful experimentation by adding a number of new and
improved procedures, including some simulation as an adjunct to lab work,
including tutorials in support of laboratory instruction, and being made
adaptable for use in diverse educational settings from the community college to
doctoral institutions. Implementation of the curriculum package at the eight
institutions in the project consortium will directly benefit nearly 13,500
general chemistry students over five years. Dissemination to the whole country
is expected.
