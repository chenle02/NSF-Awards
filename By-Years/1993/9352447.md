The Anthropology Department is developing, evaluating, and disseminating digital
image based, computer-assisted laboratory education in human and primate
skeletal biology. Satisfactory laboratory experience for introductory skeletal
biology students is precluded at most colleges and/or universities as a result
of limited collections of instructional specimens, which cannot be appropriately
expanded. The present project seeks to utilize recent developments in digital
image storage and display technology to enhance the Skeletal Explorer Video-
Disk System for MS-DOS Workstations; to develop a parallel Skeletal Explorer
application for Apple Macintosh workstations; and to develop, validate, and
disseminate laboratory instruction materials specifically designed for
introductory courses, at educational levels ranging from community college
through research university.
