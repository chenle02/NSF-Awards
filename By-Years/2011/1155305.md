The PI's request funding to increase the longevity of seafloor geodetic
measurements by developing and demonstrating an inexpensive, permanent seafloor
benchmark. The benchmark will provide a physical tie to the sea floor lasting
for decades (perhaps longer) on which geodetic sensors can be repeatedly placed
and removed with millimeter resolution. Global coordinates estimated with
seafloor geodetic techniques will remain attached to the benchmark allowing for
the interchange of sensors as they fail or become obsolete, or for the sensors
to be removed and used elsewhere, all the while maintaining a coherent series of
positions referenced to the benchmark. The benchmark will be designed to be
lowered via a wire to the seafloor with sensors attached. The sensors will be
capable of being recalled via an acoustic command sent from a ship to release
from the benchmark and freely float to the sea surface for recovery. The
duration of the sensor attachment to the benchmark will last from a few days to
a few years depending on the specific needs of the experiment. The recovered
sensors are then available to be reused at other locations, or again at the same
site in the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If high accuracy, cheap, campaign-style seafloor
geodesy can be developed, the studies that could be done with such a system
could transform our knowledge of subduction zones and megathrust earthquakes.
