CDA-9529463 Peshkin, Michael A. Mirkovic, Srdjan Northwestern University Robot
for Human Workspace The requested equipment of computer hardware and software
for real-time control of robotics systems is used in furtherance of research in
computer and information science and engineering in the departments of
Mechanical Engineering and Electrical and Computer Engineering. The real time
control and computation system is associated with the robot requested under this
proposal and other robots in several closely related projects. Specific research
tasks are as follows. (1) Research and development of robot-assisted surgical
systems. Most immediately, a system for directing linear insertions, such as
biopsies and orthopedic pins, under fluoroscopic imaging. These systems require
fast dedicated computers for control, and a 6-axis force sensor to facilitate
interaction with a surgeon. (2) Research and development of assertive devices to
be used in the final assembly of automobiles and light trucks, with General
Motors. This project requires a considerable amount of high-speed real-time
digital signal processing hardware, and associated software.
