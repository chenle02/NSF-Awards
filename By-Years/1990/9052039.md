Undergraduate education in cellular biology is being improved with the
introduction of a Zeiss Transmission Electron Microscope with video accessories
and a Polaroid CRT photosystem. The equipment is to be used in laboratories in
introductory botany, introductory zoology, and cell biology courses. Its use in
the introductory courses will stimulate students to take the more advanced
course. In the introductory level courses, its use is mostly through
demonstrations, but in the cell biology course, students get "hands on"
experiences with the E.M., including experimentation and analysis of results.
The instrument is also available for student independent research projects. The
university will overmatch the award by $9,147.
