Nurses are essential to contemporary hospital-based healthcare. Healthcare
providersâ€™ work requires frequent contact with patients within a hospital that
is often rapidly changing. Hospitals prioritize certain forms of expertise and
render other knowledge and labor invisible. Nurses experience trauma and stress
in their everyday work from the social structure of the hospital to the unique
demands and risks of healthcare givers. Nurses are most likely to be diagnosed
with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). This project examines nurses'
experiences of trauma within the specific historical and cultural context of
nurses' expertise, skills, and labor in healthcare. By focusing on nurses' often
invisible skills and knowledge, this project will identify the implications of
that invisibility for nurses' risk of exposure and well-being. This project
carries key lessons and insights for healthcare workers, policy makers and
administrative decision makers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on
nurses' invisible knowledge and labor by doing ethnographic interviews with
nurses, trauma experts, and workplace health and safety experts, as well as
participant observation at a hospital. It asks the following research questions:
1) how does devaluing nurses' practices, skills, and knowledges also obscure the
preventable exposures, risks, and trauma laden in the everyday work of nursing,
and in what ways are they subverted or sustained? 2) how might centering nurses'
experiences with PTSD also offer insight into the roots of nurses' working
conditions during pandemics such as COVID-19? This project contributes to
research discourses in STS and medical anthropology on the development of
professional knowledge and techniques, where nurses' expertise and skills are
often ignored in a replication of existing healthcare hierarchies. By beginning
from nurses' knowledges the project will reveal how stress and trauma can become
embedded within technical knowledges in high stress professions. By locating
nurses' experiences of trauma and stress within the broader dynamics through
which nurses develop, learn, and share skills and knowledge, this project will
explore how essential and fragile their role is within healthcare. The outcomes
of this project will inform the development of policies to support and sustain
healthcare workers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
