This dissertation investigates major architectural debates in Hungary and East
Germany between 1950 and 2000. Issues such as Socialist Realism, Public Housing,
and Postmodernism are analyzed to uncover changes over time and across countries
in the social role of the architect. The principal goal is to show how the
production of expert knowledge is shaped by the political, cultural, and
economic conditions in which experts practice their trade. The project will also
examine the complex interaction between authoritarian states and professional
knowledge: both the authority of the state over professional conduct and the
ways in which state predominance was challenged or legitimated by professionals.
The research uses 1) archival materials such as architectural journals and legal
regulations, 2) interviews with architects, and 3) secondary statistical data
such as census data on architects.
