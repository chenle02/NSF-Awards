This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project considers an
innovative method for detecting and quantifying natural fracture systems in
rock. The geometry of the fracture system controls the permeability of many oil
and gas reservoirs and aquifers. Both oil and gas and environmental applications
require new tools and techniques to quantify the fracture geometry, thus
allowing prediction of permeability. During the Phase I research an inverse
method was developed for fracture geometry from diverse geophysical
measurements. This was accomplished by combining forward models relating
fracture geometry to various anisotropic, stress-dependent properties including
permeability, electrical conductivity, and seismic velocity with a maximum
entropy regularization criterion. It was demonstrated that a relatively small
number of geophysical measurements could be used to invert for a statistical
description of the fracture geometry with some predictive power. Following this
proof of principle, in Phase II, this method will now be turned into an
interactive tool for studying and understanding fracture system behavior for oil
and gas and environmental applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To accomplish
this, the forward models will be refined, the inversion algorithm will be tuned
for this specific problem, and the algorithms will be validated using case
studies. This new capability will likely provide many improvements to
exploration, development, and reservoir performance activities by defining
realistic input parameters for reservoir fluid flow simulators. It is in our
national interest to develop new innovative and cost effective exploration and
reservoir simulation technologies which will extend the useful lifetime of oil
and gas reservoirs and extending the period of time that competitively priced
oil and natural gas can be produced in this country. &lt;br/&gt;l
