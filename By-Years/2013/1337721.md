With this award from the Chemistry Major Research Instrumentation Program,
Professor David Rovnyak from Bucknell University and colleagues Thomas Selby,
Marie Pizzorno, Timothy Strein and Charles Clapp will acquire an isothermal
titration calorimeter (ITC). The proposal is aimed at enhancing research and
education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) study of molecular
interactions by microscale calorimetry; (b) guest-host binding by bile micelles;
(c) study of protein-protein interactions between viral proteins; (d)
characterization of inhibitors of soybean lipoxygenase-1; and (e) binding and
specificity of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC)
enzymes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) is a very
sensitive thermodynamic technique that is used to characterize binding
interactions between species such as those between a small molecule and an
enzyme. ITC measures directly the heat absorbed or released during a binding
process. This provides insight on the strength of chemical and biochemical
binding interactions. The calorimeter will also be incorporated into several
upper division level laboratory classes. Thus this instrument will be used not
only in research but also in educational and outreach activities.
