Medical imaging has benefited greatly from advances in signal and image
processing, which have enabled better data acquisition, superior reconstruction
and improved analysis of massive amounts of imaging data. With improving
resolutions and the push for comprehensive diagnosis, medical imaging faces new
challenges; including bigger data sizes, longer scan durations, and
susceptibility to artifacts, such as patient motion. Hence, it is imperative
that these large-scale datasets are processed and analyzed efficiently in the
presence of systematic and physiological imperfections, along with constraints
on diagnostic ability and patient throughput.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
builds a cross-disciplinary research framework to provide theoretical,
algorithmic and application developments based on geometric methods to
characterize the limits and to improve the state of medical imaging
reconstruction and analysis. This research comprises three complementary
thrusts: rate-distortion characterization of learning algorithms; theoretical
guarantees and algorithms for phase retrieval of low-dimensional models; and
optimization strategies on low-dimensional manifolds for a class of parameter
estimation problems. Each of these thrusts is complemented with applications in
medical imaging, with tremendous potential for translational impact in the US
healthcare system, including improved diagnosis and throughput in health-care
applications. Broader educational impacts of this project result from
integration of the research to graduate and undergraduate curriculum; outreach
to the local community and to under-privileged K-12 students.
