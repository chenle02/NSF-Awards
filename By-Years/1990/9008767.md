This is an ambitious proposal to advance the foundation of risk and decision
analysis. The research focuses on decisions where incomplete or conflicting
knowledge creates ambiguity about the probability of an event. In order to
account for ambiguity aversion, the models to be investigated contain
modifications to utilities rather than probabilities. Also, the proposed
research is based on the concept of situation specific utility functions. The
planned investigation will look at three important issues: the impact of
probability ambiguity on choice, the incorporation of equity in social risk
management, and the extension of generalized utility theory. The emphasis for
each issue is on building and testing models. The general research strategy will
be based on parallel theoretical development and empirical analysis. This
coordination between theory and data should lead to improved models that can be
applied in operational contexts.
