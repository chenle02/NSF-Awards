The research project is concerned with an initial- boundary value problem from
nonlinear elasticity theory involving nonmonotone stress strain relations. The
stable solutions for such a problem will have to minimize a noncovex energy
functional. They may exhibit discon- tinuous gradients related to changes of
phases. The existence of such stable solutions and their long time limiting
behavior will be investigated. The research results will have practical
implications in engineering mechanics.
