This dissertation research project of a cultural anthropologist studies how
households use over-the-counter ("non-prescription") medications. The student
will select a sample of households with young children in Tucson, Arizona, which
vary on their access to health-care insurance. The project will study how
mothers obtain information about non-prescription drugs, and hypothesizes that
uninsured households will rely on OTC medications more than insured households.
A sample of 40 uninsured and 20 insured households will be studied over a year
to track the illness episodes. Pharmacists will be interviewed about their
provision of information to customers. This project is important because the
trend in recent years has been to decontrol many previously prescription-only
medications. Given the current concern about health care and insurance in our
society, this sort of in-depth study of a sample of families will provide
valuable information to policy makers about their situation.
