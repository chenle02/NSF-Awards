This project involves a series of laboratory studies that examine whether the
motives that people carry into interracial interactions may contribute to
negative experiences and, and how altering such motives might contribute to more
positive interactions. Recent research has found that contact across racial
and/or cultural divides can sometimes be negative. These types of interactions
appear to require additional effort to manage, and consequently often result in
mental and emotional fatigue. The research included in this project aims to
discover avenues to reduce this potential outcome of interracial contact by
investigating the effects of intergroup interactions on Black, White and
Latino/a participants (a) with approach-oriented versus avoidance-oriented
mindsets, (b) focused on their aspirations for the interaction (promotion-
focused) rather than their responsibilities within the interaction (prevention-
focused), or (c) with the goal to develop rather than demonstrate positive
racial attitudes and intergroup understanding (learning rather than performance
goals) during the interaction. The investigators hypothesize that approach-
orientation, promotion focus, and learning goals will enhance the quality of
these interactions and, in turn, eliminate the disrupting effects the
interactions have on individuals' cognitive performance and emotional well-
being.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is mounting evidence that diverse environments
have widespread social, societal, and organizational benefits. Nevertheless, the
fact remains that many individuals find such diverse environments and contact
with members of different racial groups both cognitively and emotionally
challenging. The findings of this research will aid in creating and optimizing
the positive aspects of racially diverse environments by improving the quality
of the intergroup contact experiences which are characteristic of these
settings.
