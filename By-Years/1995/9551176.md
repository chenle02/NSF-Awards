The college is purchasing a 20-inch telescope to use with a CCD camera or a CCD
spectrograph. The new equipment expands the observational component of a number
of courses, increases the effectiveness of the college's public outreach
programs, and expands the possibilities for student research, particularly in
the area of supernova monitoring. This 20-inch teaching telescope is part of a
larger plan for a new college observatory.
