This study is an international analysis of public attitudes towards contemporary
whale management and an assessment of public knowledge about whales and whaling.
Questionnaires will be administered in the United States, Australia, Britain,
Germany, Japan and Norway. The research is intended to obtain accurate
information about public attitudes on whaling. This information is essential for
the development of national policy decisions, and the formulation of whale
management policies by international bodies, such as the International Whaling
Commission.
