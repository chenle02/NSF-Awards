University Title: RAPID: Big Geospatial Data for Decision Support in Ebola
Triage

Project Proposed: This project, developing a methodology for utilization of
geospatial data for decision support in triage and hotline operations related to
identification of suspected cases of Ebola aims to further, develop a prototype
module, on the base of the TerraFly instrument (presently funded by NSF). The
prototype, a decision support application, presents data mashup to operators
responding to hotline calls and patient encounter triage. Additionally, the
effort leverages work on Fuzzy Logic for epidemics prediction. Furthermore, in
collaboration with UMBC, FIU researchers will: - Identify locations of Ebola by
geolocating references in Twitter Posts, utilizing the FIU?s patent-pending
technology of geolocating social media, - Generate near real time Crisis maps
demonstrating the spread of Ebola available data and assess their utility to
stakeholders presently involved in mitigation, - Compare maps derived from
social media data streams to CDC maps. Broader Impacts:

This work, coordinated with and submitted in parallel with respective RAPID
proposals, with coalition members at FAU, UMBC, and UMN, aims to jointly address
public health problems of national and global significance. In particular the
proposers will work with FAU on modeling Ebola spread through use of innovative
big data analytics techniques and with UMBC on integrating quantifiable social
media data from Twitter into our data mashups. Beyond the present issue of
Ebola, the proposed methodology and the coalition-building effort aims to
support solutions in a wide range of public health issues.
