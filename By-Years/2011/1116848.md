Systems today must cope with failures induced by many factors outside the
control of the organization producing the software: faults in infrastructure and
components developed by third-parties, unpredictable loads, and variable
resources. Modern systems must therefore take increasing responsibility for
problem detection and repair at runtime. Effective fault detection and repair
could be greatly enhanced by run-time fault diagnosis and localization -- the
ability to identify the source of problem so that appropriate actions can be
taken either by a human operator or automated mechanisms to repair the system.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this research we are developing new foundations for
run-time fault diagnosis and localization. To do this we are extending and
synthesizing recent advances in two areas. The first is the use of architecture
models for monitoring a system at run-time. The second is the use of spectrum-
based reasoning for fault localization (SFL). SFL is a lightweight technique
that takes as its input a form of trace abstraction and produces a list of
likely fault candidates, ordered by probability of being the true fault
explanation. It has been used with impressive results during design time but
thus far has not been exploited at runtime in the context of architecture-based
monitoring and diagnosis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will improve the
trustworthiness and robustness of modern software systems by providing new
techniques for diagnosing faults while a system is running, thereby providing an
improved basis for fault detection and resolution.
