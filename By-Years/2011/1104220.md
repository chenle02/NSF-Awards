The project develops and validates "new media" skill sets needed by technicians.
A technical committee adapts the skill standards development model used in
European social partnerships to define the job responsibilities of the New Media
Enabled Technician. A DACUM (Developing A CUrriculuM) process with expert
frontline workers is then used to conduct an occupational analysis of the New
Media Enabled Technician and identify the new media skills that cut across a
range of technician jobs. Project partners conduct a national online validation
of the New Media Enabled Technician?s duties, responsibilities, and associated
skills, knowledge and abilities. Subsequently, the project staff, in
consultation with expert workers, develop examples of how technicians use social
media tools in routine work to solve problems and manage a business enterprise.
Working with community college faculty, they develop and pilot problem based
learning scenarios that integrate the new media skills and course content.
