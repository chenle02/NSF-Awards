This award supports the Research Experience for Undergraduates site at SUNY at
Stony Brook. The site will support six students in year one, and eight in the
following two years, for ten weeks of summer research in Physics and Astronomy.
Research projects are available both at Stony Brook University and at Brookhaven
National Laboratory. The site offers leading faculty with enthusiasm for working
with undergraduates and high engagement with cutting edge
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research projects will be available in
experimental, theoretical and computational tracks within the areas of:
Accelerator Physics, Astronomy, Atomic Molecular and Optical Physics, Condensed
Matter Physics, Cosmology, High Energy Physics and Nuclear Physics. Students
will work alongside faculty on novel research projects and be given instruction
in research techniques, presenting their work, and computational and
experimental skills. Tutorial materials developed for the program will be made
publicly available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
