This award will support a two-year collaborative project between Professor
Robert F. Curl, Department of Chemistry, Rice University, and Professor Leon F.
Phillips, Department of Chemistry, University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New
Zealand. The activity takes place under the U.S.-New Zealand Cooperative Science
Program. The scientists will cooperate in a study of the reactions of several
small free radicals (transient, reactive chemical species such as C2H, HCO, and
CH2CN) with oxygen atoms. Such a study is relevant both to understanding aspects
of the chemistry of the interstellar medium, as well as the reactions taking
place in various combustion processes. By measuring the rate constants of these
radical-atom reactions, and in some cases carrying out spectroscopic studies to
identify reaction products, the scientists expect to contribute to a greater
understanding of these reaction systems. The radicals will be produced by
excimer flash photolysis of suitable precursor molecules. The oxygen atoms (and
later, other atoms and OH) will be generated in a discharge flow system, and
allowed to react with the radicals. Both the U.S. and New Zealand research
groups have experience in this area of research, involving flash photolysis,
infrared spectroscopy, and the use of laser probes. Professor Phillips and his
colleagues at Canterbury University have focused primarily on the chemical
kinetics of these reactions, and have developed experimental techniques for
carrying out such measurements, including methods for measuring the
concentrations of atoms. Professor Curl and his group at Rice have emphasized
high resolution infrared spectroscopy as well as kinetic studies. Exchange
visits by the principal investigators will serve to develop the capability for
atom- radical kinetic studies at Rice and to enhance the spectroscopic analysis
strengths at Canterbury.
