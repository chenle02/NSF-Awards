The goal of this research is to investigate a global testing infrastructure to
identify critical factors that reduce the time to product stability while
improving the competitive position of developing organizations. Teams of
graduate computer science students in Ireland and the United States will conduct
operational testing on an industrial software system following several
scenarios. They will compare various approaches of processing trouble reports
and software updates to determine their impact on defects uncovered, the
severity levels and types of defects, and the complexity of the modules in which
the defects occurred. The faculty and industry personnel are all participants in
the Software Engineering Research Center, and NSF Industry/University
Cooperative Research Center.
