In this project Hampton University will develop a five-year model program for
the preparation of middle school science teachers. This model program will
involve the development of one new mathematics course, three new science
courses, and the modification of six existing science courses in the first three
years. Years four and five will focus on course evaluation and revision,
selection of mentor teachers, and development of field placement and student
teacher experiences. The science content requirements being proposed satisfy
National Science Teachers Association recommendations for middle school
teachers. In an attempt to recruit minority students into teaching, Hampton
University, which has a predominately black student body, will work closely with
high school science teachers and will mount a powerful recruitment campaign
within its student body. It is projected that within five years more than 108
students will be enrolled in the middle school science teaching program. This
project represents a cooperative effort among the academic departments of
science education, biology, chemistry, physics, and computer science. Faculty
from each department will be involved in course development and evaluation.
Public schools personnel will also be involved as members of an advisory
committee, as mentor teachers, and in the planning and implementation of in-
school preservice teaching experiences.
