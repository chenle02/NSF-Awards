This award supports research on problems in the theory of quadratic forms and
the theory of finite-dimensional division algebras. Questions considered involve
determining the structure of bilinear spaces (more precisely the Knebusch-Witt
ring) over algebraic curves, in particular elliptic curves. A second set of
problems involves studying the non-tame valuation theory of division algebras,
in both finite and mixed characteristics. Both subjects are intimatley related
to Galois cohomology, and therefore problems in Galois theory will be considered
as part of the research. The research supported involves the theory of quadratic
forms. This, in its simplest form, is the study of polynomial forms of degree
two. Equivalently, it is an analysis of the types of inner products that can
define the metric geometry of an n-dimensional vector space. The study of
quadratic forms has deep interrelations with algebraic geometry and algebraic
k-theory.
