In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry
Program of the Chemistry Division, Professors Kristi Kiick, Xinqiao Jia, and
Christopher Roberts of the University of Delaware will employ a combination of
computational, synthetic, and advanced characterization methods to elucidate the
molecular design rules for the assembly of peptide-polymer nanostructures.
Coarse-grained computational models will be used to reveal the molecular details
of the association behavior of various structurally relevant peptides, both
alone and in the context of hydrophilic polymer domains of various lengths.
Molecules that are indicated to adopt diverse nanostructured assemblies will be
synthesized. A combination of spectrophotometric, calorimetric, scattering, and
microscopy methods will be used to characterize assembly and aggregation, with
correlation to the molecular details of the peptide association. This research
will provide new synthetic pathways to access these novel macromolecular
structures and will establish the rules that govern assembly on the basis of
multiple and controllable stimuli. The broader impacts involve broad,
multidisciplinary training of graduate and undergraduate students, participation
in the University of Delaware College of Engineering K-12 Outreach Program
(including the creation of new activities within this infrastructure), and the
potential societal benefits of a fundamental understanding of the assembly of
polymer-peptide conjugates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Peptides are chains of
chemically linked amino acids and are the components of proteins. This work will
expand the repertoire of chemistry that can be used to create new large
molecules that mimic natural biomaterials and will lead to a better
understanding of how peptides aggregate into larger structures. Such aggregation
phenomena are linked to the inactivation of biopharmaceuticals and the
progression of neurodegenerative diseases. This research could have long term
applications in medicine, pharmaceutical processing, and nanotechnology.
