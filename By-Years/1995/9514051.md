9514051 Trant Sharks and rays (elasmobranchs) belong to a scientifically
important taxa; however, relatively little is known about their reproductive
endocrinology. This proposal describes a classical and a molecular approach to
the study of ovarian steroid synthesis in the Atlantic stingray (Dasyatis
sabina). Similarly to mammals, the stingray maintains a pregnancy, supports the
developing young through a "placenta", and gives birth to precocious young. This
proposed research will result in the development in the tools used in the
examination of the molecular and cellular control of the steroidogenic pathway.
The cDNAs that encode specific steroidogenic enzymes will be isolated. In
addition, the cDNA will be used to express the encoded protein in yeast and E.
coli for biochemical studies. After these tools are developed, the regulation of
steroidogenesis will be studied at the site of transcription (synthesis of RNA
from DNA) and translation of the RNA (synthesis of the enzymes) for four key
steroidogenic enzymes. This molecular investigation will be married to a
classical reproductive endocrine study. The suite of steroids produced by the
stingray ovary will be identified, rates of steroid synthesis will be
determined, and the seasonal changes of reproductive steroids in the blood will
be monitored. Accomplishment of the proposed objectives will provide a
foundation for: 1) a greater in-depth examination of gonadal steroidogenesis, 2)
an examination of the unique elasmobranch adrenal steroidogenesis, and 3)
development of long-term primary culture of follicular tissue. The results of
this proposal will yield probes for other laboratories interested in studying
steroidogenesis in lower vertebrates. ***
