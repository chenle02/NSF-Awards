Undergraduate Control Systems Design Laboratory This project will upgrade an
undergraduate control laboratory by adding new experiments and introducing the
students to a digital computer program (LabView) that allows data acquisition,
analysis, display, and real-time control functions to be integrated into a
single digital computer (a MAC IIsi). The LabView virtual instrument software
allows the MAC computer to act as a variety of laboratory instruments. The
digital computer will also contain the MATLAB computer program with the control
systems toolbox for off-line simulation, analysis and design. The combinations
of the MAC II with the LabVIEW and MATLAB software creates a control systems
workstation that gives the students access to state-of- the-art tools. The funds
awarded in this project provide for acquisition of MAC IIsi computers, data-
acquisition boards, and software. The funding will allow the institution to
complete the upgrade, add new systems to be controlled, expand the types of
experiments being conducted, and introduce the students to modern control
engineering workstations and software.
