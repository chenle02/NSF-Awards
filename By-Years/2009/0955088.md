The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project
is to derive models of human motor control and learning that improve the
performance of brain-machine interfaces. Through direct measurement of brain
activity, these interfaces enable people with impaired sensory-motor function to
control artificial limbs and other prosthetic devices by thought alone. Inspired
by evidence that human motor control is based on a discrete internal
representation of motor commands and that behavioral motor recovery is similar
to the acquisition of functional language, the method of approach will focus on
the construction of statistical language models that allow incremental
specification of motor programs. Grounded within the framework of feedback
information theory and decentralized control, this approach will result in the
design of feedback control systems for prosthetic devices that better reflect
user intent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this research will provide new
opportunities to restore sensory-motor function, potentially improving the
quality of life for people with disability due to conditions like amputation,
spinal cord injury, and stroke. This research may also result in a better
understanding of how the central nervous system interacts with peripheral
biomechanics to control action and perception, which in turn is essential for
understanding higher cognitive function and ultimately for reverse-engineering
the brain. As part of a complementary educational program, the PI will
facilitate interactive demonstrations for elementary school students, co-direct
a week-long summer institute for high school students, and develop and assess
courses preparing undergraduate and graduate students for research that
integrates systems engineering and neuroscience.
