Exploring Network-on-Chip (NoC) Architecture Design
Space&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Design of scalable,
high performance, area and energy efficient network-on-chip (NoC) architectures
has emerged as a critical issue for orchestrating the system-on-chip (SoC)
design paradigm. However, unlike the traditional multiprocessor interconnects,
design of NoC architectures poses a whole set of new challenges in terms of on-
chip area budget, energy efficiency, and reliability. The motivation of this
research is to explore the NoC design space considering four closely intertwined
issues. These are area constraint design and analysis of NoC architectures,
developing detailed energy models for on-chip interconnects, designing suitable
fault-tolerant techniques and reliability models, and developing a comprehensive
testbed for conducting performance, energy and reliability tradeoffs in
designing NoCs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since on-chip interconnects are predicted
to be the performance bottlenecks for SoC architectures, the success of this
research is likely to have a significant impact on the design of future SoCs,
which are increasingly used in a wide range of applications. The
simulation/analytic tools and techniques developed in this research will be used
for training undergraduate and graduate students. The tools will be available
through our Web site for use by other researchers, and we envision direct
transfer of our ideas to industry.&lt;br/&gt;
