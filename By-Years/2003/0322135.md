Funding is requested in support of a summer, 2003 workshop at the Flatirons
Outdoor Classroom, for selected teachers within the Boulder Valley School
District in Boulder, Colorado. Sixteen teachers (drawn from elementary, middle,
and high schools in the district) would spend two weeks at the Flatirons Outdoor
classroom. In the mornings, teachers would participate in lectures and
discussion on topics in geology, hydrology, botany, biology, geography, water
politics, and ethics, led by local experts in these respective fields. In the
afternoon, teachers will work in teams to devise curricular materials for
primary and secondary school students that relate the material covered in the
mornings to the distinctive interdisciplinary capacities of this outdoor
space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the workshop would be: 1) to provide
district teachers with training in the Earth and environmental sicneces, science
policy, and selected areas of the humanities so that they could design
curricular materials that make effective use of the Flatirons Outdoor Classroom.
2) Through doing so, to create pedagogical materials on interdisciplinary
educational education that can be disseminated regionally and nationally in a
variety of formats (such as publications, conference presentations, museum
exhibits, and the internet. 3) To disseminate accounts of the pedagogical
possibilities of the Flatirons Outdoor Classroom, so that this model may be
adapted and adopted by communities nationwide.
