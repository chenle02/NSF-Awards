The proposed research is designed to test hypotheses about the function of
horns and to apply results to the conservation of asocial megavertebrates,
particularly in response to catastrophic reductions due to poaching. To delay
the decline, a bold experiment is being attempted in Namibia where male and
female black rhinos have been dehorned. Unlike actions employed in other
geographic regions, dehorning has been controversial for three principal
reasons: (1) while horns are re-grown, rates of re-growth remain unknown making
it impossible to know where horn removal might be needed again; (2) because not
all animals are dehorned, horned animals may have reproductive advantages;
hence, effects of removal on the breeding and genetic structure of the
population are unclear; and (3) the calves of hornless females may be more
vulnerable to predation. In the absence of information, horn function cannot be
assessed. The proposed research addresses these issues by gathering data on horn
growth and regrowth, comparing reproduction among rhinos varying in horn size,
and examining the frequency of attacks by predators toward, and responses of,
horned and hornless rhinos. Two study sites will be used, one with horned and
hornless rhinos, and another with individuals all with intact horns. The
research promises new insight into the effects of anatomical structures on life
histories of animals in the wild, and has significant potential for affecting
management of this rare species.
