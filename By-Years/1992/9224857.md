The aim of the project is to explore mathematically interesting probability
questions arising directly or indirectly from the study of algorithms and
combinatorics. One aspect concerns weak convergence methods for studying size-
asymptotics of random combinatorial objects. Another aspect is a study of random
walk in random environment on trees as a simple case of the Metropolis
algorithm. A third part concerns algorithmic aspects of Bayesian posteriors on
probability distributions given i.i.d. data, where we take a nonparametric prior
derived from superprocess excursion. Random trees occur in various guises
throughout the proposal. One part of the project is a theoretical study of how
to approximate large random discrete structures by continuous structures, in
contexts where such an approximation is rather subtle. Another part is a
theoretical study of the most widely-used algorithm for computer simulation of
complicated random objects, in a simplified setting. A final part is the
development of sophisticated algorithms for updating statistical estimates of
spatial distributions as more data becomes available.
