This project is about constant term identities, combinatorial enumeration, and
their interaction. Four areas of research will be pursued: constant term
identities; multi-variate integrals and their q-analogs; enumeration of certain
arrays of integers; and uses of constant term identities in proving the Mills-
Robbins-Rumsey conjectures. This project involves the use of computers in
attempts to resolve some of the problems. The problems are also of interest in
several areas outside of combinatorics, such as hypergeometric series, Lie
theory, and cyclic homology.
