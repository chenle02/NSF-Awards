Objective: we aim to design and develop a room temperature graphene-based THz
reconfigurable aperture array to realize video-rate THz imaging based on
compressive sensing. The proposed device promises an elegant solution to the
long standing problem in realizing THz modulation. By electrostatically tuning
the Fermi level in a pair of capacitively coupled graphene sheets, the THz
transmission intensity can be tuned from > 90% to < 10%, thus pointing ways to
fabricate high speed, high resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio and low-cost
THz imagers.

Intellectual Merit: THz modulation enabled by intraband transitions in graphene,
is another attractive real-world application of graphene besides transparent
conductors and frequency multipliers etc. We will also answer questions
regarding energy band alignment in graphene/semiconductor heterojunctions,
large-area graphene preparation and passivation and electromagnetic interactions
in metematerial structures made of graphene and metal.

Broader Impact: The high-speed and efficient THz modulators based on graphene
are of immense interest to both the THz and graphene community. Graduate
students will be trained in the emergent fields of THz and nanomaterials and
they are also an integral element of the designed outreach activities to
disseminate the new discoveries to the general audience including undergraduate
students, school teachers and K-12 students.
