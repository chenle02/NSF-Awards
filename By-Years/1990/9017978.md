An international conference on "The Thermodynamic Basis of Protein Structure and
Function" will be held on October 4-7, 1990 in Kansas City, Missouri. The
meeting will provide a focal point and synthesis of a group of diverse aspects
of the basis of protein structure and function. These include: protein folding,
fluctuations in protein structure, protein- water interactions, thermodynamics
of protein interaction, regulatory interactions in proteins, thermodynamics of
enzyme catalysis, multifrequency enthalpic fluctuations, kinetics and
thermodynamics of conformational processes, and the thermodynamics of protein
engineering.
