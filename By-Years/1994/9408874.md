The goal of this research is to produce a general and versatile path planner
that can be applied to a wide range of complex situations including both
multiple redundant robots and wheeled vehicles subject to obstacle avoidance and
other constraints. Currently, path planning is a human--intensive endeavor with
long and arduous teaching of the robot path by a human operator in a simulated
work environment. Besides the cost and quality considerations of such practice,
planning for certain complex systems, such as multifingered robot hands or
tractors with multiple trailers, are beyond the capability of most humans. The
approach of this research project is to first pose the path planning problem as
a finite-time nonlinear control problem, and then transform it to a static root-
finding problem in an augmented space which can be iteratively solved. The
approach will be extended to address issues related to convergence, penalty
function selection, optimality, and robustness and sensitivity with respect to
the kinematic model. The algorithm will be systematically applied, in both
simulation and experimentation n, to a number of fairly complex case studies
involving both redundant manipulators and wheeled vehicles which have
traditionally been treated as different cases.
