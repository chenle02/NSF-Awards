Base isolation is a strategy that is effective in mitigating the effects of
earthquakes in certain structures. Interest in base isolation is developing
worldwide and research results are beginning to become available for translation
into engineering practice. This research project will study combining concepts
of base isolation with those of active control to mitigate the effects of
earthquakes. The research will consist of developing active control strategies,
numerically simulating structural response, studying effects of delayed
information, and performing preliminary experimenttion. The results will provide
a determination of feasibilty of using this combined concept for earthquake
hazard mitgation in structures.
