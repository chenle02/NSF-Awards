9622839 Owusu-Ofori This award is for support of the Third US-Africa
International Conference on Manufacturing Technology to be held in the city of
Accra, Ghana in August, 1996. The goal of the conference is to enable contacts
between the African researchers and their counterparts in North America with the
aim of developing mutual cooperation. The Conference will include both invited
and contributed sessions on a range of topics related to manufacturing
technology, including manufacturing management, industrialization and technology
transfer, and the roles of government, the private sector, and academia in
industrialization. A special session is being devoted to discussion of
opportunities for research collaboration among the different countries. The
Conference is an important international meeting and provides opportunities for
participants from the United States, Africa, and Asia to share research ideas
and develop strategies for more concrete collaborations. In the long run, the
conference should be useful in assisting the development of a local research
infrastructure that will support an emerging industrial base on the African
continent.
