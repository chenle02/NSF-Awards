The investigator and his colleagues organize the 2001 John H. Barrett Memorial
Lectures in the University of Tennessee at Knoxville from May 10-12, 2001. The
Barrett Lectures have been held annually since 1972. Each year a different topic
is chosen, representing the research interests of the mathematics faculty of the
University of Tennessee. Since 1993, the lectures have consisted of three one-
hour survey talks by each of three leading researchers representing different
themes/directions in a single field. The topic of the 2001 Barrett Lectures is:
``New Directions and Developments in Computational Mathematics". The focus of
the lectures is parallel numerical algorithms for partial differential equations
and their implementations and applications. The main speakers of the 2001
Barrett Lectures are Jinchao Xu of Penn State University, David Keyes of Old
Dominion University and ICASE, and Mary Wheeler of University of Texas at
Austin. Each of them will deliver three one-hour survey lectures on recent
developments on parallel numerical algorithms with three different emphases:
theory (Xu), computer implementation (Keyes), and application (Wheeler). In
addition to the main speakers, six speakers are also invited to give one-hour
talks on topics related to one of the main lectures.

The Barrett Lectures are partly funded by a grant from Tennessee Science
Alliance, and have often received additional support from the National Science
Foundation. They attract wide interest, with an audience of between 40 and 50
participants from the whole country, in addition to faculty and students from
Knoxville and the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. They represent one of the few
long standing lecture series in mathematics in the southeastern United States.
The main objective of the 2001 Barrett Lectures is to provide the participants
with an exposition of parallel numerical algorithms for partial differential
equations arising from various scientific/engineering/industrial applications,
through in-depth survey lectures and informal discussions with the above three
leading researchers in the field. Additional goals are to foster
interdisciplinary collaboration, particularly with researchers in the Computer
Science Department and in the College of Engineering at the University of
Tennessee and several other southeastern institutions, and to generate a set of
written surveys in the subject, which the organizing committee will endeavor to
have published in book form. The fund being requested from the NSF will be spent
providing partial support towards travel and accommodation for $20$ graduate
students and recent Ph.D.'s who do not have research grants.
