Hybrid von Neumann-dataflow architectures are an attempt to combine hardware
support for synchronization and latency hiding with von Neumann features such as
register files, instruction and data caches, RISC style instruction pipelining
and vector data structures. The success of a hybrid architecture design lies in
its ability to provide a balance between the dataflow and von Neumann features
that will optimize its performance. This research provides both quantitative and
qualitative analysis of these features to determine such a balance. In the first
step, a quantitative evaluation of the relative extent of the various forms of
locality is performed. Secondly, the architectural features, pertaining to
processor design and storage model, that can exploit these forms of locality are
determined. The impact of these features on performance, code generation
strategies and instruction set design is evaluated. Based on a given processor
and machine architecture, code partitioning and structure allocation strategies
are determined and evaluated. The hybrid dataflow model is evaluated using a
parameterizable, discrete event driven, register transfer level dataflow machine
simulator.
