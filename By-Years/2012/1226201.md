The number of Americans who self-identify as belonging to more than one race has
grown to over 9 million, emerging as one of the fastest growing demographic
groups in the United States. There has been much discussion, in both academic
disciplines and public forums, about the impact of mixed-race population growth
on peoples' stereotypes and prejudices about racial groups, and particularly how
biracially-identified individuals may challenge underlying beliefs about racial
categories themselves. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will examine the
impact of exposure to biracial identified, racially ambiguous individuals on
White perceivers' beliefs about social categories. Using a naturalistic
longitudinal study of recent arrivals to Hawaii (a largely multiracial context)
and a series of laboratory experiments in the U.S. mainland, this project tests
whether Whites' exposure to biracially identified individuals causes Whites to
believe that society is moving away from biological, discrete views of racial
categories and to subsequently decrease their personal endorsement of
essentialism. Moreover, this proposal tests two seemingly contradictory
consequences of essentialist belief change. On the one hand, essentialism
reduction should lead to more favorable attitudes towards racial minorities and
less use of social categories in judgment. On the other hand, recognizing that
society has become less essentialist may increase perceptions of racial equity
and racial progress and lower support for diversity policies (e.g., affirmative
action). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By identifying the positive and negative
consequences of reduced essentialism and the conditions under which reductions
occur, this project will aid in identifying potential intergroup interventions
that involve naturally occurring challenges to essentialism (e.g., biracial
exposure) and help us understand how they operate (e.g., through changing
beliefs about societal norms and expanding individuals' cognitive flexibility).
