The surface segregation of polymer chains in melts due to molecular weight
effects has important consequences in determining the mechanical resilience of
composite materials. It is thus suggested that the surface behavior of
apparently simple blends such as isotopic mixtures are more complicated than
thought before. In the second case they considered the surface behavior of a
binary blend, in which all segments of one chain interact identically with the
surface, while the end moieties of the second species have energetic
interactions with the surface that are different from the central beads. Their
preliminary experiments suggest, in agreement with theory, that the appropriate
tailoring of these end-moieties will dictate which component will partition to a
substrate interface. Experimentally, they propose to conduct more detailed
experiments on these systems primarily through the use of a new technique,
neutron reflectivity, to obtain a better understanding of the physics in these
interfacial situations. They have shown that mean-field lattice calculations
cannot enumerate the behavior of isotopic polymers and therefore propose to
conduct off-lattice Monte Carlo simulations on these systems to delineate their
behavior.
