The subgroup, "Biopolymers In Vivo" (BIV), was created to broaden the
understanding of biophysics in cells and has attracted the attention of
researchers from around the world, and especially students, postdocs and early-
career biophysicists. The organizers have selected for the 2012 Biophysical
Society BIV symposium, topics from molecular to cellular systems to address the
effects of cellular environment on biological functions. The subjects range from
proteins and nucleic acids in bacteria, to synthetic cells, and cell-like
environments. In addition, physical principles and theories involving
hydrodynamic interactions and volume exclusion provide complementary insight
into biomolecular dynamics inside a cell. The symposium will accelerate the
momentum of research inside cells by gathering established leaders in this field
along with undergrads, graduate students, and postdocs who share the same aim.
The level of the talks will be accessible to general attendees of the 2012
Biophysical Society Meeting, which will be held in San Diego. The BIV subgroup
will promote research on the physics of living matter using a wide range of
approaches including experiment, theory and computer simulation.
