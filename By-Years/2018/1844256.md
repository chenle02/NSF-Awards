This CAREER proposal focuses on the development of teachers' identities, which
are operationalized as beliefs and practices, behaviors, and pedagogical
knowledge. The PI uses a qualitative approach, occurring over two phases, to
investigate the impact of formal-informal collaborations on identity development
over time. The study is grounded in an ecological theoretical approach that
incorporates a view of informal learning settings as learner-driven and unique
in providing opportunities for interaction with objects during meaning-making
experiences among groups of learners. The longitudinal research design includes
collection of an array of data, including observations of teaching and learning
activities, interviews, survey responses, and archival documents such as student
work and videos of classroom experiences. The PI uses a narrative analysis and a
grounded theoretical approach to generate themes about beliefs and practices
around behaviors and pedagogical knowledge informed by informal science
education experiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research findings and related
educational activities inform the field's understanding of best practices of
integrating informal science activities into science teacher education,
including determining appropriate kinds of support for STEM teachers who learn
to teach in informal learning environments (ILE). The PI is integrating research
findings in the revision of existing courses and the development of new courses
and experiences for both new and experienced teachers. The project addresses the
need for empirical evidence of impacts of ILE experiences on professional
development, and will build capacity of informal science institution and
university professionals to provide effective teacher education experiences and
new teacher support.
