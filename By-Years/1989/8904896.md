A modelling study to construct a dynamic stratigraphic model of event bed
deposition on the Louisiana-Texas continental shelf. Sensitivity tests will help
define a set of physically realizable solutions. The main objective is to test
the hypothesis that coarse-grained "event" beds are the result ofshort-lived
storms. The modelling will attempt to answer questions about the strength of
geostrophic flow necessary to form these beds, the source for the sand, regional
extent and interval characteristics and the vertical sequence of the event beds
in the framework of the frequency of storms and availability of accommodation
space on the shelf.
