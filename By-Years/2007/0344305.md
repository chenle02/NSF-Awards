M.L. Guerinot and E.L. Connolly Metal Uptake in Arabidopsis thaliana 1/7/04

Iron is an essential nutrient and the ability to accumulate iron from the diet
is crucial for human health. Currently, more people suffer from malnutrition due
to micronutrient deficiencies than from deficiencies of protein or energy and it
is estimated that over 2 billion people worldwide suffer from iron deficiency.
In agriculture, the availability of iron in soil plays a major part in
determining crop yields. In addition, plants are the main dietary source of iron
for much of the world's population. However, iron can also be toxic to both
plants and animals when present at high levels. Thus, all cells must carefully
regulate iron uptake. The long-range goal of these studies is to understand how
plants take up iron from the soil and how plants maintain proper iron levels in
the various cells/tissues of the plant. Previously, the FRO2 gene was identified
as a critical component of the iron uptake system in Arabidopsis thaliana; FRO2
encodes a low iron inducible ferric chelate reductase responsible for reduction
of iron at the root surface. The current studies are aimed at further
characterization of FRO2 as well as three additional FRO family members (FRO3,
FRO6 and FRO7). Specifically, the roles of each FRO in iron uptake and
homeostasis will be examined using a variety of molecular, cellular and
biochemical approaches. A second aim focuses on a transcription factor (bHLH29)
and its role in controlling FRO gene expression in an iron-dependent fashion.
The proposed studies will ultimately lead to a better understanding of iron
uptake in plants and to the design of plants that are capable of growth on iron
deficient soils and that accumulate iron and thus have a higher nutritional
value.

This collaborative project will provide unique mentoring opportunities. The
Biology Department at USC has a total of 950 majors, of whom approximately 59%
are women and 33% are minority students (27% are African American). An exchange
program between USC and Dartmouth will allow promising young USC undergraduates
to experience research in both the Guerinot and Connolly labs. First-generation,
low-income undergraduate students from groups underrepresented in the sciences
will be recruited and trained in the latest genomic, molecular and biochemical
methods. The PI and co-PI are actively involved in a number of mentoring
programs that will be supported by this grant.
