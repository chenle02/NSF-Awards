9730643 Soloviev The project will analyze the turbulence data obtained by the
Russian bow sensors during TOGA COARE legs of the R/V Moana Wave. The main goal
is to quantify turbulence levels in the near-surface layer of the tropical ocean
under a variety of forcing and mixed layer conditions. The objectives are to: 1)
compare the observed turbulence dissipation rate with theoretical values; and 2)
find typical spatial patterns of the turbulence parameters.
