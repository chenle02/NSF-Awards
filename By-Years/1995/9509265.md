9509265 Fabrikant Collisional and photo-processes involving the formation and
destruction of stable and temporary negative ions are studied using a variety of
theoretical techniques. The problems undertaken include negative ion formation
in atoms, the interaction of Rydberg atoms with other atoms and polar molecules
and the interaction of electrons with molecules absorbed on surfaces. ***
