A conceptual design of an inherently safe reactor (ISR) has been developed by
Nuclear Engineering Faculty and Students at the Ohio State University (OSU). The
design, which won critical acclaims of many experts in the field of nuclear
reactor safety, makes extensive use of conventional light water reactor (LWR)
technology, but also incorporates several innovative passive features. The
ultimate goal of the research outlined in this proposal is twofold: to develop
and document a methodology for quantifying the benefits of passive reactor
safety features, and to determine the safety gains in incorporating into a
340-MWe boiling water reactor (BWR) (a) natural circulation and (b) a passive
steam-driven emergency core cooling system (ECCS) contained within a prestressed
concrete reactor vessel. The method as applied to the OSU-ISR will include
verification of full power, shutdown and accident natural circulation modes,
identification of system reliability based on natural circulation parameters and
finally, comparison of results with current LWR systems. The proposed research
program in essence will develop a methodology and apply to the OSU-ISR concept
to determine the relative safety and reliability of the modified BWR system as
compared to current light water reactor technology.
