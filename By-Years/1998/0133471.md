The theoretical and experimental research efforts in this project focus on
haptics interaction and visual servoing of deformable objects through shared
control. In particular, novel haptics modeling of interaction with deformable
objects will be explored, using overlaying local nonlinear modeling of elasto-
dynamic properties of objects; new visual servoing algorithms will be formulated
for tracking deformable objects using position and image based control
techniques; new robot control algorithms will be developed for safe interaction
with a pacient's organs using haptics and vision. The project's education
component focuses on developing new courses, involving students in course
development, and involving undergraduate students in research. The PI will also
participate in education of the under-represented high school students.
