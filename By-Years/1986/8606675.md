Heat pumps are an important commercial product whose use will increase in the
years to come. It is also a fact that U. S. heat pump technology is slipping
behind that of other countries. This research sets forth some novel heat pump
cycles and also will verify the concepts by experiment. It is expected that the
results of this work will enable the U.S. position in heat pumps to be restored.
