This proposal focuses on testing whether insect herbivores are controlled
largely by their&lt;br/&gt;host plant or by their natural enemies. I will test
the relative strengths of these&lt;br/&gt;factors by using an intertidal study
system of salt marsh plants and their associated&lt;br/&gt;herbivores. I will
test whether the influence of both plants and natural enemies
varies&lt;br/&gt;along a stress gradient, in this case a salinity gradient. The
project should be interest&lt;br/&gt;to ecologists, agriculturalists,
entomologists, and pest control workers. If natural&lt;br/&gt;enemies are not
found to be important, or to be important only in certain habitats,
then&lt;br/&gt;the value of biological control, using natural enemies, is
brought into question and the&lt;br/&gt;value of plant resistance as a control
technique is strengthened.
