Plants from around the world vary considerably in their leaf morphological and
physiological traits. Although some combinations of leaf traits are found
repeatedly in nature, others are not. This suggests either that the observed
trait combinations are economically advantageous for carbon gain and plant
productivity in different habitats, and thus reflect adaptive evolution, or that
these are the only trait combinations that are genetically possible. The project
will test whether trait combinations identified as the Worldwide Leaf Economic
Spectrum (WLES: leaf photosynthesis, nitrogen, thickness, and lifespan) reflect
successful ecological and evolutionary solutions to different environments.
First, the project will compare 27 species of sunflower species (Helianthus), to
see whether particular trait combinations are robust when evolutionary
relationships are accounted for, and whether they are associated with success in
particular environments, and thus support adaptive evolution. Second, the
project will test whether artificial selection under low nutrients results in
trait combinations predicted by the WLES, and whether there are any genetic
constraints. The expectation is that many trait combinations are possible (i.e.
no genetic constraints) and that the WLES trait combinations found in nature and
managed systems represent plant strategies that are the most successful
compromises between rapid resource acquisition and greater resource conservation
for different environments. A greater understanding of WLES leaf traits and
their association with success in low resource habitats may contribute to the
improvement of domesticated Helianthus annuus, which is a major oilseed crop
with over 2 million acres in cultivation in the US. The results will also
further the ability to predict which plants will be successful in natural and
managed habitats as climates change. The study will provide unique training for
high school students and future science teachers.
