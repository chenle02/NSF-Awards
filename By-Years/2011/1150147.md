Research Objectives and Approaches&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is
to harvest otherwise wasted mechanical energy and produce renewable electricity
with piezoelectric nanomaterials. The approach is focused on the significant
factors in the energy conversion at the nanoscale with the development of a
3-dimensional energy harvester, which capitalizes on the significant advantages
in material properties and dynamics that nanowires
offer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The research will lead
to greater understanding of energy conversion in piezoelectric zinc oxide and
barium titanate nanowires through a 3-dimensional generator based on laterally
aligned nanowire arrays. Calculations show that a 3-dimensional generator will
produce orders-of-magnitude greater power than current 2-dimensional ones, with
potential for piezoelectric materials to function at large scales. This research
aims to increase our use of ubiquitous ambient energy sources, such as
vibrations in engines, roads, or buildings that are largely wasted
today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The integrated research
and education plan will synergistically benefit society. Hands-on workshops in a
summer camp will inspire interests in science, technology and engineering among
K-12 students. The PI?s interdisciplinary research does not require advanced
knowledge for students to begin, which will facilitate efforts to recruit
underrepresented undergraduate students. The intrigued student can then gain
unique experiences by assisting with the proposed research and relevant
knowledge through a new course entitled ?Engineered Nanomaterials for Solid-
State Energy Conversion?. The research result will be disseminated in leading
journals, conferences, and workshops to benefit the scientific community and
will be incorporated into the classroom to foster student learning.
