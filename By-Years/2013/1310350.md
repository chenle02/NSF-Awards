The Environmental Chemical Sciences Program in the Chemistry Division at the
National Science Foundation supports the research of Professor Rabi A. Musah and
Robert B. Cody both at the State University of New York at Albany who will
direct a project to investigate volatile organosulfur compounds (VOSCs) that are
emitted by representative plants to the environment using direct analysis in
real time mass spectrometry (DART-MS). In order to determine the possible fates
of these compounds in the atmosphere, the gas-phase reactions of identified
compounds when exposed to atmospherically relevant radicals, such as ozone,
hydroxyl and NOx species, will be investigated. In collaboration with industrial
partner JEOL USA Inc., a platform that interfaces with the JEOL AccuTOF Direct
Analysis in Real Time (DARTÂ®) mass spectrometer will be developed to permit high
resolution DART-MS analysis of VOSCs under ambient conditions in air. The
biogeochemistry of VOSCs has been the focus of significant attention because of
increased awareness of their contribution to atmospheric sulfur, and hence their
potential to influence the climate globally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research
will facilitate the study of not only the fates of plant emitted VOSCs, but also
the extent to which they may ultimately contribute to the overall atmospheric
sulfur burden, and influence pollution, acid rain, and cloud formation, among
other phenomena. The developed analytical tools would be commercially available
and find broad utility for analyses relevant to a range of other fields
including chemistry, biochemistry, forensics chemistry, food sciences,
agriculture, and medicine. The integration of teaching and research between the
postdoctoral trainee and graduate student on the one hand, and the JEOL
scientists on the other, unimpeded by departmental or administrative boundaries,
will cultivate a cultural shift in research-based instruction. The trainees will
gain a breadth of skills, strengths, and understanding to work in an
interdisciplinary team environment while being grounded with depth of knowledge
in a major field. The training will provide scientific preparation for the
student and the postdoctoral associate whether they pursue academic or non-
academic careers and it will provide a breeding ground for exploration and
application of novel experimental approaches to resolve problems.
