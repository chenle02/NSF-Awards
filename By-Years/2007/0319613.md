This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop
the next generation of rapid thermal processing (RTP) equipment for advanced
CMOS technology. This research will investigate the commercial feasibility of
millisecond microwave anneal system for 300 mm silicon wafers. The anticipated
goals of this research are (1) to demonstrate the maximum power/heating
capabilities of millisecond microwave RTP, (2) to demonstrate that millisecond
microwave RTP will satisfy the CMOS technology nodes for the years 2005-2015,
and (3) to illustrate the commercial feasibility of millisecond microwave RTP.

The development of a novel rapid heating technology directly satisfies a CMOS
requirement and introduces a new field of rapid heating technology for novel
materials processing. The establishment of this technique as a viable anneal
technology should attract significant funding from the semiconductor industry.
Finally, millisecond heating has materials processing applications beyond the
scope of silicon processing technology. Once established in silicon, this
technology may expand into related fields, most notably ultra-rapid ceramics
sintering.
