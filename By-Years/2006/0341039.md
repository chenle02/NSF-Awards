Interdisciplinary (99) This project is developing, evaluating and disseminating
materials for teaching a science-based course, "Environmental Issues for
Designers and Merchandisers," that instructs interior and apparel students
(i.e., future designers and merchandisers) about design-related environmental
issues. The course emphasizes scientific concepts underlying textile-related
environmental problems, and focuses on McDonough and Braungart's "cradle to
cradle" design model as an approach for eliminating environmental problems
during the design phase of a product's life cycle. The course uses a case
studies approach to exemplify model application. Materials being developed
include PowerPoint-based classroom materials with embedded videos of case
histories. The intellectual merit of the project lies in providing apparel
design and merchandising students the scientific foundation and context to make
environmentally wise decisions in the design of textile products. The broader
impacts of the project lie in providing a relevant science background to a
population of non-science students who would not ordinarily receive such an
experience, and in helping to bring a scientific and environmental consciousness
into the fields of interior design and apparel design.
