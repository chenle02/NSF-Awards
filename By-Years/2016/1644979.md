This project supports the participation of early career scientists, postdocs,
and students in a symposium on the chemistry of biogenic volatile organic
compounds (BVOC) and the formation of secondary organic particles in the
atmosphere. The symposium will be held at the annual American Association for
Aerosol Research (AAAR) conference to be held in Portland Oregon from October
17-21, 2016.

The symposium will include presentations on the effects of anthropogenic
nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) on BVOC oxidation and aerosol
formation from laboratory, field, and modeling studies. The participation of
both experimentalists and modelers and related discussions will enhance
efficient knowledge transfer, where laboratory/field data will provide important
constraints for improved parameterization of aerosol formation in models. By
bringing together senior and junior scientists at the workshop, the meeting will
serve to foster scientific training and networking opportunities for younger
scientists, thereby greatly enhancing their career development.
