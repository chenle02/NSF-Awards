This support will allow the New York Botanical Garden to publish a 1500-page,
two-volume monograph, The Moss Flora of Mexico, the research for which was NSF-
funded. This study which contains contributions from 32 authors, is one of the
few moss floras for any tropical country and documents 900 species in 32 genera.
Its comprehensiveness and scholarship, including the more than 800 plates that
illustrate many of the species for the first time, will make the volumes an
invaluable resource for professionals and students working in tropical
biodiversity, tropical floras, and especially bryology.
