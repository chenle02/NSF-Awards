This grant is supported jointly by the Divisions of Materials Research and
Mathematical Sciences. The research will focus on interference effects in
electronic systems driven by strong interactions and extends to nonlinear
physics. In particular, problems to be addressed in quantum physics include
interference effects in p- and d-wave chiral superconductors; magnetotransport
and quantum Hall effect in organic quasi-one-dimensional conductors; and
Aharanov-Bohm effect in the quantum Hall regime. In the area of nonlinear
physics, problems to be addressed include singularities in moving fronts and
diffusion driven aggregations; integrable aspects of nonlinear dynamics;
application of random matrices in problems of analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
