With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at City University of New York/Hunter College will
acquire a X-ray diffractometer with CCD detector for small molecule
diffractometry. This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas
including the following: a) self-assembly of nano-scaled, solid-state photonic
materials; b) lanthanide polyoxometalates: building blocks for new materials; c)
polyoxometalate anions and metalloenzyme mimics; d) redox-mediated chiroptical
materials; e) synthetic carbohydrate chemistry; f) chiral phosphorus ligands and
antisense oligonucleotides; g) complexes formed by bile acids, cholesterol and
other steroids with cyclodextrin derivatives and synthetic receptors; h) quantum
crystallography of molecules; and i) study of geometry and electronic
environment of metal sites by solid state NMR and X-ray
crystallography.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The X-ray diffractometer allows accurate
and precise measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a molecule,
including bond distances and angles, and it provides accurate information about
the spatial arrangement of the molecule relative to the neighboring molecules.
These studies will have an impact in a number of areas, including materials
chemistry and biochemistry.
