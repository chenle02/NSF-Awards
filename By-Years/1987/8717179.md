A conference will be convened in the Fall of l987 at MIT of individuals
currently engaged in programs in the U.S. designed to teach Japanese to American
scientists and engineers and of others with relevant specialized knowledge. The
participants will address the current availability of such training, the
materials available for carrying it out, and barriers and costs, perceived and
real, to acquiring sufficient technical Japanese to engage in research,
including long-term (six months or more) stays in Japan. A report will be
prepared for the National Science Foundation on these issues and on options for
addressing them.
