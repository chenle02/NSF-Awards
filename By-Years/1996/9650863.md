This project focuses on a workshop-based approach to an introductory physical
science course. An enhanced learning environment is being created that utilizes
advanced technologies such as computers, networks, and digital media for student
exploration and learning in physical science. The project adopts an inquiry-
based approach to the materials that fosters student collaboration, practice of
oral and written communication skills, and an appreciation for some of the
fundamental principles of physics, chemistry, astronomy, and earth system
science. Wherever appropriate, microcomputer-based laboratory techniques and
digital multimedia are being used to enrich the learning experience and enable
students to focus on building appropriate mental models of the scientific
concepts being explored. Two sections (to be called The Science Studio) of a
pilot physical science course are being offered in the workshop format, meeting
twice per week for 2-hour sessions. One of the sections is offered within the
university's honors program while the other has open enrollment. Widespread
adoption of the workshop model after the pilot phase may affect in excess of
1,000 students per year.
