An interdisciplinary, international, materials science workshop will be held in
Santiago, Chile, on April 26-29, 2004, under the sponsorship of NSF and CONICYT-
Chile. The workshop is organized by scientists from countries in the Americas
through the Inter-American Materials Collaboration (CIAM), the Center for
Advanced Materials Research (CIMAT) in Chile, and the U. of California at Santa
Barbara. The workshop provides a forum for scientific exchange at the cutting
edge of a rapidly developing field by bringing together materials researchers
and students from across the continent, thus enhancing collaborations among
participants with an emphasis on interdisciplinarity. An attendance of about 200
is expected, students and postdoctoral research associates comprise about half
of the participants.

This award is supported by the Division of Materials Research, the Office of
International Science and Engineering and the Division of Chemical and Transport
Systems.
