ATM-9302475 Finlayson-Pitts The reactions of alkali halide particles in the
atmosphere to form photochemically reactive species is currently of great
interest. Such particles, particularly sodium chloride, are not only ubiquitous
in the marine boundary layer, but also have been found in the plumes from
burning oil wells in Kuwait, in the exhaust from solid rocket propellants, and
in emissions from the El Chichon volcano. In this project studies of the
kinetics and mechanisms of the reactions of alkali halide with various nitrogen
oxides and ozone will be undertaken. This will be accomplished through the use
of the relatively new but potentially very valuable technique of diffuse
reflectance infrared spectroscopy (DRIFT), which allows one to follow both the
gases and the surfaces of the salt in real time as the reactions are occurring.
The emphasis will be on understanding the fundamental chemical processes,
especially how the nature of the surface controls reactions of atmospheric
importance.
