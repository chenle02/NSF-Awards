Recent IR experiments on the time dependent vibrational and rotational response
of CN-ions in crystals indicate that the vibrational dynamics of this diatomic
molecule in solids leads to unexpected lasing behavior. If other diatomic
defects in crystals have properties related to CN- then solid state vibrational
lasers could be practical for a variety of applications in the infrared and far-
infrared spectral regions. One fundamental experimental problem has been the
lack of coincidences between near-IR color center laser pumps and the overtone
frequencies of molecules which can be doped into crystals. The discovery by the
PI that nonresonant UV laser radiation can be used to pump the vibrational
manifold of CN- opens up another avenue through which the IR radiative
properties of molecules in solids can be studied. The interfacing of a pulsed UV
excimer laser to an ultrahigh resolution fourier-transform infrared spectrometer
will provide a new efficient type of time resolved vibrational spectroscopy
which can be used to explore multilevel IR energy transfer of molecules in the
solid state. For the examination of complex molecules with subnsecond relaxation
times the fourier- transform infrared spectrometer will be used in a different
mode to time analyze the delay between picosecond pulses in the measurement of
fast saturable absorption in the anharmonic vibrator.
