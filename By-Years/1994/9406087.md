9406087 Bernstein The objective of this workshop is to critically evaluate the
past and present status of geotechnical engineering, scrutinize the needs of the
future, and provide directions to enter the 21st century as a vigorous
discipline. In this context the role of the geomedia vis-a-vis engineering,
economic and societal needs will be identified and redefined if necessary. The
terminology needed to correctly represent and communicate the redefined role and
direction of this engineering discipline will be developed. And finally,
recommendations will be made to inform the public, including the engineering and
scientific communities, of the role and importance of geo- materials and systems
to the sustained growth and enhancement of mankind and resources available to
support that growth. ***
