CSUN (California State University-Northridge) operates the San Fernando
Observatory (SFO), which has produced an extensive data set of photometric full-
disk solar images covering more than twenty-two years. These images allow
precise measurement of the relative brightness of a variety of solar features,
such as sunspots and faculae. The Principal Investigator (PI) will utilize this
SFO data, as well as photometric images from other sources, to address open
scientific questions about solar variability.

The PI plans to investigate many issues, including whether observed solar
magnetic features are sufficient to explain short and long term variations in
total and spectral solar irradiance, and what the relative contributions of
various solar features might be to changes in those irradiances. The research
will analyze the statistical properties of solar active regions, to discover
whether these vary over a solar cycle, or from one cycle to the next. It expects
to determine whether the solar irradiance changes in a systematic way at solar
minimum, and whether measurements of solar features can be used to reconstruct
current and historical values of total solar irradiance (TSI) and spectral solar
irradiance (SSI).

The PI pledges that these photometric images, precision information on solar
active regions, and secondary data (such as total and spectral solar irradiance
models) will be made available to the wider research community. This research
will also improve our understanding of solar variability and any effect it might
have on the Earth's climate and weather, and therefore have broad impact on
society. The PI also emphasizes that CSUN serves a significant minority
population, and that this project will thus increase the participation of under-
represented groups in science. Finally, the PI will give public talks in the
CSUN planetarium about his research results, in order to inform and educate a
wider audience.
