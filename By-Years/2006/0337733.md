This project is investigating the motion of the tectonic plates relative to the
hotspots, which are persistent locations of volcanism thought by many to
originate deep in the Earth. Examples of hotspot volcanoes include active
volcanism at Kilauea volcano on the big island of Hawaii, active volcanism at
and near Iceland, and volcanism in Yellowstone National Park. The motion of the
tectonic plates relative to the hotspots since 68 million years ago are being
estimated as are the uncertainty in estimates of that motion using new methods
developed in the project. These uncertainties are being used to estimate
uncertainties of several predictions, for example, using the motion of the
Pacific plate relative to the hotspots to predict the motion of the Nubian (West
African) plate relative to the hotspots. These predictions and their
uncertainties are being used to test several hypotheses including the hypothesis
that hotspots in the Atlantic Ocean basin are stationary relative to those in
the Pacific Ocean basin. This will provide important information about motions
deep within the planet and thus provide fundamental knowledge about internally
driven Earth processes. The new methods developed for estimating these
uncertainties will are being made widely available so that they can be readily
used by other researchers.
