Proposal Number: 0435168&lt;br/&gt;PI: Nicholas Maxemchuk
&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Columbia University &lt;br/&gt;Title: Funneling Impulses
in Sensor Networks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
grant's research targets sensor networks that must "funnel" a sudden impulse of
data that is generated due to an anomalous event such as an earthquake,
terrorist attack, flood, or fire. The objective is to understand, from a
fundamental standpoint, how to design sensor networks to adequately handle these
impulses of data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs explore four fundamental areas
that must be addressed by these types of networks for this
scenario:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Topological layout (density) of sensors to
optimize battery resources during funneling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Persistence
of data waiting to be funneled as nodes fail&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Compression
of data en-route to the collection points during
funneling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Reliability of delivery of data en-route to
the collection points during funneling&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will
produce fundamental, mathematical models that will be used to solve these
problems in an analytical context. The results will be of use to more
practically-oriented research that seeks to implement and experiment with actual
hardware and software solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The availability of dense
sensor networks that are robust and can effectively funnel impulses will have
great impact on demanding sensing application areas such as disaster response
and recovery, fire fighting, and emergency response. In addition, the techniques
that are developed within this research will play a crucial role in defining
foundations for future dense sensor networks, providing the basis for a new
class of sensing applications in these critically important
areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research results will be disseminated through
technical and popular publications in top conferences.&lt;br/&gt;
