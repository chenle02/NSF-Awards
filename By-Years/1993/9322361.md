9322361 Ataai This Research Experiences for Undergraduates project in the
Department of Chemical Engineering at the University of Pittsburgh will
introduce undergraduates from engineering and the sciences, especially
undergraduates majoring in chemical engineering, chemistry, and biology at small
colleges and universities in the region, to a research environment in which
full-time faculty, visiting scientists, post-docs, and graduates students are
working on research that promises to lead to important new technologies in the
fields such as biochemical engineering, catalysis, and fuels. ***
