CBET-0813939, Agrawal&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides funds for travel
support and meeting CDs for 52 students at the 2008 Technical Meeting of the
Central States Section of the Combustion Institute, to be held April 20-22, 2008
at the University of Alabama Tuscaloosa. The stated goal of the meeting is to
bring together combustion researchers from academia, federal government, and
industry to discuss the newest developments in combustion science.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scientific and technological advances are needed in system
efficiencies, cleaner technologies, and alternative and renewable sources of
energy due to rapidly increasing energy demand, limited supply of fossil fuels,
and increased concern over global warming. These energy and environmental issues
are central to combustion science and will be addressed by research advances
presented at the meeting. In addition to these broader technological impacts,
student exposure to advances in science and to the scientific dialogue of the
meeting will give substantial educational impact.
