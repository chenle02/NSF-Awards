Wartell This award will help support the renovation of the high bay area in the
Cherry Emerson Building at Georgia Institute of Technology. This three story
building is home to the educational and research missions of the School of
Biology and to the instrumentation and staff of the Research Center for
Biotechnology. This renovation will convert the high bay area into two floors of
needed research laboratories needed for the biosciences at this institution. The
research and training to take place in these lab spaces include environmental
biology, microbiology, and molecular biology/genetics. Technical expertise and
training are available in this building in the areas of nuclear magnetic
resonance spectroscopy, high resolution mass spectroscopy, chromatographic
separations, medium scale fermentation, and microbial bioreactor systems. This
renovation project will provide approximately 3506 square feet of modernized
laboratory space to be used by 14 faculty, 7 postdoctoral fellows, 35 graduate
students, 4 research technicians, and about 32 undergraduate students.
