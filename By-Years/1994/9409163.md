9409163 Gruzglina This award is for research to develop a theory of the
compaction process for powder materials, based on the concept of modeling the
compacted blend as a viscous fluid. An analysis of the formation of asymmetrical
briquettes using conventional forming elements will be conducted. The process of
counter-motion of the blend in the pressing zone will be studied. New improved
forming elements will be developed. Thus, the research is directed at replacing
current empirical design methods for compacting machinery by an analytical
approach, based on the proposed theory. Briquetting machinery is widely used in
powder metallurgy, nonferrous metallurgy, coal production, and production of
food and pharmaceutical products. The results of the research will therefore be
of potential use in all these industries.
