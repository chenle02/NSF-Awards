In this project the P.I. will develop a model of the ocean circulation, driven
by wind and buoyancy forcing, as a contribution to the World Ocean Circulation
Experiment (WOCE). An existing model developed by Luyten, Pedlosky, and Stommel
will be modified to account for eastern boundary currents and for cross-
isopycnal flux. The result will be a hybrid analytical/numerical model, and
after some experience with its performance, the P.I. will apply it to question
of data assimilation.
