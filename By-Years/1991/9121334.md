This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in parallel
computing and software libraries between Jack Dongarra of the University of
Tennessee and Bernard Tourancheau of the Laboratory for Parallel Computing at
the Ecole Normale Superieure, Lyon, France. The investigators seek to develop
high performance communication and computation routines for linear algebra
algorithms on distributed-memory supercomputers. Dr. Dongarra's group brings to
this collaboration experience in developing software libraries for linear
algebra subroutines. This is complemented by the French investigator's expertise
in linear algebra algorithms and access to unique parallel computers in Lyon.
Recent advances in the development of software libraries have led to better,
more efficient software performance and a greater portability amongst machines.
Research has progressed from vector computers to shared-memory computers and
currently is focused on distributed memory systems for high performance
supercomputers. This collaborative effort is oriented towards the development of
software libraries for distributed memory systems. The ultimate goal is the
development of a standardized code and portable software libraries for the
supercomputers of the future.
