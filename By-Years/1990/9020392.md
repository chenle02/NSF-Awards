This proposal addresses the urgent issues of non-renewable resource development
in Arctic regions of the United States and the USSR. A comparative evaluation of
national regimes will be used to help consolidate the interests of government,
industry, environmental organizations and Native communities. Funding is
requested for five U.S. participants to meet with Soviet colleagues in Moscow in
late Fall 1990 under the auspices of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. The
international and multidisciplinary focus of this proposal coincides very well
with the goals of the Arctic Social Science program within the Division of Polar
Programs and the international goals of the Arctic Research and Policy Act.
