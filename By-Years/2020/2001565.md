This PI will conduct research in algebraic geometry which is the study of spaces
that arise as solution sets to polynomial equations. These spaces are algebraic
varieties, and they are studied both by examining the algebraic properties of
the equations and the geometry of the solution sets. An important feature of
algebraic geometry is that a collection of algebraic varieties (e.g. the
collection of all plane conic curves) often itself is an algebraic variety, and
algebraic varieties appearing in this way are called moduli spaces. The PI will
study some specific moduli spaces, such as the compactified universal Jacobian
and the Kontsevich moduli space of stable maps, with the goal of both better
understanding them and applying their study to problems like curve counting. The
grant will also support research students and the PI's outreach activities
including the South Carolina Math Circle. This project is jointly funded by the
Algebra and Number Theory program and the Established Program to Stimulate
Competitive Research (EPSCoR).

After roughly 60 years of work by many mathematicians, we now have a detailed
understanding of how to construct compactified Jacobians, and the PI will apply
this understanding to advance algebraic geometry. The PI will study the
arithmetic, geometry, and topology of moduli spaces of sheaves and then to apply
those results to solve counting problems (i.e. to advance enumerative geometry).
The moduli spaces the PI will focus on are moduli spaces of sheaves on singular
curves or compactified Jacobians, and the project consists of two broad parts.
For the first part, the PI will develop the enumerative geometry of the
universal compactified Jacobian, a moduli space of sheaves on stable curves, in
a manner analogous to the development of the Schubert calculus of the
Grassmannian variety. For the second part, the PI will count curves
arithmetically using A1-homotopy theory.
