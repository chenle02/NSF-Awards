BRILEY 97-30365 This award provides funding for an Engineering Research Centers
(ERC) Program/Centers for Research Excellence in Science and Technology (CREST)
Program Partnership between the Engineering Research Center for Computational
Field Simulation at Mississippi State University (MSU) and Tennessee State
University (TSU) CREST entitled "Computational Prediction of Aircraft Icing
Phenomena." This objectives of this research program include the development,
application and evaluation of existing one-dimensional icing models, as well as
new models involving two-and three-dimensional physical processes that represent
the complex physical process of ice formation and accumulation on surfaces. This
research will also develop new solution algorithms capable of efficient solution
of complex flow and heat transfer for applications which include both very low
and transonic Mach number regions. These algorithms will allow the use of
structured and unstructured grids, and implementation in scaleable form on
distributed memory computing systems. The icing models will be coupled to the
Navies-Stokes flow solver through a boundary surface interface procedure. The
research collaboration between the MSU ERC and the TSU CREST is well suited for
the proposed collaboration in that it will require the coupling of separately
developed codes for the icing models (TSU) and the Navier-Stokes solution (MSU),
to correctly model the boundary interface. The coupling of these codes and the
demonstration and validation of predictions will focus the collaboration.
