In this project, PI's from three institutions will carry out sampling on a
transect in the Southern Ocean along 65 degrees South latitude across the Ross
Sea. The sampling will be carried out on the USSR vessel, R/V IOFFE. Scientists
from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography will be responsible for the
hydrography and nutrients, while scientists from Lamont will acquire and analyze
samples for the tracers, Tritium, Helium, Oxygen-18, and Carbon-14. Oregon State
University (this project) will provide overall coordination and contribute to
the overall data analysis and integration. This section constitutes a joint
contribution by the USA and the Soviet Union to the International World Ocean
Circulation Experiment (WOCE), specifically, Hydrographic line S-4.
