This proposal aims to establish a royalty-free, national compiler infrastructure
that serves the needs of the research community and industry. A successful
infrastructure will have a major impact on computing . The availability of such
a system will make compiler research and development more accessible to a larger
community, and the system itself can form the basis of a modern compiler for
commercial use. The investment in this infrastructure is expected to be greatly
amplified through community participation. As a focal point to bring together
all the talents in the compiler area, the infrastructure can develop into a
super-system that surpasses any existing system. Such an infrastructure can
bring about the kind of acceleration in compiler development needed to match the
phenomenal advances in processor architectures. The proposed infrastructure
includes robust front ends and back ends, as well as many different state-of
-the-art program analyses and optimizations.
