This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program provides
continued support to Dr. Robert R. Holmes of the Chemistry Department,
University of Massachusetts at Amherst, for the investigation of high valent
silicon and phosphorus compounds. Anionic, hexacoordinated silicon compounds
will be prepared and their characteristics will be compared to analogous
phosphorus compounds. Acyclic, pentaoxy, anionic silicates will be studied in
order to understand more concerning the initial steps in silanol polymerization.
The structure and conformational properties of pentacoordinte phosphorus and
silicon compunds containing rings varying in size from 6- to 8- membered will be
studied, particularly as relevant to cAMP mechanisms. Also to be investigated is
the mechanistic pathway for nucleophilic displacement reactions of
tetracoordinate phosphorus and silicon. A wide range of tools will be used to
characterize the compounds, including variable temperature NMR, X-ray
diffraction, and molecular modeling. %%% Only recently has it become possible to
compare the behavior of silicon compounds with five or six groups attached to
silicon to the behavior of analogous phosphorus compounds. By comparing the
details of reactions in which such compounds rearrange or lose the fifth or
sixth group, it is possible to understand more about how spatial and electronic
factors affect the chemistry of these compounds. This fundamental research
project may help provide insight into the formation of silicon polymers or into
the hydrolysis of nucleoside cyclic 3',5'-monophosphates, which play a central
role in the regulation of cell metabolism.
