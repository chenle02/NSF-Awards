A completely relativistic theory of strong-field atomic photoionization will be
developed utilizing the approximation that the photoelectron's potential energy
in the strong field is larger than its binding energy. The theoretical
development will be used to explore tunneling phenomena and to develop a full
theory of the "stabilization" phenomenon in high field photoionization.
