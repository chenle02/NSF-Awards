This work in mathematical physics deals with the relation between causal
descriptions of dynamical systems and the time- scales of the underlying
dynamics. This will be studied using simple mathematical models that are area
preserving maps and their quantised versions (multidimensional extension of
Baker's Map, BBGKY hierarchy). The work relates to the general problem of chaos
and its correspondence in quantum mechanics.
