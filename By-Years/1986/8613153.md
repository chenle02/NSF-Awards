This experimental research project is directed towards understanding the fluid
mechanics of drop deformation and breakup for Newtonian and polymeric non-
Newtonian fluids in time dependent flows at low Reynolds numbers. It will also
address fundamentals of particle capture at fluid interfaces (bubble- particle
collisions) and droplet coalescence. The proposed research addresses fluid
dynamics topics of fundamental importance to manufacturing and materials
processing and other topics of societal importance.
