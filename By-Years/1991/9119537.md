The goal of this project is to determine the response of the Baikal hydrological
system to forcing from past changes in climate and neotectonics. Nine specific
time windows of global importance are targeted in a 3-year program of iterative
steps. The research is designed to study these time windows by obtaining and
analyzing cores of Lake Baikal's sedimentary archive with a lithochrono-
stratigraphic framework constrained by AMS 14C dating, magnetic stratigraphy and
high resolution 3.5 kKz seismic stratigraphy. The Lake Baikal paleolimnology
project offers unique opportunities as a full-scale American Russian scientific
partnership. Knowledge about the response of the world's largest and deepest
freshwater body to continental climate change and atmospheric forcing will
contribute significant new results to international efforts to understand the
past response dynamics of large ecosystems during important time windows. The
project is guided as closely as possible by recommendations of the PAGES
International Geosphere/Biosphere project, and climate and hydrological aspects
of Earth Systems history for the U.S. Global Change Program.
