CBET-0828749&lt;br/&gt;Patankar&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The physical principles
underlying the extraordinary mobility of swimming and flying animals have been
the subject of years of effort and there is still much that is not understood.
This study develops an efficient numerical method for fully resolved simulation
of self-propulsion of organisms called Fully Resolved Momentum Redistribution
for self Propulsion (FuRMoRP). It will be used to study swimming fish; however,
it is sufficiently general to function for small flying animals as well. The
motivation to develop such a tool is two-fold: first, to develop a high
resolution efficient fluid simulation technology that is transformational by its
potential to significantly impact many interdisciplinary areas; second, to gain
insight into a number of fundamental problems in aquatic locomotion which will
also lead to insights into the design of a novel, highly-maneuverable underwater
vehicle being developed through a separate project in the Co-PI's lab. The
maneuverability and efficiency of fish is inspiring new styles of propulsion and
maneuvering in underwater vehicles for applications such as undersea exploration
and environmental monitoring. The development of such vehicles will depend on
the resolution of open issues in aquatic locomotion which will be studied here
using FuRMoRP applied to three important swimming modes and fish morphologies.
The PIs hope to answer specific questions: What is the most efficient
deformation kinematics three given fish types? How do they compare with
experimentally observed gaits? What are their comparative efficiencies? The
education plan involves developing new graduate and undergraduate courses, fluid
animations for explanation of biofluid-dynamic principles, a book project, and
international outreach. For outreach, the PIs will work with the world renowned
Shedd Aquarium in Chicago to help develop a more educational display of the
electric eels. The display will provide real-time acoustic and visual cues to
the visitors to help them appreciate some of the fluid dynamical science and
beauty of the electric eels.
