9619908 Bartels The Albion College REU Site combines laboratory studies in the
department of Geological Sciences with field research in southwestern Wyoming.
Each undergraduate project examines a tightly constrained aspect of the geology
or vertebrate paleontology of the Eocene formations of the Green River Basin in
conjunction with an on-going joint Albion College-University of Michigan
research program. These Eocene sediments and the vertebrate faunas they contain
record an interval when Rocky Mountain basins preserved a unique combination of
varied depositional environments and the interplay of modern vertebrates
replacing those that appeared after the extinction of dinosaurs 65 million years
ago. The fossil remains of animals ancestral to most modern vertebrate groups
are preserved in variety of ancient lake, lake-margin, meandering stream, and
alluvial fan deposits. Student participants, recruited from across the nation,
combine field work and sophisticated laboratory analyses with thorough report
preparation and presentation. Individual investigations are selected from topics
ranging from issues in vertebrate paleobiology to sediment geochemistry. In both
field and laboratory phases of the project, students are advised and assisted by
a diverse body of established scientists from a variety of institutions.
