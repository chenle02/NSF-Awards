9360489 Simpson Fisheries have become an increasingly more significant food
source. Currently 30% of the protein consumed by Americans comes from the sea
and this percentage is growing. Over the past decade fisheries have experienced
more regulation because of bycatch -- that portion of a fisherman's catch that
is not the primary target. Because of the increased regulation caused by
bycatch, fisheries management has become increasingly more difficult. Techniques
that can automatically and non-intrusively detect, classify, and quantify fish
populations are of intense interest to all levels of fisheries management.
Technologies are needed to improve the ability of fisheries management to
monitor the fisheries. One area that will immediately benefit the fisheries is a
more efficient and effective technique automatically to detect and classify
fish. A sonar system with these capabilities does not currently exist. The
transition of Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) sonar signal classification
technology to fisheries would be of great benefit to American Fishing fleets,
American fisheries management groups, and to our dwindling American
manufacturing base. Scientific Fishery Systems, Inc. (SFS) is developing a fish
detection and classification system that utilizes these defense technologies.
