Game theory is the study of mathematical models of strategic interaction among
rational decision-makers. This project is about analyzing large population
games, which will improve our understanding of complex systems in finance,
macro-economics and engineering that are known to be extremely difficult to
analyze. Here we will consider applications such as unemployment insurance and
better understanding of systemic risk in financial markets. Results on these
applications have a potential to help regulators with their decision making by
using these tools to conduct risk-benefit analyses. The tools developed here
will also be applicable to answering broader fundamental questions in
mathematical finance. This project will provide support and opportunities for
several graduate students and postdoctoral scholars.

There have been some exciting developments in stochastic control inspired by
finance and economics in the recent years: The analysis of Nash equilibriums of
games with large number of players each having a very little influence on the
overall system lead to the theory of mean field games. Applications now mandate
finer understanding of finite state mean field games, since these are
computationally more amenable, and heterogenous interactions between players
using random graphs. The project has broad applications such as understanding
macro-economic problems and systemic risk. The proposal will contribute to these
developments by providing some new mathematical tools and exciting new results.
In particular we propose to make advances in the following problems: Mean-field
game analysis of Unemployment Insurance; Finite State Mean Field Games with
Common Noise; Mean Field Interaction to analyze Systemic Risk in the long run;
Modeling Heterogenous Interactions among particles/agents.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
