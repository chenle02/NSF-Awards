Physical side channels pose a big threat to the security of embedded hardware.
The differential power analysis (DPA) attack is a well known side channel threat
which exploits the linear dependence of the power on the secret data or an
intermediate value correlated to the secret data through statistical model
building. This project addresses the DPA vulnerability by deploying a technology
cell library consisting of private gates. The technique developed will make
embedded hardware less vulnerable to side-channel attacks, thereby securing
private user data and transactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops
logic level and netlist level metrics to model the DPA vulnerability of a
circuit. The logic level metric, called normalized variance, is efficiently
computed for a logic network with switching probability and switched capacitance
estimation through BDDs or other methods. The project develops a more accurate
but computationally more expensive metric, which is a refinement of the
normalized variance and is deployed at circuit level.
