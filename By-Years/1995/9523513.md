9523513 Wettlaufer This project is a three-year experimental study of the
dynamics of liquid water existing at the boundaries of ice crystal at
temperatures below the freezing point of pure water. This process, called
premelting, has significant consequences in the redistributing of brine in sea
ice, the apparent migrating of contaminants through glacier ice, and the rate of
frost heave and weathering in soils and rocks. Premelting is common to virtually
all types of materials, but has been most extensively studied in ice. It may be
caused by adsorption forces, wetting, size effects, or substrate disorder, and
involves many aspects of surface physics and phase transition phenomena. The
experimental and theoretical program will include studies of ice crystal growth
and unfrozen water transport between crystals as functions of temperature and
temperature differences, as well as such studies between ice crystals and
various substrates. An important objective will be the development of useful
models for ice growth and impurity transport under natural conditions in order
to assess how grain interfaces may serve as chemical conduits. ***
