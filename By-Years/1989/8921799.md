It is proposed that the NSF provide partial support for the NAS Committee on
Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Sciences (CAMOS) for a three year period. CAMOS
provides a focus for this broad and diverse field: 1) Providing a source from
which federal agencies can obtain technical advice and assistance. 2) Conducts
and publishes studies concerning atomic, molecular and optical science and its
multidisciplinary connections to other fields. 3) Provides a forum for
discussion among atomic, molecular, and optical scientists, thereby providing a
unifying mechanism. 4) Provides an interface for communication among the atomic,
molecular, and optical science communities and federal agency program directors
who fund research.
