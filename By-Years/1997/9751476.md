Through the purchase of a new diode-array ultraviolet/visible (UV/VIS)
spectrophotometer with computer interface, this project is integrating the
concepts, practice, and specialized uses of UV/VIS spectroscopy into the 2-year
curriculum. In the general chemistry course, the instrument is being used as a
tool for learning the fundamentals of quantitative analysis and identification
and is allowing for more choices for independent laboratory projects. Students
at the organic chemistry level are taking advantage of the increased options for
the instrumental analysis components of their organic laboratory projects. The
project is also introducing non-science-students to modern instrumentation by
demonstrating its uses in a hands-on, problem-solving context. At all levels,
experiments are being devised that use the UV/VIS spectrophotometer to clearly
illustrate instrumental methods, applications, and limitations. *
