This research project will investigate the stress-strain (constitutive)
behavior of soils when subjected to earthquake loading, focusing on the
anisotropic response. Although a number of models have already been proposed,
verification of such models is difficult. This project involves a combined
analytical, computational, and experimental program to determine the
constitutive behavior. The analytical component focuses on a hierarchical model
that the principal investigator has been developing. The experimental phase of
the project will utilize a multiaxial cubical device which is capable of loading
the specimen along various loading paths. An ultrasonic method will be used to
measure the degree of anisotropy of the soil specimen. The cubical device will
be modified so that the degree of anisotropy can be measured during loading,
unloading, and reloading. An alternative to the ultrasonic method will also be
considered, namely measurement of the electrical properties of the specimen. The
above tests will first be done statically, and when verified they will then be
extended to the case of dynamic loading. This will be done with a number of
soils so as to verify the technique for a wide variety of geological materials.
Finally, the constitutive characterization will be utilized to solve typical
boundary value problems involving nonlinear soil behavior. For example, the
problem of dynamically loaded structure-foundation systems, or of a foundation
pile embedded in cohesionless soil will be considered. Then the computed
response of the structure-soil system will be compared qualitatively with
available closed-form solutions and laboratory or field data. The principal
investigator has an international reputation in the formulation of the
constitutive behavior of geological materials. He has the expertise and the
institutional facilities available to successfully complete the research
proposed.
