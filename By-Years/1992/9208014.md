Dispersal is a major life history characteristic composed of many interacting
traits. Most arguments about the evolution of dispersal patterns assume that
there is significant genetic variation for these traits and genetically covary
with other traits that are influenced by natural selection. A major difficulty
in understanding the evolution of dispersal patterns has been the inability to
quantify individual differences in those biological parameters contributing to
dispersal potential. In the marine slipper snail, Crepidula fornicata, the
principal biological trait governing dispersal capacity is the duration of a
free-swimming larval stage. Larval of Crepidula must develop in the plankton for
one to several weeks before becoming capable of metamorphosing to the sedentary
juvenile stage. This period of obligatory dispersal can now be quantified for
individual larvae. We propose to determine the quantitative genetic covariance
with other larval and post-metamorphic traits that have been previously proposed
to influence the development of metamorphic competence and fitness variation. We
will specifically test the hypothesis that dispersal capacity may evolve through
its genetic correlation with other traits that are subject to natural selection.
