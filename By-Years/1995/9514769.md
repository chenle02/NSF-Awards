Moore 9514769 There are marked anatomical differences in the central nervous
systems of males and females. It appears that the gonadal hormone environment
may play a substantial and integral role in the development of these
differences. However, a component of structural differences also appears
dependent on external stimuli received during development of the central nervous
system. Dr. Moore is investigating the interrelationship of factors involved in
developing differences in the central nervous system. The studies involve
manipulation of the gonadal hormone mixture and the environmental experiences
young animals encounter. The influence of these changes on anatomical
characteristics of the nervous system are probed using sophisticated
neuroanatomical techniques. These investigations will provide significant
information about the factors important for the development of the nervous
system. Additionally, information about the role of external environmental
factors on the nervous system will also be defined. This information is crucial
to understanding the ability of species to survive in the wild and reproduce
successfully, and ultimately thrive in their natural habitats.
