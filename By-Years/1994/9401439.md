9401439 Roemmich The deep water mass exchange between the South and North
Pacific through the Samoan passage will be quantified by conducting an
hydrographic line between Fiji and Tahiti across the Samoan passage and the
Pehring basin. Water temperature, salinity, nutrients and dissolved oxygen will
be extracted from water samples collected every 30 nautical miles. This
experiment is a component of the one-time hydrographic survey of the World Ocean
Circulation Experiment (WOCE).
