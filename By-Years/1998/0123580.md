A three-day workshop on "Separability of cognitive functions: What can be
learned from Williams Syndrome?" will be held in late August of 2001. The
workshop is designed to encourage researchers in the Five Colleges and other
colleges in New England the the North East states to engage in research
involving young people with Williams syndrome. Its secondary goal is to bring
the Berkshire Hills Music Academy facility and its future potential for
facilitating research to the attention of the world-wide community of Williams
researchers. A third goal is to promote the exchange of ideas among researchers
with various kinds of expertise in Williams syndrome. All three goals are
directed to the larger objective of understanding the diwssociations among
cognitive abilities exhibited by Williams syndrome people and exploring their
implications for the basic structure of human cognition and the interconnections
among distinct cognitive abilities
