The Department of Chemistry is purchasing an instrument package including a high
performance liquid chromatograph equipped with a diode array spectrophotometric
detector, data station and printer. This HPLC is to be integrated into
analytical and synthetic laboratory courses. Applications of this fundamental
capability are to be extended into virtually every field of inquiry in the
curriculum where quantitative measurements are required. New instructional
materials and laboratory experiments are to be developed to facilitate student
understanding of this technology. Applications of HPLC suitable to a local high
school teacher's workshop also are to be implemented.
