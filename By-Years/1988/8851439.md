This project enhances the digital controls offerings at this institution. Using
the laboratory funded by this award, undergraduate electrical engineering
students study theoretical and practical principals of automatic controls,
discrete time control systems and digital signal processing. The equipment
supporting this lab includes: TMS32010 Evaluation Modules with analog interface
boards, macro assembler/linker, simulators, Hiitachi V-1100A oscilloscopes, IBM
PS/2 PC's and Epsom printers. This award is being matched by an equal sum from
the grantee.
