A smart grid is made possible by applying sensing, measurement and control
devices with two-way communications to electricity production, transmission,
distribution, and consumption parts of the power grid that communicate
information about grid condition to system users, operators and automated
devices, making it possible to dynamically respond to changes in grid condition.
A smart grid is eventually a wireless hybrid network, and its capacity and
achievability are studied. An information theoretic approach for multiple access
channels is applied to increase the throughput capacity, and three tasks are
studied: 1) smart grid versus smart home, 2) square network versus smart grid
network, and 3) base stations with antenna array. The achievability of the
capacity is studied via analyzing the rate of smart grid which consists of
multimodal sensors/meters. Different sensor modalities may be independent or
dependent, and some preliminary fundamental results are derived and are
subsequently applied to smart grid wireless network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One
study conducted by the US Department of Energy concludes that internal
modernization of US grids with smart grid capabilities would save between 46 and
117 billion dollars over the next 20 years. With the segments set to benefit the
most will be smart metering hardware sellers and makers of software used to
transmit and organize the massive amount of data collected by meters. The
capacity study performed in this project provides the upper bound for the smart
grid to transmit the massive amount of data, and the achievability study
provides an efficient way to organize the massive amount of data collected by
meters.
