9314564 Kadko The author proposes to test the hypothesis that an increase in 3-
He/heat, following a megaplume event, reflects rapid degassing of a newly-
permeable system, after which conditions should return to equilibrium with
gradual precipitation of minerals and longer residence time of waters. He will
use radioisotope tracers in vent fluids to be collected at the northern Cleft
Segment of Juan de Fuca Ridge, which will be compared with data from 1990. There
will also be a test deployment of a gamma detector to be used as a monitoring
device.
