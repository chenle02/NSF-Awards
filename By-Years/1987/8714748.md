The objective of this project is to develop a research proposal on "The
Development of Gender, Race, and Ethnicity Concepts in Young Children." The
planning activities will include collaboration with well established researchers
in the field to strengthen the principal investigator's research background and
to improve her publication record. Support of this project will assist a well
trained black psychologist to improve her research techniques and to complete
the planning and development of a regular MRI proposal. The planning activities,
if successful, will significantly enhance the potential of the investigator to
compete for regular MRI and other research support.
