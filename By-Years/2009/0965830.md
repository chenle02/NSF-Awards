This project is implementing Mathematics Scholars 2015 (MS 2015) to enroll
twenty eight (28) achieving, but financially needy incoming freshman and current
students, as full-time Mathematics majors who are pursuing an associate degree
in Mathematics. The goal is to increase the numbers of Mathematics scholars who
enter the workforce or transfer to a university following completion of an
associate degree. Project objectives include: (1) recruit, select and award
eligible MS 2015 Scholars with scholarships, (2) retain MS 2015 Scholars
utilizing enrichment activities including study group sessions, scholars hour,
faculty mentoring, academic advising, attendance at conferences, internships,
and field trips with university and industry partners, and (3) ensure Scholars
enrolled in MS 2015 earn an associate degree and either secure employment with
the support of the College career placement services, or pursue a baccalaureate
degree with support of the College Transfer Services. Scholars also have the
opportunity to gain real life experiences in STEM fields through Research
Experiences for Undergraduates (REU)/Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority
Participation (LSAMP), employer job shadowing, and internships. The project
targets primarily underrepresented groups. Project results are widely
disseminated to share results and emerging innovations.
