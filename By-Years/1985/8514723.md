This research program will use a new application of the microwave Hall-effect to
probe the physics and chemistry of very small metal particles on non-metallic
supports. This catalyst class is of interest for a wide variety of chemical
synthesis. The results of this investigation are expected to produce a unique
method to measure electronic properties of supported metal catalysts, and to
make other contributions to the science of catalysis including: an ;itin situ;ro
method that allows data determination under a range of operating conditions;
data on the alloy effects when two or more metals are present as small clusters
on non-metallic supports; a new method to characterize bulk catalysts; and new
evidence to help understand the detailed mechanisms of strong metal support
interaction.
