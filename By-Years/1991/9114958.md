Research will be carried out in high energy electron scattering at SLAC. The
principal focus will be on experiments which probe the quark substructure of
nucleons and few nucleon systems. Part of the research activities will be to
coordinate the Nuclear Physics at the SLAC program and facilitate experiments in
SLAC End Station A.
