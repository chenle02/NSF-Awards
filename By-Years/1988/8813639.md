Recent breakthroughs in signal processing based on higher-order or polyspectra
have been initially applied to deconvolution, array processing, signal
detection, and identification of nonlinear, nonminimum phase systems.
Previously, conventional signal processing techniques only permitted the
recovery of minimum phase system descriptions, which were often not accurate.
This one-of-a-kind workshop was organized to exploit the above theoretical
breakthrough and encourage both further experience with practical application
and further development of the associated theory. The NSF support will be used
to defray the travel costs of both U.S. and foreign participants, whose
attendance is deemed essential to the workshop's success. A grant award of $5000
from the CSP program is recommended.
