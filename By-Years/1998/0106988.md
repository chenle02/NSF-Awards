Extending The Understandings of Consequence Project: Investigating Transfer and
Persistence &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scientifically accepted explanations often
require students to structure knowledge in ways that contradict their
expectations about the nature of how causes and effects behave. Such
explanations can involve: causal mechanisms that are inferred or abstract;
causal patterns that extend beyond linear and unidirectional to cyclic,
reciprocal, and non-sequential; correspondences between causes and effects that
are in various respects probabilistic; and causal agents that are decentralized
and involve aspects of emergence. These are ways of thinking and abstractions
students typically are not familiar with. "The Understandings of Consequence
Project" revealed that students and scientists' explanations tend to have very
different types of causal structures at the core. The project demonstrated that
impacting students' assumptions about the nature of causality is a promising
approach for helping students restructure their knowledge and achieve scientific
understandings. However, there are lingering questions to be answered, such as
the transferability of learning about causal forms in one topic to another and
the persistence of the subsequent restructuring. The current project extends
"The Understandings of Consequence Project" to systematically investigate these
questions. We will assess the transfer of understanding of causal forms to
topics with isomorphic and non-isomorphic causal forms and to science learning
more generally. The impact of minimal levels of student-focused and teacher-
directed transfer support will be assessed. Persistence of learning will be
examined later in the same school year and again two years later. Findings will
result in revisions to the Understandings of Consequence curriculum units. This
research has the potential to impact how deeply and lastingly all students learn
science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
