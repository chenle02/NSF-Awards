Normal faults play a major role in stretching the earth?s crust and generating
earthquakes, yet their mechanics are poorly understood. Determining their
strength, seismogenic potential, and why some may slip rapidly or accumulate
large displacements are key to understanding not only rifted plate margins -
with their associated mineral resources and earthquake hazard - but also basic
fault mechanics. Rock deformation experiments predict that normal faults should
initiate at steep dips of about 60-70ยบ and that they should frictionally lock up
at dips less than 30-45ยบ. However, geologists have long observed major low-angle
normal faults in the rock record. This observation and the lack of normal fault
earthquakes with dips less than 30-45ยบ suggest that natural faults may be weaker
than experiments indicate. Resolving this apparent mechanical paradox remains at
the center of a debate about the strength of mature faults. To address the
mysteries of slip on low-angle normal faults, this multi-disciplinary study of
the best-exposed and fastest slipping of the few active examples known on Earth,
the Mai'iu Fault in the Woodlark Rift of Papua New Guinea, uses GPS,
thermochronometric, structural geologic and geomorphic observations, and
modeling to test current ideas of low-angle fault mechanics. The project would
advance desired societal outcomes through: (1) full participation of women in
STEM; (2) increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with
science and technology through outreach to Papua New Guinea native populations;
(3) development of a globally competitive STEM workforce through the training of
graduate students; and (4) increased partnerships through international
collaboration with New Zealand scientists. The project is supported by the
Tectonics Program and NSF's International Science and Engineering
program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the world's fastest slipping active low-angle
normal fault, the Mai'iu fault represents a world class opportunity to resolve
controversies regarding the mechanics and evolution of low-angle normal faults.
The Mai'iu Fault slips at 6-10 mm/year, and its smooth, domal surface is exposed
in the landscape for more than 20 km, yielding a rare natural laboratory of an
active and rapidly slipping low-angle normal fault in a continental rift.
Through multidisciplinary data acquisition and modeling efforts, the University
of Texas team in collaboration with New Zealand scientists will address the
following hypotheses: (1) slip on low-angle normal faults can occur at cm/year
rates on intrinsically weak planes; (2) slip on low-angle normal faults can
occur by aseismic creep; (3) low-angle normal faults undergo temporal variations
in slip rate; and (4) normal faults on the continents can acquire large
displacements through the rolling hinge process. The research team employs: (1)
campaign GPS to determine contemporary slip rates and whether or not the fault
is creeping or locked; (2) geochronology and thermochronology ((U-Th)/He,
fission track, multi-diffusion domain K-feldspar 40Ar/39Ar) to evaluate the
evolution of low-angle normal faults, and variations in exhumation/slip rates
through time; (3) cosmogenic radionuclide studies to evaluate Quaternary slip
rates of the Mai'iu Fault; (4) structural geology to identify slip mechanisms on
the fault and structural evolution of the dome; and (5) geodynamical modeling to
integrate and interpret the various data sets.
