This research will focus on development of neuron-to-neuron synapses and will
be aimed at testing the validity of neuromuscular junctions as a model for
neuron-to-neuron synapses. Specifically, motoneurons will be isolated from
embryonic or young post-natal rats, using a flourescence-activated cell sorter,
and will be grown in culture with neurons that should and neurons that should
not form synapses onto them. The presence of synapses will be ascertained
electrophysically and immunocytochemically. The numbers and subcellular
distributions of two types of neurotransmitter receptors (those for a peptide,
substance P, and an amino acid, glycine) will be monitored, and the effects of
the presence of other neurons and of formation of synapses will be determined.
Particular attention will be given to whether inducers of different types of
receptors acting on the same neuron combine in a linearly additive or
synergistic manner. A working hypothesis for this work is that changes in
subcellular distributions of receptors will be more prominent in neuron-to-
neuron synaptogenesis than will effects on total receptor number.
