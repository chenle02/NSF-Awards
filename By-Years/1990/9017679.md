The objective of this project is to study the dynamic response of soils that
have previously been subjected to anisotropic consolidation stresses. A
comprehensive testing program will be carried out using a resonant column
device. A parametric study of the factors which influence the response of each
of the soils tested will be performed. As a result, general guidelines along
with empirical mathematical models are hoped to be developed which will enhance
the engineer's knowledge in designing foundations under such soil conditions.
This study will focus on the shear moduli and damping characteristics of
anisotropic soils.
