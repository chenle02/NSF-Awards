In this project, the American Crystallographic Association will develop a
curriculum for and conduct a pilot experimental short course in the
determination of the crystal structures of small and medium-sized molecules. The
course, intended for beginning crystallographers, will emphasize hands-on
experience and will lead to an increase the reservoir of crystallographic
expertise available to the U.S. scientific community. A set of lecture and
laboratory notes will be produced and made available to chemistry and biology
departments that wish to offer a similar introductory crystallography course.
%%% With this award, the Chemistry Division and the Division of Instrumentation
&amp; Resourses will support a Course for Novice Crystallographers proposed by
Dr. Bryan M. Craven of the Department of Chemistry at the University of
Pittsburgh. The course will be offered to beginning crystallographers by the
American Crystallographic Association. The notes produced from the pilot
experimental short course will be made available for wide dissemination to
chemistry and biology departments.
