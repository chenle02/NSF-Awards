The challenge in logic programming is to offer a system that provides the
opportunity to ensure correctness of programs (by executing formal logic
specifications) without sacrificing efficiency (by allowing specification of
control). Their project is to design and implement an environment for the
development and execution of logic programs, maintaining and utilizing control
information specified separately from the logic of the programs. The benefits of
maintaining separate logic and control information include readability of the
programs, the ability to make best use of the underlying hardware by changing
the control specification without affecting the partial correctness of the
programs, and portability of the logic specifications. The proposed system is
unique in that most logic programming languages/systems sacrifice the
correctness of the declarative logic semantics in favor of the efficiency gained
by embedding the control information in the logic program itself.
