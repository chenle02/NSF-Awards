The proposed research is concerned with classical and semiclassical theories of
molecular bound states and intramolecular dynamics. Many new experimental
techniques are now able to probe the properties of highly excited molecular
vibrational and vibration-rotation states in unprecedented detail, and the
interpretation of such experiments poses severe challeges for theory. The
present work aims to address these theoretical problems via unified treatment of
the spectroscopy and dynamics of highly excited states. Practical and efficient
methods for semiclassical quantization of multidimensional systems are to be
developed, and these and other methods will be applied to studying the statics
and dynamics of small molecules of current experimental interest. The
significance of this basic research in Theoretical and Computational Chemistry
lies in its contribution to a detailed understanding of the way in which energy
flows within a molecule and the consequences of these details for knowing which
bonds will break in a chemical reaction.
