While the traditional design and analysis of algorithms assumes that complete
knowledge of the entire input is available to the algorithm, the area of online
algorithms deals with the case where the input is revealed in parts, and the
online algorithm is required to respond to each new part immediately upon
arrival, without knowledge of the future. Previous decisions of the online
algorithm cannot be revoked. Thus, the main issue in online computation is
obtaining good performance in the face of uncertainty, since the future is
unknown to the algorithm. The problems in this setting arise in all of computer
science, as well in much of sequential decision-making, machine learning, and
many other areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is focused on a
deeper investigation of the primal-dual approach to online algorithm design. The
topics investigated in this project are (a) extending the success of linear
optimization to the convex case, (b) relaxing monotonicity of the variables and
developing principled approaches for algorithms with preemption, and (c)
understanding the connection of online primal-dual approaches and online machine
learning algorithms. As part of the broader impact, the research is likely to
lead to better algorithms for a variety of problems both in traditional
algorithm design and in other areas like machine learning and algorithmic game
theory.
