This U.S.-Brazil award supports Dr. Claudio T. Silva and co-workers at the
University of Utah to collaborate with Dr. Luiz Velho at the VISGRAF Laboratory
at Instituto de Matematica Pura e Aplicada in Rio de Janeiro as well as
colleagues from Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil in the area of
visualization and 3D modeling of large-scale data sets. In this project the
researchers will develop tools that can handle very large real-world data in the
context of the modeling and rendering of 3D environments and scientific
visualization. The resulting artifacts, algorithms, and tools for modeling and
visualization will be shared with the research
community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The acquisition, management, and visualization
of very large data sets of the type proposed here are becoming very important
components of scientific research in a number of areas. This project leverages
the expertise of the groups from both the U.S. and Brazil and will enhance the
end-to-end understanding of data acquisition, processing, management, and
interactive visualization. The results of this project will have a high impact
on all the related disciplines that need visualization and suffer from problems
in managing very large data sets.&lt;br/&gt;
