Osmotic Regulation in Freshwater and Salt Tolerant Charophyte Algae: Salt
tolerance is important in determining the natural distribution of plants and in
determining yield of agricultural crop plants in saline soils which are
naturally saline or arise from irrigation. Algae provide a model system for
studying salt tolerance, because stresses can be applied more precisely and
responses can be analyzed in more detail. Two closely related species of
Charophyte algae differ in their salt tolerance: Chara corallina is a freshwater
alga that does not regulate its turgor; C. buckellii is salt tolerant and is
able to regulate turgor. By studying the difference between these species these
studies will elucidate the mechanism of turgor regulation. The research
objectives are to further characterize the difference between the two species
with respect to their ability to regulate turgor and withstand high salt
concentration, using survivorship, membrane potentials, and ion composition; to
identify transport systems important to turgor regulation using patch clamp and
to isolate and characterize the H+-ATPase of the plasmalemma which may provide
energy for transport systems.
