Professor Qin will work in the general area of algebraic &lt;br/&gt;geometry and
its interplay with representation theory and &lt;br/&gt;string theory. The main
tools are the Hilbert schemes of &lt;br/&gt;points on projective surfaces,
techniques of vertex algebras, &lt;br/&gt;quantum cohomology, the moduli spaces
of Gieseker semistable &lt;br/&gt;bundles on surfaces, and the holomorphic
Casson invariants &lt;br/&gt;for Calabi-Yau three folds. The investigation
should increase &lt;br/&gt;the knowledge about the relations among Hilbert
schemes, vertex &lt;br/&gt;algebras and quantum cohomology, and shed light on
stable &lt;br/&gt;bundles over Calabi-Yau three folds and the S-duality
conjecture &lt;br/&gt;from physics in the form formulated by Vafa and
Witten.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Algebraic geometry studies geometric objects
described by&lt;br/&gt;polynomial equations. It has been at the central
stage&lt;br/&gt;of recent confluence between mathematics and
physics.&lt;br/&gt;Many of these interactions have led to profound improvement
in&lt;br/&gt;the understanding of both mathematics and
physics.&lt;br/&gt;Professor Qin's research areas provide solid mathematical
&lt;br/&gt;foundation to the physics theories which are vital to explain
&lt;br/&gt;the universe.&lt;br/&gt;
