John Shareshian plans to work on four projects. He will continue joint work with
Michelle Wachs involving the use of quasisymmetric functions in various
combinatorial, geometric and representation theoretic settings. The current main
goal of this project is to show that the Frobenius characteristic of a
representation of the symmetric group on the cohomology of a regular semisimple
Hessenberg variety is a refinement of the chromatic symmetric function of a
graph naturally associated to the variety. Shareshian will continue joint work
with Russ Woodroofe, in which two problems are studied. The first problem is to
show that the order complex of the coset poset of a finite group is never
contractible. This problem has been reduced by Shareshian and Woodroofe to a
problem about prime divisors of indices of maximal subgroups of alternating
groups. The second problem is to develop a nongraded analog of Richard Stanley's
theory of supersolvable lattices. The main goal is to find a theory that both
encompasses the already well-studied theory of left modular lattices and
provides a better understanding of combinatorial properties of subgroup lattices
of finite solvable groups. Finally, Shareshian will attempt to settle a problem
in topological combinatorics raised by Michael Aschbacher and Stephen Smith in
their work on the Quillen Conjecture about the partially ordered set of
p-subgroups of a finite group.

Shareshian studies connections between three areas of mathematics, namely,
combinatorics, group theory and geometry. Combinatorialists study discrete,
usually finite, structures, often attempting to enumerate all such structures
satisfying a given condition. Combinatorial problems arise naturally in various
areas of intellectual inquiry, including mathematics, computer science, physics
and biology. Group theorists study symmetry by encoding the symmetries of an
object by an algebraic system, called a group. Since humans are naturally drawn
to highly symmetric objects and use symmetry to understand many scientific and
aesthetic phenomena, group theory is ubiquitous. It appears, for example, in
many problems from physics and chemistry. Geometers study shapes. These shapes
might live in spaces of high dimension and therefore be inaccessible to
understanding through visualization. Mathematicians often attempt to understand
such shapes by associating to them algebraic systems in a way that provides
useful information. In some cases, these algebraic systems are best understood
by associating to them combinatorial objects that encode the algebraic
information relevant to the geometric problem at hand. Shareshian examines
combinatorial objects arising in this manner.
