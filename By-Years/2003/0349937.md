&lt;br/&gt;In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry
Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Bierbaum will conduct research on
gas-phase ion chemistry and thermochemistry. The project consists of two sub-
areas: 1) Fundamental studies will be carried out on ion thermochemistry and
reaction mechanisms and, 2) applications of chemical ionization mass
spectrometry (CIMS) will be further developed. The first of these is composed of
five individual studies on a) the thermochemistry of metal atoms, b) the
thermochemistry of biologically relevant anions, c) the thermochemistry of
anions generated from cyclopentanone, d) the thermochemistry of pentalene, and
e) the thermochemistry and mechanisms in the reactions of nitrogen and oxygen
atoms. The second sub-area is concerned with a) the CIMS detection of
formaldehyde synthesis induced by fluoroquinolones and b) the CIMS detection of
nitro compounds related to explosives. Several additional tasks are planned that
will be carried out in collaboration with colleagues from several institutions.
This research is carried out with postdoctoral research associates, and graduate
and undergraduate students, including women and underrepresented minorities.
These participants will receive advanced training in the area of gas-phase ion
chemistry that will prepare them for productive careers in industry, academia,
or the government sectors of American science and technology.&lt;br/&gt;
