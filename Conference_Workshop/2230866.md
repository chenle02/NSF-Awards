The Southern Regional Council on Statistics (SRCOS) is a consortium of
statistics and biostatistics programs in the South, with member programs at 45
universities in 16 states in the region. This grant provides support for
graduate and undergraduate students to participate in the 57th annual SRCOS
Summer Research Conference (SRC) in statistics and biostatistics, held in Jekyll
Island, Georgia on October 2-5, 2022. The purpose of the conference is to
encourage interchange and mutual understanding of current research ideas in
statistics and biostatistics and to provide motivation and direction to further
research progress. The SRC is particularly valuable for graduate students,
undergraduate students, isolated statisticians, and faculty from smaller
regional schools in the southern region within driving distance. The meeting
provides an opportunity for young researchers to interact closely with leaders
in the field in a manner not possible at larger meetings.

Speakers will present formal research talks with adequate time allowed for
clarification, amplification, and further informal discussions in small groups.
Under the travel support provided by this award, graduate students will attend
and present their research in posters to be reviewed by more experienced
researchers. In addition, the meeting will also include the annual Statistical
Undergraduate Research Experience (SURE), a conference within a conference aimed
to encourage the participation of undergraduate students from under-represented
groups to pursue graduate education and career opportunities in STEM fields.
SURE will include events specifically for undergraduate students and
undergraduate mentors, such as a panel about career opportunities in statistics,
a ?Real Data Analytics Workshop,? and a speed-mentoring session with current
statistics and biostatistics graduate students. This award will support SURE,
encouraging under-represented students to enter STEM fields and providing
training to support this endeavor. More information about the conference can be
found at the website: https://www.srcos.org/conference.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
