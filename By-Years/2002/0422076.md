This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II research project will
develop a miniaturized gas analyzer for use in industrial process control, fault
detection and monitoring. The gas analyzer proposed here would be able to
identify the chemical components of the gas and quantify their partial pressures
down to part-per-million (ppm) levels. It will be sensitive to a range of gas
species, and be small, have low power consumption and low
cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this research project will be
to advance the nation's scientific and intellectual knowledge base by developing
and demonstrating novel plasma emission sources and their applications. It will
advance the nation's economic competitiveness by enhancing industrial
productivity and the ability of the US semiconductor capital equipment industry
to compete worldwide. &lt;br/&gt;
