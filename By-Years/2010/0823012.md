This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to develop
an unique hot press die casting technology to be used to produce graphite-metal
materials. These materials will be used to produce packaging components for use
in high power electronics packaging. There is a critical need for advanced
materials with improved thermal properties capable of meeting the thermal
management requirements of current and future high power electronic systems. The
heat dissipation rate of electronic systems has increased dramatically, as a
result of ongoing advances in semiconductor materials, compression of circuit
physical architecture, size reduction of packaging envelops and faster switching
speed. The technology developed in this project will enable the manufacture of
cost effective graphite-metal packaging that offers improved thermal properties
critical to thermal management solutions for next generation power electronics.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project
will be the development of the hot press die casting technology for use in
producing graphite-metal billet materials. The adoption and wide-spread use of
the graphite-metal packaging products for electronic systems will enable
commercial electronic devices based upon more efficient higher power
semiconductor materials that will provide benefit to society in the form of more
efficient, longer life electronics; reduced energy consumption; and improved
environmental quality.
