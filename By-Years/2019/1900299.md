With this award, the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Division of Chemistry is
supporting the research of Professor Aaron Aponick of the Department of
Chemistry at the University of Florida. The project focuses on the design of new
kinds metal-containing complexes used in the synthesis of organic compounds used
in agriculture, clean energy technologies and pharmaceuticals. The chemical
industry relies on such reactions as means of producing new compounds and
materials more easily than classical reaction chemistry (with less energy, time
or required separations). The team led by Professor Aponick is developing
catalysts that show promise for the applications in advanced manufacturing. This
project also provides hands-on training for students. Public outreach is
achieved by public lectures at the University of Florida. Public outreach also
includes Chemistry Day at the Mall, Molecular Mania. This event is popular with
children and fosters interactions with the public in general. Many visitors with
diverse socioeconomic
backgrounds&lt;br/&gt;participate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Chemical Synthesis
Program of the Division of Chemistry is supporting the research of Professor
Aaron Aponick of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Florida who is
developing a new class of ligands for homogeneous catalysis. His "P-N" ligands
incorporates imidazole substituents in an atropisomeric chiral biaryl backbone.
Many P,N-ligands are known, but Professor Aponick's imidazole-based systems
exhibit distinctive and often superior catalytic behavior. A major aim of the
research is to elucidate the principles underpinning the reactivity and
selectivity imparted by this modular ligand platform. Mechanistic studies are
being employed to provide a fundamental understanding of the organometallic
chemistry. The Aponick group is utilizing kinetic and crystallographic studies
to interrogate how the coordination chemistry of these so-called Stack-ligands
influences the catalytic activity. Further studies utilize the more basic and
geometrically constrained imidazole moiety to enable new reactions that rely on
what appears to be a bifunctional and hemilabile coordination motif. With this
strategy, new enantioselective copper- and palladium-catalyzed reactions are
being developed. This research program is providing hands-on training for
students. Their professional development is emphasized in all aspects of the
work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
