This award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research program supports the
acquisition of a Digital Instruments Dimension 3100 Scanned Probe Microscope
(SPM) System with a NanoScope IV Controller. This instrument will be placed in a
central facility to be employed in the research of dozens of undergraduate and
graduate students from many departments at Cornell. It will also be used by
Cornell nanotechnology classes, K-12 tours, and outside users. The microscope
will enable new research directions dealing with nanoscale electrical devices,
nanoscale chemical modification, polymer dynamics near surfaces, the development
of new types of scanning microscopy, and biomaterials characterization. It will
take the place of an older SPM that will be relocated to Simmons College, a
women's college in Boston, to be used in undergraduate research aimed at
developing polymer materials for organic light-emitting diodes.
&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;This award from the Instrumentation for Materials
Research program supports the acquisition of a Digital Instruments Dimension
3100 Scanned Probe Microscope (SPM) System, which will be placed in a central
facility for use by dozens of undergraduate and graduate students in projects
that require imaging samples with nanometer-scale resolution. For example, it
will be used to examine molecular-scale electronic devices while they are in
operation, the atom-by-atom processes by which chemicals can sculpt surfaces,
and the self-assembly of biological materials. The microscope will also be
employed by Cornell nanotechnology classes, visiting high-school teachers and
students, and outside users. It will take the place of an older scanned-probe
microscope that will be relocated to Simmons College, a women's college in
Boston, Massachusetts. This will provide students at Simmons and nearby colleges
the opportunity to work with a research-quality instrument as they are
encouraged to consider technical careers.&lt;br/&gt;
