This project will sustain and enhance a national repository of traces that
capture usage of file-systems, storage and input/outputs with the goal of
helping researchers to address performance bottlenecks. As part of ongoing
activities, new tools essential to the successful use of traces will be added.
Also, new mirror sites are planned to expand efficiency and utility of the trace
repository. The national repository of file systems traces is of immense
importance to the software engineering community. By updating the traces for the
new and emerging applications, this project provides a vital service to this
community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Disk based file system is a performance
bottleneck for many computer applications. Thus, it is useful to have a set of
activity traces for storage systems to understand the access characteristics.
Such traces may potentially help optimize flash-based solid-state storage and
other emerging non-volatile memory based storage technologies. As the storage
technologies evolve with network storage, cloud-based storage, Geo-replicated
storage, the trace repository provides a set of targets for storage systems
optimization.
