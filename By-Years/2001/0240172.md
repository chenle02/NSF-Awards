Abstract&lt;br/&gt;CHE-0240172&lt;br/&gt;Shultz/Tufts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
research project, with the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
Program, addresses the detailed structure of the ice surface. Using the
adsorption of several probe molecules combined with sum frequency generation
studies of the vibrational spectroscopy of the ice surface, the location and
mobility of hydrogen atoms on the ice surface will be determined. Professor
Shultz and her coworkers in the Department of Chemistry at Tufts University will
examine the basic structure and reactivity of the single crystal ice surface.
This information will be useful for developing a basic understanding of the
chemistry of ice surfaces, important in planetary atmospheres, terrestrial
meteorology, and stratospheric chemical kinetics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using
the technique of sum frequency generation spectroscopy, Professor Shultz and her
group at Tufts University are examining the surface of well characterized ice
crystals. By examining the interaction of the ice surface with various probe
molecules, the location and motion of hydrogen atoms on the ice surface will be
determined. The basic information obtained from these studies is relevant to
tropospheric and stratospheric molecule transport and reaction. &lt;br/&gt;
