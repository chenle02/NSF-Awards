9508085 Evans Under this CAREER award, Dr. Evans will examine the relationship
between tropical convection and the large-scale circulation. It has long been
hypothesized that the transports of heat, moisture and momentum from the tropics
to the extratropics, accomplished by tropical convection, maintain the general
circulation. Dr. Evans further suggests that the degree to which the convection
is organized is determined by what is required to maintain the general
circulation, with highly organized systems playing a large, and necessary, role
in maintaining the Earth's energy balance. Using satellite-based observations,
Dr. Evans will classify various types of tropical convective systems ranging
from short-lived, disorganized convection to highly organized tropical cyclones
and mesoscale convective complexes, and then assess their impact on the general
circulation by analyzing the momentum and energy fluxes. The analyses will
employ the gridded fields produced by the European Centre for Medium Range
Forecasting for a recent field experiment in the tropical Pacific. Dr. Evans'
educational program will focus on the recruitment and retention of talented
women at the graduate and undergraduate level, primarily through her work with
the Women in Science and Engineering Institute at Penn State. She also will
develop a new course on climate modeling which will include special emphasis on
current controversial topics related to climate systems study and modeling. ***
