This project is initiating a community of undergraduate and graduate scholars in
electrical, civil and industrial engineering that is focused on academic
achievement and supports the goals of the S-STEM program. The project addresses
the significant challenge of retention of students with financial need in
engineering. The goals of the Scholars in Engineering program are to 1)
cultivate a focus on academic excellence in early-stage bachelor's and master's
students, 2) improve student retention and degree completion, 3) enhance student
retention and support programs in the school of engineering, 4) improve graduate
school or career preparation and placement. The program involves two cohorts of
approximately 11 undergraduates each and five cohorts of about four graduate
students each. The student community is being cultivated through academic
monitoring, mentoring, professional development and community building
activities. Two kinds of mentoring relationships are being encouraged: peer
mentoring between the graduate and undergraduate students and hierarchical
mentoring between faculty and graduate students to support community building,
encourage academic excellence and increase career preparation. In addition to
financial need and citizenship criteria, other selection factors include
academic performance, motivation, and calculus I enrollment
(undergraduates).&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The intellectual
merit of this proposal is two-fold. First, the development of an undergraduate-
graduate student, and a graduate student-faculty mentorship relationship can
improve the intellectual development of students. Second, the project helps to
produce graduates who are well grounded in their disciplines and better prepared
for success in graduate studies and beyond. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impact: The strategies can substantially improve student retention in
engineering fields, thereby increasing the engineering work force. More broadly,
the approach is a best-practice model for other engineering schools.
