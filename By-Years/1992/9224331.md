PROGRAM: Oceanographic Instrumentation The PI's request funding to purchase
shipboard instrumentation in support of NSF-funded research. The instrument will
be used aboard the R/V EWING, a 239 foot vessel, which is owned and operated by
the Observatory. Funding provided through this grant will be used to purchase a
CTD & hydro-winch monitoring system which is a safety-related item that will
benefit numerous cruises and decrease the damage or loss of instruments.
