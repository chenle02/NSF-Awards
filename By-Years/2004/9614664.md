9614664 Yin Two models for the response of Asia to the collision between Indian
and Asia are current. In the extrusion model, convergence is accommodated by
lateral extrusion of western Tibet moving out of the way to the east of the
Indian plate, whereas in the crustal thickening model invokes north-south
shortening and thickening to accommodate convergence. The active Karakorum and
Altyn Tagh faults have long been identified as candidates for the lateral
extrusion model faults. However, uncertainly about timing and magnitude of slip
on these faults has precluded quantitative evaluation of the relative importance
of lateral extrusion vs. crustal thickening tectonics. This project is a
mapping, geochronologic and paleomagnetic effort to establish slip history for
these important faults. Results are expected to provide a quantitative
evaluation of the applicability of these models for the Indo-Asian collision.
