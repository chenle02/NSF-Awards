Dr. Jonathan A. Ellman has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Ellman's doctoral degree was from Harvard University under the
supervision of Professor David Evans. Dr. Ellman intends to continue research at
the University of California at Berkeley under the sponsorship of Professor
Peter G. Schultz. Dr. Ellman's area of postdoctoral research will be site-
specific incorporation of synthetic amino acids into proteins by enzyme-
catalyzed acylation of tRNA or by chemical synthesis of aminoacyl tRNA. The
Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as an important
infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge and experience of new
Ph.D's and attract them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical
research and teaching.
