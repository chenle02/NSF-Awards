Dr. Borgia will conduct a comparative study of behavior and evolutionary
relationships among different bowerbird species. He will develop a biochemical
phylogeny of bowerbirds based on comparisons of mitochondrial DNA. In the field
he will observe and experimentally manipulate conditions for six species. This
comparative information can be used to reconstruct the historical sequence by
which complex traits evolved and to carry out novel tests of hypotheses about
the operation of choice. The proposed study represents the first attempt to use
comparisons within a group of related species to evaluate recent models for the
evolution of choice and display. This study should help provide critical
information for developing a general model. Such knowledge can have important
economic applications in pest control, game management, species preservation,
and animal breeding.
