This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial Biology for
FY2002. The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of
protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are
not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides
opportunities for a recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in
microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of
established scientists, and to broaden his/her scientific horizons beyond the
research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These
fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their
research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves
of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign
locations.

The research and training plan is entitled "Molecular analysis to identify genes
that contribute to the establishment and maintenance of a protistan symbiosis."
Little is known at the molecular level about the mechanisms underlying symbiotic
associations. This project seeks to identify the genes involved in the symbiosis
between two protistan species. Biological screens for symbiosis using
mutagenized symbionts and 2D gel electrophoresis will yield mutants or proteins,
respectively, which can be used ultimately to derive DNA sequence. The sequence
data will allow for the identification of the involved genes.
