9418520 Wasson The P.I.s propose to use the UCLA Cameca 1270 ion-microprobe and
petrographic techniques to determine the three O-isotopes in the conducting
phase magnetite present in unequilibrated chondritic meteorites in order to
obtain detailed compositional data that relate to: (1) the nebular processes
that led to the formation of the chondrites; (2) the compositions of major O
reservoirs that contributed to the solar nebula; and (3) low-grade metamorphic
processes that occurred in parent bodies. During the next year the P.I.s will
study the formation of the magnetite in unequilibrated carbonaceous (CV) and
ordinary (H, L, LL) chondrites. The P.I.s examination of many thin sections of
CV chondrites shows that magnetite is relatively common in chondrules. The P.I.s
will use the ion microprobe to determine the compositions of these magnetites on
the oxygen 3-isotope diagram relative to other CV minerals that describe a
mixing line extending from 18O values &lt;-40% along a slope of 0.94 almost to
the intersection of this line with the terrestrial fractionation line. A key
question the P.I.s hope to answer is whether this magnetite formed in the solar
nebula or during the oxidation of the CV parent body. The P.I.s' second project
will be to examine the three O isotopes in magnetite present in magnetite-
carbide assemblages in some unequilibrated ordinary chondrites. Krot discovered
a number of these assemblages while at UCLA. The origin of these
oxidized/reduced assemblages is not known; again, the possible locales are the
solar nebula and the parent body. Precise O-isotope data will provide important
constraints both on the locale and on the nature of the agent that oxidized the
Fe of the magnetite.
