Research in this program consists of a theoretical and experimental
investigation of self-focusing of ultrashort laser pulses in nonlinear
dispersive media. The studies characterize the temporal, spatial, and spectral
focusing of a femtosecond laser pulse when its peak power is above the critical
power for self-focusing. Using wide band-gap solid- state materials and high-
pressure gases as nonlinear media, a wide range of experimental conditions are
expected to be explored. One outgrowth of the research should be the
determination of the range of applicability of the three- dimensional nonlinear
Schroedinger equation to the nonlinear propagation of ultrashort pulses.
