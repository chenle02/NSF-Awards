This two-year synthesis project, led by researchers at Utah State University,
focuses on the use of scaffolding in STEM learning in formal and informal
settings. Scaffolding is support that helps students engage in and gain skill at
tasks that are beyond their unassisted capabilities. The project uses meta-
analysis to determine the influence of scaffold characteristics, study and
assessment instrument quality, and assessment type on cognitive outcomes in
K-Adult STEM education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Preparing all students to address
fundamental STEM problems is central to preparing effective citizens for the
21st century. Combined with scaffolding, inquiry-based approaches in STEM
education can lead to this goal. A current lack of a comprehensive assessment of
scaffolding characteristics hinders (a) scaffolding adoption by STEM instructors
and administrators and (b) scaffolding design by instructional designers.
