Project Abstract SES Proposal 0129823 Technology in the Making of 20th Century
Europe Thomas Misa, Illinois Institute of Technology

This proposal supports the participation of American historians of technology
in a large-scale, European-based study seeking to understand the roles of
technology in the making of European society across the 20th century. The work
undertaken focuses on conceptual and empirical research that will extend the
European project -- and which is done in close collaboration with a network of
European and North American scholars. The PIs intend the work outlined here, in
both substantive and organizational ways, to help the field of STS speak to
vital public concerns about the role of technology in society. More
specifically, the project is intended to generate new knowledge about
technology's role in 20th-century Europe, greater visibility and coherence for
European studies of technology in the U.S., and a better comparative
understanding of U.S. developments. These collaborative efforts may serve as a
model for STS research that is transnational in topic, organization, and method.

Specific activities include the following: [a] coordination and integration of
the European project as a whole, with a goal of refining concepts and methods
for conducting detailed empirical research related to "big" questions about
technology in complex historical processes; [b] work on the "cities" theme of
the larger project -- involving research, coordination, workshops, and
publications; and [c] similar work on the "colonialism" theme of the project.
The PI and co-PI are already deeply involved in the European network; through
workshops and other efforts, the project seeks to encourage broader
participation by other U.S. scholars.
