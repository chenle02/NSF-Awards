This award will provide supplementary support to enable Dr. DeMar Taylor of Old
Dominion University to conduct collaborative research with Dr. Yasuo Chinizei
for one year at Mie University in Japan. They will investigate vitellogenesis
(egg yolk protein precursor synthesis) in ticks. Dr. Chinzei's lab has recently
found an active septide from the tick brain which induces vitellogenin synthesis
in the insect's fat body. The goals of this research are to isolate the active
septide, elucidate the mechanisms of regulation of vitel- logenesis, and to
identify, the important morphological, physiological and biochemical processes
involved. Many species of ticks are of medical importance worldwide as vectors
of diseases. An understanding of vitellogenin synthesis might enable the
blockage of egg protein production by hormonal regulation, thus reducing the
number of offspring produced and ultimately controlling tick populations. Dr.
Taylor's research has concentrated on sex pheromones of disease trnasmitting
ticks. This will be complemented by Chinzei's expertise in vitellogenesis in
ticks.
