Extinction, which may be the ultimate fate of all species, has always held a
special interest for geologists and biologists, and even legislators (e.g.,
Endangered Species Act). Extinction events, when a number of species become
extinct over a geologically short period time, have always had historical
significance to Earth scientists and evolutionary biologists, as they are
conveniently used to divide up geologic time. In this project, PI and students
will examine in detail one of the earliest extinction events, at the Lower-
Middle Cambrian boundary, and help answer questions such as how sudden the event
really was, what percentage of the fauna went extinct, and whether species began
to decline in numbers prior to their extinction. The paleoenvironment in which
these early taxa lived will also be reconstructed from the type of rock that now
entombs them.
