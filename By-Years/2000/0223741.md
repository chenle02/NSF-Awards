0223741&lt;br/&gt;Alfred O Hero&lt;br/&gt;University of
Michigan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of this workshop are broad: to bring
together a multi-disciplinary group of researchers to shed light on the
important challenges, the open problems, the promising approaches, and to get a
general picture of the state of the art in areas related to pattern recognition.
Each of the eminent researchers listed below&lt;br/&gt;will present a 20 minute
talk. They come from diverse communities including: computer science, applied
math, information theory, signal processing, and statistics. There will also be
representatives from NSF-CISE, NSF-DMS, NSF-BioMed, and possibly other federal
agencies (CIA, NSA, DoD), who will be attending.
