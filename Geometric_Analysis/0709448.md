This research plan integrates several research projects of the PI, unified by
the relation to topological field theories which controls the answer to the
various questions. One project builds on the PI's structural classification
of 2-dimensional (closed string) semi-simple topological field theories, with
implications for several standing conjectures on Gromov-Witten invariants.
Beyond a careful treatement of the result and its implications, the aim is to
extend it to more general theories; this seems to relate to the factorization
properties for GW invariants (Ionel-Parker, Li) and to the structural results in
the open/closed string case (Kontsevich, Costello). A second project is the
study of gauged Gromov-Witten theory, where twisted K-theories and
representations of loop groups appear. Loop groups also feature in the third
project, pertaining to the geometric Langlands programme, where the
cohomological calculations of the PI (with E. Frenkel) offer a way forward form
the results of Beilinson-Drinfeld, toward the 'derived' version of the Langlands
correspondence. (Recent work of Gukov-Kapustin-Witten suggest a controlling
topological field theory.) Current work by the PI (with C.Woodward) extending to
Higgs bundles results of coherent cohomology previously known for principal
bundles is an important step. Other, and more speculative projects include a
study of non-semisimple 3-dimensional TFT's associated to derived categories.  

Topological Field theory is a spectacular and unforeseen application of ideas
from modern quantum physics to topology: that is the field of mathematics which,
broadly speaking, studies the properties of shapes that are stable
under continuous deformations. Previous applications of
the foundational problems of quantum physics to mathematics had
dominated development in mathematical analysis for decades, but their emergence
in topology in the 1980's came as a surprise. Crudely put, the new ideas exploit
a topological irreversibility of time flow: a topological change in space-time
can usually not be 'undone' in the future. This led to the encoding of
information in new kinds of algebraic structures (technically, they are monoids
rather than groups). The new methods succeeded in unifying existing invariants
of knots and links with those of 3-and 4-dimensional structures (manifolds). New
invariants could be defined that bear stunning relations to other fields
of mathematics which study finer, but less robust structures (algebraic geometry
and complex analysis). The PI's research focuses on instances of these
structures where, in addition, a continuous group of symmetries is present in
the system, and studies the refined structures that emerge.
