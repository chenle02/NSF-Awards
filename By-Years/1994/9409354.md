9409354 Sargent This research agenda addresses important unresolved problems in
empirical macroeconomics: aggregate consumption, asset prices, and the term
structure of returns, as well as the price level impacts of various combinations
of monetary and fiscal policy. In addition, it includes theoretical work
analyzing regime switches in a fully dynamic model and how theoretical learning
models should be integrated into empirical research. More specifically, this
project applies and extends dynamic econometric theories of consumption and
investment to include multiple durable consumption goods, habits, heterogeneity
across household "technologies," a parametric version of risk- sensitivity, and
economies with long but finitely lived overlapping generations of people. The
project studies aggregation across households with habits and tastes for
multiple durable goods both in economies with complete and incomplete markets. A
recurring theme is how permanent income types of theory continue to surface in a
variety of settings, and how they can be used econometrically. A link between
permanent income theories and econometric "dynamic index" models will be
exploited for estimation and forecasting. In an overlapping generations
application of the models, the project estimates some of the costs and benefits
that would be associated with a transition from an unfunded to a fully funded
social security system. The project also examines a class of monetary models
that promise to broaden the range of evidence than can be brought to bear on
distinguished the quantity theory of money from one of its main competitors, the
"real bills" theory.
