This RAPID project proposes a model for preparing K-12 teachers to implement the
new Framework for next generation science standards. The model is based on
current evidence of effective professional development in disciplinary content
and will also develop evidence in a rapid fashion about its potential
effectiveness that will be used to refine and improve the model in time for it
to be disseminated widely to networks of teacher educators, curriculum leaders
and others as states begin to adopt the new
standards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically the model will support teachers in
developing understanding of "core ideas" and how to blend core ideas with
scientific practices and crosscutting concepts to develop learning goals; modify
existing materials; and developing learning tasks and assessment measures that
meet learning goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The recently released National
Research Council Framework for K-12 science education provides the basis for
standards development. It is anticipated that Achieve will take about a year to
develop the standards. This project will develop, test, and refine a model of
professional development related to the standards that will be one of the
factors essential to successful implementation.
