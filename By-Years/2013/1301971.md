Graduate studies are often funded by university supported teaching
assistantships, research assistantships, fellowships and federal student aid
programs. Traditionally, funding for master?s level graduate education has been
limited, and students often have to fund their own education; making a full-time
commitment to academics and research cost prohibitive. North Carolina
Agricultural and Technical State University (NCA&amp;T), a historically black
college and land-grant university, is one of four Ph.D. granting institutions
within the NCLSAMP Alliance, and leads the University of North Carolina (UNC)
System in the production of STEM degrees (Evans, 2012). The overall goal of the
BD Fellowship Program at NCA&amp;T is to increase the number of science and
engineering majors who pursue PhDs in STEM fields. Specific objectives are to:
1) Recruit a cadre of STEM graduate students who have the potential for academic
success, and the desire to pursue a STEM PhD.; 2) Provide academic development
workshops, financial support, and experiences to promote the retention of
participants; and 3) Assist students in their transition to graduate studies and
ultimately the PhD. &lt;br/&gt;Utilizing strategic initiatives aligned with the
North Carolina A&amp;T Strategic Plan, ?Preeminence 2020?, the Bridge to the
Doctorate Fellowship Program at NCA&amp;T will produce 12 highly competitive
graduate students who have experience in the interdisciplinary applications of
science and mathematics in scholarship and research relevant to 21st century
STEM workforce development.
