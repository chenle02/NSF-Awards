In this Capacity-Building Noyce Scholarship Program, STEM Teach VI, the
University of the Virgin Islands is establishing the curricular framework and
institutional collaborations to support training of STEM majors to become high-
school science teachers. The Virgin Islands has great need for such a program.
Student performance on tests of proficiency in science and mathematics shows
that education in these areas lags behind many other regions of the United
States. In preparing to remedy that need, the University of the Virgin Islands
is creating a new teacher preparation program. Faculty in the School of
Education, the College of Science and Mathematics and the College of Liberal
Arts and Social Science have identified existing courses and established new
ones to supplement the major studies of future teachers with the needed
theoretical and practical education training. Most interesting, STEM Teach VI
proponents recognize that aspects of the program must relate to the cultural and
contextual uniqueness of the Virgin Islands, so they are studying the site-
specific factors that influence learning both for the high school students and
future educators. Noyce Scholars are recruited early in their academic careers
not only from STEM majors but also from students strongly interested in STEM and
education careers. Not only does this project address a serious need for well
prepared science and mathematics teachers, it also serves a population
dramatically underrepresented in the STEM disciplines: 81% of the population is
African American and 15% is Hispanic. Once the two-year planning period is
complete, the structures will be in place to support a dynamic and forward-
looking program for STEM teacher preparation.
