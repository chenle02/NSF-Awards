The philosophy of the Panola College Interdisciplinary Technology Center project
revolves around the idea that it takes faculty from all disciplines working
together to educate each student. A problem being faced by the institution is
that academic populations often become compartmentalized and disinterested in
other disciplines. The project is developing technology based cross-curriculum
lessons in the academic foundation courses by building on experiences in physics
and English which introduce students to both technology and other disciplines.
The interdisciplinary lessons and activities simultaneously expose the diverse
population of students to a technology education and to the connections between
disciplines that make for a whole education. Goals are being achieved by
establishing a resource and activity center with open access to the latest
instructional technology for the faculty and students of Panola College. Faculty
are developing curricular materials and revising all classes to include
technological applications. The Center allows simultaneous use by structured and
unstructured groups involved in varied activities, so students learn different
applications. Outcomes include improved faculty cooperation across science and
other disciplines, a more computer- and technology-literate student body, a more
involved and interrelated curriculum, a more progressive faculty, and a program
of workforce training more appropriate for the job markets students will face.
