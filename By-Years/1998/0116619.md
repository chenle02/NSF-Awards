With this award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research Program Towson
University will be able to acquire equipment for a pulsed laser deposition
system. The pulsed laser deposition system will be primarily used to fabricate
thin films of several technologically useful and novel multi-component
perovskite metal oxides and related materials. These materials include
superconductors, colossal magnetoresistive manganites and other magnetic oxides,
as well as other perovskite oxides suitable for sensor applications. The thin
film research program will address materials physics issues that are pertinent
to sensor applications as well as those of fundamental interest. The initial
stage of the program will focus on the development colossal magnetoresistive
manganite thin films for uncooled infrared imaging and magnetic sensor
applications. The proposed research will provide a strong and versatile
synthetic materials base for the development of a Regional Materials Research
Laboratory at Towson University. The pulsed laser deposition system, in
conjunction with the existing surface characterization facility will play a
vital role in this effort. The facility will have positive impact on the
education and training of undergraduates and students from underrepresented
groups at Towson University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award from the
Instrumentation for Materials Research Program Towson University will be able to
acquire equipment for a pulsed laser deposition system. Towson University has
initiated the development of a Materials Research Laboratory, which will act as
a regional facility for research and education. A Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD)
system will be the cornerstone of this multidisciplinary facility and will
service researchers at Towson University, local colleges and universities,
government laboratories, and industry. The materials research facility will
support investigations by the faculty and their students that seek to
characterize the physical and chemical properties of both natural and synthetic
materials. Initial PLD projects will focus on thin films of colossal
magnetoresistive materials, High Temperature Superconductors, Ferroelectrics and
other perovskite oxides of interest for various sensor applications or as
metallic electrodes. The analytical methods and techniques developed during
these investigations will be shared and integrated into other projects and will
serve to foster the collaborative atmosphere that already exists between the
geoscience, physics, and astronomy programs. The facility will have positive
impact on the education and training of undergraduates and students from
underrepresented groups at Towson University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
