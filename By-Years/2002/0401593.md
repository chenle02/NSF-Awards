This award supports research using general circulation models to test the idea
that activities undertaken by humans since the advent of managed agriculture
approximately 11,000 years ago have added significant amounts of carbon dioxide
(CO2) and methane into the Earth's atmosphere. The researchers will attempt to
simulate a cooler world that would exist today in the absence of pre-industrial
and industrial-era greenhouse emissions. The researchers will also examine the
impacts of large-scale clearance of Eurasian forests prior to industrial periods
and analyze the impact of short-term climatic variations in a cooler and lower
greenhouse gas concentration world. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recently published
research by the authors suggests that activities undertaken by humans about
11,000 years ago have added significant amounts of carbon dioxide and methane to
the atmosphere. The onset of significant human emissions of these gases can be
detected by the departure of atmospheric gas concentrations from natural cyclic
variations that have prevailed for thousands of years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
researchers hypothesize that if natural decreases in CO2 and methane prevailed
during the middle and late Holocene, greenhouse-gas concentrations in the
atmosphere would have fallen toward their natural limit and the Earth would be a
considerably cooler place than it is today. One line of evidence suggests an ice
sheet would be growing today in northeast Canada. This suggests that greenhouse-
gas emissions from pre-industrial human activities kept climate too warm for
glaciation to begin. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
