The Bishop Museum is the repository for over 105,000 ethnographic objects from
the Hawaiian and Pacific areas. These unique and irreplaceable items, the result
of systematic anthropological research, are an important national resource that
needs to be protected for posterity and future research use. In 1991 the Bishop
Museum will move its anthropology collections into a new storage facility. In
order to prepare for this move, the museum staff will conduct a computerized
inventory and condition survey of the ethnology collections. This will result in
a detailed catalogue which may be used by researchers as well as insure that the
collections are moved safely. This project will insure that the ethnographic
collections in the Bishop Museum are accessible and can be used in the future by
scientists from across the country to advance our knowledge of the natural and
cultural history of Hawaii and Pacific peoples.
