This project will investigate the contributions of viruses to the mortality of
phytoplankton and bacterioplankton in the Western Antarctic Peninsula. Viral
lysis has fundamentally different consequences for how carbon is transferred
through the marine food web, but the importance of viral mortality is unknown.
The principal investigators will measure viral mortality on samples at different
stages of the spring/summer bloom in the vicinity of Palmer Station, Antarctica.
Since all of the available methods have their limitations, a suite of approaches
will be employed. The project also will examine whether sea ice acts as a seed
bank for viruses that contribute to phytoplankton mortality during the bloom.
Fieldwork will be conducted primarily in the vicinity of Palmer Station to allow
time series measurements during the course of the bloom. Broader impacts include
teacher training workshops, summer research projects, and collaboration with
Palmer LTER outreach activities. The project also will contribute to the
training of a postdoctoral fellow, graduate students, and one or more
undergraduate students each year.
