This research project aims to develop new tools in probability theory that will
enhance understanding of interacting particle systems and random networks. The
motivating problems touch fundamental questions such as the effect of initial
conditions (e.g., ordered or disordered, random or fixed) in Markov chains on
their time of convergence to equilibrium, and structure formation (surface
shape, subgraphs in networks, etc.) versus disorder under various conditions.
Many of the questions under study remain open, despite extensive studies
offering detailed heuristics and corroborating experiments; the goal of this
project is to make progress on these via new methods of analysis, which are
expected to find further applications in probability theory as well as in other
areas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first research project focuses on the interplay
between a spin system, such as the Ising or Potts model, and a natural Markov
chain modelling its evolution, for example Metropolis or heat-bath Glauber
dynamics. The phase transition that both the dynamical and static models undergo
has received much attention, yet various basic problems have so far been out of
reach of rigorous analysis in all three (high, low, and critical) temperature
regimes. This project studies several such problems, as well as newer ones
suggested by recent advances, including understanding the effect of the initial
configurations (random or deterministic, balanced or alternating, etc.) on the
mixing time at high temperature and establishing a power-law for mixing at
criticality in dimension 3 and higher. A second research direction focuses on
random surface models, as well as their evolution, with ramifications for the
Ising model and the roughening transition in crystals. The final research topic
addresses random walks on the Erdos-Renyi random graph: the project aims to
study the effect of the initial state on the mixing time of random walks, and in
different regimes to establish typical structural properties, such as robustness
of its features to noise, and atypical ones, such as whether the system
organizes to asymmetric structures when conditioned on an atypical event (large
deviations).
