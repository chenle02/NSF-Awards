Plasmas are gas-phase assemblies of ions, electrons, and neutral
molecules/atoms. When materials surfaces are exposed to plasmas, many complex
physical and chemical interactions take place. In particular, energetic ions can
dislodge violently, interact electronically, or form chemical bonds with surface
atoms. The formation and breakage of chemical bonds (reactions) between
energetic gas-phase ions and surfaces are very poorly understood. This research
is focused in improving the understanding of such reaction mechanisms and
controlling the outcome of plasma-surface interactions. The experimental results
will stimulate the development and testing of relevant theories, and introduce
new knowledge on reactive scattering dynamics into chemical
curricula.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Findings from this research should impact
surface science and plasma processing, important technologies for characterizing
and treating, coating, or etching solid surfaces for applications ranging from
surface functionalization, to microelectronics fabrication, and space
exploration. The research should lead to a new paradigm for selecting plasma
chemistries and conditions, based on the reactivity and overall scattering
dynamics of specific ions formed in the plasma, thus speeding up and making less
expensive the development of plasma processes for many applications.
