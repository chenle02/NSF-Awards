The dynamic motions in proteins are impressively rich, in terms of both
amplitudes and timescales. These fluctuations have a profound impact on protein
stability and function. The overall goal of this research is to identify three-
dimensional, connective motional networks in a functional protein domain, the
second PDZ domain from tyrosine phosphatase 1E (hPTP1E-PDZ2), and relate these
networks to PDZ function by characterizing them in the free and ligand-bound PDZ
states. Dynamic motions will be characterized using a combination of NMR spin
relaxation methods (15N and 2H) and molecular dynamics simulations. To gain
insight into the structural and functional context of dynamic perturbations, the
dynamic response to single-site mutations will be determined in free and bound
PDZ states. Coupling free energies between these residues will be determined
with respect to ligand binding and protein unfolding. This combined experimental
and theoretical approach may allow determination of the residence of pair-wise
residue couplings with respect to functional state. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
significance of these studies is to begin to understand how individual, residue
motions contribute to larger, multibody, correlated motions that are essential
for protein function, such as protein-protein interactions. Key to this effort
is a focus on the motions of individual side chains, even those pointing into
the protein core, as side chains have large amplitudes of motion, due in part to
sampling of multiple rotameric states. The effects of energetic and dynamical
coupling and their relation to function investigated here should be fundamental
to proteins, and therefore of broad intellectual significance. Integrating this
research with the training of minority and women trainees will result in an
effort of broad scientific and cultural impact.&lt;br/&gt;
