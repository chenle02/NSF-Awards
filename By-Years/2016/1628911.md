During a recession, although economic growth is falling, employers do not
usually cut wages. A long-standing puzzle in economics is why paychecks usually
do not adjust to the full extent of an economic crash. Surveys indicate that
firms resist wage cuts because of a belief that workers will be less productive
if their wages are cut. It is difficult to test if those beliefs are justified
because we cannot observe the necessary counterfactual, without a controlled
experiment. The results of this research effort will help us better understand
how employment levels react to economic fluctuations and provide insight into a
policy that governments use to boast employment. The amount of money that goes
into fighting deflation can hardly be overstated. It is important for economic
progress to understand the effect of nominal wage reference points. This project
is a laboratory experiment to observe the decisions of firms and workers after a
recession. Employers set wages in order to maximize their profits, given their
beliefs about what motivates employees. Employees then choose effort levels
according to their wages and preferences. The PIs will be able to observe how
wages affect effort choices and measure precisely what firms believe. In this
experiment, some participants will experience inflation. If a worker's paycheck
stays the same under inflation, they are actually taking a real wage cut,
however they may not feel as disaffected as they would after receiving a nominal
wage cut. The results will contribute to our understanding of the impact of
inflation on productivity of employed. Outside of a controlled experiment, it is
difficult to introduce random variation in the price level. The PIs can
implement it through the exchange rate of performance earnings during the
experiment to the dollar payments made to subjects after the experiment.
