This project will partially support an emphasis year in Probability and Ergodic
Theory to be held at Northwestern University during the 1989-90 academic year.
In particular, specialty conferences will be supported in the following three
areas: (1) almost everywhere convergence in probability and ergodic theory, to
be held October 16-20, 1989 and organized by Professor Alexandra Bellow, (2)
diffusion processes and related problems in analysis, to be held October 23-27,
1989 and organized by Professor Mark Pinsky, and (3) manifolds of nonpositive
curvature, to be held March 19-23, 1990 and organized by Professor Keith Burns.
The topics to be covered include bi- convexity, complex martingales, ergodic
theorems for operators and subsequences, non-linear ergodic theorems, sub-
additive ergodic theory, stochastic differential geometry, large deviations,
Lyapunov exponents, Anasov systems, geodesic flows, and the fundamental group.
These conferences will be an integral part of the emphasis year that will be
held at Northwestern.
