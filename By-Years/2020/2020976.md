Suicide warfare—a timely topic in post-9/11 world— has occupied important space
around the world, especially since the twentieth century. Internationally
comparative in scope, this project explores the ethics of engineering for
homeland security. In any country at war, it may be rational to act in what
appears to be an irrational matter, and suicide missions are a key instance of
this phenomenon. Suicide warfare for homeland defense, albeit against enemy
forces, first requires human sacrifice, thus raising far more ethical issues
than technological ones. Focusing on engineering communities in two nations that
used suicide as a form or warfare, the project aims to answer a set of inter-
related questions: (1) How and why did engineers support organized suicide
attacks for homeland defense? (2) How was the moral sensitivity of peacetime
reduced to support the desperate act as evil but necessary? (3) At what cost
(and to whom) does society in war benefit from a given engineering project? and,
(4) What are the acceptable costs of suicide as a technology acceptable for
national defense? Project results will be used to create educational materials,
public presentations, and publications in popular
outlets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project uses historical methods to analyze
the period from 1914 to 1961, during which World War I, World War II, and the
Cold War each elevated the importance of patriotic self-sacrifice for national
causes. Critical analyses of these materials enable a series of comparisons of
social practices and technological dimensions by which different nations created
their versions of suicide warfare in the air by actively shaping the notions of
suicide for homeland defense. Popular literature, posters, government
publications, and more are used to uncover the socio-technological context in
which suicide warfare in the air took shape, and how and why this differed
across social contexts. Overall, this project contributes to scholarship on
engineering ethics, the history of technology, and Science and Technology
Studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
