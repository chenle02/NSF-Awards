Support is provided for a theoretical investigation of the dynamics of a low
density atomic beam in interaction with the electromagnetic field modes of a
high-Q resonator. A study will be made of the conditions under which this system
becomes chaotic, both quantum mechanaically and semi-classically. The generation
of nonclassical states of the electromagnetic field and the onset and build-up
of coherence in atom-field interactions will be studied.
