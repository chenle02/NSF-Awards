Twin-station GPS receiver data provide, on small scales (400 m resolution), a
measure of Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) radio scintillations and plasma
depletion drifts above Eritrea in Africa. Large-scale context of F-region
depletions is provided simultaneously by 630 nm all sky imaging. These data,
acquired during a four-year period from 1999 - 2003, are used to investigate the
formation, morphology, and day-to-day variability of the equatorial spread-F
irregularity. Assimilation of these African data into global models uniquely
constrains the poorly understood climatology of these irregularities that are
known to disrupt communication and navigation.
