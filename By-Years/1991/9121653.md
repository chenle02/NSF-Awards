This action funds an Interagency agreement between NSF and the Bureau of the
Census to support planning and development of the 1993 postcensal survey of
college graduates. This survey will collect information on education, training
and employment related to science and engineering from a nationally
representative sample of persons with bachelor's degrees (or higher). These data
are used in NSF's Scientific and Technical Personnel Data System (STPDS).
