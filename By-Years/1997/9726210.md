This award supports Dr. Anant K. Ramdas and up to three graduate students from
Purdue University in a collaboration with Harald Pascher of the Department of
Experimental Physics at the University of Bayreuth. The collaboration will study
the collective and localized excitations in the ternary and quaternary alloys of
II-VI diluted magnetic semiconductors. Experimental investigations will involve
spontaneous Raman scattering and coherent Stokes-Raman studies supplemented with
modulation techniques, photoluminescence, and Fourier transform spectroscopy.
Magnetic interactions in the diluted magnetic semiconductors, controlled by the
concentration of the magnetic ions or by the dimensionality in sub-micron
quantum well structures manifest themselves in a spectacular manner in numerous
phenomena, such as the Faraday and Voigt effect, Raman-electron paramagnetic
resonance, and Raman-anti-ferromagnetic resonance.
