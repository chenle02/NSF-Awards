Partial or complete travel support is provided to permit graduate students, and
some speakers, to attend a cross- discipline workshop on Plasma Experiments in
Laboratory and Space, to be held in Alpbach, Austria July 1-6, 1991. The
conference will emphasize areas of plasma physics of common interest to
laboratory and space science, including such topics as: critical velocity,
reconnection, ion cyclotron waves, beam driven instabilities, anomalous
resistivity, double layers, collisionless shocks, non-linear and kinetic Alven
waves, active space experiments, turbulence, and transport.
