Mechanism of Disease Resistance in Transgenic Plants: Dr. Beachy recently
reported the production of transgenic tobacco plants (plants regenerated from
cells into which foreign DNA was introduced by transformation) that expressed
the coat protein (CP) gene of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) as a chimeric nuclear
gene. These plants and their progeny were less susceptible to infection by TMV,
and the appearance of symptoms caused by infection were significantly delayed in
the transgenic plants compared to control plants. In addition, some of the
transgenic plants escaped infection. Studies are continuing to determine the
mechanism(s) that confer resistance to these transgenic plants. These
experiments include site directed mutations to alter the amino acid sequence of
the TMV- CP, as well as its subcellular localization in transgenic plants. This
action provides funds to purchase two pieces of equipment necessary for the
successful completion of the work, specifically, a controlled enviornment
incubator/shaker for bacterial cultures, and a controlled environment chamber
for holding plants that are infected with virus.
