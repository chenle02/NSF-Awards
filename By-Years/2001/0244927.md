This project is a continuation of a search for the electron electric dipole
moment (EDM), using the metastable state of PbO. Observation of an electron EDM
would provide definitive evidence for phenomena beyond the Standard Model of
particle physics. Currently favored theories involving supersymmetry typically
predict the EDM within a few orders of magnitude of the current limit. Recent
results indicate that it should be possible to improve upon the current
sensitivity by a factor of at least 100, within the three-year period of the
project. In parallel with the EDM search, techniques for further extending the
sensitivity of the method will be developed. We will search for unknown states
which couple radiatively to the metastable state, using classical spectroscopic
techniques. Successful completion of this search will allow us to identify
suitable probe and/or pump transitions, which can be used for a more efficient
excitation and detection of the PbO molecules. On the broader impact, the PI's
search for the electron EDM will continue to involve extensive student training.
Also the PI will continue to widely disseminate the results, through refereed
publications, conference presentations, and public lectures.
