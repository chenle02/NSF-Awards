A major instrumentation need in neurophysiology is the production of new sensor
interfaces between brain and electronic devices. Advances in multichannel
sensing of neural activity, detection of local levels of neurotransmitters, and
other physiological parameters would be valuable as an evolutional step in
studies of the normal physiology of neural circuits. Also, information on the
local pattern of activity within connected neural structures and of local
chemical release of neuromodulator substances will be needed to devise control
or communication strategies within and between neural structures to understand
effective neural function. A team of scientist at the University of Colorado,
Denver and the University of Texas, Dallas are coordinating research activities
which are developing biochemical probes and the technology to record from 32
sites simultaneously in neural tissue. This action is to support their
activities which deal with multi-electrode array (dagger) and connector
construction and the writing of computer software essential for data acquisition
and interpretation.
