Model development and theoretical studies of viscoelastic flow instabilities
are to be carried out. Domain decomposition and pseudospectral numerical codes
will be used to explore the stability of flow configurations representative of
polymer processing systems. The main focus will be on the coupling of such
models to one simulating the near-wall region for polymers flowing past solid
surfaces, based on simulated microstructures, to explore the effect of wall slip
on flow instabilities. The work is expected to lead to more robust and realistic
numerical modeling of complex polymer processes. The modeling also relates to
drag reduction from fluids with polymer additives.
