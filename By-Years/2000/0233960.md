Rounds&lt;br/&gt;CCR-0233960&lt;br/&gt;This project, under
the&lt;br/&gt;embedded and hybrid systems program (EHS), investigates a
surprisingly simple method for&lt;br/&gt;integrating process-algebraic
techniques with hybrid automaton-based techniques for creating a mathematical
foundation upon which real programming languages for hybrid and embedded systems
can be based. More specifically, it addresses a new class of hybrid
systems&lt;br/&gt;which can reconfigure themselves to handle different physical
tasks at different times, yet operating concurrently. Very little progress has
been achieved to date on such problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research
investigates a hybrid extension of Milner's pi-calculus to allow processes
written in this language to interact with continuous environments. The extension
is the phi-calculus.&lt;br/&gt;The reasons for pursuing this approach are as
follows. (1) The phi-calculus is believed to subsume and properly extend most of
the current versions of hybrid systems; for example, hybrid automata hybrid I-O
automata hybrid Petri nets, and HybridCC; (2) The goal is to be able to model
distributed logical control and interaction with continuous processes in a
principled structural way. The pi-calculus, using its algebraic process-
structuring primitives, has been shown to be&lt;br/&gt;a rich language in which
many interesting discrete concurrent phenomena can be expressed: a language for,
and theory of, communicating processes which can reconfigure themselves; a
language in which distributed objects and classes can be defined; and a language
and theory&lt;br/&gt;capable not only of expressing interaction, but arbitrary
computation, in that the lambda-calculus of Church can be translated into it;
(3) This all suggests that successful hybrid versions of algebraic
&lt;br/&gt;calculi will have novel and elegant ways of expressing hybrid systems
--possibilities for distributed control which would be awkward, if not
impossible, to express in current formalisms.&lt;br/&gt;
