In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division,
Prof. Gina Hoatson of the College of William and Mary will engage in developing
new techniques of pulsed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy in order
to expand the accessible range of time scales over which the rates of molecular
motion as well as the associated dynamical trajectories can be determined. These
include methods of selective inversion, the determination of double quantum line
shapes, methods of Hadamard excitation spectroscopy, which is a variant of
stochastic NMR possessing considerable advantages over conventional pulsed NMR,
and spectral density measurements on powders. Systems to be investigated in the
course of this work include molecular crystals, inclusion compounds, and liquid
crystals. %%% Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a powerful,
ubiquitious method for the study of solids and liquids through the interaction
of nuclear magnets of the constituent atoms with electromagnetic radiation. The
absorption of this radiation by the nuclear magnets is not only characteristic
of the specific chemical element but is also affected by the chemical
environment. The atomic nuclei thus act as microscopic probes and yield site
specific information about the structure and dynamics of the solid or liquid
substance. Continual developments in theoretical and experimental techniques
have resulted in vastly improved performance of the NMR method as a tool for
basic studies of the properties of condensed matter and have greatly expanded
its application to problems in physics, chemistry, materials science, biology,
and medicine. In this project further developments are planned to enable the NMR
method to deal with difficult or so far undoable problems and thereby extend the
range of its applicability to practical problems.
