The study of complex cobordism and related cohomology theories is a long
standing and well respected area of algebraic topology. Another area has been
that of (finite) group theoretic constructions, becoming, in its most modern
form, equivariant stable homotopy theory. Results in recent years, most
spectacularly the proofs of Segal's Burnside ring conjecture and Ravenel's
nilpotence conjecture, have dramatically begun to bring to fruition these two
branches of stable homotopy theory. Historically, these branches have been
basically independent of each other. An exception is Atiyah's theorem relating
K*(BG) (a bordism type of object) to the complex representation ring of G. There
are now indications of much more widespread interrelations. This is the subject
of Kuhn's recent and current research. It is hard to say where the study of such
intricate algebraic patterns will lead, but the history of mathematics strongly
suggests that mastering them will have repercussions elsewhere, either in use of
the patterns themselves or of the techniques developed for treating them.
