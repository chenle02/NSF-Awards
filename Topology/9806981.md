9806981 Goodwillie This project is mainly concerned with the long-range goal of
investigating those aspects of the topology of manifolds that lie beyond the
reach of algebraic K-theory. The method is a combination of several kinds of
"functor calculus." One task is to investigate some interrelationships between
these calculi with an eye to strengthening the general method. This is expected
to involve some foundational work on Poincare duality complexes. Another task
for the long haul is to look at what may be called a second-order analogue of
algebraic K-theory; it arises by a kind of quadratic stabilization of manifold
phenomena. For the short haul there is the job of constructing a kind of second-
order analogue of cyclic homology that should be related to the above as cyclic
homology is related to algebraic K-theory. There is at least a slight hope that
this would yield topologically defined invariants for four-manifolds that are
akin to the well-known analytically defined Seiberg-Witten invariants. The word
"calculus" is used because of an attractive analogy with the ordinary calculus
of functions. Sometimes, of course, the way to settle a numerical question is to
see the answer as a value of a function; by means of the powerful apparatus of
calculus, properties of the function can lead to a computation of the number.
Likewise, a fact about some geometrically defined object is sometimes best
proved by viewing the object as a particular value of a functor and using the
apparatus of some kind of functor calculus. This analogy may show something of
the flavor of the work; the content is harder to describe to the non-expert,
because most of the "geometric" objects in question are connected to everyday
reality by rather long chains of abstract ideas. ***
