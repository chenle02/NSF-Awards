The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation -
Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project is to develop an intelligent online
real-time lubricant oil health monitoring system to maintain and extend the
health of high-speed rotating and reciprocating machinery used in many key
industries. The completed system will significantly reduce operation costs by
eliminating the need for inspection shutdowns, while avoiding catastrophic
component failure during operation. Applications include bearings,
turbomachinery gearboxes, and even combustion engines in sectors such as the
wind farm, transportation, manufacturing and defense industries. The system is
expected to provide an important early warning of mechanical failure and will be
used to develop more efficient maintenance schedules to reduce machine operation
costs and avoid catastrophic failure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project
aims to develop a comprehensive lubricant oil condition monitor system offering
real-time characterization of contaminant debris and lubricant oil quality to
judge a machineâ€™s operating health. Objectives include: 1) inductive pulse
sensing and microfluidic signal multiplexing technologies will be used to detect
fine wear debris in lubricant oil to enable monitoring of the entire wear
progression; 2) real-time processing will be used to significantly reduce the
data size to be analyzed and stored; 3) a lubricant property-sensing array will
measure multiple oil properties simultaneously; 4) an artificial neural network
will link measured sensor signals to oil properties with high accuracy,
eliminating cross-sensitivities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
