The Synthetic Organic Program is funding Dr. Paul Helquist of the Department of
Chemistry at the University of Notre Dame to continue his research on new
methods in synthetic organic and organometallic chemistry. The important
unifying themes among the subprojects are the construction of carbocyclic ring
systems, the development of organometallic reagents with a special emphasis on
transition metals, and the development of reactions that take place with
asymmetric induction. First, iron-carbene complexes will be studied to test the
ability of these reactive intermediates to undergo C-H insertion and cationic
olefinic cyclization. Chiral-at-iron derivatives will be used to test aysmmetric
versions of the reactions. Second, intermediates derived from the reaction
between ketone enolates and cyclopropane derivatives will be used as precursors
cyclopentanone annulation, formation of polycyclic fused cycloheptanone systems
and three-carbon segments for the synthesis of large-ring systems. Third, the
concept of diastereofacial selective coordination of alkenes and the subsequent
use of the coordinated alkenes for chiral synthesis will be extended to include
organic pi-donor ligands in general.
