Sensory transduction is a process that converts some form of stimulus energy
into a neural response, to send information to the brain. Little is known about
the molecular mechanisms for transduction in chemosensory systems. Taste
detection of some substances may involve the triggering of flow of particular
charged ions across the membrane of the taste-bud cells. Bitter taste is
particularly important in feeding, because several toxic compounds from plants
are bitter. Using a novel method for isolating mammalian taste cells, this
project will focus on the role of calcium ions in bitter taste transduction.
Changes in intracellular calcium are known to result in neurotransmitter
release, to carry the signal to neurons to the brain. Preliminary data show that
bitter compounds stimulate release of calcium from internal stores in a
subpopulation of taste cells. The mechanism is proposed to involve a receptor
molecule (protein) in the cell membrane. When a stimulus molecule binds to these
receptors, intracellular second messenger molecules are activated that then
regulate calcium levels. Such a mechanism is distinct from the usual dependence
of intracellular calcium levels on the electrical depolarization of the cell
membrane. Cell types will be identified by antibody reactivity,
electrophysiological recordings of cells will be made while bitter stimuli are
delivered, and selected pharmacological agents will be used to block specific
steps, to clarify the transduction process. This novel approach overcomes a
major difficulty of taste research, that the taste cells are inaccessibly
embedded in the tongue. The results will be very important for understanding how
a specific taste occurs, understanding chemosensory systems in general, and
probably will have applications in the food industry.
