0319201 Van Patten This award supports the PI to visit the laboratory of Harald
Morgner of the Department of Chemistry and Mineralogy at the University of
Leipzig, Germany. The purpose of the visit is to finalize plans for a joint
research project on the structure and evolution of polyelectrolyte thin films
during and after deposition. Thin film assembly has become a critical area of
nanotechnology research over the past decade and Morgner is one of the few
scientists in the world with the equipment and expertise to use low-energy ion
scattering spectroscopy to perform concentration depth profiling of condensed
materials over ranges of tens to hundreds of nanometers. Together, the US and
German labs will use ISS to map the internal structure of polyelectrolyte thin
films and to monitor the evolution of the films as a function of ambient
conditions during and after deposition.

The broader impacts of this collaboration are that it increases interactions
between US researchers and those in the former East Germany, it promotes
collaborative opportunities and career development for US junior faculty, and it
enhances the infrastructure for research and education by laying the groundwork
for future international research and education opportunities.
