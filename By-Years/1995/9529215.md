9529215 Nakamura This award supports a 24 month Science and Technology Agency of
Japan (STA) Postdoctoral Fellowship for Dr. Takashi Nakamura at the National
Foods Research Institute, Tsukuba, Japan. Dr. Nakamura will work with Dr.
Mitsutoshi Nakajima of the Process Engineering Laboratory on a research project
entitled "Purification of Inulin and Inulo-oligasaccharides through Enzyme
Extraction and Nanofiltration of the Jerusalem Artichoke". The proposed research
will concentrate on membrane technology and its application to the purification
of fats and sugars from agricultural and biological products. For sugars, the
focus of the application of membrane technology will be on the Jerusalem
artichoke, a Hokkaido agricultural product, and the extraction and purification
of inulin and inulo-oligosaccharides. The use of the appropriate enzymes in the
hydrolysis of fats and oligasaccharides as well as establishing a well supported
model to accurately predict the permeate flux are necessary in creating viable
and cost- effective membrane technologies for the food industry. As the use of
fats and sugars are widespread in the food industry, the research will
investigate and determine the degree to which membrane technologies can be used
to achieve cost-efficient industrial processing. The proposed research is of
considerable theoretical and practical interest to the bio-engineering community
and the benefits to be obtained from collaborative research will be valuable to
both participants. Furthermore, the research will likely yield positive results
for the United States and Japan as well as the international scientific
community as a whole. As such, the research satisfies the objectives of the
program in its emphasis on the exchange and transfer of scientific knowledge
through international collaboration. ***
