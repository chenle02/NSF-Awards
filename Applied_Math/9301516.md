The first part of this project is concerned with two types of stochastic
differential equations: equations with discontinuous paths and reflecting
boundary conditions, and forward-backward equations, possibly with discontinuous
paths. Properties of such stochastic differential equations, such as existence
and uniqueness of solutions, solvability properties and continuous, or
measurable, dependence of solutions on the data, will be investigated. This
study will provide the fundamental tools for the second part of this project,
which is concerned with singular-regular stochastic control problems for
nonlinear diffusions. The singular-regular model is distinguished by involving
both measurable controls and measure-type controls. In some cases, constraints
on the state process are imposed, which leads to so-called reflecting type
models. The focus of this part of the research is on issues which are of
fundamental interest in control theory and applications, such as characterizing
the value function and optimal policy and deriving sufficient and/or necessary
conditions on the optimal control. This research project will develop a unified
framework for a broad class of stochastic control problems by combining
classical stochastic control theory with the newly developed singular stochastic
control theory. The latter is a rapidly expanding area of research and poses
many challenging theoretical issues related to partial differential equations
and stochastic analysis. The principal applications of this research are to
optimal control problems for dissipative dynamical systems under uncertainty.
Specific anticipated applications are to position/speed control policies for an
aircraft operating under uncertain weather disturbances; to financial economics
problems such as option pricing, consumption/investment optimization with
transaction costs, optimal control of storage or inventory type systems, among
others.
