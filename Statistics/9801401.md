The investigators work on three aspects of the foundations of Bayesian
statistics and decision theory: (i) They develop measures of incoherence which
permit them to quantify the extent to which non-Bayesian procedures violate
principles of subjective expected utility. (ii) They implement algorithms for
assessing partially ordered preferences, according to their representation in
terms of sets of agreeing probability/utility pairs. These are relevant for
modeling Pareto consensus of a group of coherent (Bayesian) expert decision
makers. (iii) They explore connections between merely finitely additive
probability and valid computations with "improper" priors, in the context of so-
called "Marginalization" paradoxes.

Bayesian statistics aims to put statistics on a sound theoretical footing by
modeling a rational statistical decision maker as if he or she were a bookie,
announcing probabilities which act as prices at which risky bets can be bought
or sold. An important general result is that a bookie either behaves as a
Bayesian, or would accept a series of bets that would make the bookie a sure
loser. The investigators explore extensions of this theory to account for non-
Bayesian behavior, groups of bookies, and more general interpretations of
probability.
