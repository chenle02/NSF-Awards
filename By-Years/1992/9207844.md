1/f noise appears in most high-technology applications as a low-frequency
fluctuation limiting the achievable performance and stability. On the other
hand, physical cross sections and process rates have been shown theoretically by
the author to fluctuate with a 1/f spectral density according to a universal
formula which gives the power spectrum of fractional cross section fluctuations
in terms of the fine structure constant a=1/137 if both the velocity change of
the scattered current carriers and their number are known. We can now calculate
quantum 1/f noise in all forms of scattering (impurity, phonon, umklapp, inter-
valley), in bulk and surface recombination and tunneling rates, as well as
emission processes. For extended currents in larger devices with over 1013
carriers per unit length the magnetic energy dominates the kinetic energy of
drift motion, so the coherent quantum 1/f effect becomes dominant. The proposed
research would apply this theory to solid state devices and microstructures, and
would further develop the theory in the transition region between the
conventional and coherent domains. We expect the proposed research to benefit
high-tech applications through general and practical low 1/f noise design and
optimization principles, and to improve the general understanding of the quantum
1/f effect as quantum chaos, or as a technically important fundamental law of
nature.
