9727667 Beyerlein This project entitled Glow Discharge
Atomization/ExcitationAonization Sources involves a series of studies to further
the development and implementation of radio frequency glow discharge (rf-GD)
devices as spectrochemical sources for direct solids analysis to include
nonconductive materials such as glasses, ceramics, and polymers, by atomic
emission and mass spectrometries. Areas of investigation include the
implementation of fundamental diagnostic techniques for real-time monitoring of
rf-GD atomization/excitation/ionization conditions, where e.g., real- time in
situ monitoring of sputtered crater depth will be accomplished with a laser
confocal displacement apparatus mounted within the discharge source. Also, the
addition of helium to the normal argon discharge will be studied as a means of
providing enhanced depth resolution and sensitivity for hard- to-excite/ionize
elements. %%% Radio frequency glow discharge sources hold promise in the
analysis of materials such as polymers, ceramics and glasses, with the potential
for performing rapid bulk and depth-resolved elemental analysis of films,
coatings and membrane materials. The further development and optimization of
these analytical tools will provide significant advantages over present analysis
capabilities in fields of practical applications that include biotechnology,
industrial process control, and waste characterization. ***
