The purpose of this research is to exploit developments for three-dimensional
robot vision obtained under a previous NSF grant. One area of investigation
involves the inspection of machined parts using the technique of a shaped
projection pattern based on the CAD description of the part. A shaped pattern is
projected on the manufactured part in such a manner that a simple pattern such
as lines or a grid results even though the part shape might be quite complex.
The simple pattern can be easily analyzed to test the quality of the shape of
the part as compared to the design goals. Other facets of three-dimensional
measurements for robot control will also be investigated. This work offers a
major step toward the integration of computer-aided design, manufacturing, and
inspection, and could lead to improved product quality and greater economic
competitiveness.
