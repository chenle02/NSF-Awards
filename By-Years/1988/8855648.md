In 1985 and 1986, the Educational Testing Service (ETS) conducted a study to
determine the persistence of minority students in the study of mathematics,
engineering, and scientific in college. These students were selected because
they had indicated that they wanted to major in MSE fields and had scored 550 or
better on their SAT (Math). In 1897, ETS sent a questionnaire to the
approximately 5,000 students who had persisted in their field of initial choice
and asked: "What advice would you give to boys and girls just starting high
school, if they want to succeed in college as math, science, engineering or
premed majors, and pursue careers in MSE fields?" The response of the students
was enthusiastic, and ETS found an unusual amount of wisdom in the advice. This
project will allow for the production and dissemination of a booklet containing
the responses from the minority students. The ETS has analyzed the responses,
and constructed a set of code catagories. The advice of the older students will
be selected so that all five catagories are represented. The booklet will be
distributed to high schools in the United States.//
