This research concentrates on the modelling, extension, and use of an
associative knowledge base ranging over the English Language as a whole. Our
existing topological model of English semantic space has been employed
experimentally for information analysis, including the exclusively rule-based
resolution of semantic ambiguity. Specific thrusts of this work include further
research on the global structure of the knowledge base, especially as to
implications of relaxing, and also increasing, the strength of the connectivity
definition -- for on this definition depends the elaboration of the semantic
distance metrics. Such semantic distance metrics, and other structural
components, are implicit in the proposed efforts to 1. automatically add
specialized terms (for narrow domain knowledge applications) to appropriate
semantic sub-spaces; 2. explore the relationship between non-monotonic reasoning
and semantic spaces in the knowledge base (e.g., how do shifts among associative
sub- nets relate to rejection of "old" information and the addition of new
information?): 3. explore the possibility that the associative memory structure
of the knowledge base implicitly already contains information of the type
currently explicitly and manually pre-encoded for knowledge bases (implicit
availability would enable a system either to access such information
automatically or to bypass it); 4. explore the relationship between the
associative knowledge base and the generic human machine learning models
incorporated in current natural computation, neural computing, and genetic
computing; 5. precisely establish uses for Rough sets as a multi-valued
Knowledge Representation Structure for English semantic space when there is a
degree of uncertainty in the knowledge encoded.
