With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at Oberlin College will acquire a Beowulf cluster. This
equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including a) electronic
structure calculations of preferential salvation around peptides; b) quantum
chemical ab initio calculations of the atmospheric oxidation mechanisms of
hydrocarbons; c) development of algorithms for multiple whole-genome alignments;
d) studies of pulsar scintillation; and e) the development of new models of
propagation of electromagnetic waves through turbulent ionized plasmas.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A cluster of fast, modern computer workstations is vital
to serving the computing needs of active research departments. Such a "computer
network" also serves as a development environment for new theoretical codes and
algorithms, provides state-of-the-art graphics and visualization facilities, and
supports research in state-of-the-art applications of parallel processing. These
studies will have a significant impact in a wide number of areas, including
biochemistry, space physics and environmental chemistry. &lt;br/&gt;
