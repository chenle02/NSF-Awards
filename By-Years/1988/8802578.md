Current rates of habitat destruction and environmental perturbation cannot
continue without a concomitant and unprecedented loss of genetic, species, and
ecological diversity. The traditional forms of mitigation (isolated reserves of
various kinds, captive breeding, storage of germ plasm, embryos, etc.) all
suffer from various weaknesses and disadvantages. The synthetic discipline of
conservation biology is positioned to improve these traditional practices and
invent new ones. Nevertheless, there is little consensus about the relative
importance and potential utility of various approaches. The objective of this
proposal is to provide some guidelines for researchers by (1) identifying the
major scientific challenges associated with the various environmental threats,
(2) suggest research directions that might lead to needed advances, and (3)
propose cost.effective mechanisms for the achievement of the needed
breakthroughs.
