The neutron moisture meter and the dual-energy gamma-ray probe are routinely
used in hydrological investigations to measure in situ the water content of
soils and sediments, even though the geometric characteristics of the volumes of
influence of these instruments and their spatial sensitivity are still very
poorly understood. To reach a much better understanding of the physics of water
content measurements in heterogeneous soils, and of how it impacts more
complicated measurement processes (like the in situ determination of the
unsaturated hydraulic conductivity) of which soil moisture measurement is only a
component, we propose to have recourse to computer simulations on
parallel/vector supercomputers. In particular, we propose to use a modified
version of the Monte Carlo code MCNP, describing the transport of neutrons and
photons in 3-dimensional geometries. The expected results of this research
(which will also extend to other aspects of hydrology besides soil moisture
measurement) will allow better use of existing instruments and, eventually
(although it is not part of the present proposal), the design of improved ones.
