This project would provide funds to the National Center for Education Statistics
to supplement a second follow-up of the mathematics and science teachers
students in the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988. Student
questionnaires will be expanded by two pages of items on the nature and quality
of mathematics and science courses offered. Also, the teacher questionnaire
would be expanded to induce specific items about courses and activities of
teaching mathematics and science courses taken by students in their twelfth year
of school. NCES has contracted this work with the National Opinion Research
Center (NORC) at the University of Chicago.//
