The PIs propose to investigate a free fluid (nongel) electrophoresis concept for
preparative and production scale separation of proteins and other biochemicals.
Fractionation occurs in a column with alternating porous barriers and fluid
chambers. Axial flows, which vary in magnitude from barrier to barrier, oppose
electrophoretic migration, causing the species in a multicomponent mixture to
focus among the chambers. The method is suitable for batch and continuous modes.
The scope of the proposed research encompasses binary separation experiments,
mathematical modeling, multicomponent experiments, extensions, and comparative
evaluations. The binary experiments will employ two chambers and one porous
barrier to separate two proteins, e.g. hemoglobin and serum albumin. A
mathematical model will be developed to help design multicomponent experiments
and interpret data. Extensions which can aid practicality and robustness will be
performed. Comparative evaluations will be made with other methods.
