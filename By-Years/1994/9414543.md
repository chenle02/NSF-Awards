9414543 Borden Compaction grouting is an important tool both for pre-
construction ground improvement and post-construction remediation of projects in
geomaterials, including tunneling, trenching, underpinning and lifeline
engineering under natural hazard conditions. Although the general methodology is
widely used, the methodology is empirical and basic mechanics and processes are
not well understood. This research has the following objectives: 1) to develop a
model to predict in situ injection geometric relationships; 2) to develop an
appropriate test which can be used for the design of a compaction grouting
operation; 3) to verify the model and test(s) in laboratory and full-scale field
injection experiments. The result of this research will be a verified model and
test procedures which will permit optimized and reliable design of soil and site
improvement by compaction grouting.
