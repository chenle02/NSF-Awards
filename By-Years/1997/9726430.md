of Florida TITLE: Regional Assessment of the Effects of ENSO-Related Climate
Variability on the Agricultural Sector of Argentina and Uruguay- Implications
for Adoption of Climate Forecasts. This is a multidisciplinary proposal to link
a system of climate, crop and decision models in order to understand the
interactions of interannual climate variability, crop productivity and the value
of ENSO-related climate forecasts to the agriculture of Argentina and Uruguay.
Monte Carlo simulation techniques will be utilized to create probability
distribution of crop response to climate variability. Survey methods will be
used to understand the perceptions of the decision makers. This research will
try to answer the important question of how useful the recent gains in climate
prediction skills are and can be to the agriculturists. The results from this
grant will be of great practical utility in assessing the value of improvements
in climate prediction.
