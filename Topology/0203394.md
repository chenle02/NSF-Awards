The PI of this proposal intends to study the topology of 3-dimensional manifolds
via Dehn surgery, essential surfaces and essential laminations. It is a common
method to use 2-dimensional surfaces as a tool in studying 3-manifolds. The most
useful surfaces in studying 3-manifolds are essential surface, essential
laminations, and Heegaard surfaces. The purpose of this project is to study the
properties of 3-manifolds using these surfaces and Dehn surgery. There have been
great progress in this area in the last few years, for example we now know that
an essential surface will remain essential after most Dehn surgeries, and the
exact upper bounds on distances between all ten pairs of nonsimple surgery types
have been determined. However there are still some very important problems
remaining to be solved in this area. An objective of this project is to
determine how many surgeries are ``exceptional'' in certain sense, for example,
how many will produce so called Seifert manifolds, and how many will kill an
essential surface. The PI will also study the problem of how an immersed surface
intersects a Heegaard surface.

3-manifolds are objects that are locally like ordinary 3-dimensional spaces, but
whose global structure may be quite complicated. Such objects appear naturally
from different areas of mathematics as well as physics and other sciences. The
ultimate goal in the study of 3-manifold topology is to have a thorough
understanding of the structure of 3-manifolds. This has not been achieved yet,
but there has been a great progress towards the proof of a conjectural picture
described by Thurston more than 20 years ago. The PI proposes to continue
studying 3-manifolds via Dehn surgery, which is a method of constructing new
3-dimensional spaces from an existing 3-dimensional space, by removing a
neighborhood of a circle and then gluing back in a different way. The
achievement of this project will be an important step towards the goal of having
a clear understanding of the topological and geometric structures of
3-manifolds.
