Professor Jeffrey A. Cina, of the University of Oregon Eugene, is supported to
perform research on the theory of wavepacket interferometry and relaxation
dynamics. Theoretical support for the emerging field of ultrafast spectroscopy
is required to aid in reconstructing molecular motion that may be inferred from
measurement. A feature of this work is that the information-rich time-dependent
molecular wavefunction, rather than probability density, is ultimately
determined. Applications of the method are aimed at understanding quantum-state
entanglement which is currently an issue of importance to quantum computing,
electronic energy transfer which is a key step in photosynthesis, and chemical
dynamics in solid materials and condensed-phase environments.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ability to spectrographically determine processes in
and properties of large molecules has been limited until recently. The methods
developed here allow one to significantly enhance capabilities for watching
molecular motions and are particularly well suited to the size regime relevant
to biological processes and quantum dots. Understanding gleaned from such work
may impact the development and control of biologically inspired molecular
materials for use in catalysis, energy storage and quantum information
technologies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
