Pseudomonas solanacearum is an ecologically and economically important
phytopathogen causing a lethal wilt disease of over 200 solanaceous plants
worldwide. The research proposed investigates biochemical and genetic basis of
its pathogenicity, focusing on major extracellular macromolecules. A greater
than 10-kb segment (Region I) of the P. solanacearum genome in which insertions
simultaneously cause a major decrease in virulence, production of extracellular
polysaccharide slime (EPS), and synthesis of two major extracellular proteins
(EXPs) has been identified. One objective of the proposed research is to
characterize Region I gene products and investigate their involvement in
virulence and synthesis of extracellular virulence molecules. This will be
accomplished by E. coli maxicell analysis of Region I subclones, TnphoA
mutagenesis, and in vitro biochemical and in planta studies of nonpolar isertion
mutants of Region I. The gene encoding a major 28-kDa EXP, whose level
correlates with EPS levels, will be cloned and similarly analyzed. For the
biochemical studies we will first develop methods to detect accumulation of
intermediates in EPS synthesis. Expression of Region I depends on two distinct,
unlinked loci that encode exported (membrane) proteins, and a locus located 6 kb
downstream of Region I; other studies suggest that all these loci control other
virulence genes unlinked to Region I. Additional project objectives are
characterization of the regulatory proteins by DNA sequence and gene product
analysis, exploring crosstalk between them by analysis of Region I expression in
multiple mutant background, and investigation of signals affecting virulence
gene regulation.
