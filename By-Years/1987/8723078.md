Research in stochastic analysis and control, with special emphasis on
mathematical economics and on problems of singular control and optimal stopping.
Particular topics include: (i) a detailed study of single-agent
portfolio/consumption problems with very general market models and utility
functions, using techniques from stochastic analysis; (ii) the associated
treatment of equilibrium problems for an economy with several agents, whose
joint optimal actions determine the prices of traded commodites by "clearing"
the markets; (iii) a new approach to optimal stopping using the theory of
balayage semimartingales, and the discussion of its ramifications for the
reflection problem of Skorohod and for singular stochastic control; and (iv) a
study of integral functionals for diffusion processes and semimartingales.
