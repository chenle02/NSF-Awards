Statement of Objectives 1. To increase preservice biology teachers (stusdents)
knowledge of the use of computerbased technologies in the sciences, including
video microscopy, digital imaging, and computer interfacing with data
collectors. 2. To allow students to develop inquiry-based laboratories using the
above technologies. 3. To provide opportunities for students to practice
intergrating these technologies with their teaching as they give demonstrations
to other biology classes and to inservice teachers. Methods During the teaching
methods courses for secondary and middle school biology preservice teachers,
students, will participate in variety of inquiry-based laboraties and
demonstrations using computer-based technologies. After they have become
familiar with this equipment, they will develop their own lessons and will teach
lessons to their peers. As another opportunity to develop their teaching skills
using this equipment, they will conduct demonstrations and workshops for the
elementary teachers biology course, graduate students who teach the introductory
biology courses, and to inservice teachers. During the training workshops,
participants will not only participate in or observe use of the equipment, they
will have the opportunity to develop their own laboratories and /or develop
videotaped or computer disks with images from the video microscopy equipment and
digital imaging system. This will allow teachers, who do not have this equipment
in their classrooms, to have this equipment in their classrooms, to have use of
the equipment. Significance of activity to the advancement of education
Currently, few biology courses at Southwest Missouri State University use
computer-based technologies in their laboratories. In some cases, secondary
schools have more technology in their classroom than teachers have experienced
using in their university preparation. This equipment will not only provide more
opportunities for preservice teachers to use the equipment, but will allow these
students to develop lessons and integrate the equipment into their tracking. In
addition, they will be able to develop their teaching skills by presenting
training workshops and demonstrations to other teachers. By offering workshops
to graduate teaching assistants, the equipment may also be used in majors
biology courses. Inservice teachers will have the opportunity to learn how to
use the equipment and to produce videotapes and computer files of images and
laboratory exercises to use in their classrooms. This equipment will provide
learning opportunities in biology and in integrating technology into teaching.
