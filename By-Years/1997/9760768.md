Reveo Inc. will develop a novel Cholesteric Liquid Crystal(CLC) broadband
polariser with high extinction ratio in a wide incident angle range. A novel
concept which combines reflection and transmission properties of CLC films to
significantly enhance the angular performance of these polarisers will be
explored, to produce these polarisers. This technology is expected to provide
further brightness enhancement in backlit Liquid Crystal Displays and eliminate
the current problem of chromaticity distortion. This technology has potential to
impact the multi billion dollar civilian and defense display market.
