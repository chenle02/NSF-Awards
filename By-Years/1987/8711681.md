The research involves a method of quantitative flow visualization combining
optics and computer-aided image and data analysis for investigation of flow
phenomena. In the research a modern method of measuring flow velocity and its
related properties, called "flow imaging" is used. Flow imaging is an emerging
technique for accurate measurements of the flow field. The research is to create
a system that can provide quantitative measurements of the whole flow field by
integrating and utilizing the recent advances in optics, video, photography, and
computer data processing. Problems with both hardware and software necessitates
an initial study of flows about which much is known so that accuracy of the
technique can be verified. This project is one supported under the Creativity
Awards for Undergraduate Engineering Students.
