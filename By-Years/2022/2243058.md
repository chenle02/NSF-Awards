This research project will develop statistical methodologies and associated
theories that facilitate the analysis of spatial data for socioeconomic
problems. The project is motivated by common features found in many modern
datasets, such as the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey, data from
the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, and County Health Rankings &amp; Roadmaps
data. These public-use datasets are enormous and have hidden homogeneity
features on many different demographic and economic indicators, at different
spatial locations and different time periods. This project will provide a
general formulation and a flexible machine learning toolbox for exploring latent
heterogeneity and subgroups and discovering hidden patterns within subgroups of
spatial data. Students will be recruited, especially from underrepresented
groups, to participate in the research. New courses on spatio-temporal
statistics and geographic information systems and user-friendly software
packages will be developed. The project will advance knowledge within the
statistical sciences, and the research results will be of value to the work of
government agencies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project will develop a
geographically adaptive concave fusion penalized (GACP) learning method that can
simultaneously estimate the model parameters and recover the latent memberships.
Based on the GACP learning, the project will pursue three specific research
topics, and the newly developed methodology will be applied to different
socioeconomic problems. In the first topic, the project will develop a
generalized optimization estimation approach based on the GACP learning for
spatially varying coefficient models with a latent grouping structure. In the
second topic, the project will extend the newly developed framework to
compositional covariates to explore heterogeneous effects of Intersectoral Gross
Domestic Product contributions on Gini coefficients over subregions in the
United States. In the third topic, the project will derive a joint estimation
and clustering procedure of Lorenz curves across different states in the US. The
project will establish consistency and asymptotic distributions for the newly
developed estimators and will develop eï¬€icient algorithms for optimization. This
project will advance the frontiers of spatial heterogeneity learning for
socioeconomic problems. The knowledge gained from this research will benefit
regional economic policy and other complex socioeconomic
problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
