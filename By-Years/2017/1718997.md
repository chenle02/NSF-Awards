The operating system (OS) kernel is the security-critical foundation of a
computer system. Unfortunately, errors in the kernel software of commodity
operating systems like Windows and Linux can allow a malicious attacker to take
over the whole system. This research project is developing new techniques to
eliminate certain types of critical errors from commodity OS kernels in a way
that is both mathematically provable and efficient.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
researchers are developing a unique combination of static and dynamic techniques
to provide practical spatial memory safety for commodity OS kernels. These
techniques include a new type system which guarantees that for every kernel
module all its memory accesses are within bounds and the corresponding access
type (read, write, execute) is allowed by the module's capabilities. This is
achieved by automatically inserting necessary runtime checks during compilation.
Since these new checks introduce performance overhead, the project includes
additional techniques to reduce the overhead. The first optimization approach is
utilizing software compartmentalization and model checking to eliminate
redundant checks. The second optimization is adopting Intel MPX (memory
protection extension), a new and commercially available hardware feature to
reduce the cost of runtime checks.
