This renewal grant in the Organic Dynamics Program provides support for the
research of Dr. Gene Wubbels of Grinnell College. The project will engage six
undergraduates in organic synthesis, photochemistry, isolation and
characterization of reaction products and measurement of reaction kinetics and
will take place in a well-equipped, non-graduate department that has been a
significant baccalaureate source of Ph.D.'s in chemistry. The theme of the
research is catalysis of homogeneous photochemical reactions and mechanisms of
nucleophilic aromatic photosubstitution. The research will continue to explore
the novel subject of catalysis in photochemistry by determining the nature of
Bronsted Catalysis Law plots, obtaining definitive evidence for electron hole
transfer catalysis involving hydroxide ion, and elucidating the structural
requirements governing a case in which base catalysis competes with quenching.
Intermediate structures involved in intramolecular photodisplacement of hydrogen
on an aromatic ring will be elucidated and the "element effect" on nucleophilic
aromatic photosubstitution will be measured for the first time.
