The World Wide Web is fast becoming the de facto repository of preference for
on-line information, yet the technology of the Web has inadvertently created
barriers for people with disabilities. Under this funding, the World Wide Web
Consortium will create an International Program Office for coordinating five
Web-related activities: (1) Technology development; (2) Development of tools;
(3) Guidelines for the use of the technology; (4) Educational outreach; and (5)
Research and advanced development. The Consortium will combine its own
membership funds with those of foundations, industrial sponsors, the US
Government, and the European Commission to fund the International Program
Office. This office will have its own director, with its own budget, but will be
housed in and fully integrated with the Consortium. Staff members who coordinate
the evolution of the Web protocols will work with the International Program
Office to ensure that the evolution removes, rather than reinforces,
accessibility barriers.
