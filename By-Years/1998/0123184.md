This award, provided by the Office of Polar Programs (OPP) of the National
Science Foundation (NSF), provides support for U.S. participation in an
international workshop and associated planning activities of the Antarctic
Neotectonics (ANTEC) initiative. The goal of the ANTEC program is to improve
understanding of the unique character of the neotectonic regime of the Antarctic
plate, including measurement of, and discrimination between, glacial and
tectonic kinematic signals, mapping the structure of the Antarctic lithosphere
and asthenosphere, investigating the stress field and seismotectonic features of
the Antarctic plate, and understanding the nature of coupling between tectonics,
climate and erosion. A workshop at the Certosa di Pontignano, Siena, Italy, will
bring together scientists active in Antarctic neotectonics research to assess
the current status of neotectonic research programs, and to develop a detailed
science plan for future research. Nearly 45% of the research projects currently
funded by the Antarctic Geology and Geophysics Program of NSF-OPP are either
focused directly on, or are pertinent to, Antarctic neotectonic science themes.
Consequently, broad representation of the U.S. research community at the ANTEC
workshop is important. Funds provided by this award will support U.S.
participation in the workshop and will cover costs associated with dissemination
of the workshop results through publication of a workshop report, a brochure
summarizing the ANTEC initiative, and via the ANTEC web
site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
