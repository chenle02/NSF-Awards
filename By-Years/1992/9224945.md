The objective of this Workshop on Earthquake Site Response and Seismic Code
Provisions, November 18-20, 1992, University of Southern California, concerns
the effects of site response on earthquake ground motions; the aim is to develop
recommendations for modifications to existing design guidelines and codes for
earthquake site response. It follows on from the Site Effects Workshop held at
the University of New York at Buffalo in 1991. Financial support for this
workshop is provided by the National Science Foundation, the National Center for
Earthquake Engineering Research (NCEER), the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and
the Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC). The need to examine the soil
categories and site factors (S factors) used in building code site response
provisions arises from: (a) concerns with the existing definitions of site
factors, and (b) the fact that current building code provisions (that is, soil
factors S1 through S3) were developed in the mid-1970's (S4 was added following
the 1985 Mexico earthquake). The need for this workshop is further highlighted
by the accumulation in recent years of extensive research data and new knowledge
on site response effects. It is strongly supported by committees involved in:
(a) the planned 1994 revision of the NEHRP (National Earthquake Hazard Reduction
Program) Recommended Provisions for The Development of Seismic Regulations for
New Buildings; and (b) by the Structural Engineers Association of California's
(SEAOC) 1993 planned revision of the "Blue Book". The results from this workshop
will provide essential input and recommendations to these committees'
activities. The workshop involves geotechnical engineers, seismologists and
structural engineers. It is planned to publish the workshop proceedings in March
1993.
