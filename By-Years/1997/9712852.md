9712852 Benoit This project addresses the evaluation of a novel field technique
to be used at the Treasure Island National Geotechnical Experimentation Site
(NGES) in San Francisco, California; the objective being to evaluate the insitu
void ratio and soil fabric at this site. This technique consists of vertical and
horizontal measurements of soil electrical resistivity using two specially
instrumented piezocones simultaneously pushed into the ground. The method,
designed by a research group in Italy at the Hydraulic and Structural Research
Center of the Italian Electricity Agency (ENEL-CRIS), allows continuous
electrical resistivity measurements in the vertical direction for each probe and
in the horizontal direction between the two probes. The results, using
groundwater and soil samples, are calibrated against laboratory tests on samples
reconstituted at various densities. This field technique permits a large volume
of soil to be tested, avoiding the unwanted remolding effects surrounding the
device. Because of the difficulty in obtaining undisturbed insitu samples for
laboratory testing of sands, this insitu method shows great potential in
providing parameters needed for the prediction of the dynamic response of soils
subjected to earthquake loading. The potential of this insitu electrical
resistivity cone penetration test to provide new soil parameters to evaluate the
earthquake response of natural sand deposits will advance the state-of-the-art
and permit rapid and cost- effective methods for characterization of
cohesionless soils.
