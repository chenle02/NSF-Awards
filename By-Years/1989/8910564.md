This award provides continuing support for a broad research program aimed at
improving numerical models of tropospheric and stratospheric circulations. The
long-term benefit will be the improvement in our ability to predict weather and
climate. The project consists of three major thrusts. The first involves a
variety of problems related to dynamical and computational aspects of
atmospheric modeling, with the focus being the development, application, and
evaluation of an isentropic coordinate model. Using an isentropic coordinate
system allows one to overcome certain computational problems associated with
other coordinate systems which can affect the accuracy of the representation of
dynamical processes in the model. Another exciting part of this activity is the
construction of a hybrid-coordinate model that combines the isentropic model
with a variable depth planetary boundary layer model. The second major area
involves the parameterization of subgrid-scale processes involving (1)
orography, and (2) moisture, with emphasis on the three-way interactions between
convective-scale, mesoscale and large-scale circulations under various types of
flow patterns and surface boundary conditions. This will be done as a
combination of statistical studies of observed conditions and numerical
simulations. Finally, the principal investigators will incorporate a number of
the new parameterizations into the UCLA general circulation model.
