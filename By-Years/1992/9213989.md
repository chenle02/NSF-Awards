This Science in Developing Countries Program award will support Silvia Salgado
Gonzalez to carry out dissertation research on the nature and evolution of
sociopolitical complexity among precolumbian groups of Pacific Nicaragua.
Ethnohistorical sources suggest that the sociopolitical organization of the area
corresponded to complex chiefdoms, but the archaeological data to explain the
evolution and operation of these politics is lacking. The project will provide
new data on one of the most poorly- known areas in Central America and, more
importantly, it will contribute to the ongoing debate on the nature of the
evolution of complexity in Southeastern Mesoamerica and Lower Central America.
This is a cooperative project between SUNY-Albany, and the National Museum and
the Patrimonio Historico of Nicaragua. It will provide training in field and
laboratory archaeological methods and techniques to Nicaraguan students, enlarge
the archaeological program of the Nicaraguan institutions involved, and expand
the research interests of the Department of Anthropology and the Institute of
Mesoamerican Studies at SUNY. ***//
