The goal of this research is the development of a toolkit based on formal
methods for aiding designers in developing floating point arithmetic hardware
and software. A novel feature of this research is the introduction of theorem
proving techniques directly into the design process. The toolkit includes a
formalized version of the IEEE floating point specification and theorems that
reason about that specification.
