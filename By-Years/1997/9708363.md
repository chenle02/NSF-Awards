Professor Doren of the University of Delaware is being supported by the
Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to continue his work using
theoretical methods to address reactive and non-reactive chemistry that occurs
on semiconductor surfaces. During the next grant period Doren will use
computational methods, based primarily on Density Functional Theory, to address
certain aspects of the surface chemistry on silicon and germanium. A major
component of this new work will be concentrated on the recombinative desorption
of hydrogen. Specifically the role of an excited electronic state will be
investigated as part of the kinetics and dynamics of this process. The scope of
this project will also address similarities and differences in the behavior of
silicon and germanium. The computational approach used will utilize both a
finite cluster as well as periodic slabs in the calculations. The immediate
objective of Doren's research is to develop reliable methods for calculating
mechanisms and rates of reactions on silicon surfaces, and to apply them to
several examples which are important in semiconductor device fabrication. A
mechanistic understanding of silicon surface chemistry will be essential for
developing new semiconductor technologies that require unprecedented control
over the properties of these materials.
