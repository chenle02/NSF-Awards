AST-0349075&lt;br/&gt;Stassun&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Keivan Stassun, at Vanderbilt
University, will execute a multi-faceted, collaborative research plan, involving
both observational and numerical research components, with the goal of
addressing order-of-magnitude problems in star formation. In his research, he
will address:&lt;br/&gt;1. Empirical determinations of masses for low-mass pre-
main-sequence stars: 2. Angular momentum evolution of young stars: 3.
Interpretive 3-D computer models of protostellar environments. Leveraging extant
Vanderbilt resources, this work encompasses a broad, international research
program that will provide measurements of masses and angular momenta for young
stars, as well as state-of-the-art computer simulations of the complex
environments of protostars. These measurements will then be used in simulations
to test forefront theories of star formation and early stellar
evolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Stassun will execute a coherent, systemic
education and outreach plan, integrated into the research, with the goal of
addressing the order-of-magnitude under representation of minorities in
astronomy and astrophysics. His work will: 1. Enhance science learning for
minority K-12 students: 2. Increase professional development opportunities for
K-12 science teachers, especially those teaching at minority high-schools: 3.
Train a cadre of minority undergraduate and Masters-level students for PhD study
in astronomy and astrophysics: 4. Prepare graduate students for their future
roles integrating research and education. This ambitious plan will be made
possible by working in partnership with nearby Fisk University, an Historically
Black University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
