This grant provides funds to organize the 2011 Technical Conference for the
Society of Engineering Science (SES). The conference will take place on October
12-14, 2011 at the Norris Center at Northwestern University. The SES conference
facilitates the free exchange of information on all aspects of engineering
science and provides a forum for discussion, education, and recognition of the
talents of the engineering science community. The SES conference promotes the
development and strengthening of the interfaces between various disciplines in
engineering, sciences, and mathematics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Consistent with
the SES mission, the 2011 SES Technical Conference will actively seek the
participation of groups underrepresented in science and engineering (e.g.,
underrepresented minorities, women, and persons with disabilities). This will be
achieved by (1) targeting historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs)
around the country, (2) encouraging faculty members to identify promising
undergraduate students with an interest in pursuing graduate studies and (3)
providing travel assistance to undergraduate and graduate students, particularly
those of underrepresented minorities, women, and persons with disabilities. The
funds requested are for this purpose.
