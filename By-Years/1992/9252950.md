This Wisconsin Genetics Education Program has been responsible for the
development of genetics activities which have been developed by classroom
teachers, K-12. These activities have taken place over the past six years and
consequently many activities will be generated and/or revised to make them
suitable for the appropriate grade level. These materials will be integrated
into existing science texts. The materials address genetics in several contexts.
Some integrate content with arts or language curricula; many address issues of
genetics in social and personal contexts. They are suited for all levels of
students and all ability levels, K-12. In addition to the development of
genetics modules, workshops illustrating project use will be held at national
professional conferences in order to share these and other activities with pre-
college teachers.
