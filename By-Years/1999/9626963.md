This research pursues some questions which are related to and inspired in part
by discussions the P.I., Dr. Diane Meuser, has had and and continue to have with
Professor Kazhdan and Professor Mazur of Harvard University. Professor Meuser is
studying properties of a generalized p-adic local Igusa zeta function. A special
case is the "p-adic volume" of a variety which is the integral of the analytic
differential w on a compact analytic variety X and it is this case that she has
been discussing with Kazhdan and Mazur. A special case she is working on in
detail is the generalized zeta function in the case where X is an elliptic curve
and w is the unique invariant differential on the elliptic curve. Interactive
activities include: involvement with graduate and undergraduate women through a
Women in Mathematics organization, and serving as a faculty advisor to a
residence hall at Harvard University.
