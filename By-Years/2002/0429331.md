This award provides funding to the State University of New York, University at
Buffalo (UB) to acquire three 22 kip, hydraulic dynamic actuators (each with a
stroke of +/- 1 meter, velocity of +/-2.5 meters/second, and acceleration of +/-
3 g's) and a one-story test structure for nonstructural component testing at the
George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) UB
real-time hybrid seismic testing facility that will be operated by NEES
Consortium, Inc., as a national shared use facility during FY 2005 - FY 2014.
This equipment will be used in conjunction with the 9.1-meter tall by 12-meter
wide reaction wall, 12-meter by 24-meter strong floor, and the extensive array
of dynamic/seismic sensors available at the UB NEES facility. The equipment
capabilities were selected based on a study of motions observed in selected
buildings during past earthquakes. This equipment will be available to the
earthquake engineering research community through the NEES Consortium, Inc., UB
NEES facility. This award is funded by the NSF NEES Major Research Equipment and
Facilities Construction (MREFC) project and is a component of the National
Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP)
