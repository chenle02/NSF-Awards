In this three-year U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research project in physiological
processes between Irena Cosic, Boris Kidrich Institute for Nuclear Science, and
Michael Baker, University of California, San Diego, the investigators will study
the structures of the steriod receptor and its interaction with promoter sites
on DNA. They will use a new approach for sequence analysis of proteins developed
by the Yugoslav scientist and traditional computer analyses of proteins done by
the U.S. scientist in their research. The results will advance understanding of
the role of steriod processes in metabolic regulation, sodium and potassium
levels, reproductive physiology and growth of certain tumors. This project was
approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on Cooperation in Science and
Technology and is supported through a joint fund consisting of matching
contributions from the governments of the United States and Yugoslavia. The U.S.
contribution is provided annually by the Department of State. No NSF funds are
involved. Grants are made to the principal scientific institution in Yugoslavia,
but include dollar funds for U.S. scientist travel to Yugoslavia and for
Yugoslav scientists' living expenses in the U.S.
