The shared memory computation model provides an attractive alternative to the
message passing model such that the techniques learned from parallel
computations can be applied to distributed computation problems. In a
distributed environment, node failures are more often than in a tightly-coupled
multiprocessor system due to man-made downtime. The fault recovery issue should
be dealt with in order to make the shared memory computation model feasible for
distributed environments. The objectives of this project are (1) to develop a
low overhead concurrent checkpointing scheme with a controllable checkpoint
interval and no global synchronization; (2) to design a recoverable distributed
shared memory system based on the new checkpointing scheme; (3) to build an
experimental system to examine the engineering issues related to building such
systems; (4) to evaluate different checkpointing schemes, with benchmark
applications; and (5) to explore potential distributed applications, based on
shared memory computations.
