This award provides funds to the Biology department of Temple University to
support as an REU site for a combined academic year and summer program of
undergraduate research. This program will draw on the department's extensive
experience with undergraduate research as part of the academic year research
program, and also incorporate elements of the Temple University Basic Science
Summer Minority Program which has been in effect for the past two years. The
goal of this program is to provide a rich research environment and a sense of
community among promising students in order to encourage them to enter careers
in the biological sciences. To achieve this goal, the program will have two
major components. The first of these is continued academic year participation in
research projects by students enrolled at Temple. The second is an intensive
Summer research program which will reach out to students beyond Temple. Academic
year students will have the opportunity to participate in the Summer program. In
both components, special effort will be made to attract underrepresented
minority students.
