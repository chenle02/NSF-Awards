Early Cambrian small shelly fossils have been recovered from late Precambrian
to early Paleozoic strata of the southwestern Taoudeni Basin, Senegal and
Guinea, West Africa. Folded and faulted lateral correlatives of these strata are
incorporated in the polyorogenic (late Precambrian to late Paleozoic)
Mauritanide fold belt. P.I. will conduct a detailed sampling program of the
fossiliferous strata and undertake paleontological and sedimentological analyses
to further document the faunas and to determine the environments of deposition
of the containing strata. The project will add to our knowledge of the
stratigraphy of Paleozoic basins and fold belts in West Africa. It will refine
our understanding of the distribution of earliest Cambrian small shelly fossils
and help to test previously proposed provincial schemes. The project will also
result in interpretations of the environments in which these organisms lived,
died and accummulated as fossils.
