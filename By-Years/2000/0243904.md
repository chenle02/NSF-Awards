The Physics Department of the University of California at Davis will host
undergraduates for a summer research experience. The ultimate goal is to
encourage students to continue studying physics through and beyond the college
level. The program will give students views of physics not seen in typical
coursework: first-hand experience of the joys and frustrations of research, and
information about several types of physics careers. The program will support ten
students per year for the next three years, with half recruited from two-year
and four-year colleges in northern California and the remainder recruited
nationally from four-year colleges and universities. The heart of the program is
a research project, supervised by one or more faculty members, in condensed
matter physics, biophysics, geophysics, environmental physics, nuclear physics,
high energy physics, or cosmology. Supplementary activities will include
introductory talks giving overviews of current physics research areas, lunch
meetings to encourage discussion about the students' research projects, and
visits to nearby national laboratories and industry to illustrate careers open
to trained physicists. The program will conclude with research presentations by
the students, given at a combined session with another ten-student summer
program aimed at science and engineering undergraduates from community colleges.
