Blanch 0337080 Sea sponges are a prolific source of compounds with high
potential therapeutic value. Over the past decade, compounds have been isolated
from sponge extracts with potent anti-mitotic, anti viral and antibacterial
properties. However, due to environmental constraints and accessibility,
insufficient sponge biomass is available from which to extract these compounds
for testing and clinical trials. To date, there are no immortalized sponge cell
lines and techniques for cell cultivation are still in their infancy. This
project is to carry out exploratory studies on the adaptation of modern tissue
engineering techniques, particularly the recent developments in three-
dimensional scaffold materials, to cultivate cells of the sea sponge Axinella
corrugata in vitro.
