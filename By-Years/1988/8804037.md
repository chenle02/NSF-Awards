Occidental College is being supported to establish a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) SITE. The purpose of this SITE is to provide meaningful
hands-on research opportunities in contemporary chemistry for outstanding
undergraduate students under the supervision of experienced research chemists.
For the summer of 1988, the program will support 9 students recruited from
Occidental and other institutions. Research activities will include studies in
the following areas: o Pd(O)-assisted synthesis of chiral carboxylic nucleosides
o Kinetics and mechanism of electrophilic aromatic substitution o Spectroscopy
of metal-binding proteins o Photochemistry of furocoumarin o Aluminum analysis
by metastable nitrogen transfer emmision spectrometry o Synthesis of transition
metal organometallics o Thermodynamics and control of ligand binding to human
erythrocyte glucose-6-phosphate
