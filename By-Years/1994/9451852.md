9451852 Lemons A significant mismatch exists between what traditional A&P
courses offer and what many non-traditional students need. As a result, these
students are not learning how systems function, but are memorizing many facts
about them. We propose innovative laboratories which present function first in
the context of a broad organizing theme, and then introduce anatomical and
physiological details to explain the function. We begin with hands-on
investigations using physical models and then progress to computer simulation,
anatomical correlations and experiments. This reverses the traditional order of
learning, helping students move from concrete experiences to formal thinking
about dynamic physiological processes. The centerpiece of these new laboratories
are Multi-purpose Laboratory Workstations based on the Macintosh Quadra 660AV
with CD-ROM, running LabView and multi-media software, and connected to the
Virtual Scientist interface which conditions signals from a variety of
transducers and controls experiments and models. This proposal is complementary
to a CCD project entitled, "Developing critical thinking and content mastery in
non-traditional students: a comprehensive, technologically enhanced approach."
It will allow us to outfit the laboratories with equipment necessary to
implement the new A&P curriculum we are developing.
