While warped disks and gaseous rings of spiral galaxies are rare, where they
exist they can be powerful diagnostics of dynamical processes which apply in all
galaxies. They are also being discovered with increasing frequency. This grant
provides partial support for an international conference of active workers
studying these puzzling objects. The proximity of the Pittsburgh Supercomputing
Center to the meeting is expected to stimulate fruitful interactions between
specialists in numerical simulation and observers, particularly those
specializing in studies of the motion and distribution of neutral hydrogen.
