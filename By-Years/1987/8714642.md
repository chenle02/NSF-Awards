A workshop on Environmental Chemical Processes will be held September 25-27,
1987 in Tahoe, Nevada. The focus of this meeting will be on the chemistry needed
to define and solve environmental problems. Condensed phase environmental
problems will be provided equal billing with gas phase environmental challenges.
The pivotal position of chemistry in basic environmental chemistry research will
be the premier concern of the workshop. A report summarizing the findings of the
workshop will be a technical reference for scientists examining options to
improve and protect the nation's environment and will be a guide for chemists in
academia, industry and government to research opportunities that are ripe for
investigation in the study of environmental processes. Participants in the
workshop will be from academia, industry, and government.
