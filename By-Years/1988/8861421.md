A key consideration in a variety of manufacturing processes is controlling
either the position or shape of an interface defined as the boundary between
liquid and solid materials of dissimilar composition or density to within
certain allowable tolerances. Examples of such diverse processes are vertical
freeze Bridgman and Czochralski crystal growth Electroslag remelting for metal
refinement. A technique based on gamma ray transmission is ideal to provide
information regarding interface position and curvature. However, existing
methods that provide positional information are not suitable for application
towards industrial automation. A method to monitor and subsequently control and
interface boundary using an appropriate gamma ray emitting radioisotope and a
rugged semiconductor detector will be developed. The detector will be either a
modified version of an existing device or a new unit, developed in-house, with
superior detection performance capabilities. Research will focus on the
development of gamma ray transport models and algorithms that will determine
what the ideal component properties needed to fulfill specific requirements in
terms of position resolution, detection efficiency and a timely presentation of
the measured gamma ray intensity. Experiments will be performed to demonstrate
measurement capabilities such as sensitivity to small changes in either
interface curvature or density.
