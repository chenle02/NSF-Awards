This award provides support for participants in a sequence of three regional
conferences in applied mathematics to be held in the upstate New York area.
These three meetings of the New York Conference on Applied Mathematics are to be
held at the:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* State University of New York, Buffalo, on
Saturday, April 16, 2011;&lt;br/&gt;* Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute on
Saturday, April 14, 2012; and&lt;br/&gt;* Cornell University on Saturday, April
13, 2013.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference programs, which will include talks
in mathematical biology, imaging science, fluid mechanics, applications of
dynamical systems, network theory, and numerical analysis, will also feature
poster sessions, brief "research advertisement" presentations, and panel
discussions on open problems and future directions in applied and computational
mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference series will strengthen ties
between applied mathematicians and scientists working in the upstate New York
region and will allow researchers and students to stay abreast of a wide array
of advances in applied and computational mathematics. The meetings encourage and
support participation by students, junior researchers, and members of groups
underrepresented in mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference web site:
