The proposed Second Symposium on Intelligence and Security Informatics
(ISI-2004) aims to provide an intellectual forum for discussion among usually
disparate communities: academic researchers in information technologies,
computer science, public policy, and social sciences; local, state, and federal
law enforcement and intelligence experts; and information technology industry
consultants and practitioners. The speakers and attendees, including noted
informatics, computer science, and policy researchers as well as progressive
leaders in law enforcement and security communities will engage in productive
dialogue and explore avenues of collaboration. The organizers of the meeting
will solicit high-quality research papers of relevance to intelligence and
security research, which will be evaluated by appropriate researchers and
practitioners for presentation as well as publication. Active intelligence and
security informatics research can and will improve knowledge discovery and
dissemination, and enhance information sharing and collaboration across law
enforcement communities; the Second ISI Symposium supports that outcome.
