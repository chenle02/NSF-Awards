Two hormones control the cycles of growth, molting and regeneration in arthropod
animals (insects and crustaceans). In crustaceans, one of the hormones is
ecdycsone, chemically a steroid, that directly controls the cycles. Ecdysone is
secreted by glands (Y-organs) in the body cavity. Secretion by the Y-organs is
controlled in turn by the second hormone, molt-inhibiting hormone (MIH) which is
chemically a protein and is secreted by specialized nerve cells in the brain.
This system is analogous to that in the human and other vertebrates (adrenal
cortex, ovary and testis) that secrete steroid hormones and that are governed by
protein hormones from the brain/pituitary gland. However, the crustacean system
is simpler in cell structure and metabolism. For this reason, the system is
being used as a model for studying the details of how cells take up cholesterol
(the universal precursor of steroid hormones) and process it for hormone
synthesis, and how neural hormones control these events. The focus of this
project is to uncover the mechanism by which cholesterol enters Y-organ cells in
light of findings that cholesterol is presented to the cells bound up in high-
density lipo-protein (HDL). Specific receptors for HDL on the cell surface, how
the complex is broken down in the cell and how and where the freed cholesterol
is processed into hormone will be examined. Attendant studies will explore how
MIH modifies cell function to slow or stop hormone biosynthesis. In this regard,
crustaceans appear to be unique among animals; a theoretically significant
aspect of this model is that the brain hormone (MIH) regulates negatively,
whereas in all other known systems the corresponding hormone is stimulatory.
Techniques will include use of radioactive tracers, the electron microscope, the
ultracentrifuge and high-pressure liquid chromatography. This research embraces
the fields of neurobiology, endocrinology and developmental biology in
addressing basic questions on coordination of bodily functions. Results should
have eventual application of clinical medicine in the areas of steroid
endocrinology, reproductive physiology, pathologies of glands and
atherosclerosis (arising from defects in cholesterol metabolism). Also,
knowledge gained will add to understanding the arthropod molting/growth cycle, a
developmental process that dominates the existance of this abundant,
economically important group of animals.
