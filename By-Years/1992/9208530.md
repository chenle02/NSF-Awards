The focus of this research is the synthesis of of an array of fully fluorinated
compounds having skeletons with four to twelve carbon atoms. Representative
molecules contain conjugated pi-electron systems and polycyclic skeletons
composed of small strained rings. Studies of the compounds will include
determination of product composition, kinetic and thermodynamic measurements and
quantum mechanical calculations. Comparison of the fluorocarbons with their
hydrocarbon counterparts will shed light on the nature of fluorine as a
substituent in organic chemistry. %%% With this award, the Synthetic Organic
Program is supporting the research of Dr. David M. Lemal of the Department of
Chemistry at Dartmouth College. Professor Lemal will focus his work on gaining
insight into the nature and chemistry of fluorocarbons.
