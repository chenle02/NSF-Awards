Software is an integral part of every life, from cell phones in everyone's
pocket to autonomous cars that have already driven millions of miles to embedded
software enabling smart home appliances. Developers are prone to making mistakes
and introducing bugs to the software, making automated software validation
techniques essential to ensure delivering reliable software. Software testing is
the activity of finding and fixing software bugs is an important activity for
software developers. With the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the
potential power of Machine Learning (ML) in understanding and predicting bug
patterns in code, software testing and debugging are gradually moving towards
learning-based techniques, i.e., neural testing and debugging of software. This
research project will address fundamental challenges in automated software
testing and debugging by leveraging AI, and will develop new insights for
semantically robust and interpretable neural testing and
debugging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combining theory building, empirical data-driven
research, and tool building, this research aims to (1) design semantically
robust neural models of code and develop systematic approaches for high-quality
dataset generation, (2) develop several techniques to construct deep test
oracles for functional and non-functional testing, and (3) design interpretation
techniques for extracting and reusing the knowledge of neural models to unify
testing and debugging. These overarching ideas can make software testing and
debugging smarter and faster, significantly impacting how researchers and
practitioners improve software quality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
