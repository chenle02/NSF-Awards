This research, aimed at advancing our understanding of how cultural forms
interact with social institutions, will examine the ways an established cultural
form (the English novel) was imported into, and reconstructed within, a new
social setting (Nigeria and the English- speaking West Indies). The data to be
analyzed include: the texts of all Nigerian and West Indian novels written
between 1950 and 1985; the backgrounds and careers of authors; the location and
organization of publishers; and the socioeconomic characteristics of readers of
fiction. Using content analysis, archival research, and the results of
questionnaires administered to authors, editors, and other book-trade
professionals, the research will develop a model of how transmitted and
indigenous cultural materials interact under specific institutional conditions
to construct new cultural forms. The results should be relevant cultural forms
other than literature, such as artistic, religious and ideological transmissions
and reconstructions.
