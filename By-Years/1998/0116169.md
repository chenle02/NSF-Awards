0116169 Dickinson These studies focus on fundamental mechanisms and applications
of nanometer scale surface manipulation involving combined stimuli, where the
tip of a scanning force microscope stimulates the surface in the presence of an
aggressive chemical solution. These combined stimuli can make and break bonds
and reorganize material on surfaces of single crystals, glasses, and polymers in
a highly localized fashion. We will examine the role of crystalline and other
structural defects (e.g., steps, kinks, vacancies, and nanostructures generated
by the tip) in dissolution and growth to identify the rate limiting steps (with
and without stimulation by the SFM tip) and how they depend on stress, solution
chemistry, and temperature. These results will be related to fundamental
physical and chemical parameters governing dissolution and growth, such as
activation energies and volume/entropic factors. We also will examine how the
apparently random mechanical vibrations in cantilevers during scanning might be
related to transient surface phenomena in supersaturated solutions. These
studies have considerable promise in the development of new methods for
generating atomically flat surfaces, constructing novel nanometer structures,
and producing textured surfaces for bonding and chemically active arrangements.
The studies also support atomic level understanding of the technologically
important process of chemical mechanical polishing (CMP), where the SFM tip
serves as a model abrasive particle. Sensor development, MEMS, and development
of new biologically active substrates and surfaces will benefit from the
improved molecular-level understanding of dissolution and growth resulting from
this work. ***
