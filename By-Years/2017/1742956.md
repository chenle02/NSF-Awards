This project is focused on investigating the physical and chemical
characteristics of biomass burning emissions in the period before flaming
combustion ignites. Pre-ignition emissions are likely to be responsible for a
substantial fraction of the organic aerosol released to the atmosphere from the
burning of solid fuels. The results of this project will be described in two
instructional videos to communicate the principles of pre-ignition emissions.
This information will be used to inform and educate many in the developing
world, that largely rely on solid fuels for cooking and heating, of possible
methods for reducing potential exposures to toxic air pollutants from biomass
burning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of this effort are to: (1) develop
a controlled-temperature generator that simulates the physical factors
controlling biomass emissions at ignition; (2) develop a "sufficiently
empirical" model that predicts emission rates and quantities; (3) confirm
factors that control emissions prior to ignition, and identify low- and high-
emitting conditions, using capabilities developed during the project; (4)
conduct a community comparison experiment to characterize pre-ignition
emissions; and (5) develop two low- bandwidth videos to communicate best
practices for achieving low emissions.
