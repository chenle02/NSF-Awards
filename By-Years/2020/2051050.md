This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site award to Louisiana State
University, located in Baton Rouge, LA, supports the training of 8 students for
10 weeks during the summers of 2021-2024. In this program, funded by the
Division of Chemistry, participants will pursue interdisciplinary research
projects in chemistry, mechanical engineering, and architecture. Students will
be mentored by faculty and gain hands-on experience by working closely with
graduate students and postdocs. Participants also will receive professional
development and ethics training, focusing on research and scientific
communication skills and graduate school. Through independent research projects,
workshops, and a seminar series, this site strives to broaden participation and
prepare students for graduate school and future STEM careers.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduate research students at this site will
undertake research projects across science and engineering, concentrated on
smart polymer composite materials and structures. Planned projects include the
design, synthesis, modeling, and characterization of smart polymer composites
with sensing, actuating, healing, and adapting capabilities. Additionally,
students will engage in weekly meetings, research facility tours, and a workshop
series on topics including research ethics and poster design. Social and
cultural exchange events are planned to promote inclusivity and networking
opportunities for a diverse group of future STEM leaders. Students will
communicate their research findings to a broad audience of students, faculty,
and staff at a university-wide summer research forum. This site aims to attract
diverse cohorts with an emphasis on recruiting from HBCUs or other minority-
serving institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
