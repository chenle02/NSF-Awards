Automate! responds to local and global needs of both industry and education. For
industry, the Metropolitan Community College (MCC) BAS IT degree option is
preparing skilled technicians for a variety of careers demanding strong
foundations in IT concepts and skills - from critical facilities operations to
advanced manufacturing, network security, energy management, and continuous
commissioning. Upon completion of the BAS option IT Associates, graduates are
prepared for a wide range of IT-enhanced careers such as managing interoperable
facilities systems, advanced manufacturing operations, network security, general
IT systems, and critical facilities such as data centers.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MCC and partners are developing, field testing, and
delivering learning resources for technician training through a new Building
Automation Systems (BAS) option within an Information Technology Associates
Degree. The primary audiences for the developed resources are two-year college
students, dual credit high school BAS Academy students, and dual credit high
school and college students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eight new BAS-contextualized
IT courses will be developed, including lesson plans, assessments, hands-on
kits, video, and other visual based elements. Access to Automate! resources will
be available through the cloud and through open online venues such as
YouTube.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is examining the effectiveness of the
process of materials development; the impact of the BAS contextualized IT
learning on student enrollment, performance and retention in the BAS option and
the IT Associates degree track; and the value of the BAS technician training to
industry.
