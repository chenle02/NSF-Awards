This project is concerned with the study of nonlinear elliptic and parabolic
equations in connection with more complex problems of differential geometry and
with physical applications. Such problems include the evolution of a
hypersurface in Euclidean (N+1)-space by functions of its principal curvatures,
the Ricci flow on both Riemannian and Lorentzian manifolds, the Yamabe flow on
surfaces, and the Weyl problem with nonnegative Gaussian curvature. Most of the
proposed problems involve equations that are either singular or degenerate,
hence problems for which the classical results fail. New analytical techniques
will be developed in the project.

The project links a wide range of active fields of mathematics, in particular,
nonlinear partial differential equations, geometry, and classical analysis. The
proposed research activity on the geometry and regularity of degenerate
nonlinear parabolic equations and free-boundary problems may lead to significant
geometric and even topological applications. The principal investigator intends
to study the applications of the mathematical problems to other disciplines such
as quantum field theory, relativity theory, plasma physics, image analysis, and
thin liquid film dynamics. Results will be disseminated to the research
community at various meetings and by publication of research articles. New
courses linking partial differential equations and geometric analysis for
graduate students will be designed and implemented.
