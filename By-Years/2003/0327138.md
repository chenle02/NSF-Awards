Sociological research has identified the importance of social networks and
social capital in the allocation of labor market advantages. However, while much
of the empirical and theoretical focus has been on the way that people access
their jobs through their search activities, few have considered those who get
their jobs without searching. These "non-searchers" receive job information
and/or job offers while not actively searching for a job. Not only are these
non-searchers surprisingly prevalent among current jobholders, they also receive
better jobs than those who actively search for their jobs. In order to identify
the characteristics of non-searchers and the nature of the employment advantages
that they receive over active searchers, I will analyze survey data from two
national datasets. Additionally, I will conduct qualitative interviews of newly
hired employees at a multinational finance company to gain a better
understanding of the processes by which people non-search and how these
processes differ from the ways that people actively search for their jobs. I
hypothesize that non-searchers receive some of the best jobs around because
their extensive work contacts provide them with access to exclusive job
information. Plus, contrary to social capital theory, non-searchers are able to
procure this valuable job information without actively searching for their jobs.
In this way, research on non-searchers has the potential for significantly
advancing theories of social capital. Also, research on non-searchers can
enhancing our understanding of social stratification more broadly, providing
insights into race, gender, and class stratification, job allocation, and access
to elite labor market positions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
