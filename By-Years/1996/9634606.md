9634606 Scanlan Description: This award is for the continuation of a U.S.-India
research collaboration in wind engineering between Robert Scanlan of Johns
Hopkins University and Prem Krishna of the University of Roorkee. Experiments
will be conducted at the Corrsin laminar flow wind tunnel at Hopkins and at the
new boundary layer tunnel at Roorkee. The investigators will study the specific
use and interpretation of bridge deck section models and building models in the
respective wind tunnels. Theory developed at Hopkins on the use of flutter
derivatives in determining wind stability will be used relative to section
models at Roorkee and Hopkins. The research will investigate the detailed
geometric forms needed to enhance stability in deck models. Scope: This award
will allow travel between the research sites to complete the agreed upon level
of effort. The funds requested for the entire research project are modest at
about $30,000. This project will continue development of the flutter derivatives
concept, considered a major advance in wind engineering, and extend abroad the
influence of U.S. technology in aerodynamic design. For India, the project will
contribute to developing modelling expertise, technical education, and
improvements in design and construction methods. ***
