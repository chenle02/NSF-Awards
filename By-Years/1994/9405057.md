9405057 Wesnousky The PIs will measure and analyze the signature of isostatic
rebound recorded in the preserved and deflected shorelines of the most recent
high-stand of late-Pleistocene Lake Lahontan, twice the second largest pluvial
lake in the western hemisphere and situated on the edge of the Great Basin. They
will integrate geological observations with physical principles to ultimately
arrive at a measure of the effective elastic thickness of the lithosphere and
the viscosity of the upper mantle material below. ****
