Drs. Atkinson, Lunine, and Hunten at the University of Arizona will use a
special laboratory technique to study detailed characteristics of the absorption
spectrum of methane. The bands selected for study are of interest to
astrophysical and planetary studies. The measurement of molecular abundances in
the atmospheres of the giant planets of the Solar System is a major
astrophysical challenge. Such measurements provide information on the abundances
of elements in those planets, and hence constrain scenarios of their origin. In
addition, the abundances of major constituents such as water or methane
determine the dynamics of the atmospheres of these planets. Interpretation of
astronomical observations of methane from the planets has been hindered by lack
of appropriate laboratory studies. The research of Drs. Atkinson, Lunine, and
Hunten will provide needed laboratory data.
