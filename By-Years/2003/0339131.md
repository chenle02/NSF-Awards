The goal of this U.S.-Czech research project between J. Sanford Rikoon of the
University of Missouri Columbia and Miloslav Lapka of the Institute of Landscape
Ecology, in Ceske Budejovice, is to strengthen the theoretical foundation
required for comparative analysis of new rural development programs,
particularly in marginal regions characterized by low performance on standard
economic and quality-of-life-indicators. This will be accomplished by bringing
together a team of senior and junior U.S. and Czech researchers with
complementary expertise in political ecology, landscape studies, and spatial
analysis. The U.S. -Czech team will undertake a study of U.S. and Central
European rural areas, with an interdisciplinary approach that examines
political, economic, socio-cultural and ecological variables. Results are
expected to blend phenomenological and empirical research in innovative ways to
refine a decision framework that incorporates local and community level
perspectives for more effective and realistic local and regional development
planning. Success would enhance our analysis of alternative schemes and improve
our understanding of the beneficial influence that competing visions expressed
by local individuals and communities can have in resource development decisions.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This interdisciplinary project fulfills the program
objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the United
States and Central Europe to combine complementary talents and share research
resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence. Broader impacts
include the early career exposure of U.S. student participants to cooperative
research abroad that may lead to future partnering with European counterparts on
topics of global importance such as sustainability, tourism development, and
rural economic strategies.
