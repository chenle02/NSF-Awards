This award is for support of a one year study to complete analyses of samples
obtained under a previous grant (DPP-8917581). The analyses to be performed
include accelerator mass spectrometric (AMS) dating of rock samples collected in
Antarctica for exposure age dating. This work will enhance current understanding
of the geologic history of the Dry Valleys and adjacent terrain during the past
7 million years, the period of time accesssible to the mix of isotopes currently
being measured. A sample preparation train dedicated to preparing terrestrial
samples for calcium-41 analyses will also be constructed to allow the addition
of this isotope to the suite of isotopes currently being measured on these
samples (Beryllium-10, Aluminum 26, Chlorine-36, and Carbon-14).
