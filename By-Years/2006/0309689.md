This project's goal is to examine how reader and text characteristics combine to
influence the comprehension of science texts. The study will make use of recent
advances in psychometrics on hierarchical linear models in order to assess the
predictive values of a large number of linguistic properties, reader
characteristics, and the structure of those factors. Through analyses of
individual differences in readers and analyses of text difficulty, the
researchers hope to be able to make progress toward using computer systems to
customized complex texts to individual readers. This, they hope, would make such
texts generally readable to a heterogeneous group of readers. The intellectual
merit of the project is in the multidisciplinary approach that the researchers
adopt in order to address problems in reading comprehension. Bringing
psychometric tools into contact with sentence processing paradigms from
cognitive science has the potential to yield new findings of interest to the
scientific community. The broader impact of the study if successful is that more
people would be able to read and understand science. The development of
diagnostic test to measure the required reading skills for complex texts would
also be beneficial.
