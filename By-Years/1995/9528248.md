In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry
Division, Kinsey will study the dynamics of molecular photodissociation both
experimentally and theoretically. In the experimental studies Dissociative
Resonance Raman Spectroscopy (DRRS) will be used to probe transient processes
involved in the photochemical decomposition of small molecules by detecting the
weak emissions from vibrationally excited states. Light from many vibrational
levels will be accumulated using a newly constructed instrument in order to
obtain a complete description of the dissociation. Mathematical functions called
wavelets will be employed to model photodissociation processes efficiently.
Theoretical studies will aid in interpreting the experimental Raman data, which
will be inverted mathematically to determine the potential energy surface
directly. Photochemical decompositions are among the most fundamental and
important of chemical processes. For example, a detailed elucidation of how
sunlight leads to ozone decomposition is essential if we hope to alter the
environmental consequences of ozone layer depletion. The early stages of such
photochemical reactions are very difficult to study in the laboratory since they
are over in less time than light takes to travel 0.001 inches. Prof. Kinsey's
studies of photochemical decomposition will provide powerful new tools for
gaining insight into reactions which occur on such a fast timescale.
