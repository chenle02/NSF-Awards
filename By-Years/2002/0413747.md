Building on a previous NSF award, the PI will acquire U.S. high-resolution
radiosonde data for gravity wave analysis. This work will give new results on
the information content of 30 m resolution radiosonde observations with a view
to gravity wave influences on the mean atmospheric state, the interannual
variability of gravity waves in the troposphere and lower stratosphere, and the
sources and propagation of gravity waves. As a second focus, the underlying
physics that determine the formation and maintenance processes for the tropical
and extra-tropical tropopause will be examined. In addition to fulfilling the
needs of the research project, the collection of radiosonde data will be made
available to the international research community in the database that is
maintained by the PI through a web-site on behalf of the World Climate Research
Programme. Two graduate students and an undergraduate student will participate
in the research.
