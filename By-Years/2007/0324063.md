Through an Interagency Agreement with the U.S. Army Edgewood Chemical Biological
Center the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Particulate
Materials will research and develop infrared obscurants for use in military and
homeland security applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project addresses an
experimental validation of an important theoretical prediction of efficient
obscuration of infrared radiation with particulates in the 2 to 12 micron range.
The major focus of the work is on the production of these nano-tabular
particles.&lt;br/&gt;
