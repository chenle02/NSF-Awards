This award provides funding for US participation in the conference "ICM
Satellite Operator Algebras Conference" that will be held July 26-30, 2018, at
the Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina in Florianopolis, Brazil.

The conference focuses on recent developments in Analysis, especially in the
field of operator theory. A number of distinguished mathematicians have agreed
to attend and speak at this conference. This award gives early career
researchers, members of underrepresented groups, researchers not funded by NSF
and the like an opportunity to attend and participate in this conference. The
organizing committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to
target groups through a number of different activities. More information will be
