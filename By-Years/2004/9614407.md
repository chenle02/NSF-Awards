9614407 Vander Pluijm Clay-bearing gouge rocks are commonly associated with the
shallow crustal segments of faults. The processes that lead to clay gouge
formation have direct implications for the mechanical properties and strength of
shallow-crustal faults. However, detailed studies of natural gouge have been
limited, which stems in part from the very fine grain size that characterizes
clay gouge. This study will attempt to determine mechanical and chemical
processes during clay-gouge formation, with emphasis on deformation fabrics,
effects of fluid interaction and clay mineral transformation, using techniques
applicable to very fine grained materials. Results are expected to clarify how
clay gouge forms in shallow portions of faults.
