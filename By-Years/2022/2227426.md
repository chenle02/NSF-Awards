The award will provide support for early career scientists, including graduate
students and post-doctoral researchers, to attend the 2022 Gordon Research
Seminar (GRS) on Cellular and Molecular Fungal Biology (Holderness School, New
Hampshire), just prior to the corresponding Gordon Research Conference. These
conferences bring together diverse scientists who study fungal biology at
different scales (molecules to populations) and from different disciplinary
perspectives (genetics, molecular and cellular biology, biochemistry,
immunology, evolutionary biology, systems and synthetic biology, etc.) The
research advances basic knowledge about fungi, including their interactions in
complex host and environment systems, and their evolution, which has
implications for biotechnology, agriculture and medicine. The GRS serves as a
forum for junior US and international scientists to present unpublished
research, exchange ideas and resources, benefit from career mentoring, and build
their professional network. The GRS is organized and co-chaired by two post-
doctoral scholars, which serves as a significant career development experience.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GRS and associated GRC will advance research on fungi,
integrating classical cell and molecular biology and modern data-rich
approaches. Investigators from around the world will have the opportunity to
discuss pioneering ideas in the field and potentially launch new collaborations.
The GRS in particular will facilitate training and professional development of a
diverse group of scientists in the field of fungal
biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is co-funded by the Genetic Mechanisms
and Cellular Dynamics and Function programs in the Division of Molecular and
Cellular Biosciences of the Directorate for Biological
Sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
