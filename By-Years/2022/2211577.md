A request is made to fund Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment (SSSE) for the
R/V Hugh R Sharp, a 146-foot regional research vessel operated by the University
of Delaware as part of the US Academic Research Fleet (ARF). Sharp is a state-
of-the-art, coastal research vessel that is owned and operated by the University
of Delaware. The vessel can carry fourteen to twenty scientists on cruises up to
eighteen days in duration and supports projects from all disciplines of
oceanography. The vessel is a regional asset, serving researchers from many
institutions throughout the mid-Atlantic. The vessel typically operates in the
coastal waters from Long Island, New York, to Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, as
well as the Delaware and Chesapeake Bays. In 2021, Sharp completed 144 days at
sea. NSF funded projects accounted for 221 days or 15% of the sailing schedule.
In 2022, Sharp is scheduled for 160 days with NSF days accounting for 56% (90
days) of the total sailing schedule. SSSE requested in this proposal
includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Replace the shipâ€™s Palfinger main Crane $256,439
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the
present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines
(NSF 19-602). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the
vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded
oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by
the relevant research program of NSF). The acquisition, maintenance and
operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any
US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their
research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of
potential researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
