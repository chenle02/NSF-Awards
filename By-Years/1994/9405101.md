Bates Theoretical descriptions of the phase behavior of bulk polymer systems,
including polymer-polymer mixtures and block copolymers, have generally assumed
molecular symmetry between components. Recent experiments with model linear
polyolefin homopolymers and block copolymers have demonstrated that the phase
behavior, and surface segregation tendencies, of these materials can be
correlated with differences in the conformational symmetry parameter. The
symmetry parameter characterizes differences in the manner in which polymers (or
blocks) fill space conformationally versus volumetrically. In the presence of a
symmetry breaking surface, or at a microdomain interface, differences in the
parameter will provide an entropic driving force for preferential wetting, or a
specific interfacial curvature, respectively. These effects will be examined
experimentally by preparing well-defined polyolefins and studying their bulk
phase behavior and surface properties using a variety of methods. Model
polyolefin specimens will be produced through the catalytic hydrogenation of
anionically synthesized unsaturated hydrocarbon polymers. Bulk phase behavior
will be established using dynamic mechanical spectroscopy and small-angle
neutron scattering (SANS) measurements, with the objective of establishing
relationships between the symmetry parameters and the various ordered phases
found near the order- disorder transition. Surface studies will focus on two
classes of materials: linear and star homopolymer mixtures and starblock
copolymers. Neutron and X-ray reflections, and SIMS experiments will be used to
determine how variations in the symmetry parameters influence surface
segregation. %%% The overall goal of this research project is to develop methods
for manipulating polymer-polymer thermodynamics by exploiting conformational and
architectural symmetry, in order to guide the rational design of advanced
polymer-based materials.
