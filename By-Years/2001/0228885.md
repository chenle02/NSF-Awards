The overall goal is to establish a high performance connection to the Abilene
advanced Internet facility to support science research. To achieve this
connection Brandeis will establish the advanced connection via Northern
CrossRoads (NoX) to the Abilene network. Brandeis will link to the NoX gigapop
directly through a leased fiber connection provided by RCN, which will also
provide the end switches and the circuit monitoring equipment as well as manage
the circuit. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposers have identified four areas of
research that require the use of a high performance network connection. The
investigators in each of these areas of research have coped with inadequate
bandwidth for a number of years. They have been remarkably adaptive in working
out ways to deal with this situation, but the time has come to sustain their
research with a high performance Internet connection. &lt;br/&gt;
