9414891 Arruda This project is to conduct a nonisothermal analytical and
experimental study of viscoelastic fiber drawing. Two types of viscoelastic
fibers will be considered, glass and a liquid crystalline polymer. The project
will include the manufacture of these two fiber types to perform an extensive
characterization program that will lead to the development of the evolution
equation. Characterization of the fibers will include mechanical, thermal and
optical analyses both before and after processing and chemical treatments. ***
