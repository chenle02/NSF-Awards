General Audience Summary

The proposed object of study is the Schlick Zirkel, a group of philosophically-
oriented scientists in 1920s Vienna that eventually evolved into the Vienna
Circle, which is of great importance and has received much attention in the
history of the philosophy of science. The intellectual contribution is both a
close study of the ideas, insights, and intellectual innovations of the Zirkel
concerning the foundations of science and of theoretical reasoning, and a
historical study of its members. The project will serve to clarify of how
specialists, professional philosophers and scientific practitioners, develop an
understanding of the scientific enterprise. It will also help to explain how
distinct individuals, with different backgrounds and training, and belonging to
distinct disciplines, arrive at their own conception of the scientific
enterprise. This process, which ultimately shapes and forms the popular
perception of science, involves careful examination, extended discussions, and
heated debates before a consensus emerges

Technical Summary

The intrinsic merit of the proposed work derives from the significance of the
Zirkel in the development of Twentieth Century philosophical thought and the
fact that the Zirkel has received little critical attention in the literature.
The Zirkel was the original group which evolved into the Vienna Circle, a major
source of Logical Empiricism, which dominated philosophical thought about
science throughout most of the Twentieth Century. The last two decades have seen
a resurgence of scholarly interest in the Vienna Circle and in the early
development of Logical Empiricism. During this period, the influence of Kantian
thought on Logical Empiricism has been emphasized, while the contribution of the
Zirkel has been largely neglected. The proposed project will remedy both the
lack of scholarly interest in a leading influence on recent philosophy of
science while correcting the mistaken impressions which have resulted from this
neglect.
