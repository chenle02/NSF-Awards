The proposed research consists of three related projects at the intersection of
noncommutative algebra and algebraic geometry. The first project concerns
noncommutative analogs of algebraic varieties called maximal orders; these are
coherent sheaves of noncommutative algebras on varieties whose generic stalk is
a central simple algebra. The project involves studying modules over some
maximal orders, developing a minimal model program for maximal orders on
3-folds, and studying Brauer groups of supersingular K3 surfaces in
characteristic p. The second project focuses on Clifford algebras and Ulrich
sheaves on varieties. This project uses Clifford algebra representations to
construct Ulrich sheaves on algebraic varieties and examines stability in the
category of Ulrich sheaves on varieties. The third project links Clifford
algebras and Brauer groups of fields by investigating the relationship between
cyclicity of division algebras and representations of Clifford algebras, and by
using weighted Clifford algebras to study relative Brauer groups of curves.

The fruitful interactions between mathematics and theoretical physics in the
past several decades have resulted in great interest in noncommutative algebras
and Clifford algebras in particular. Noncommutative algebras are similar to
polynomials in which the order of multiplication matters. Clifford algebras
occur in the definition of the Dirac equation and are an integral part of
quantum mechanics and quantum field theory. Noncommutative algebras can be
studied using the sophisticated methods of algebraic geometry and, conversely,
have been used to answer questions is algebraic geometry. Algebraic geometry was
developed and has proved to be a powerful tool for addressing some old problems
in algebra. The subject of noncommutative algebraic geometry has been
progressing rapidly, and the projects in this proposal further develop some deep
geometric and algebraic aspects of noncommutative algebras (and Clifford
algebras in particular) and related algebraic geometry.
