Neural Network Models that Bridge Levels of Abstraction This is the first year
funding of a three year continuing award on neural net models of cognition. Such
models must provide architectures capable both of representing a given situation
at different levels of abstraction and of supporting the flow of information
between these levels. This project explores cognitive neural models that can
bridge levels of abstraction, by developing a connectionist model of the well-
known cognitive phenomenon of illusory contour perception (perception of non-
existent contour lines at boundaries of a non- existent occluding object
inferred from context). The model of illusory contour perception will allow top-
down feedback from the perception of an occluding object to cause the perception
of illusory contrast along the object's boundary. The model will explicitly
incorporate a representational hierarchy of visual elements at multiple levels
of abstraction. Simulation results using the model will show how feedforward
activation leads to the perception of the occluded object at a high level of
abstraction, and how feedback activates the units that represent the illusory
contrast. The architecture of the model suggests a testable prediction about
human perception of subjective contours, providing clues to certain mysteries of
visual perception.
