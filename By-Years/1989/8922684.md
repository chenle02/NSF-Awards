The objective in this research project is to carry out detailed studies on the
role of differential heating in climate and its variability using data from
extended integrations of the NCAR Community Climate Model (DDC). The project
will continue and extend on previous work which focussed on a detailed
comparison of heating distributions prediction by an earlier version of the CCM
(CCMOB) and the current version (CCM1). This is important project since it will
help to quantify the improvements or deficiencies in the representation of
differential heating in the new version of the CCM (CCM1). The results will
provide a basis for developing future strategies for improving the model
physics.
