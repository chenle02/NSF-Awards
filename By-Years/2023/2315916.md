Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) requests funds for shipboard
scientific support equipment that is needed to carry out NSF-supported
scientific research. Working within the collaborative framework of the
University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS), the proposed
equipment will be maintained by the SIO ship operations department for use by
NSF-supported scientists from institutions nationwide who require these seagoing
facilities.

With this proposal, SIO provides technical descriptions and rationale for the
acquisition of the following Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment:

1) Mooring winch for West Coast Winch Pool $399,249 2) General purpose winch
OS-42 for BIOS $396,965 3) Management of procurement, testing, shipping, and
installation $156,014 4) Markey Remote Access Systems on Roger Revelle and Sally
Ride $13,826 5) Overboarding block for Robert Gordon Sproul $13,617 6) IDC
$28,818 $1,008,489

Broader Impacts The principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit
Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 19-602). It provides
infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use
instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects
(which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of
NSF). The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation
allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working,
calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research,
and expanding the base of potential researchers.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
