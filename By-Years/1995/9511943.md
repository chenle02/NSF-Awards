This award provides partial support for the participation of eighteen U.S.
graduate students and postdoctoral associates in a various sessions of a series
of research-oriented workshops to be held in Spring, 1996 at the Erwin
Schroedinger International Institute for Mathematical Physics in Vienna,
Austria. Ivan Penkov of the University of California at Riverside and Joseph A.
Wolf of the University of California at Berkeley, have co-organized a program
consisting of three one-month long sessions on topics in the area of
Representation Theory with Applications to Mathematical Physics. Over twenty
speakers/participants who are world leaders in Representation Theory from
several countries are expected to participate in one or more of the sessions,
and there will also be advanced students from a number of countries.
Representation theory is one of the key disciplines of modern mathematics as
well as modern physics. The subject is one with a great diversity of
international experience and perspectives. The group of junior U.S. participants
competitively selected to participate in this program will gain invaluable
experience, knowledge and personal contacts which should enrich their future
professional careers.
