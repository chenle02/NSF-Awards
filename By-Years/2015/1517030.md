The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) has been building a
global network of fully automated, or robotic, telescopes, called "Skynet".
Skynet is capable of controlling scores of telescopes simultaneously, including
most commercially available small-telescope hardware, and now numbers 20
telescopes spanning Chile, Australia, the United States, and Italy. Skynet
fulfills both research and education missions, for tens of thousands of users --
including professionals and students of all ages, graduate school through
elementary school. Skynet's user community consists of UNC-CH, 13 regional
undergraduate institutions including three minority-serving institutions, and
UNC-CH's Morehead Planetarium and Science Center. Partnerships with many other
institutions, nationally and internationally, produce additional high-impact,
small-telescope science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program directly supports
Skynet's senior systems engineer to (1) continue to integrate new instruments
and new telescopes into Skynet; (2) continue to develop Skynet's telescope
control and web-based, dynamic queue-scheduling software; and (3) continue to
develop Afterglow, which is easy-to-learn and easy-to-use, but publication
quality, web-based data reduction and analysis software integrated into Skynet's
database. These efforts will significantly impact UNC-CH's ability to study
gamma-ray bursts, but more importantly, they will significantly impact research
and research training that is being carried out across Skynet's larger, and
rapidly growing, user community, on transient and time-variable phenomena in
general.
