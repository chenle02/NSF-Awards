The Franklin Institute Science Museum in Philadelphia, PA., acting as
administrative coordinator for the Issues Laboratory Collaborative (ILC),
requests NSF support for five science museums over a three year period to
investigate the effectiveness of museum-based programs about controversial
issues in science and technology; to develop, test, refine, and disseminate ten
educational programs on science issues; and to establish a permanent Science
Issues Network that will disseminate materials and methods to all U.S. science
museums engaged in issues programs. This project has been formulated for re-
submission to the National Science Foundation with guidance from a distinguished
panel of scientists who will assist in program development. Approximately two
million people will be directly served by ILC programs and exhibits during the
three-year period.
