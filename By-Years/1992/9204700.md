Late Tertiary, tephra-rich sedimentary strata widespread in the Basin and Range
Province of the Western United States are markedly more abundant than older.
Tertiary sedimentary strata, and have accumulated in fault- bounded extensional
basins formed province-wide. As a step towards better understanding the nature
and regional significance of these tephra-rich strata and their associated
basin, better control is needed on their age and geographical distribution.
Towards this end PIs will establish the sequence of silicic tephra layers in
these sparsely fossiliferous Late Tertiary strata in the northern Basin and
Range, and will date selected samples. The tephra will be characterized using
trace/minor element chemistry of the glass phase, and size, and shape analysis
of the glass particles. For dating the layers PIs will use the 40Ar/39Ar laser
fusion technique on sanidine and biotite, common phenocrysts in the tephra. The
results will also add to the understanding of time, frequency, and magnitude of
silicic volcanism in the Late Tertiary of the region, and the tephrochronology
will provide a fundamental reference framework for future structural,
stratigraphic, and paleontologic studies of these strata.
