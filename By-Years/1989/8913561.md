The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office will provide data to extend existing data
series concerning patenting in the United States. Data will include numbers of
patents granted year by year to Americans and to citizens of other specified
countries, patents owned by individuals as opposed to private corporate entities
and the U.S. Government, and patents assigned to universities and colleges.
Counts of granted patents will be classified by both the Patent Office
Classification system and the Standard Industrial Classification system. These
data are used in the National Science Board's series of Science and Engineering
Indicators reports as indicators of levels of technical invention in the various
countries, sectors, and fields.
