The objective of this IGERT proposal is to develop a fellowship program in the
multidisciplinary area of Sensory Knowledge-based INterface Science (SKINS).
This program investigates the dynamic, information-rich molecular structure of
the ultimate smart interface - human skin - by coupling advances in biomedical
engineering, microsystems, and information technology. The interdisciplinary
approach that is required to understand the signal processing, chemical
synthesis and microfluidics of this unique biological interface forms the
innovative theme of this proposal. Another compelling aspect of this program is
to investigate the technology transfer/development cycle through collaboration
with USF's College of Business Administration, industrial internships and
international exchange. Research outcomes of this proposal would facilitate the
understanding and optimizing of the science and technology of MEMS,
nanotechnology and information processing for cells and tissue studies, and
contribute towards the goal of transitioning the clinical laboratory into the
point-of-care. The program will also facilitate the transformation of six
traditionally strong research programs (from Colleges of Engineering, Medicine,
Arts and Sciences, Business and Marine Science at USF and the Colleges of
Engineering and Arts and Sciences at UCF) into a strong multi-disciplinary
research program with a thematic focus that leverages the advances in bio,
micro, nano, info and medical technologies. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;IGERT is an
NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D.
scientists and engineers with the multidisciplinary backgrounds and the
technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of
the future. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate
education by establishing innovative new models for graduate education and
training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends
traditional disciplinary boundaries. In the fifth year of the program, awards
are being made to twenty-one institutions for programs that collectively span
the areas of science and engineering supported by NSF.&lt;br/&gt;
