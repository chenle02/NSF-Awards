Proposal: 9321110 ABSTRACT Date: 6/1/94 PI: M.D. Wand Institution: Displaytech,
Inc. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project deals with
the design, synthesis and characterization of temperature insensitive
ferroelectric liquid crystals (FLC) which are easily aligned, have a broad
operating chiral smectic A range and show a large electroclinic effect. Such
FLCs show a linear electro-optic effect which permits gray modulation without
partial domain switching. Specifically, the Phase II research will synthesize
80-120 new FLCs, test their ability to induce temperature insensitivity of
proprietary Displaytech smectic B dopants, and test and optimize for nematic
phase induction N*-inducing Displaytech dopants. Achieving these objectives will
permit the formulation of the best analog liquid crystal mixture which will be
evaluated in two devices, a linear array modulator for analog beam steering
applications and a single element continuous grayscale modulator. High speed
analog intensity modulators, based on temperature insensitive FLCs showing a
large electroclinic effect will find applications in flat panel displays, analog
beam deflectors, continuously tunable birefringence filters useful in imaging
spectrometers, and neural networks. These technologies are of high current
interest and strategic importance.
