The theory of stacks is the study of symmetries of geometric objects and, as
such, has wide impact throughout mathematics: it is a central theme in current
work in algebraic geometry, algebraic topology, number theory, analytic and
differential geometry, and mathematical physics. Indeed, the theory has proved
flexible enough to apply to any field of mathematics were it is important to
study symmetries across continuous families of geometric objects, especially
when the groups of self-symmetries can vary non-continuously throughout the
family. This workshop, to be held at the Fields Institute in Toronto, will bring
together leading researchers, postdoctoral mathematicians, and graduate students
from fields which apply the theory of stacks; the intent is to discuss recent
advances, and to explore and stimulate potentially important new areas of
applications. The main speakers will address current problems in chromatic
stable homotopy theory, orbifolds, mathematical physics, geometry in various
forms, and the emerging field of derived algebraic geometry. Researchers who
have agreed to participate include Mark Behrens (MIT), Ian Grojnowksi
(Cambridge), Jacob Lurie (Harvard), Gabriele Vezzosi (Firenze), and Angelo
Vistolli (Scuola Normale Superiore). In addition, Mike Hopkins (Harvard) will
give a series of lectures concurrently with this workshop.

The workshop will be the central event of a two-month subprogram entitled
``Stacks in geometry and topology'', within the thematic program ``Geometric
applications of homotopy theory''. The full program will run from January
through June of 2007 at the Fields Institute. Beyond the workshop, there a
directly related mini-courses by Paul Goerss (Northwestern), Ezra Getzler
(Northwestern), and Jacob Lurie (Harvard). The workshop and the mini-courses
will pursue the theory of stacks across a diverse fields of mathematics where
this theory has been applied, and an important goal of this whole program is to
foster cross-disciplinary interaction.
