The project establishes a research training program in algebraic geometry and
its boundary areas at the University of Michigan. Target trainees are recent
PhDs and advanced graduate students. The project is run by five senior faculty
members representing a wide swath of current research trends in algebraic
geometry, in consultation with an additional 14 senior faculty at Michigan in
related areas. Activities include innovations in seminar structure offering
trainees broad exposure to a wide variety of basic and research level topics in
algebraic geometry (broadly construed); an annual school (open also to young
researchers outside Michigan) covering a research topic of current importance
taught by a prominent researcher from outside Michigan; opportunities for post-
doctoral researchers to design and lead REU projects under the mentorship of a
senior faculty member; opportunities for advanced graduate students and post-
docs to develop their technical lecturing and writing skills; and numerous
opportunities for post-docs and advanced graduate students to receive mentoring
on all aspects of a research career in mathematics.

Algebraic geometry is one of the most central and active branches of
mathematics today, with increasingly important connections to other branches of
mathematics and science. Algebraic geometry also underlies many applications of
mathematics to technology and government, including coding theory (bringing us,
for example, the compact disc) and spline theory (bringing us computer aided
design and the computer graphics essential to certain medical applications and
Hollywood movies), as well as important issues of national security pioneered by
the National Security Agency. The explosive growth of algebraic geometry at the
end of the twentieth century has made this a very exciting time to begin
research in the field, but it has also made it difficult for young researchers
to get started. This project will increase the flow of broadly trained
researchers in algebraic geometry and its boundary areas, therefore enhancing
the training infrastructure and the research workforce in these vital areas of
mathematics in the twenty-first century.
