EIA-0091534&lt;br/&gt;Francis J. Harvey&lt;br/&gt;University of
Kentucky&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Digital Government: Bringing Government and
Citizens Together: A Metadata Extension Test-bed for the Kentucky Spatial Data
Infrastructure (KYSDI) Clearinghouse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The planning grant
will enable us to undertake research on developing a Metadata extension for
spatial data integration involving citizens and government. We propose to focus
on establishing the parameters for improving citizen involvement in the project
and developing a prototype application to assess technical issues. These
activities will be the basis for emphasizing four key themes: semantic
interoperability, human-computer interaction, inter-agency collaboration, and
citizen access in a revised submission to the digital government
program.&lt;br/&gt;
