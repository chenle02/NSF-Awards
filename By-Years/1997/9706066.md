9706066 Cohen This Focused Reqearch Group project involves fundamental studies
of elastomer properties. The proposed research consists of a three-pronged
approach involving: 1) careful synthesis and characterization; 2) use of
deuterium NMR; and 3) Monte Carlo simulations. The group will use end-linking
chemisty to vary the architecture of the prepared networks in a systernatic way
and to examine the effect of this variation on the mechanical and swelling
properties of the networks. Deuterium NMR experiments will be used to probe the
molecular architecture of the networks and the segment orientational order
parameter of networks under compression. Finally, Monte Carlo simulation methods
will be developed to examine the molecular structures that are obtained after
curing, the swelling mechanisms of the networks and the effect of the chain
stiffness of the precursor molecules. Experimental results, model predictions
and simulation results will be compared to validate or improve existing models
as well as propose new models if necessary. These studies on
poly(diethylsiloxane) (PDES) networks will help elucidate a long standing issue
about the nature of segment-segment interactions in strained networks because
PDES exhibits a mesophasic structure above its glass transition. %%% This
research is in the technologically important area of elastomeric materials and
networks and will help provide fundamental understanding of their molecular-
level structures and properties. ***
