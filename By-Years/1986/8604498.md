This research equipment grant will assist in the procurement of a high
temperature mechanical testing system to be adapted to a JEOL JSM-T300 scanning
electron microscope. An automated video image analysis system will be
incorporated to facilitate the synchronization of the mechanical response of the
specimens and the microstructural changes of its surface. The facility will
serve the entire research community at the University of Cincinnati.
