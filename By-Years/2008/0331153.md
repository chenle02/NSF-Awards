The PI and a collaborator from Georgia Institute of Technology propose to work
both with a ray tracing method and with a partial coherence method to gain an
understanding of the surface roughness effects on the radiative properties of
silicon based thin film materials, specifically patterned silicon wafers.
Experimental measurements of the reflectivity and transmissivity of silicon
wafers will be performed at Georgia Tech using a three-axis measurement method.
The facility to accomplish this portion of the proposed research already exists.
The results could have technological impact in applications such as rapid
thermal processing, laser annealing, flash annealing, or other processes that
are strongly dependent on radiative energy deposition. These technologies are
critical to the manufacturing of current and next generation of semiconductors
and many other thin film materials. &lt;br/&gt;This research is being supported
by the Thermal Transport and Thermal Processing Program of Chemical and
Transport Systems Division.
