Enrique Peacock-Lopez of Williams College is supported by an award from the
Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program to continue and expand his work
in the area of chemical self-replication as well as chemical and biochemical
regulatory mechanisms in solutions and on surfaces. A large number of
biochemical systems show regulatory positive and negative feedback loops that
extend from the molecular cell level to the physiological level. The PI's group
studies the molecular basis of chemical self-replication and chemical,
biochemical and physiological regulatory mechanisms. Their aim to to develop
dynamic models to explain observed temporal and chaotic oscillation in the
concentrations of relevant metabolites. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dynamical
analysis of chemical and biochemical mechanisms and chemical self-replication
provides insights into efficient ways to modify or redirect overall biochemical
dynamics. The Peacock-Lopez research group is composed entirely of
undergraduates who receive valuable training and experience in the scientific
research process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This RUI award is supported in a co-
funding arrangement with the Genes and Genome program of the Division of
Molecular and Cellular Biology.
