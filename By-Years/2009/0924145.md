Dr. Tanya Luhrmann (Stanford University) will undertake research on how some
Americans learn to make judgments about experiences they label spiritual. The
researcher draws upon prior ethnographic fieldwork that found that there are at
least two distinct kinds of learning involved: the acquisition of cultural
knowledge, or "discourse," and the development of specific psychological skills
through prayer practice that change how people experience their minds and
bodies. By focusing on the importance of learning in a social setting, the
research will contribute to scientific understanding how some people learn to
have intimate spiritual experiences and how powerful that learning experience
can be in shaping the ways in which the world is
experienced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current project is framed around the
hypotheses that (1) spiritual experience is shaped by combination of belief,
proclivity, and practice; (2) that specific forms of learned kataphatic or
imagination-based prayer increase mental imagery and unusual sensory
experiences; and (3) that some individuals, who report more phenomena in the
first place and score higher on an absorption scale, change more than others.
Research methods include experimental prayer training followed by evaluation;
intensive interviews about spiritual experience; and technical discourse
analysis of taped reports of spiritual experiences. Data analysis will employ
cyber-enabled text analysis and other methods used to systematically analyze
qualitative data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
