This award supports the collaborative efforts of Kenneth C. Janda, V. Ara
Apkarian, William S. Reeburgh (University of California-Irvine), Kenneth D.
Jordan (University of Pittsburgh), Stefan G. Llewellyn Smith (University of
California-San Diego) and Subramanian Iyer (Energetics, Inc.) to understand
hydrate-clathrates. Hydrate-clathrates are a unique class of substance in which
water molecules form a crystal lattice with open cavities that can cage guest
gas molecules, such as hydrogen, methane or carbon dioxide, without chemical
bonding. This team of scientists and engineers will 1) advance the theoretical
description of gas-hydrate systems; 2) test theory against experiments on real
systems 3) use the results from atomistic level studies to refine macroscopic
models for simulating the behavior of gas hydrates over long time scales in
complex environments found in nature; 4) test the macroscopic model against
marine data; 5) predict changes to the global methane budget under various
global warming scenarios; 6) investigate the utility of hydrate-clathrates to
transport and store carbon dioxide and hydrogen. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gas-
hydrates can impact both the global environment and energy resources. Large
quantities of methane are stored as hydrates deep in the ocean. This reservoir
of methane is a potential new source of energy, but also a potentially dangerous
source of global warming. While hydrate-clathrates offer a benign energy
storehouse for hydrogen and carbon monoxide gases, they are also can cause
obstructions in high-pressure methane pipelines. This project is funded through
the Collaborative Research in Chemistry Program (CRC) and provides outstanding
opportunities for undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral
researchers to acquire knowledge and skills in very broad areas of research,
including experimental and theoretical physical chemistry, marine chemistry, and
mechanical and environmental engineering. These topics will also be presented to
high school teachers in a special summer institute.&lt;br/&gt;
