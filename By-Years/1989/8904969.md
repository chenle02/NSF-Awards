The complex northern termination of the Tonga.Kermadec island arc is an
excellent example of a tear in an oceanic plate. The research will study
earthquake locations and focal mechanisms in this tectonically active area. The
observations will be used to develop a comprehensive model of lithospheric
structure and dynamics of plate interaction and will be compared with
observations from other arc terminations. The research bears on fundamental
questions of earthquake and tsunami risk in the Southwest Pacific and thus has
application to the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
