With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and Chemistry
Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) programs, Miami University at
Oxford will acquire a microfocus X-ray diffractometer. In general, an X-ray
diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three-
dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and
provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of a molecule
relative to neighboring molecules. The studies described here will impact a
number of areas, including organic and inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry
and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well
as research and research training of chemistry, biochemistry and geology
graduate and undergraduate students as well as postdoctoral
fellows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award is aimed at enhancing research and
education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) integrating
paramagnetic resonance of high-spin cobalt systems using trispyrazolylborates
and trispyrazolymethanes as ligands; (b) investigating the structure of cation
and anion solid solutions in apatite; (c) studying surface structure induced
dissymmetrization during crystal growth; (d) investigating decavanadates; (e)
preparing large molecules with complex three-dimensional structures; (f)
developing catalytic methods to affect difficult organic transformations; and
(g) merging transition metal and organocatalysis for asymmetric organic
transformations.
