An investigation for, and subsequent design of a high speed, high contrast,
semiconductor spatial light modulator (SLM) is proposed. The SLM uses
polarization rotation in a MQW under built-in uniaxial stress. The ordinarily
strained MQWs are pattern with stripe forms to induce an anisotropy in the
absorption. The MQW structures then are sandwiched between two linear polarizers
similar to liquid crystal SLMs. the "on" and "off" states are controlled with an
applied voltage. The contrast ratio, which is determined by the quality of the
polarizers, can reach as high as 1000: 1; which the modulation speed, which is
determined by electro-absorption in the heterostructures, can reach the
picosecond range. The proposal represents a two-year collaboration between the
Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Rutgers University and the
Electronics Technology and Devices Laboratory (ETDL) at Fort Monmouth. The work
at Rutgers will focus on processing development, structural characterization,
and theoretical modeling. In addition, a graduate student from Rutgers will
spend and majority of her time at ETDL, performing the optical studies for this
project. The National Science Foundation's support will greatly enhance our
joint efforts in this area.
