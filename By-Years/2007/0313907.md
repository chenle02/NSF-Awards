Mark Hoffmann of the University of North Dakota is supported by the Theoretical
and Computational Chemistry Program to develop and apply high-accuracy
electronic structure theory for the calculation of Floquet states that address
the behavior of molecules in intense laser fields. Second-order generalized Van
Vleck perturbation theory and multireference configuration interaction theory
will be extended for this purpose. The quasi-classical trajectory surface
hopping method will be used to address time dependence, and a model including
instantaneous Floquet states will be explored for describing chirped laser
radiation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The quantum control of chemical reactions
through lasers is expected to make important contributions to diverse research
areas such as biochemistry and nanotechnology, and will lay the groundwork for
quantum chemical engineering. Accurate theoretical descriptions of the phenomena
observed for molecules in intense laser fields will be addressed by this
research.
