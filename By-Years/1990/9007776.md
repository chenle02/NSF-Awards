The principal investigator, in collaboration with Leroy Odom and Edwin Hilinski
at Florida State University, will attempt to develop a quartz geochronometer and
geothermometer. He will do so by examining the number of Schottky-Frenkel
defects in natural quartz using electron spin resonance spectroscopy, then
determining the age of the quartz via improved uranium-thorium dating
techniques, thereby establishing the rate of accumulation of the defects.
Through annealing experiments a study also will be made of the thermal
stabilities and mean lives of the defects; this in turn could provide a basis
for a geologically useful geochronometer. Since quartz is a common minerals,
development of this tool could have wide application, and would be particularly
useful for rocks in which other methods cannot be applied. The understanding of
defects in quartz also will benefit the semiconductor industry.
