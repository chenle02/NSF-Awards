This project seeks to take a major step toward increased practicality of
parallel programming for genuine applications. Three areas will be studied:
oLanguage design: A new multiparadigm language will be designed, weaving
together the best parallel programming features of functional, logic, and
objected oriented languages: producer-consumer AND- parallelism (functional);
goal-driven OR-parallelism (logic), and message-based loose coupling (object
oriented languages). oImplementation techniques: A coherent implementation
strategy for this composite language will be developed, based on techniques for
compiling each language component to conventional machine code. These techniques
will include strictness analysis (functional) , Warren Abstract Machine Code
(logical), and encapsulated imperative code (object oriented languages). The
combined method will be demonstrated on both a uniprocessor workstation and on
an 18-node multiprocessor system. oProgrammer pragmatics: The practical merits
of this approach will be evaluated through an application study involving
successive levels of sophistication in digital circuit simulation. In support of
this demonstration, user interface issues will be addressed through the
construction of a prototype programming environment, operating compatibly in
both uni-and multiprocessor modes. Parallel programming is rapidly being
transformed from an esoteric specialty to a subject of fundamental importance to
all programers. Among the reasons for this transformation are (i) the
introduction of concurrency control constructs into general purpose languages
(e.g. tasks in ADA), (ii) increasing interest in naturally parallel algorithms
(e.g. constraint satisfaction methods), and (iii) the recent availability of
commercial multiprocessor offering dramatically increased computing power per
unit cost.
