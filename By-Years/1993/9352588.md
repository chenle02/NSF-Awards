Improvement in the teaching of chemical kinetics in the undergraduate
laboratories will be accomplished by adding kinetics experiments to the physical
chemistry course and improving the current enzyme kinetics laboratory used in
the biochemistry course. One experiments will use spectroscopy to monitor the
hydrolysis, while others will make use of temperature controls to study enzyme
reaction rates. Another uses stopped flow spectroscopy to measure rapid
hydrolysis. Students have been involved in the initial development of these
experiments.
