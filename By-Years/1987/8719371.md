During solar flares large amounts of energy are released. The energy release
occurs in three phases. The first phase is the precursor phase which is
associated with slightly enhanced emissions and perhaps the emergence or
rearrangement of magnetic flux. The second phase, the impulsive (sometimes
called non- thermal) phase where the primary energy release occurs, is
associated with the highest energy phenomena and a rapid increase in intensity
and volume of electromagnetic emissions. The third phase is the gradual phase
which is characterized by lower energy phenomena, a slow decay in the intensity
of emissions and, sometimes, secondary energy releases. This grant will support
the development of a self-consistent model for the propagation of energetic
particles released in the impulsive phase of solar flares down into the lower
corona and chromosphere, the outer corona and interplanetary medium during the
gradual phase. The study seeks to provide a means for unifying existing models
to produce a coherent and comprehensive picture of plasma heating and energy
transport during solar flares. A knowledge of these processes is important for
our understanding of mechanisms to accelerate or heat plasmas to high energies
and of the plasma and energy flow in the chromosphere and corona. The results
will provide a better basis for interpreting solar X-ray and radio emissions
which will in turn provide new information for models of solar flares and
similar high energy phenomena on other stars and planets. The solar flare is the
most energetic, explosive phenomenon affecting the terrestrial atmosphere.
