The Taguchi design method is a statistical design technique that seeks to
improve productivity by creating production systems that are insensitive to
variations in the input factors or changes in the environment. This is achieved
by modelling the outcome of the system as a response surface and using factorial
experimental design techniques to identify areas of the response surface which
are relatively flat to changes in inputs. This Engineering Initiation Award
proposes to create an alternative to the factorial design methods by using
spectral design methods. Spectral design of experiments is a technique whereby
factors that are significant determinants of system behavior can be identified
by analyzing the spectra of the system inputs and outputs. The resulting
analysis is comparable to a traditional factorial experiment under classical
design assumptions. The spectral approach has the additional property of
yielding correct factor identifications even when a lag of unknown duration
exists between the introduction of a change to an input and the corresponding
change in the output of the system. Combining the Taguchi design method with
spectral design of experiments will yield a method that can be used for
productivity improvement in industries in which the Taguchi approach is
currently not easily applicable, such as chemical engineering and other process
industries.
