Funding will be utilized for travel of US scientists and researchers to present
papers at the first international workshop and conference on thermal, fluid and
interfacial phenomena in physico-chemical, materials and bio- processes. The
workshop will address problems on interfacial stability and transport with
applications to materials and bio-processing such as electrodeposition, crystal
growth, jetting, lung and corneal transport, etc. The conference will be held in
Giessen, Germany, between September 12 - 16, 2001, and the proceedings will be
published. The support is meant for graduate students and post-doctoral
scientists as well as non-tenured faculty in the early stages of their careers.
