This collaborative award to the University of Washington and Cornell University
funds the development of a calorimeter detector that would be used to measure
the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. This quantity is of fundamental
interest because of discrepancies between a recent measurement and theoretical
predictions of the standard model of particle physics. The magnetic moment of
the muon will be measured with greatly increased precision. If the discrepancy
is confirmed, it would imply the existence of new subatomic particles, so far
undetected, and would fundamentally reshape our understanding of the world
around us.
