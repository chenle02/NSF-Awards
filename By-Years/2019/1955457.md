Errors in software can lead to disastrous consequences, from power outages to
stock market crashes, and from massive leaks of private consumer data to wide-
scale software vulnerabilities. A promising approach to making software more
reliable is foundational verification. In this approach programmers use a
theorem prover to state and prove properties about their programs. Because the
proofs are done with the assistance of a theorem prover, in full complete
detail, foundational verification provides the strongest possible levels of
assurance, virtually guaranteeing that the software works correctly. However,
while foundational verification shows great promise, the cost of producing
foundationally verified software remains prohibitively high for most programs,
as it requires enormous manual effort by highly trained experts. The manual
effort required in foundational verification is one of the main impediments to
the broader adoption of this promising technique.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal
of this project is to use machine learning to significantly alleviate the manual
effort required to complete proofs in foundational verification, thereby
fundamentally reshaping the cost/benefit analysis of using the methodology. The
intellectual merit involves training machine-learning algorithms on current
proofs to automatically predict the steps that need to be taken in future
proofs. By laying the foundation for a significant shift in the cost/benefit
analysis of using foundational verification, this project has the potential of
ushering in an new era of increased adoption of the technique, and of safer and
more secure software as a result.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
