9631919 Chow The proposed research includes: (a) Development of efficient
algorithms for the solution of conventional and advanced formulations of the Hoo
and model-matching design methods as applied to multi-input, multi-output
aircraft engine design problems. (b) Demonstration of the use of the iterative
LMI algorithm to compute controllers with order, magnitude, phase, and
structural constraints. (c) Development of new capabilities of the iterative LMI
algorithm to include, for example, synthesis problems. (d) Improvement of the
iterative LMI algorithm. The research will be conducted by the PI, with
contributions from a team of control engineers from GE CR&amp;D and Aircraft
Engines. ***
