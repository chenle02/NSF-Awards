The IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory is held approximately
every eighteen months at sites alternating between the United States and foreign
countries. The 1990 Symposium will be held in San Diego, CA on January 14.19.
The areas to be covered in this symposium include communication systems,
complexity theory, cryptography, data compression, data networks, detection and
estimation, error control coding, multi-.user information theory, pattern
recognition, Shannon theory, stochastic processes, and applications of
information theory to speech and image processing, VLSI, and other fields. The
proposal requests support for the air travel expenses of U.S. scientists whose
papers have been selected for presentation at the symposium but who, for lack of
funds, might not be able to attend. The awards will be made by a committee
composed of the Co.Chairmen of the symposium. Preference in awards will go to
scientists of junior rank at academic institutions. No more than one author of a
given paper will receive an award. Average award size is expected to be about
$300.
