(Public Law 111-5)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective: The objective of this program
is to develop a new framework for studying distributed inference with dependent
observations. A broad range of issues will be addressed under this program,
ranging from distributed detection, distributed estimation, robust inference, to
asymptotic performance in a large system setting.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: The intellectual merit is in the
unifying nature of the proposed framework. Existing results in distributed
inference with dependent observations are rather fragmented. The proposed
framework unifies these isolated studies and provides intuition behind many of
the observations reported in existing literature. Such intuition, as well as the
framework itself, can be applied and adapted to various distributed inference in
complex systems. The transformative nature of the proposed research lies in its
potential to connect existing isolated studies, and to identify and resolve
distributed inference problems that were never before addressed, thereby
providing clear design principles for distributed inference systems under
realistic dependent data models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The
broader impacts are multifaceted. The study sheds light on the fundamental cause
of difficulty in dealing with dependent observations in distributed systems; it
provides useful insights that may lead to research advances in areas beyond that
of distributed inference. The research results are to be disseminated to both
the research community through publications and tutorial presentations and to
graduate students through curriculum development. Encouraging and facilitating
graduate student participation in professional meetings and conferences and
recruiting undergraduate students in research projects which will help instill
enthusiasm and foster their interest in scientific activities.
