Even though seismic isolation is growing very rapidly, data on response of
isolated structures to actual earthquakes is still lacking. This research helps
fill this void by using isolation systems in a full-size building and obtaining
data on relative response between isolated and nonisolated structures. This
latter benefit results from the unique design of the test facility, located at
Tohoku University near Sendai, Japan. The test facility consists of two
identical full-size three-story buildings built side by side, except that one
structure is seismically isolated and the other is not. The facility is easily
adapted to use a variety of isolation systems. Since Sendai is a very
seismically active area, considerable data can be obtained in a short period of
time. This research program will use base isolation systems (at Sendai) for
which bearings have been extensively tested in the laboratory. The research
project results provide sets of data of individual bearings in an actual
building. The system response of the adjacent nonisolated structure provides
data for comparative purposes.
