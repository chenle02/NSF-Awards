Research during the last two decades has shown that conventional physics
instruction fails to alter student alternative conceptions (misconceptions), to
improve their problem-solving expertise, and to help students form a coherent
knowledge structure that can be effectively accessed when needed. Recent
experiments in physics education show that we can do much better. In these
experiments, students are active participants in constructing their own
knowledge and in developing expert-like strategies to solve standard and complex
problems. In this project, two new sets of active learning aides are being
constructed and evaluated, including a set of Concept Construction Experiments
and a set of Experiment Problems. These activities are being used in lecture,
recitation, and laboratory instruction in large introductory physics classes for
engineers and science majors. The kits are being integrated with previously
developed active learning pencil- and-paper activities into a coherent program
of physics instruction called OCS (Overview, Case Study) Action Physics. An
Active Learning Student Study Guide and Laboratory Manual are being prepared to
supplement a conventional textbook. A coordinated effort is being made to help
students construct their own conceptual models, to develop the individual skills
needed to use those models to solve complex problems, and to help students
organize this knowledge (conceptual and procedural) into a coherent structure
that can be accessed effectively. Previous and current work have shown
considerable promise for this method of instruction.
