NSF CAREER 0347902&lt;br/&gt;A Linguistic Approach to Software
Development&lt;br/&gt;Cristina Videira Lopes&lt;br/&gt;University of California
- Irvince&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Software in Science, Engineering and Business
requires domain expertise. But software development is worsened by the fact that
the description mechanisms - programming languages - are inadequate for
conveying relevant information to people. As a result, software systems become
fragile monuments of code that only software "artisans" dare to modify.
&lt;br/&gt;Work will be conducted within Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) and
Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP), with the aim of exploring their benefits in
software development. DSLs will be developed within ubiquitous computing, as it
includes several fields of expertise. The objective is the identification of
abstractions and the integration of different pieces of specification. A greater
objective is to find fundamental principles and techniques for the rapid
development of DSLs. The following will be studied, developed and empirically
evaluated: (1) Natural Language-based mechanisms for the support of more kinds
of referencing, such as anaphora; (2) methods for developing domain-specific
vocabularies; (3) techniques for the rapid development of DSLs.&lt;br/&gt;The
goal is that the process of software development will be improved considerably
by shortening expression gaps. The state of the art in both theory and practice
of Programming and Software Engineering will be&lt;br/&gt;enhanced with a
foundation for a new, important class of programming
languages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
