Prior research in modeling software failure rates has been based on
mathematical models of hardware reliability. These models do not reflect the
measurable, internal characteristics of the software systems. One measurable
characteristic of software, its complexity, has been shown to correlate well
with measures of software failure. Thus, incorporating software complexity
measures into existing reliability models provides substantial improvement in
their accuracy. Creating a mathematical model of software reliability is similar
to creating a hypothesis for a scientific experiment: the model must be
validated through experimentation. In this research, data collected during the
development of the Space Shuttle onboard flight systems provides an experimental
project in which the hypothesized reliability models are studied. One of the
most important aspects in the comparison of different reliability models is
their predictive quality. The goal of software reliability modeling is to
predict the future failure behavior of software using past and present data. New
reliability models with relative and functional complexity are compared to
existing models in terms of their predictive quality and quality of fit.
