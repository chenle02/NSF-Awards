Solids velocity distribution will be measured in an oscillating or continuously
shearing cell, with a specially built ultrasonic Doppler velocimeter. Liquid
pore pressure will also be determined. The objective is to obtain shear- strain
relationships, and data on the effect of gravity on resettling. The research is
focused on the flow measurements in concentrated slurries, and the improvement
of the ultrasonic technique for particulate flows. The ultrasonic method will
for non-intrusive measurements in dense slurry flow, which may lead to
fundamental findings on the two-phase flow structure.
