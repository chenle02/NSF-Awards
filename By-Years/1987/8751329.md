The Project for Leadership Enhancement, Application, and Dissemination in
Science (LEADS) will educate twenty excellent teachers of science (called
primary leaders) to lead workshops for sixty selected qualified elementary
teachers (called secondary leaders) and twenty administrators who will go back
to Los Angeles area school districts to lead science education programs they
helped design. Beginning in January 1988, primary leaders will attend ten
sessions of training, developing a handbook and workshops. In the summer of
1988, school districts will nominate a team of three elementary science teachers
and an administrator, who will attend a four week workshop in biology, earth
science, chemistry and physics at UCLA with lectures by scientists on the staff
of the University. The primary leaders will run the workshops and perfect the
handbook. In the 1988-89 academic year, the school districts will arrange
workshops for their science teachers using the secondary leaders.
