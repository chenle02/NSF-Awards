Researchers have developed a prototype CO2 insufflator that when used during a
colonoscopy reduces the discomfort caused by the procedure. The technology
developed through this project could provide a disposable CO2 insufflator that
uses an effervescent reaction to generate CO2 and is compatible with standard
flexible endoscopes. Effervescent chemical reactions are one of the few physical
phenomena capable of safely generating biocompatible gases in a rapid manner.
This ability enables the development of this technology for providing surgical
insufflation through small, light-weight and disposable devices that can be used
safely in standard clinical settings, remote locations and frontline triage
units.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Currently used CO2 insufflators are large, complex
and not widely used due to the high costs associated with the equipment.
Development of a small, disposable CO2 insufflator could increase regular use of
CO2 insufflators during colonoscopy procedures, which in turn would reduce the
discomfort experienced by the patient during the procedure. This technology
could enable a new class of insufflators which can be used in a wide range of
minimally invasive procedures.
