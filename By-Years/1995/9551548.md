The two principal gate keeper courses, the first semesters of general biology
and human anatomy and physiology have an attrition rate far above the average
for the college. Analysis by the curriculum committee has indicated that
students in these courses find the cell biology component especially difficult.
Attempts to improve performance in this area by utilization of an after-class
study center and additional cell biology laboratory activities have proven to be
inadequate. Through this project, a computer-assisted instruction (CAI)
laboratory is being developed. The laboratory consists of 24 networked stations
plus an instructor's station. The prior five hands-on laboratories are also
being equipped with one computerized station that permits integration of "wet"
laboratory activities with computer-assisted activities. A series of interactive
software titles have been closed and cover all aspects of the syllabus topics in
cell biology.
