The project aim is to develop an undergraduate program in behavioral
neuroscience with a strong emphasis on the development of critical thinking
skills through participation in active learning experiences in the classroom and
in faculty supervised student research. The project will focus on three separate
levels: introductory and advanced courses, and student research, with the degree
of training at each stage designed to build upon the skills learned in earlier
stages. This program expects to encourage student initiated research in
neuroscience that asks original questions through experimentation. Instruments
have been selected to introduce the skills necessary to utilize modern
technology in neuroanatomy and neurophysiology. Equipment is requested to
develop skills in neuroanatomy (a cryostat and related histological equipment)
and neurophysiology (including single and multiple unit recording apparatus).
