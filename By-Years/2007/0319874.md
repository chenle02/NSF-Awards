This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate
the feasibility of a nuclear magnetic resonance force microscope (NMRFM) that
will make it possible for the first time ever to routinely image intracellular
diffusion properties, relaxation times, and hydrogen densities of live cells
with sub-optical spatial resolution, down to a volume resolution of 0.1 micron
on a side. The hypothesis is that an NMRFM technique can be used for NMR-based
imaging of living eucaryotic and procaryotic cells with sub-optical resolution,
thereby allowing measurement of diffusion properties, relaxation times, and
hydrogen (proton-spin) densities of the cell itself and its larger internal
structures (e.g. nucleus, cytoplasm, plasma membrane, and mitochondria).

The commercial applications of this project will be in the research
instrumentation market. Prospective customers include biologists, medical
researchers, clinical practitioners, and others interested in functional and
structural imaging of living cells and acellular tissue samples.
