The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the
learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM)
by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative
resources, models and tools (RMTs). Projects in the DRK-12 program build on
fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development
efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed
projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Exploratory project will conduct an in-depth
analysis of instructional coaching by analyzing 520 hours of archived video-
recorded coaching sessions with 75 middle and high school science teachers in
grades 6-12 collected in a U.S. Department of Education IES-funded coaching
research study. The goal of the project is to "unpack" the coaching intervention
by analyzing the videos and previously collected quantitative outcome data to
(a) create descriptive profiles of instructional coaching and (b) identify which
key coaching elements ("active ingredients") lead to desired teacher and student
outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following a design-based research approach,
relying on iterative feedback and using data saturation process to analyze data,
the project will translate theorized, conceptual characteristics of coaching
into empirical models to guide future coaching research and practical guidance
through identification of critical elements needed for coaching to work.
