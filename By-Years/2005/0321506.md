This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will complete the
development of the microscale bioreactor platform as a useful tool for cell
culture studies in drug discovery research and development. The Phase II work
has three key objectives : (1) to expand the capabilities of the microscale
bioreactor to allow for the measurement of pH, dissolved oxygen, and protein
titer ; (2) to construct a fully automated bioprocessing cluster tool ; and (3)
to demonstrate the cost and speed advantages of the high-throughput approach to
bioreactor production of recombinant protein. The commercial application of this
project is in the area of cell culture bioreactors for drug discovery and
development.
