tomographic analysis of Neoproterozoic multicellular eukaryotes

ABSTRACT

This project is designed to study the three-dimensional internal structure of
phosphatized animal embryos and algae in the Neoproterozoic Doushantuo Formation
using new microscopic X-radiographic computed tomographic (microCT) as well as
conventional SEM and thin section techniques. Analyses will focus on a well-
constrained suite of 15 morphotypes. These fossils provide critical information
about the evolution of early multicellular organisms, and exhibit some of the
most spectacular cellular-level preservation known from the geologic record. The
goals of this project are to characterize the geometry, spatial relationships,
and number of cells within individual embryos and algae, and to identify
possible subcellular structures. This information will be used to interpret the
subcellular biology, cell geometry, and cell division topology. Ultimately, such
information is important in taxonomic and phylogenetic interpretation of these
Doushantuo fossils, which provide a unique window onto the Neoproterozoic
diversification of multicellular eukaryotes. Techniques developed during the
implementation of this project will be used to examine other permineralized and
calcareous fossils.
