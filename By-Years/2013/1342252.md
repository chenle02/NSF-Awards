The April 15, 2013 Boston Marathon Bombing (BMB) is a fresh reminder that
societies can be shocked not only by natural disasters such as earthquakes and
hurricanes but also by acts of terrorism. The bombing engaged the public in
multiple ways, and social media platforms (Twitter, YouTube, Facebook, etc.)
enabled the public to become both informed and to some extent involved. Digital
traces that can be collected from these sites present a brief window of
opportunity for research on how, and to what extent, this involvement emerged.
This RAPID project will collect data from social media such as Twitter and other
linked sources to address questions about the flow of information about the
event across traditional and social media, the propogation and amplification of
unsubstantiated information and misinformation, differences between official and
popular social media use, self-organization of efforts for assistance or suspect
tracking and changes in public sentiment over time. Data from this event may
reveal differences in the dynamics of social media use in the wake of terrorist
events vs. natural disasters.

The intellectual merit of the proposed project is that it combines emerging
methods and techniques for social media research with recent research on
disaster response coordination and planning to develop a conceptual model of the
BMB information flows to guide data collection and analysis. Because the Boston
Marathon attracted participants from around the world, this bombing has a global
dimension that may affect the nature and reach of the social media
communications.

Broader impacts of the project include educational benefits from students
involved in the project and in courses that will be informed by the project
findings. The collected data will be made available to other researchers and the
principal investigators plan to coordinate their work with others examining this
event, thus contributing to the infrastructure for science. The proposal
includes funding for dissemination of the results of preliminary analysis of the
collected data. Results from analysis may offer an improved guide for research
on communication and information flows in crises and disasters (whether natural
or human-initiated), thus benefiting society.
