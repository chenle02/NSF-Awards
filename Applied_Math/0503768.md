The Euler equations, a set of partial differential equations that describe the
motion of an inviscid fluid, are an exceptionally challenging system.
Friedlander studies issues related to these equations that involve important
mathematical problems and at the same time reflect basic properties of fluid
behaviour. Friedlander and Pavlovic examine an infinite system of nonlinearly
coupled ordinary differential equations that provide a simpler model of the
Euler equations. They use a variety of tools to examine the "closeness" of the
model, for which they prove the existence of finite time singularities, to the
Euler equations. In a separate line of research Friedlander and her
collaborators continue a project that examines the stability and instability of
fluid configurations. They study the unstable spectrum of the Euler equation
with the goal of a complete description of the structure of this spectrum over
the energy norm for generic two- and three-dimensional flows. This spectrum
detects not only instability in the linear sense but also is closely related to
natural physical questions about the transition from stability to instability
for the full nonlinear system. The investigator and her collaborators use a
considerable range of mathematical techniques to carry out this research,
including asymptotic methods, spectral theory, operator semi-group theory,
dynamical systems, and harmonic analysis.

The issue of stability or instability of a fluid flow is one of the central
problems in fluid dynamics: stable flows are robust under inevitable
disturbances in the environment, while unstable flows may break up, sometimes
violently. Even though the topic has been the subject for intense study over
more than a century because of its connection with many branches of science,
such as engineering, physics, oceanography, and meteorology, many questions
remain open. Friedlander uses mathematical techniques to answer some of these
questions and her work shows that in some appropriate sense almost all fluid
flows are unstable, although there are a number of different types of such
instability. A student is involved in the project, and the investigator
continues various mentoring activities to encourage women to enter careers in
mathematics.
