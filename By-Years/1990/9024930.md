The principal investigators will continue their successful research program in
various topics of current interest in complex fuction theory. In particular,
Professor Bank will work on the properties of solutions of complex ordinary
differential equations pertaining to growth and oscillation. Professor Kaufman
will work on problems involving conformal mapping, measure theory and
descriptive set theory and on problems in abstract harmonic analysis. And
Professor Wu will work on problems involving Green's functions in multi-
dimensional domains and growth properties along certain curves and on problems
in parabolic potential theory.
