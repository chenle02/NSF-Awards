This project combines new approaches and methods to understand evolutionary
changes in flower color in a group of plants, Ruellia (Acanthaceae), with 200+
species in the Americas. The focus is on anthocyanins (the blue to red pigments
that are the most important contributors of color in flowers). Cutting edge DNA
sequencing approaches will be used to study the plant biochemical pathways that
produce anthocyanins. These results will be placed in an evolutionary context to
understand what happens when, for example, purple flowers evolve from red-
flowered ancestors. The phylogeny or family tree of Ruellia will be
reconstructed using novel molecular markers to be developed for this project;
these markers will subsequently be useful to numerous other researchers.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flowers are among the most common means by which people
connect to nature: floral biology has great potential to engage broad audiences
in science. This research is also important because it will shed light on the
anthocyanins biochemical pathway. Anthocyanins contribute to numerous plant
functions (e.g., pollinator and fruit disperser attraction, UV sunscreen,
herbivore defense), and have also been linked to human health benefits (e.g.,
anti-cancer, -viral, -inflammatory, -arteriosclerosis activity; treatments for
hypertension, vision disorders). Anthocyanins are common constituents of human
diets, being found in frequently consumed fruits and vegetables. This research
project will add substantially to knowledge of the genetic basis of anthocyanin
production and will thus have implications for human health research.
