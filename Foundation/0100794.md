Cherlin and Thomas will pursue interactions of the techniques of logic with
problems in algebra and combinatorics. Cherlin will work with groups of finite
Morley rank using methods modeled heavily on finite group theory, aiming
particularly at an approach to the odd characteristic case compatible with the
existence of bad fields, and on problems in graph theory susceptible to model
theoretic analysis (universal graphs and problems of wqo). Thomas will work on
Borel equivalence relations, particularly with those associated with natural
classification problems in algebra, which may well provide the examples needed
to settle some problems presently open in full generality, as well as providing
information on the relative difficulty (according to a very robust system of
measurement) of the algebraic problems, some very classical and open, for what
can now seen to be essential reasons. Thomas will also pursue his work on the
automorphism tower problem, using set theoretic techniques.

Mathematical logic provides tools of great generality which can be applied to
various areas of mathematics. In combinatorial contexts the model theoretic
point of view provides methods that can be used to handle specific problems very
uniformly, rather than on the case by case basis sometimes encountered in the
literature. Descriptive set theory provides methods for analyzing the relative
difficulty of both solved and unsolved problems in algebra, and in particular
provides concrete information as to how detailed an answer one may usefully seek
in a classification problem, making it possible to distinguish dead ends from
fruitful lines of inquiry on an a priori basis.
