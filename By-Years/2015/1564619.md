The "Supporting College and Career Education through Student Scholarships in
Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (SuCCESS in STEM)" project at
Pellissippi State Community College will support 24 nontraditional students with
scholarships up to $8,500 per year over 2.5 years. The project will increase the
participation of financially-disadvantaged, nontraditional students in post-
secondary opportunities in high-demand STEM areas in East Tennessee. Support
services will be designed and implemented to ensure that scholars successfully
complete an associate degree and are prepared to either enter the workforce or
transfer to a four-year institution upon graduation. Real-world experiences
through targeted strategies such as internships, mentoring, and shadowing with
assistance of established partnerships with local industry will support the
successful transition of scholars into either employment or continuing post-
secondary education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quantitative and qualitative data will
be collected for both a formative and summative evaluation that will measure the
overall impact of the program. A comparison of student success and graduation
rates will be performed between scholars who are required to use these support
services versus students who voluntarily use these services. Research will focus
on the efficacy of support services and interventions that support the retention
of scholars, specifically focusing on improving the success of under-resourced,
nontraditional students in STEM disciplines. The results of this study will be
disseminated to the higher education academic community and will provide
guidance on intervention strategies such as scholarship programs, cohorts,
supplemental instruction, and experiential learning for recruiting and retaining
under-resourced students in STEM disciplines in a two-year college environment.
