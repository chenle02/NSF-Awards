This SBIR Phase I award provides funds to develop a software package for the
processing of macromolecular diffraction data from electronic position-sensitive
area detectors, with particular application to data from high-flux storage ring
x-ray sources. Existing packages of software are either geared toward data from
conventional laboratory x-ray sources or have been tested in a limited number of
sites. The proposers' XENGEN software package has been widely used and tested
and could be readily adapted to the high-flux, storage ring context. The
research involves extending this package to allow it to handle more kinds of
crystallographic data than it can currently handle, with particular attention to
its application to storage-ring data. The extensions of the existing software
must allow it to deal with new classes of statistical objects and with different
types of experimental conditions. The research effort will consist of analyzing
those new contexts, writing and documenting the new software, and testing the
software in conventional contexts and with data from detectors at storage rings.
The result will be a software package capable of handling diffraction data from
conventional x-ray sources and from storage rings when used in monochromatic or
multiple-wavelength modes; the types of area detectors for which the software
could be used include multiwire proportional counters, SIT tube television
detectors, and charge coupled device detectors. Genex intends to license and
distribute the software to laboratories and regional facilities in the United
States and abroad.
