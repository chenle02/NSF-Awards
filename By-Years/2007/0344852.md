&lt;br/&gt;Very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs), those that contain 20 or more
carbon units, are incorporated into a wide variety of physiologically
significant phytochemicals, including cuticular waxes, cutin, suberin,
sphingolipids, and some phospholipids and seed oils. Genes that encode several
of the enzymes involved in the production of VLCFAs have been isolated. Based on
the finding that maize mutants that block the production of one of these enzymes
are embryo lethal, VLCFAs must be essential during maize embryogenesis. Mutants
that block the accumulation of essential VLCFAs therefore provide an ideal
experimental system to determine the essential role of VLCFA-derived
phytochemicals in plant development.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will define
the essential developmental role(s) of VLCFAs, by determining the morphological
differences that distinguish the development of mutant embryos from normal
embryos. It will also establish which VLCFA-derived compound(s) are essential
during embryo development, by comparing the accumulation of VLCFA-derived
compounds in normal and mutant embryos. Finally, mutants that overcome the
embryo lethality associated with genetic blocks in the production of VLCFAs will
be isolated. In the long term, these mutants can be used to dissect the diverse
network of biochemical pathways that utilize VLCFAs.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed
studies meet the challenge of understanding the complex interplay between
biochemistry and development by continuing to exploit the synergy inherent in a
long-term research collaboration that integrates genetic and biochemical
approaches. This project will provide excellent cross-disciplinary training
experiences to a diverse group of early-career scientists because it will use a
combination of hypothesis-driven and genome-wide analyses, and apply cutting-
edge technologies to address significant questions in plant biology that have
proven recalcitrant to a mono-disciplinary approach.&lt;br/&gt;
