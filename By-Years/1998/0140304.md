EIA-0140304 -Salvatore Stolfo-Columbia University-SGER: Mitigating Access Risks
of Browsing Government Data and Websites by Secure Private Portals

This proposal from a computer scientist and a social scientist will study the
social and policy implications and citizen perceptions of government gathering
of Personally Identifying Information through Federal web sites, and will
explore the use of alternative privacy-enhancing technologies. These
technologies will be evaluated and further developed. Initial discussions with
several interested Federal Government agencies have already begun.
