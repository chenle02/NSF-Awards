The value of foliage as a food for herbivorous insect larvae depends upon the
nutritive value of the plant tissue and the food processing capabilities of the
insect years it has become increasingly clear that the characteristics that are
most important in determining nutritive value of foliage are nitrogen, water,
and toxin content, and possible also acidity. Much less is known about the
factors that determine an insect's capability to process ingested materials to
counter the characteristics of foliage that are potentially harmful. In very few
cases have convincing mechanistic explanations been provided to explain why one
insect species can grow will on a particular plant while another grows very
poorly. It is the purpose of this research to assess the importance of various
foliage characteristics that prevent effective food utilization by lepidopteran
larvae, to identify biochemical characteristics of the insects that allow them
to overcome these barriers, and to assess the metabolic costs of these
adaptations. If this project achieves its objectives, the results and
conclusions will be useful in explaining the relative susceptibilities of
different types of plant species (both crop plants and wild plants) to different
insect species (both pest species and non-pest species). This work may also
explain the ability of some insects to switch food plants or adapt to new hosts.
Thus, this research may help to clarify some of the biochemical factors that
have fostered the evolution of diversity among insects, and to explain why some
insects become pests and others do not.
