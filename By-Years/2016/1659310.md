This project focuses upon robust, persistent identification of data, which could
greatly improve scientific discovery and reuse of datasets. Persistent
identifiers of data (PIDs) enhance scientific discovery and are an important
element of research data sharing. This project creates a testbed to evaluate new
capabilities for persistent identifiers. The initial stage of the project will
include four diverse repositories containing millions of PIDs, and the second
stage will allow any NSF-eligible institution to use the testbed to evaluate
their own work. The project would enhance research
interoperability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Currently, there are several persistent
identifier options for data (such as Digital Object Identifiers, Handles, the
Archive Resource Key, and Uniform Resource Names). The existing environment is
limited by multiple solutions, weak interoperability, and procedures translating
PID to data object that are inconsistent. This project provides several new
capabilities:&lt;br/&gt; - A testbed to research new capabilities and
interoperability for persistent identifiers, which builds upon Indiana
University cyberinfrastructure and instances on Amazon Web Services;&lt;br/&gt;
- The ability to prototype and evaluate PID types, allowing study of the
difficulties and advantages of relating types to one another across a
distributed system; and&lt;br/&gt; - Approaches to mapping from PIDs to
Canonical Text Services Uniform Resource Names (CTS URNs). Combining URNs with
Handles should allow a precise CTS URN referencing capability, with the flexible
resolution of the existing widely-used Handle System.&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to
standardize the results of PID resolution, allowing various PID services to
interoperate at a higher level.
