This action funds Alexander J Loosley of Brown University to conduct a research
project, entitled "Studying how immune system cells detect the difference
between soft and stiff tissue," during the summer of 2012 at the National
University of Singapore in Singapore. The host scientist is Prof. Michael P
Sheetz.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is in using traction force
measurements to study the mechanisms that drive force generation and rigidity
detection in human immune system cells.

The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-
hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science,
science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
