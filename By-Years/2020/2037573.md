This project will bring together a broad group of stakeholders including
industry, academia and government covering areas ranging from technical to
economics, and other areas related to adoption for a moderated discussion of
priorities, collaborative topics and deliverables related to sustainability
through deployment of low carbon energy systems. This will provide a framework
and path for impactful results that will result in the rapid deployment of
sustainable energy paradigms in the short term.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Development of sustainable energy paradigms that are
economically realizable and reliable remains at the forefront of technological
development and policy drivers. Important challenges are developing grid-scale
energy storage that is reliable and affordable, innovating novel carbon capture,
utilization and sequestration (CCUS) that is economically feasible, reducing the
energy and environmental footprint of chemical conversion, imagining and
delivering a decarbonized and affordable industrial energy and a truly circular
plastics economy that ensures a zero-waste paradigm. The convergence of
advancing science and engineering focusing on issues of energy and
sustainability including carbon management, renewable energy and alternate fuels
such as hydrogen and energy storage are crucial to drive the energy transition.
Moreover, developing the capabilities and competencies of the workforce and the
tools that &lt;br/&gt;will enable this transition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
