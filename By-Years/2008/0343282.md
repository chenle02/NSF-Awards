This is a planning grant for department level reform at the University of Utah,
Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. In this project, the already
strong laboratory component within the ECE program at the University of Utah
will be enhanced by developing system-level design projects to be integrated
within individual courses and also spanning multiple courses. This builds on a
particular strength of the department, which already has a top-notch
industrially-sponsored senior design sequence a few courses with strong system
design projects. Through this change, it is expected to (1) increase student
recruitment and retention (including diverse students who might otherwise not
have chosen or stayed in engineering), (2) increase student motivation (system
design projects are FUN), (3) increase knowledge acquisition and retention
(because you can't forget something that you need to integrate at the end of the
semester and perhaps next semester too), and (4) develop system-level design
understanding (the formal training of which is very limited within ours and
other traditional engineering curricula).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The novel aspects
of this proposal include the projects themselves, the methods and concepts of
integrating multiple classes within the curriculum, and the methods to assess
and implement these projects. Undergraduate students, graduate students, and
faculty will work together to build this new program within our
department.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
