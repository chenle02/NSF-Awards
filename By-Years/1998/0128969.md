0128969&lt;br/&gt;Boltje&lt;br/&gt;This award supports Robert Boltje and
students from the University of California-Santa Cruz in a collaboration with
Burkhard Kulshammer of the Department of Mathematics at the University of Jena,
Germany. The aim of the international project is to study the structure of
various representation rings of finite groups, viz., the ring of monomial
representations, the trivial and linear source ring, the Green ring, and other
viariants. The results are expected to have applications to generalizations of
Brown's theorem on Euler characteristics and to invariants in algebraic number
theory, and might also uncover connections to algebraic topology. The work plan
provides for extensive participation by graduate students in the international
travel and research, and the exchange is intendedto let them benefit from the
complementary strengths of both collaborators and to introduce them at an early
stage to international collaboration to stimulate further exchange of
ideas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
