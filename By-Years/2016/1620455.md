Future scientific and technological progress will depend heavily on the
generation of new information technology capabilities and novel methods from
signal and image processing to deal with today's massive volumes of data. A
research effort is proposed to create mathematical concepts and computational
methods to address some of the key challenges in this important area. In
particular, the PI will focus on the areas of imaging, high-dimensional data
analysis, machine learning, and information theory. The project uses tools from
computational harmonic analysis, operator theory, random matrix theory, and
optimization yielding efficient numerical algorithms with rigorously-established
properties under carefully stated conditions. The payoffs for society at large
are many, including new information technology capabilities, improved methods
for signal- and image processing, as well as better understanding of data mining
tools for Big Data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two concrete topics of this research
effort are:(i) Fast and reliable algorithms of non-convex problems: When dealing
with massive data sets, many tasks involve the use of a heuristic algorithm to
solve a non-convex optimization problem. Often these heuristic algorithms get
stuck in local minima, that are far away from the global minimum. We will
develop fast numerical algorithms that come with theoretical performance
guarantees for a range of important data analysis tasks; (ii) Efficient
algorithms for heterogenous and high-dimensional data: Existing methods for
high-dimensional data are often computationally rather expensive and rely on
stationarity and homogeneity of the data, thus limiting their use for massive,
heterogenous data sets. The PI will derive a framework of computationally
efficient methods for properly fusing and efficiently processing heterogeneous,
high-dimensional data.
