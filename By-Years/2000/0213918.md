The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) at the University
of Colorado, The Ferroelectric Liquid Crystal Materoals Reserach Center, focuses
on basic liquid crystal and soft materials science that may result in enhanced
capabilities for electro-optic, nonlinear optic, chemical and other
applications. The Center consists of a single interdisciplinary research group
(IRG) working on three major themes: molecularstructure/macroscopic properties,
interfaces, and polymers/gels. Each theme integrates molecular modeling and
design, synthesis, physical characterization, and applications development. The
MRSEC maintains shared facilities in support of its research and for the
training of students. The Center carries out a comprehensive education and
outreach program that includes outreach to K-12 students and teachers by
bringing materials topics to the classroom, summer research experiences for
undergraduates, and a graduate program in liquid crystal science and technology.
The MRSEC has strong interactions with the industrial sector through research
collaborations involving faculty and students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participants
in the Center currently include 9 senior investigators, 1 postdoctoral
associate, 12 graduate students, and 4 support personnel. Professor Noel A.
Clark directs the MRSEC. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
