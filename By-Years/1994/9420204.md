9420204 Bolte Dr. Bolte's observational research project addresses four
problems: 1) the absolute age of the oldest globular star clusters in the
Galaxy, 2) the age dispersion among the galactic globular clusters and for the
dwarf spheroidal galaxies that are companions to the Milky Way, 3) the low-mass
end of the Population II star mass/luminosity function, and 4) the nature of
blue straggler stars in globular clusters and the frequency of their occurrence
as a function of stellar density and velocity dispersion within the individual
clusters and for different clusters.
