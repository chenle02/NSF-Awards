The proposed research deals with interrelated subjects in symplectic geometry,
quantization and low dimensional topology. Methods of non-commutative algebras
and geometry will be applied to a number of questions in geometric quantization,
particularly to the study of moduli of flat connections on bundles over Riemann
surfaces. This is expected to lead to further insight into knot invariants and
three-dimensional manifolds related to conformal field theories.
