The focus of this research is to design artificial nucleases based on quinone
methides which hydrolyse the DNA phosphate backbone under mild conditions. To
determine the mechanistic details of action of quinone methides, natural
products, such as mitomycin C and daunamycin, will be investigated by
electrochemical studies, Nernst-Clark plots, pH rate profiles and product
studies. Cyclopropyl quinone methides will be investigated by spectroscopic
studies. Aziridinyl hydroquinones will be studied to obtain a structure activity
relationship for fate and nucleophile selectivity of reduced aziridinyl
quinones. With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the
research of Dr. Edward B. Skibo of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry
at Arizona State University. Professor Skibo will focus his work on the study of
the formation and fate of reactive species such as quinone methides.These
studies will impact areas including natural product chemistry and the design of
artificial DNA cleaving agents.
