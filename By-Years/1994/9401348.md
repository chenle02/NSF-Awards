9401348 Watson Dr. Watson will continue his theoretical research on the creation
and transport of maser radiation in diffuse astrophysical environments. The
results will be applied to interpreting the observations of star-forming
regions, of circumstellar environments, and of the diffuse medium in other
galaxies. Delineating the characteristics of maser radiation from gaseous,
Keplerian disks, and other geometrical configurations will be a central topic.
Calculations for the polarization properties needed to infer the relationship
between the magnetic field and the gas at the highest densities will also be
performed. Astronomical phenomena that involve the dense molecular gas, such as
star formation, will be better understood as a result of this research.
