Activists seeking to persuade government officials to implement particular
policies often try to mobilize public opinion and widespread public displays of
support. Their ability to do so is affected not only by their own skills, but by
the extent and nature of their linkages with a larger constituency, and by their
relations to other political actors. In European democracies, this especially
includes political parties. Public support for an issue which is initially
popular may actually decline as the issue becomes politicized. Activists cannot
control public opinion, and must instead change their own ideas in response to
these shifting definitions of an issue. For this project, longitudinal survey
data on a Dutch "peace movement" campaign are analyzed statistically to provide
input for theorizing. The data were collected in the Netherlands before and
after a massive campaign in which millions of citizens sent the government
postcards opposing deployment of Cruise missiles. The campaign ultimately failed
when the government approved deployment. Surveys have been completed for samples
of the general public in four communities, as well as for all activists in those
same four and six additional communities. Theory developed in light of the data
will show how the costs and benefits that underlie collective action are
themselves constructed in light of political allegiances and identities.
