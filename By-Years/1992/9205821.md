Many of the problems central to earth structure and history require a deeper
understanding of differentiation in a convecting two-phase (liquid-solid)
system. Current research indicates no inconsistency between geophysical
arguments favoring extensive early melting of the earth (a deep magma ocean) and
geochemical arguments, primarily because differentiation does not begin until
the system approaches the solidus (melt fraction 20%). The PI will pursue the
issue of the extent to which differentiation can take place at this stage and
subsequently, through a comprehensive set of analytical and computer model
calculations, and combine these with high pressure geochemical data to test the
consequences against current earth structure. //
