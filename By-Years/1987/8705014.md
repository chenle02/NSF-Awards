Dr. Elizabeth Bernays of the University of California, Berkeley, intends to
establish, in a varied group of insects, whether or not behavioral rejection of
plants is correlated with oral toxicity (including any adverse effects on
fitness) of such plants. The question has never been specifically addressed, but
preliminary data suggest that correlation of deterrence with "toxicity" for
plant secondary compounds is poor. If this proves to be generally true, it must
be asked why behavioral deterrence is so widespread. The selective forces
maintaining host plant specificity the associated rejection of most plants could
well be more positive needs based on quite different principles. In that case,
our understanding of plant defenses against insects would need revision. These
researches bear directly on questions of pest control and parasitism in
agriculture and agroforestry which could have wide ranging connotations,
especially in tropical systems. The investigator and her institution are well
suited to pursue this research to a successful conclusion.
