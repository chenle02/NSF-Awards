This project investigates new computational methods for prototyping physical
systems with desired dynamical behaviors, with expected applications in design
and control engineering. It develops a computational environment for visualizing
and manipulating dynamics of physical systems through a combination of numerical
and symbolic computations. More specifically, this project studies (1) automated
characterization of dynamical systems through analytic and geometric analysis,
and (2) techniques for interactive synthesis, optimization, and visualization of
dynamics, for example, ``computational scissors'' that cut-and-paste vector
fields and shape the desired dynamical properties (e.g. stability regions) for a
complex system that is otherwise difficult to design.
