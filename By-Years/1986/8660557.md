Clean sources of atomic chlorine are required for mechanistic studies of
semiconductor etching processes. In this proposal, we describe modifications to
an existing ultrahigh vacuum compatible, effusive beam, microwave discharge
fluorine atom source which would alow its use as a source of chlorine atoms, and
we define measurements to characterize and demonstrate its operation. The
modifications are aimed primarily at reducing heterogeneous recombination of
chlorine atoms on the source walls. The measurement techniques include modulated
beam mass spectrometry and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.
