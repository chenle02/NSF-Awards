The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II
project seeks to increase the competitiveness of the US in manufacturing high
value parts for shops with high product variety, low volumes, large lead times,
and large set up times. The application addresses a need to find the optimal way
of utilizing existing resources in order to maximize production rates. The
proposed technology may provide an affordable and easy-to-use solution for
target markets in aerospace and medical technologies industries. The technology
may also help strengthen the national defense of the United States by
facilitating onshoring of defense manufacturing by making domestic producers
more cost competitive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project involves the development of a new technology
that enables high value manufacturers in optimizing the flow of materials in
their shops. For shops with high product variety, low volume, large lead times,
and large set up times, there is a need to find the optimal way to utilize
existing resources in order to maximize production rate. Most scheduling
optimizers are unable to handle this problem reliably or affordably. The newly
proposed methods, algorithms, and software may solve this challenge. The
business model for delivering this software solution is designed for small and
medium size businesses in terms of both cost and usability perspectives. The
solution demonstrates double digit improvements in all Key Performance
Indicators (KPIs), such as on-time delivery (OTD), inventory turns, and
profitability. Phase II work will mature shop optimization software through
demonstration in a real aerospace parts factory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
