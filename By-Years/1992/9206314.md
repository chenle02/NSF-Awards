This award provides funding for the acquisition of several items of equipment
for the Purdue Rare Isotope Measurement Laboratory or PRIME Lab. PRIME Lab
operates a tandem Van de Graaff accelerator devoted primarily to geoscience
applications of radioactive dating and the use of extremely rare cosmogenic
nuclides as tracers to explain processes of weathering, groundwater circulation,
soil formation, sedimentation, crustal subduction, and extraterrestrial impact
phenomena. The equipment to be obtained through this award includes a new
charging belt and a cryopump for the accelerator.
