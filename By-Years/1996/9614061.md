9614061 Clark The structure and dynamical behavior of liquid crystalline (LC)
phases will be studied using optical microscopy, light and x- ray scattering,
and scanning tunneling microscopy. A principal focus will be on freely suspended
liquid crystalline films and liquid crystals in porous media, with an emphasis
on investigating dimensionality, fluctuation and interface effects. The
fluctuation, field and surface effects when combined with the wide variety of
order parameters and symmetries characteristic of liquid crystals will provide a
special opportunity for observing neu phenomena. %%% The topics to be explored
will have important scientific and technological impact on areas such as liquid
crystals for use in flat panel displays, and the likelihood of the discovery of
entirely new phenomena will open up avenues of exploration for other scientists
working in areas such as condensed matter physics and chemistry. ***
