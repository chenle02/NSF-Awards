ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broadband biological agent detection is developed
whereby chains of labeled paramagnetic nanoparticles are caused to rotate
through a magnetic field and signal is enhanced through a lock-in amplification
technique. The project, if successful, will allow improving signal to noise
ratio for biosensors. Three students are involved and many aspects of the
research from nanotechnology, nanomagnetics, sensing, and modeling are all
involved. Good outreach activities and teaching are incorporated into the
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is being funded by the CTS/ENG (C
Aidun, PD) and ECS/ENG (R Khosla, PD).
