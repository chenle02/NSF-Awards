9409274 Novick This proposal deals with connections between combinatorial
optimization, graph theory, matroid theory and coding theory. Matroids
generalize the notion of vector space. An ideal clutter is a type of 0-1 matrix
which arises in the set covering problem. Applications of the set covering
problem include airline crew scheduling, dispatching of trucks and facility
location. The theory of codes is used to efficiently account for noise when
sending, receiving and decoding messages. Binary clutters occur in many graph
theoretic settings and in network applications. There are close connections
between binary clutters, matroids and codes. The applicant proposes to study the
structure of ideal, binary clutters in a matroidal context and to determine the
feasibility of a matroidal approach to a long standing graph colouring problem
and to some questions involving the covering radius of certain codes. The
covering radius of a code is important for decoding. Planning activities will
include working with two senior researchers, Andras Sebo, of CNRC in Grenoble,
and J.D. Key of Clemson University. The outcome of the planning period will be
several papers and a formal NSF proposal to be completed within 18 months of the
start date. ***
