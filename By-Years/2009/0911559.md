Edwin L. Sibert of the University of Wisconsin is supported by an award from the
Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program to develop theoretical
descriptions of correlated electronic-nuclear both in the gas and condensed
phases. The PI and his research group are developing models for studying energy
flow in molecular system for which coupling between electronic and nuclear
degrees of freedom are especially significant, including the dynamics of open
shell methoxy/ hydroxymethane species and proton tunneling dynamics of formic
acid dimer in solution. They collaborate with spectroscopist Peter Chen and his
group at Spelman College to help in the interpretation of complex spectra
involving multiple potential interacting energy surfaces.

Understanding the correlation between electronic and nuclear motion will help in
the understanding of many systems ranging from enzyme function, photo-chemistry,
materials and molecular electronics. The PI is involved in organizing a Gordon
conference and a Telluride workshop to bring together scientists working in this
important research area.
