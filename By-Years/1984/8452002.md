The research plan for this project is to examine the effects of time varying
parameters on the stability of adaptive control algorithms. Two dual models for
the parameter time variations will be examined: (1) large changes infrequently
("jump parameters"); and (2) small changes infrequently ("drift parameters").
New algorithms will be developed which can handle both types of variations while
preserving their global stability properties and good performance. Initially,
continuous-time plants and algorithms will be considered and later on, the
continuous-time results will be extended to the discrete time case.
