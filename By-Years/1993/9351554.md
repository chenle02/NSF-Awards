9351554 Shalhoub Modular laser instrumentation is being developed for use in
upper-division chemistry courses and student research. This approach is
advancing students' knowledge of modern spectroscopy and demonstrating the
applications of lasers in chemistry. Since most students are intrigued by
lasers, they are becoming more involved in hands-on experiments. Students are
using a helium-cadmium laser, monochromator, and signal enhancing instruments
interfaced to a computer to investigate the spectra of molecules. Light emitted
from laser-excited molecules is directed through a monochromator and detected
with a lock-in amplifier. Students are building instruments from components to
ensure that they understand the workings of what is typically 'blackbox'
equipment. The new experiments are replacing outmoded or redundant measurements
in the physical chemistry lab with the result that the curriculum now has a
better balance between thermodynamics and spectroscopy. ***
