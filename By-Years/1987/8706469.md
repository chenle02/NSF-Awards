This proposal requests funds for the purchase of a transmission electron
microscope for a group of neurobiologists and cell biologists. The microscope is
also used in training electron microscopists. The instrument will be used to
support research on synaptogenesis and synaptic organization in the developing
peripheral and central nervous system and synaptic plasticity in the central
nervous system, the role of individual components of the cytoskeleton in
mitosis, cell morphogenesis, and normal and pathological conditions of neurons,
and on the supramolecular organization of photosynthetic membranes, and
transient changes in cellular membrane systems associated with the secretion of
glycoproteins and oligosaccharins; i.e., oligosaccarides with hormonal
properties.
