This proposal requests support for a symposium entitled "Plant Gametes and
Fertilization" sponsored by the Botanical Society of America in conjunction with
the American Institute of Biological Sciences Annual Meeting in Richmond, Va.,
August 7, 1990. The objective is to stimulate research in the U.S. on plant
reproduction, specifically on the study of gametes and fertilization in
flowering plants, by presenting current research in the field. Emphasis will be
on the questions being asked and the experimental approaches used to answer
them. Topics will include isolation and characterization of sperm and eggs,
fertilization in vivo and in vitro and methods used in the study of algal
gametes and fertilization. By inviting international speakers and Americans who
have worked abroad, the symposium will provide an overview of this expanding
international field. Invited talks will be followed by an open session of
contributed papers on plant gametes and fertilization to which any member may
submit an abstract. %%% Sexual reproduction in flowering plants has emerged as
an area of significant scientific progress in the last five years, in addition
to its obvious importance to agriculture. This meeting will provide access for
U.S. scientists to the latest work in this area.
