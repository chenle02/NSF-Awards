9312087 This project involves interdisciplinary research taking place in a
laboratory setting, in which mathematical theory and applied scientific problems
are attacked in an environment supporting modern computational methods and
advanced computer graphics. Some of the problems considered are: grain
boundaries of compound materials; global behavior of embedded minimal surfaces
and computational methods for finding Willmore extrema; computation of conformal
knot energies and stable "multiple bubble" configurations; fluid flow problems.
In addition software tools, automated video techniques and networking tools will
be developed, tailored to the interdisciplinary research being carried out.
