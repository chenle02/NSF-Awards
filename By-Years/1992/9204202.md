The proposed work is on a number of fundamental problems in several areas of
algorithm design and analysis. Work in three areas is planned. o Work on both
limited and unlimited randomness is to be continued on two fronts, new
algorithms and better tools for analyzing them. The analytic tools include
better bounds for tail events, and extensions of operator theory to analyze
performance in more difficult cases. o For suitably restricted classes, it
should be feasible to automate the generation of algorithms problems for
teaching, and to formulate very high level languages that admit natural
solutions and support automated verification and refutation. Research for this
section is aimed at exploring the fundamentals necessary to build a fledgling
system to support the learning of algorithmic concepts. o While a rich variety
of models for distributed processing have been devised, and many algorithms have
been analyzed within these theoretical frameworks, some large scale machines are
being built that run on different principles. This work is aimed at
understanding such computation, which might be called semi-synchronous.
