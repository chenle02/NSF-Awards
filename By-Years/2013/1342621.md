There is a need in the mathematics community for conferences that are geared
toward the professional growth of young mathematicians. Attending and giving
talks at conferences is a necessary part of every mathematician's life, but many
conferences cater to established specialists. Such an environment can prove too
intimidating for graduate students who wish to give talks of their own. The
Binghamton University Graduate Conference in Algebra and Topology (BUGCAT) was
specifically designed to meet the need for an alternative. It is a math
conference run by graduate students, for graduate students. Like all
conferences, BUGCAT provides a gathering place for professors and graduate
students from various institutions to present their research to a wider
audience, to collaborate, and to share ideas. The focus at the BUGCAT, however,
is on the graduate student. The BUGCAT gives graduate students doing research in
any area of algebra or topology an opportunity to practice giving talks and to
network with other mathematicians sharing related research interests. At the
same time, it gives graduate students an opportunity to hear talks by world
renowned mathematicians doing groundbreaking work.

This award supports the Binghamton University Graduate Conference in Algebra and
Topology, which will take place at Binghamton University on November 17-18,
2014. Now in its seventh year, the BUGCAT is a venue where algebra and topology
graduate students in all stages of their research can present their work. The
graduate students who attend the BUGCAT are better equipped to find academic
positions and continue research and collaboration. Attendees are exposed to a
wide variety of current research, ideas, and results, and they have ample
opportunity to meet senior researchers and students of their generation who may
become future collaborators or colleagues. The conference also promotes
diversity in the mathematical sciences by encouraging and supporting
participation by women and minorities.
