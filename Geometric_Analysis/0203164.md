ABSTRACT: DMS 0203164.

We have been studying problems in Riemannian geometry that concern with
interplays between curvature and topology, and the major part of our work are
about the controlled topology of collapsed manifolds with sectional curvature
bounded in absolute value and applications to the global Riemannian geometry.
For the past three years, we have made substantial progresses in this field
pioneered by Cheeger-Gromov-Fukaya: we established the isomorphism finiteness
result for the higher homotopy groups, the diffeomorphism finiteness result for
a certain class of manifolds, and the convergence of collapsing sequences in
this class. We have made a progress on investigating some rigidity phenomena for
the class of closed manifolds of non-positive sectional which are not locally
symmetric spaces. We have made a progress in the homeomorphism classification of
positively curved manifolds whose isometry group contains a torus of large rank,
and extend this result to the larger class of manifolds which only admit
isometric discrete abelian group actions. We will continue our programs in these
fields in the near future that represents a continuation of the work proposed
three years ago for NSF Grant DMS 9971360.

One of the most important developments in Riemannian geometry in the last two
decades is our understanding of the Riemannian manifolds which appear to be
smaller than their actual dimension (i.e collapsed). For instance, the surface
of a very thin donuts looks like a circle while whose curvature and diameter are
bounded. Our progress is amplified by the amazing fact that among the manifolds
whose curvature and diameter are bounded, all but finitely many appear to be
smaller than their actual dimension.
