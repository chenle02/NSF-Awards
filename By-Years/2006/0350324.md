American society is becoming increasingly multi-ethnic. Traditionally, however,
issues of cultural diversity have been peripheral in core fields concerned with
understanding learning and development. A science of learning must place these
issues at the center of the scientific investigation of learning and
development. The goal of this SLC Catalyst activity is to develop the
conceptual, methodological and empirical underpinnings for the creation of a
Center for the Study of Culture, Learning and
Development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will focus on three activities:
(1) conceptualize and operationalize a research agenda for the systematic study
of culture, learning and development within an ecological framework, focusing in
particular on the diverse cultural pathways of development across human groups;
(2) build the partnerships needed to accomplish such an agenda; and (3) create a
blueprint for the kinds of work practices, leadership and management structures,
evaluation and dissemination efforts needed to support an efficient, critically
reflective, and productive Center. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research agenda
will address fundamental, unanswered questions about diverse cultural pathways
of development. It will address fundamental methodological issues in the
empirical investigation of complex social ecologies within an inter-disciplinary
framework.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Center for the Study of Culture, Learning and
Development will contribute to deeper understanding of both persistent and
emergent social and educational dilemmas in our society, and, importantly, to
the design of models aimed at improving life chances for the many in this
country who historically have been underserved by educational and public service
efforts. &lt;br/&gt;
