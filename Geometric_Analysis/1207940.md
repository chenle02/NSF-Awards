The University of North Carolina (UNC) Department of Mathematics plans to host a
week long conference entitled "A Conference on Partial Differential Equations -
Analytic and Geometric Aspects" in Chapel Hill from July 16-20, 2012 relating to
microlocal analysis and geometry in partial differential equations (PDE). This
conference will bring together experts in the fields of microlocal and geometric
analysis, which dramatically impact the study of partial differential equations,
geometry, topology and spectral theory. Though such fields rarely interact in
focused conferences, they often have an overlap of useful techniques and ideas
that would allow for collaborations to make advancements in both analysis and
geometry. In particular, the conference would bring together many experts whose
insights into geodesic flow and geometry could dramatically inform and advance
the University of North Carolina analysis group's efforts to understand the
existence and dynamics of nonlinear bound states on manifolds, which have arisen
in the studies of both geometry and dispersive equations. This project supports
participation in the conference on Partial Differential Equations - Analytic and
Geometric Aspects. Funds will be used for the travel and housing costs for
speakers, graduate students, postdocs and junior faculty at U.S. universities
without NSF support who would like to participate in the conference. This
workshop will reflect the main areas of focus of the partial differential
equations group at the University of North Carolina, which has grown around
distinguished senior faculty member Michael Taylor, who has made fundamental
contributions to PDE throughout his career, in particular helping to develop the
topics of microlocal and geometric analysis in the study thereof. The group has
wishes to bring in experts and students from around the world to discuss recent
advances, in particular related to nonlinear partial differential equations on
manifolds and applications. Such techniques have led to a surge in activity
touching such areas as general relativity, fluid mechanics, and nonlinear
optics. More details for the conference can be found at
