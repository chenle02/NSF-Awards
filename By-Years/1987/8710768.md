In many shallow oceanic environments, wave-induced flow and sediment transport
are dominant processes on the scales of benthic organism feeding and growth.
However, the response of marine benthic organisms to oscillatory flow and
oscillatory sediment transport has not been investigated. Using coupled field
and laboratory experiments, the effects of oscillatory flows on the feeding
biology of intertidal and shelf invertebrates will be studied. Many of the
experimental tests will utilize a uniquely constructed oscillatory wave tank
which will have future benefits in the study of the adaptations of benthic
animals to their physical environments.
