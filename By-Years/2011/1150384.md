This engineering education research initiation grant seeks to understand the
effect of student motivation and intention on conceptual understanding;
conceptual understanding is important for engineering practice and innovation.
The study will look broadly at students using a national survey which is
followed by real time data collection; the project will develop new ways to
collect data using smart-phone "apps". &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader
significance and importance of this project will occur when the results are
translated into classroom practice at multiple institutions through partnerships
with engineering faculty members. The project will broadly disseminate the
results to multiple audiences using a range of media. This project overlaps with
NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers through preparation of an
engineering workforce with new capabilities and expertise. Additionally NSF's
goal of innovating for society is enabled by creating results and research that
are useful for society by informing educational policy and practices.
