This action is for travel support for American scientists to participate in a
symposium on the interplay between the nervous, endocrine and immune systems to
be held in conjunction with the annual meeting of the American Society of
Zoologists in Vancouver, British Columbia. State-of-the-art lectures will be
held on (1) behavioral regulation of immunity and (2) mechanisms and
consequences of central nervous system and immune system interactions. The
emphasis of these presentations is on the use of diverse biological systems. The
goal of this meeting is to encourage greater research participation by
zoologists in this new and expanding field. The hope is that conveying the
conceptual and empirical advancements in psychoneuroendocrinology will lead to
the development of new experimental approaches which, in turn, will be used to
unravel the complex mechanisms, pathways and feedback loops that serve to
communicate interactions between these three systems. Elucidating the basic
mechanisms underlying stress and developing coping strategies will be one
outcome of a better understanding of this intimate relationship between the
neural, endocrine and immune systems.
