This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
will assist the Department of Chemistry at University of Rochester in the
purchase of a modern single drystal diffraction system. This new instrumentation
will enhance greatly research in a number of areas including the following: (1)
Studies of C-H and C-S bond activation in thiophenes; (2) The catalysis of acyl-
acyl coupling reactions with binuclear platinum group complexes; (3)
Electrophilic and radical processes in bond activation using cationic complexes
of Rh(III) and Ir(III) and d7 complexes; (4) Studies of the formation of
aggregates and microcrystallites of various dyes and photochemically reactive
chromophores; (5) The development of asymmetric synthesis methodology for
natural products; and (6) The design and synthesis of catalysts for the
polymerization of monosubstituted olefins. The X-ray diffractometer is used to
make accurate and precise measurements of the full three- dimensional structure
of a molecule. The information obtained gives the precise values of all the bond
distances and bond angles of a given molecule and it gives accurate information
about the spatial arrangement of that molecule relative to the neighboring
molecules.
