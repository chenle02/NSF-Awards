During the development of multicellular organisms, cell differentiation is
tightly coordinated with cell division. In animals, loss of control of cell
division leads to cancer. In both plant and animal differentiation, some cell
types display a modified cell division cycle where the DNA is replicated without
concomitant cell division, thus, increasing nuclear DNA content. This is called
endoreplication; in plants, important examples of endoreplicated cell types
include cereal endosperm, cotton fibers, and nitrogen-fixing symbiotic nodules
in legumes. Although endoreplication is known to be important in these critical
systems, its detailed mechanism and regulation remain poorly understood.
Previous work using Arabidopsis leaf hairs (trichomes) as a model for cell
differentiation demonstrated that the SIAMESE (SIM) gene encodes a cyclin-
dependant kinase inhibitor that suppresses mitosis during establishment of
endoreplication, and defined a gene family of SIAMESE-RELATED (SMR) genes found
in all land plant genomes that may function similarly.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
The project aims are to better define the biochemical mechanisms through which
the SIM protein inhibits cell division, to test hypotheses about how the SIM
protein itself is regulated, and to investigate the roles of some of the SMR
genes in plant growth and development. By illuminating the mechanisms underlying
endoreplication and the coordination of cell division and cell differentiation,
the project will advance the understanding of plant growth and development
relevant to improvement of both traditional crops and production of biomass for
biofuels. Additionally, comparison of plant and animal cell cycle control
mechanisms may give useful insights relevant to human disease. Finally, the
projected work will play a role in the education of graduate students,
undergraduates, and high school students from diverse backgrounds.
