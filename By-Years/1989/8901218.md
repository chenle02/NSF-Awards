This grant is a renewal award for DMR-8521834, which was highly productive:
development of new analytical techniques to study the fundamental phase
transformations and chemical reactions between two different oxide ceramics at
near atomic resolution, development of the use of Rutherford backscattering
spectroscopy to determine the kinetics of reactions in these systems, and
confirmation that topotaxial and epitaxial growth in these materials occurs in
layers of several unit cells at a time rather than one atomic layer at a time,
as previously believed. The emphasis of this work is to use these new analytical
techniques to understand the effect of the structure and chemistry at the phase
boundary upon the movement of the interface between two oxides of different
crystal structure. Analytical techniques being used include: all aspects of
transmission electron microscopy will be used (e.g., chemical analysis, atomic
lattice imaging. converging beam electron diffraction), electron microprobe,
visible light microscopy, Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy, and x-ray
diffraction. Materials if interest include: nickel-aluminum oxide spinels,
magnesium-aluminum oxide spinels, magnesium-chromium-aluminum oxide speinels,
and iron-aluminum oxide spinels. The research has two main objectives: geometry
of the interface, and to understand how the morphology and the chemistry of the
interface affect the kinetics with which the interface develops.
