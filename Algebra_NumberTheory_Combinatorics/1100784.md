This project focuses on algebro-geometric ideas that can be used to improve our
understanding of arithmetic phenomena. The PI and co-workers have recently
extended the scope of the theory of reductive algebraic groups over function
fields via their work on pseudo-reductive groups. This has led to
generalizations of useful finiteness theorems, and suggested new problems
concerning linear algebraic groups over function fields that the PI proposes to
solve. The PI will continue his work on descent theory in non-archimedean
geometry, as well as on some problems in Galois deformation theory that involve
reductive groups, rigid-analytic geometry, and p-adic Hodge theory. Finally, the
PI will study deeper properties of a parity obstruction, including applications
to Mordell-Weil ranks in families of elliptic curves over global function fields
and advise PhD students working on number-theoretic problems with a geometric
flavor.

Although much of the motivation for the study of number theory comes from within
pure mathematics, important practical applications continue to emerge. For
example, secure Internet communication relies crucially on number-theoretic
techniques of geometric origin that were invented for theoretical reasons. This
proposal addresses questions in several areas of active development on the
geometric side of number theory, and will lead to new theoretical methods that
solve specific problems as well as lay the groundwork for future progress. The
PI also proposes to continue supervising number theory research by talented high
school students and giving talks across many areas of mathematics to groups of
students at the high school, undergraduate, and graduate levels.
