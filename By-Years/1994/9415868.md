9415868 Buchler This three-year award will support U.S.-France cooperative
research in stellar astronomy between J. Robert Buchler of the University of
Florida and Marie-Jo Goupil of the Paris Observatory in Meudon, France. They
propose to analyze ground and space based observational data on variable
(pulsating) stars. They will develop, adapt and test novel, nonlinear techniques
in order to constrain modeling of certain types of pulsating stars. This study
involves two disciplines: stellar astrophysics and nonlinear dynamics and signal
processing. Nonlinear signal processing now makes it possible to examine older
observational data on pulsating stars and to extract inaccessible information.
The U.S. investigator is a theorist in stellar variability and irregular
variations of stars. His expertise is complemented by French observational
experience of pulsating stars. The project takes advantage of access to French
observational data that will be essential to validate the U.S. investigator's
theoretical research effort. The results will advance understanding of stellar
structure and evolution and the chemical composition and evolution of galaxies.
