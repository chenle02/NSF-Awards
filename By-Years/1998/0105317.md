0105317&lt;br/&gt;Bierly&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For years studies by government
and private groups have addressed the changing research climate in the U.S. and
also the changing education environment at all levels, K-12 through post-
graduate. Many of these studies have had a common theme, the need for a closer
integration of research and education. New opportunities using this theme
continue to exist for restructuring or redirecting programs in the Earth and
Space Sciences. Here, Earth and space science is defined broadly to include
atmospheric sciences, geochemistry, geology, geophysics, earth sciences,
hydrology, oceanography, aeronomy and space physics, and other closely allied
disciplines. One of the best ways to move toward integrating research and
education is to have open discussions with the leaders of departments
responsible for the research and associated education. These are the Heads and
Chairs of the Earth and Space Science Departments. This award supports the
annual meetings of the Heads and Chairs over the next three years.&lt;br/&gt;
