A scientific conference, Progress and Problems in Dynamics, will be held from
Monday, May 14 until Wednesday May 16, 2012 at the Medical Center Hilton,
Houston. The website for the conference is http://www.math.uh.edu/dynamics2012/
. The aim of the workshop is to bring together experts in the areas of
probabilistic dynamics, network dynamics and hybrid dynamical systems so as to
allow an exchange of techniques and insights as well as to foster collaboration
on tackling some of the most significant and topical problems in these active
research areas. So as to stimulate interaction, there will be broad expository
talks in the morning and more focused seminars in the afternoon, with ample time
set aside for detailed discussions and the initiation of research collaboration.
Participants include researchers in the modern statistical theory of dynamical
systems complemented by researchers in specific areas of dynamics and
applications, in particular: heteroclinic phenomena; adaptive networks;
spatially extended systems; mixed discrete and continuous dynamical systems.

The results of research in dynamical systems have many applications of important
economic and strategic significance ranging from biological networks and
neuroscience to control theory and engineering. A priority of the workshop is to
support and introduce postdoctoral fellows, early career researchers and
graduate students to this very active and important area of contemporary
mathematical research. Attracting young talent into this field will promote
successful research careers as well as contribute to the solution of the
problems posed in the workshop.
