This proposal deals with research activities that will lead to the detection of
ultra-high energy cosmic rays to study their origin and identity. The PI's
proposal will enable him to cover the following responsibilities: 1. Management,
integration, and quality assurance of surface detector elements. 2.
Implementation of detector trigger and calibration schemes and refine software
for event reconstruction. Funding is recommended at a slightly reduced level, a
level that will enable the PI to fulfill his commitment at the rate AUGER is
progressing.
