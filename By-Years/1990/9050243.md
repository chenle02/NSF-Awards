First Light is a one-hour documentary to be shown nationally on WGBH-TV's NOVA
science series. It tells the extraordinary story behind the building of the Hale
Telescope on Palomar Mountain in southern California. The film also documents a
research effort at the frontiers of astronomy that has pushed the Hale beyond
anything its builders had imagined: The attempt to find and map the edge of the
known universe. It follows astronomers Maarten Schmidt, James Gunn and Don
Schneider as they search for distant quasars. This team recently detected a
quasar that is by far the most distant object yet found in the universe; its
discovery may challenge our current understanding of cosmic evolution. The
documentary is based on the award winning book First Light: The Search for the
Edge of the Universe by Richard Preston. After broadcast, the program will have
wide educational distribution in secondary schools and colleges.
