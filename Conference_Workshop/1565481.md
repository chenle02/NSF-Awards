The purpose of this award is to support participation by students and early
career researchers, including members of under-represented groups, in the
mathematical and physical sciences at the 14th Experimental Chaos and Complexity
Conference (ECC 2016) to be held May 16-19, 2016 in Alberta, Canada. ECC 2016
will bring together an international group of researchers to improve the
scientific understanding of complex systems such as the cardiac electrical
system, the brain, energy and the power grid, social systems, earthquakes, and
climate. The objective of ECC 2016 is to encourage and facilitate the
collaboration of experimental and applied research in mathematics, physics,
engineering, neuroscience, chemistry, and biology.

ECC 2016 highlights new results in the study of complex systems at a variety of
scales. The goal is to bring together experimentalists and applied researchers
to study various aspects of of nonlinear dynamics, chaos, and complexity.
Examples of applications where this type of collaboration has been successful
include the cardiac electrical system, the brain, energy and the power grid,
social systems, earthquakes, and climate. These systems can display chaotic
dynamics, in that small changes in inputs or features of the system can cause
large changes in behavior. The study of complexity and chaos by mathematicians,
physicists, engineers, chemists, biologists, and neuroscientists has led to the
ability to understand and control chaotic systems in areas ranging from control
of cardiac chaos to improved efficiency in combustion systems. The award gives
students and early career researchers, including members of under-represented
groups, the opportunity to attend and participate in this conference, with the
hope that it inspires new research directions and collaborations for this group.
