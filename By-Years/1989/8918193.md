This field program will examine the dynamics of the Columbia River plume,
characterized by high transport of freshwater onto a relatively simple
continental shelf and strong tidal forcing. An extensive array of
instrumentation consisting of profiling and point current meters, thermistor
chains, conductivity/temperature sensors, and wind recorders will be moored for
about six months through the winter. These will be augmented by three cruises
and the release of telemetering Lagrangian drifters.
