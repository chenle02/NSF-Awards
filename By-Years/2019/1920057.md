This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry
Instrumentation Programs. Professor Banglin Chen from the University of Texas
San Antonio and colleagues Michael Doyle and Zachary Tonzetich are acquiring a
single crystal X-ray diffractometer equipped with a dual source of molybdenum
and copper. In general, an X-ray diffractometer (XRD) allows accurate and
precise measurements of the full three-dimensional structure of a molecule,
including bond distances and angles. A diffractometer also provides accurate
information about the spatial arrangement of a molecule relative to neighboring
molecules. The studies described here impact many areas, including organic and
inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument is an
integral part of teaching as well as research and research training of
undergraduate and graduate students in chemistry and biochemistry at this
institution. The facility serves as a regional XRD resource benefitting students
and faculty at Trinity University, St. Mary's University, and Incarnate Word
University in San Antonio, as well as Texas Lutheran University, Texas A&amp;M
University-Kingsville, University of Texas at Rio Grande Valley, and Sul Ross
State University in the greater South Texas region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
award of this diffractometer is aimed at enhancing research and education at all
levels. It is especially useful for the characterization of synthetic crystal
frameworks and during photophysical investigations of platinum(II) and
iridium(III)-carbene complexes. The instrument also serves researchers
developing and understanding homogeneous catalyst systems based on earth-
abundant transition metals, and understanding the coordination geometries and
chemical reactivities of model complexes of
metalloproteins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
