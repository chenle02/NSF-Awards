&lt;br/&gt; There is considerable literature in the area of human judgment
and&lt;br/&gt;decision making demonstrating systematic use of simplifying
heuristics and&lt;br/&gt;the biases that can arise from them. For example,
"framing effects" are&lt;br/&gt;common in which people react to the manner in
which information is labelled&lt;br/&gt;by assigning more favorable evaluations
to, say, a medical treatment that&lt;br/&gt;is described as having a "75%
success rate" as opposed to a "25% failure&lt;br/&gt;rate". However, research by
the Principal Investigator and others has&lt;br/&gt;uncovered considerable
variation in the extent to which different&lt;br/&gt;individuals display such
biases. Most recently, this research, which has&lt;br/&gt;been done almost
exclusively with adults, has linked these individual&lt;br/&gt;differences to
stable personality traits and decision styles. This&lt;br/&gt;naturally brings
up the dual questions of when such biases develop and&lt;br/&gt;whether they can
be linked to distinctive childhood dispositions. The&lt;br/&gt;present series of
studies is proposed to address these questions.&lt;br/&gt; A major resource for
these studies is an available population of 5-6&lt;br/&gt;year-olds whose social
and emotional development and cognitive capacity&lt;br/&gt;have been tracked
since they were toddlers. Thus, we have the capability of&lt;br/&gt;relating
children's decision making behavior to measures such as
shyness,&lt;br/&gt;impulsivity, and intelligence. In an initial study we showed
that these&lt;br/&gt;traits are related to risk-taking in a gambling-type game.
We are in the&lt;br/&gt;process of developing a battery of tasks/games which are
"child-friendly"&lt;br/&gt;yet capture the essence of the decision processes
observed in adults. An&lt;br/&gt;innovation of the new studies is that the
parent as well as the child will&lt;br/&gt;complete the tasks so that we can
correlate the two sets of responses to&lt;br/&gt;learn more about the
development of decision biases. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
