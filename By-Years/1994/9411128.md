The composition of seed oils varies widely between taxa and could either be the
result of relaxation from selection or selection for or against certain
compositions given the particular circumstances of the seeds of a species.
Preliminary analyses show clearly that there is a latitudinal shift in the
proportion of saturated vs. unsaturated fat in seeds; on average, tropical
species have 2 to more than 4 times the saturated vs. unsaturated fat content of
temperate species. The work proposed here seeks to determine whether the
adaptive significance of this difference lies in selection for lower oil
solidification temperatures in cool germinating temperate species. Both
phylogenetic and experimental methods are employed to strengthen the
investigation. Two groups of plants are employed: the Viguiera complex
(Asteraceae) and the tribe Cyclantherae (Cucurbitaceae). For selected species in
each, oil solidification temperature and composition are determined and then
mapped on phylogenies to determine the pattern of evolution of these traits. The
phylogeny of the Viguiera complex is known, and that of the Cyclantherae will be
determined from DNA sequence data. Experiments will be conducted to determine
the degree of plasticity of oil solidification temperature in response to
growing temperature. Finally, the performance of seeds germinating at different
temperatures will be assessed and checked to see if it is in accordance with the
hypothesis.
