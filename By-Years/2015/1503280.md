The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the
learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM)
by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative
resources, models and tools (RMTs). Projects in the DRK-12 program build on
fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development
efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed
projects. This project will develop and test a biology teacher professional
model that employs analysis of videotaped lessons to promote increased biology
content knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge among practicing biology
teachers. The content of the professional development activities will focus on
the crosscutting concepts of stability and change that link core ideas in three
areas of biology: cell biology, heredity, and evolution. These are content areas
that have been shown to be difficult for students to learn, and difficult for
teachers to teach. The professional development model will include: a) a summer
institute where teachers gain new knowledge and skills in biology and learn to
analyze videotaped lessons; b) opportunities to teach project-developed lessons
during the academic year; and c) study group sessions during the academic year
where participating teachers analyze videoclips of their own
teaching.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will design, develop, and test a
teacher professional development model that is based on a previously developed
approach that has been shown to be effective among elementary school teachers.
It is hypothesized that the newly developed program will have a positive impact
on the science achievement of high school students, that it will improve teacher
science content knowledge and classroom practice, and that the effects on
student outcomes will be equitable across student demographic variables. To test
thee hypotheses, the project will employ a quasi-experimental research approach
in which teachers will serve as their own comparison groups in a cohort control
design. Hierarchical linear modeling will be used to differentiate the effects
of variances in teacher content knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge,
student demographic variables, and school factors. It is anticipated that the
project will find evidence that the proposed approach to biology teacher
professional development has the potential to close the achievement gaps among
student populations.
