The objective of this project is to conduct an experimental and theoretical
investigation into the behavior and design of concrete beams reinforced with
three-dimensional (3-D) prefabricated fiber reinforced plastic spatial
reinforcement cages. 3-D spatial reinforcement cages, most conveniently
fabricated from pultruded grating components, will require innovative research
in the areas of manufacturing, design, modeling, analysis and construction
economics. Based on results of a recently conducted pilot study it appears that
3-D FRP reinforced beams have significant structural potential due to their
ability to fail progressively in a pseudo-ductile manner. They also appear to
have significant construction potential due to their prefabricated
industrialized manufacturing that could yield construction cost saving because
of reduced labor costs. The research will focus on the following items:
Development of new integrated 3-D FRP pultruded reinforcement cages,
characterization of mechanical properties of 3-D pultruded reinforcement cages,
optimization of elements for 3-D reinforcement cages, design and analysis of
concrete beams reinforced with 3-D FRP cages, and a study of the construction
productivity and economic benefits of the use of 3-D FRP cages.
