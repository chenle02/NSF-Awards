Surfactant-stabilized emulsion liquid membrane process constitute a potentially
important emerging separation technology for separating many toxic substances
down to very low levels. In this project, a new idea is studied, namely the use
of non-Newtonian hydrocarbon membranes. Such membranes are designed to have a
dilute solution of a nonionic polymer in a low-viscosity hydrocarbon. This
polymer induces high viscosity without decreasing the diffusivity of substances
through the solution. If successfully, such membranes could lead to commercial
separation processes involving liquid membranes, since less stabilizing
surfactant will be needed. A detailed experimental plan is implemented to
examine the effects of polymer concentration, surfactant concentration, stirrer
speed, aqueous oil rate, and other important parameters. Separations of phenolic
compounds and various metal ions are mainly studied.
