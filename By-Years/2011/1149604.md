Orlando Acevedo of Auburn University is supported by the Chemical Structure,
Dynamics, and Mechanisms program and the NSF EPSCoR office for research to
develop a comprehensive set of force field parameters for the simulation of
hundreds of widely used ionic liquid combinations and next-generation
alternatives with superior biodegradation and lower toxicity. Ionic liquids are
a unique class of solvent, generally defined as a material containing only ionic
species with a melting point below 100 deg. C. Mixed quantum and molecular
mechanics (QM/MM) Monte Carlo calculations featuring the custom force field and
free-energy perturbation theory are used to elucidate how ionic liquids operate
to enhance rates and/or shift mechanisms for three reaction categories: aromatic
nucleophilic substitutions (SNAr), base-induced beta-eliminations, and keto-enol
tautomerizations. The research objective is to establish a firm understanding of
the intermolecular interactions occurring between ionic liquids and important
chemical reaction classes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With over 100 million pounds of
chemical waste treated yearly, a better understanding of how to optimize
recyclable ionic liquids for chemical reactions has the potential to impact
society from the lab bench top to large-scale industrial manufacturing. In
addition, this project expands the number of ionic liquid force field parameters
available for simulation. The new parameters and equilibrated systems will be
made freely available to the scientific community through a website. This
proposal introduces computational chemistry to high school and undergraduate
students through a hands-on "Instant Supercomputer!Â¨ workshop featuring the
construction of a temporary supercomputer. The project will expose students to
cutting edge research and will present an opportunity to do "public science" to
solve a research problem with a real time audience, rather than disseminating
prior results.
