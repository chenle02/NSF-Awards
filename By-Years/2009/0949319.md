This grant supports upgrade of the student research computational facilities at
the Center for Earthquake Research and Information (CERI) at the University of
Memphis. Specific equipment to be acquired includes: 1) an Apple dual quadcore
Xserver with 12GB of RAM and 4TB of RAID5 disk storage; 2) 10 Apple MacPro
workstations; 3) a 14 Tb file server; and 4) 4 Apple iMacs. CERI has an existing
a Sun/Solaris network interconnected with UNIX Network Information Service (NIS)
and Network File System (NFS) protocols, a PC/XP network interconnected with
Microsoft Active Directory (AD) network services, and an Apple/OSX network that
are not formally interconnected. The new Apple hardware and software will allow
fully connectivity between the MacOSX and Solaris networks using standard UNIX
tools including NIS and NFS. The student computing facilities upgrade will
homogenize compute resources at CERI with faculty computational resources thus
simplifying systems administration. The equipment will support student and PI
research that relies on seismological and GPS geodetic observations for studies
of crustal structure and lithospheric dynamics. Currently NSF-supported studies
ranging from the U.S. mid-continent to Antarctica are poised to advance
understanding of crustal structure in sparsely surveyed areas of the globe (vis.
Antarctica), understanding of the effects of cryosphere and hydrological loading
on the Patagonian crust and by inference crustal and upper mantle rheology, and
improve our appreciation of seismic hazards and related mitigation strategies in
the Mississippi River Valley. The computational equipment will be supported by
two existing full time systems administrators. The equipment will support the
research and research training objectives of two early career female
geoscientists.
