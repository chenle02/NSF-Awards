This project will support the improvement and computerization of the mycological
holdings in the Charles Peck collection at the New York State Mycological
Herbarium, and is aimed at ensuring preservation of and greater accessibility to
the collection for research and teaching. This project is an outgrowth of
recommendations made by an advisory panel that examined and evaluated the
collections in 1991. A complementary project funded by NEH would support the
preservation and indexing of the archival materials associated with the
collection. Specific tasks of the NSF-supported project include the preparation
of a database and catalogue of the type specimens with cross-references to
archival correspondence and water color illustrations; the latter have never
been loaned or published, and slides of these watercolors will be prepared for
dissemination to the mycological research community. Curatorial improvements
involve new housing materials and the preservation of specimen labels. The
collection of 84,000 fungi is completely documented, contains about 3500 types
and 2734 holotypes, and because of Peck's dominant role in American mycology, is
of international import and central to mycological taxonomy. The improvements
allowed by this award will enhance the value and use of this collection in
biological research and teaching.
