The goal of this research is to understand how the seed controls pericarp (pod)
elongation in the pea Pisium sativum, where it is known that the seed is a rich
source of giberellins which have positive effects on pod elongation. This study
aims to confirm that pericarp growth is dependent upon giberellin biosynthesis
in situ, to determine whether seeds, or application of another hormone, auxin,
regulate in vivo pericarp giberellin-19 oxidase activity and relate the level of
enzyme activity to pericarp growth, to investigate the mechanism of action of
seed and auxin stimulation to giberellin biosynthesis, and to identify the seed
factor which promotes pericarp growth and giberellin biosynthesis in the
pericarp. Experimental approaches to these studies will involve use of
radiolabelled giberellin precursors and intermediates and metabolite
purification by HPLC and analysis by GC-MS.
