This award provides partial support to the University of Kansas experimental
particle physics group (KU) to continue studies with the Compact Muon Solenoid
(CMS) detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN in Geneva,
Switzerland, the D0 experiment at Fermilab's Tevatron, data analysis from the
CLEO experiment, efforts on international linear collider (ILC) detectors, using
radio detection techniques for high-energy cosmic rays, and performing public
outreach. The range of studies by KU form the basis for the high intellectual
merit of the program since these studies have the potential to provide a greater
understanding of matter and energy at the smallest distance scales and so
address some of the most fundamental questions in science. The broader impacts
of this proposed activity are also considerable. Graduate students and postdocs
will receive extensive training. The group also has a strong record of success
in undergraduate research and will continue such involvement. The Quarked!
Project, started by Professor Alice Bean in 2004, as well as the QuarkNet
program provide an important outreach focus as will the continuation of the
program to disseminate research findings via the Internet with web sites aimed
at different communities.
