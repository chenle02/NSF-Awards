Studies will be undertaken to characterize the fundamental interactions of
mammalian cells with families of chemically homogenous polymers with the aim of
developing bioresorbable polymers for organ and tissue regeneration.
Physicochemical properties of the polymers will be systematically varied and
correlated with the cell response (adhesion, growth, morphology, and gene
expression) of cells in contact with the polymers.
