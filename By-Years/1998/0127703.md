This action funds the National Academy of Sciences to appoint an eight-member
committee to study the responsibilities of authors of scientific papers in the
life sciences to share data and materials referenced in their publications. A
workshop as well as meetings will be used to obtain input from the scientific
community in assessing requirements imposed by journals on authors, common
practices in the community, and accepted standards for sharing, if such exists.
A report will be issued.
