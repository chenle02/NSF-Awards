9417006 Murphy This project is on research to characterize and model the
response of tumor cells to targeted toxins, and to develop design strategies for
improving the efficacy of targeted toxins. This research has two objectives: (1)
the cellular processing kinetics of several combinations of target, targeting
agent, and cell lines are to be experimentally determined and used to develop
mathematical models, which are to relate cellular trafficking of the target
agent to protein synthesis inhibition, and describe the time these molecules
spend inside the cell; and (2) the feasibility will be explored of improving the
efficacy of targeted toxins by chemical modifications of the targeting agent in
order to increase the time the targeting agent is to reside in the Golgi
apparatus. This research could contribute to rational drug design while
generating new knowledge on immunotoxins. ***
