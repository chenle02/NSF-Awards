Bacteria guard against viral infection by acquiring immunity to bacteriophage
and plasmids. This research focuses on elucidating three critical aspects of
this bacterial immune system: 1) how viral DNA sequences are incorporated into
the host genome; 2) how these genomic inserts are used to produce small anti-
sense RNAs; and 3) how foreign genetic elements are selectively silenced or
destroyed. The longer-term goal of the project is to use these insights to
engineer acquired immunity for selective microbial gene knockdown. This project
has the potential to transform the way we understand gene regulation in
bacteria, and to reveal the molecular basis for a previously unknown and
unanticipated mechanism of anti-viral defense. &lt;br/&gt;The Doudna laboratory
has a successful history of training students at all levels in the creative
dissection of molecular mechanisms involving RNA and RNA-protein complexes using
a variety of experimental methods. The project is being conducted in a highly
collaborative environment at UC Berkeley, which has become a de facto center for
CRISPR research encompassing ongoing work in the laboratories of Jill Banfield,
Phil Hugenholtz and Adam Arkin. Quarterly joint group meetings with the Banfield
lab are attended and given by all students working on CRISPR-related projects as
a means of receiving outside input. An annual CRISPR conference at UC Berkeley
attracts scientists from around the world to share their latest results.
Students attend and present their work at this meeting, providing an outstanding
opportunity for learning and discussing new results.&lt;br/&gt;
