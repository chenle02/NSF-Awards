As bacteria grow, a single bacterial cell reproduces itself to create two
daughter cells. In this process, the parent cell copies all of its cell parts
and then distributes them to both daughter cells. Often, the daughter cells are
identical copies of the parent cell, but interestingly, some bacteria create two
daughter cells that are different. This project aims to develop a detailed
understanding of how bacteria reproduce themselves in a manner that is both
highly organized and accurate. In addition, this project aims to understand how
the process of bacterial reproduction can lead to different types of daughter
cells, as well as how the process responds to changes in the environment. For
this reason, the investigator studies model bacteria that create different types
of daughter cells depending on whether the bacteria are living in the soil or
have infected the roots of a plant host. The investigator will use molecular and
genetic approaches to create a variety of tools that are required to study
bacterial reproduction. These tools will be analyzed through a combination of
biochemistry and microscopy. Importantly, this project has a rich component of
undergraduate involvement and significant participation by underrepresented
minorities. Although the model bacteria used for this project is beneficial to
the plant it infects, the new insights into bacterial reproduction that will be
gained in this project can be applied towards understanding how other types of
harmful bacteria infect plants and animals. One important application will
therefore be the development of novel cell targets for antibacterial
therapeutics at a time when bacterial resistance to antibiotics is a serious
global health issue.
