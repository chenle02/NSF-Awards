Abstract

Award: DMS-0071862 Principal Investigator: Sumio Yamada

The two main subjects of the proposed research are Teichmueller spaces of
compact Riemann surfaces of genus greater than one and the universal
Teichmueller space, which can be identified with the diffeomorphism group of the
circle. There is a natural Riemannian metric on both classical and universal
Teichmueller spaces, called the Weil-Petersson metric. Although those spaces are
not symmetric spaces, and there are no classical Lie groups acting on them
isometrically (unlike the hyperbolic spaces with the special linear group), one
notes that on the classical Teichmueller spaces the mapping class group of the
Riemann surfaces acts isometrically, and that on the universal Teichmueller
space the diffeomorphism group of the circle acts isometrically. These group
actions on Teichmueller spaces can be utilized to construct flat bundles over
various manifolds with its fibers being copies of Teichmueller spaces, which
leads to the questions of strong/super rigidity. It is in this context that the
investigator intends to use the Weil-Petersson geometry of Teichmueller spaces.

The subject of Riemann surfaces has been one of the central themes of modern
mathematics over the last two centuries. In recent years, it has received
renewed attention due to the interest created by the so-called super-string
theory, with which physicists hope to construct the grand unifying theory (GMT)
of graviation and quantum physics. The Teichmueller space, which is the subject
of this investigation, plays an important role since it is known to parametrizes
the "shapes of the string." Interactions between mathematics and theoretical
physics have proved to be fruitful for both sides, and it is the investigator's
belief that the proposed research may offer some new way of understanding the
outstanding issues in the relevant scientific fields.
