The proposal of Chuu-Lian Terng contains three projects. The first project is
joint with Karen Uhlenbeck (University of Texas at Austin). Terng and Uhlenbeck
have collaborated for the past several years to give geometric interpretations
and applications of analytic and algebraic constructions in integrable systems.
They propose to continue their investigation of geometric aspects of integrable
systems, Virasoro actions and topological conformal field theory. The second
project is on submanifolds in symmetric spaces whose Gauss-Codazzi equations are
integrable systems. Terng has made several contributions to this area when
submanifolds lie in a space form, and she plans to continue the research for the
symmetric space case. The third project is joint with Gudlaugur Thorbergsson
(University of Koln). Terng and Thorbergsson have made contributions to the
theory of isoparametric submanifolds in space forms and equifocal submanifolds
in symmetric spaces. In this project, they propose to study the geometry of
submanifolds in complex and quaternionic n-space whose U(n) and Sp(n)-invariants
are constant in various senses. The success of this project should give better
understanding of submanifold geometry in Hermitian and quaternionic Kahler
symmetric spaces.

The theory of integrable systems has deep relations with mechanics and
dynamics, applied mathematics, algebra, theoretical physics, partial
differential equations, algebraic geometry, and differential geometry. It has
also been used in other sciences. For example, (1) the sine-Gordon equation,
which is the Gauss-Codazzi equation for constant negative Gaussian curvature
surfaces in 3-space, also arises in plasma physics; (2) the non-linear
Schrodinger equation models the propergation of wave envelope in optic fiber.
Success of the proposed projects will give better understanding of the structure
of integrable systems and their geometrizations.
