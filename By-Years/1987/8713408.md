Dr. Pudup will reconstruct and compare manufacturing investment patterns in
North Carolina and Tennessee for the period 1900 to 1985 with the goal of
demonstrating the formative and enduring role of locally-sponsored industrial
location strategies. The research will rely on state-level industrial
development records that have not heretofore been exploited. Existing work in
regional analysis and industrial geography focuses on labor markets as the
primary source of regional economic differentiation. Such research tells us more
about industrial dynamics than it does about regional dynamics. This project
will highlight the role of regional industrial culture in long-term development
processes and will have important theoretical, policy, and planning
implications.
