The problem of better forecasting of the intensity of hurricanes has been
identified by the U.S. Weather Research Program as a high priority research
area. As hurricanes approach landfall, the horizontal distribution of intense
winds in hurricanes often becomes highly asymmetrical, as does the intense
convection in the eyewall and rainbands. Intense mesoscale vortices, as small as
a few kilometers in scale, are believed to produce major damage in intense
landfalling hurricanes.

This project aims to analyze the physical mechanisms associated with interaction
of a tropical cyclone with environmental vertical wind shear using a full-
physics, high resolution advanced numerical modeling system. Previous studies
have shown that persistent and predictable convective asymmetries develop in
response to imposed environmental vertical wind shear. By better understanding
the processes that produce asymmetries in tropical cyclone convection, and by
understanding how those asymmetries feed back on the tropical cyclone intensity
and structure, improved prediction of these events should be possible. Of
particular interest is the development of asymmetries in the hurricane core
convection during interaction with vertical wind shear caused by transient
circulations. As the vertical wind shear is imposed on the hurricane core,
asymmetries should develop that are well predicted by the constant-shear
studies. However, as the wind shear recedes, the time-evolution of the core
structural changes in the hurricane will be studied, particularly as they feed
back on changes in the storm intensity.

This study seeks to achieve knowledge of these processes through examination of
a series of initial-value and time varying, full-physics simulations utilizing a
very fine mesh and explicit moist physics. The results will be synthesized to
establish a series of cause and effect relationships governing core intensity
changes, and these relationships will be tested by examining real-data cases.

Successful completion of this research potentially will lead to improvements in
the forecasting of landfalling hurricanes.
