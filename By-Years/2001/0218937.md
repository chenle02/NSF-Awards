This proposal is to support work on developing an interactive Grid-enabled
analysis environment for physicists working on the high energy physics CMS
experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, Switzerland. The
environment will be lightweight yet highly functional and will make use of
existing CMS tools as plug-in components. It will consist of tools and utilities
that expose Grid system functions, parameters and behavior at selectable levels
of detail and complexity. Use will be made of Web services and it is expected
that many of the components will be sufficiently generic to be useful for other
experiments and scientific endeavors utilizing Grid computing technology.
&lt;br/&gt;The effort is closely related to work ongoing in the GriPhyN, iVDGL,
PPDG and SciDAC projects. &lt;br/&gt;
