9308059 Benning This applicant will be acquiring a time series of Airborne
Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) data along with the field data
necessary to develop spectral models of ecosystem function in grasslands and
semiarid regions. The spectral models will provide principal input drivers for a
high resolution model for grasslands and semiarid ecosystems worldwide. In the
process of working with the spectral data sets, the applicant will be developing
image analysis "unmixing" techniques and examining the scaling properties of
ecosystem processes. This work will be conducted in the laboratory of Dr. Carol
A. Wessman at the University of Colorado at Boulder, Center for the Study of
Earth from Space. N ADVLTR 821 / @ FLATRATE825 L / ' FLATRATE824 dt / ( COVLET
