This research will develop a theoretical framework for understanding and
interpreting two new types of biological data. The first concerns genetic
hitchhiking. Genetic hitchhiking refers to the effect of a selected gene upon
other genes on the same chromosome which are not themselves under selection. An
extensive theoretical study of the dynamical behavior of such systems will help
resolve current practical problems ranging from deducing the historical origins
of selected genes to explaining the frequent lack of correlation between the
physical distance separating two DNA variants, and their observed nonrandom
association. This investigation is also applicable to the many heritable
variants in DNA sequences which are currently being found near disease genes in
humans, such as those responsible for Huntington's chorea and cystic fibrosis,
as well as near important genes in natural populations of Drosophila. The other
line of research will provide a theoretical foundation for interpreting and
exploiting current data involving two components of an organism's genetic
material: one transmitted through both parents (nuclear DNA), the other
uniparentally inherited (e.g., mitochondrial and chloroplast DNA). The
significant nonrandom associations found between these two classes of genetic
material can, because of the contrasting modes of inheritance, provide a
qualitatively new kind of information about the evolutionary history of human,
animal, and plant populations. In order to take advantage of this unique
information, an extensive theoretical study will determine what associations are
possible between these two genetic components, and what force or combination of
forces would account for the observed associations in natural populations.
Formal statistical procedures will be concurrently developed to allow the
testing of various evolutionary hypotheses and the estimation of important
biological parameters such as the migration rate between two populations.
