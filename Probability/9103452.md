This award will support a graduate student to work with the senior investigator
in the area of probability theory called probability metrics. The theory of
probability metrics deals with the study of distances in the space of
probability measures and random elements, interrelations between metrics of
different types, the choice of an appropriate metric for a given stochastic
approximation problem, the characterization of induced convergences and
uniformities, and applications to limit theorems and stability of stochastic
models. The aim of the investigator's work is to study and develop the theory of
probability metrics in a systematic fashion. The theory of probability metrics
seems to have quite a large area of applications: limit theorems for sum and
maxima of random elements, characterization of distributions, queueing theory,
risk theory, survival analysis, mass transportation, infinite dimensional
network flow problems, and stability of stochastic models.
