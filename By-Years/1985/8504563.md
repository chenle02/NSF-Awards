Thin films of the ceramic superconductor Ba(Pb1-xBix)O3 are of considerable
interest both for their unusual superconducting and electronic properties, and
for their potential uses in superconducting electronic devices. While high
quality single crystals of this material can be produced by ceramic processing
techniques, it has proven more difficult to make high quality films. Thin film
samples are currently being made (in Japan) by RF sputtering from a single
composite target. In this project, an ultrahigh vacuum multiple-target sputter
deposition system is being used to fabricate thin films with much tighter
control over the deposition process. By studying the interrelation between the
deposition parameters and the resulting film characteristics, it should be
possible to synthesize thin films with properties nearly identical to the best
single crystal samples. Such high quality films can then be used to study the
origins of the unusually high superconducting critical temperature (Tc = 13K) in
this low carrier density (n 1021/cm3) material. In addition, the potential uses
of this material in superconducting electronics, and especially as a microwave
detector, are being investigated.
