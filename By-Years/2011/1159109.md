This award to the American Anthropological Association will provide support for
a workshop on creating a national registry for extant and future cultural
anthropological databases. The workshop will focus on archive selection; best
practices for data and meta data formatting; eliciting researcher participation;
and providing for on-going technical and financial support. The overarching goal
is to create a central site where researchers can go to locate sources of visual
field recordings, digital data sets, websites, and archival collections of
fieldnotes, photographs, coding sheets, and other materials. The workshop will
bring together archivists, anthropologists, representatives of key
anthropological institutions, and technical specialists. The resulting report
will be widely disseminated through multiple publication venues to encourage a
wider discussion and support from anthropological researchers.
