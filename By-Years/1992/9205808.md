This proposal is intended to initiate a research program to study cell
signalling during Drosophila development. The wealth of genetic information and
the ease of molecular manipulation in Drosophila make it an ideal system for the
dissection of processes involving many components, such as signal transduction
pathways. Here Dr. Wharton proposes to elucidate the function of the newly
identified TGF-beta like gene, 60A, through genetical and developmental
analyses. Mutations in the gene will be generated in an F2 lethal screen and a
male sterile screen. The developmental consequences of these mutants will be
determined by direct observation of their development, cuticular preparations,
histology and in situ hybridizations. Potential genetic interactions involving
60A, and other genes which code for putative components of a TGF-beta signal
transduction pathway, such as, a second Drosophila TGF-beta like gene, dpp, will
be examined. The results of these experiments will allow us to better understand
the roles of TGF-beta like proteins in communication between cells during
development.
