This award will provide 31% of the funds required to acquire a computer network
system for the geophysics group in the Department of Geological Sciences at the
University of South Carolina. The University is committed to providing the
remaining 69% as matching funds for this acquisition. The computer network will
consist of a central server with large disk capacity, 9-track tape drive,
several workstations, and a printer/plotter. It will be the primary research
tool for the geophysics faculty and their students in the area of quantitative
seismology, seismotectonics, geodesy, and geodynamics.
