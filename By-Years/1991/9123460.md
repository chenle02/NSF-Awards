Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI) has been concerned with the design of
automated agents which can interact effectively in order to satisfy their goals.
This project will contribute to both the theory and design of efficient
autonomous agents which are able to communicate and negotiate in such a way as
to enhance the possibility of reaching mutually beneficial agreements. The
authors are developing a strategic model of negotiation that takes the passage
of time during the negotiation process itself into consideration. This model is
used in the creation of a prototype of an autonomous agent that participates in
situations where negotiations are required, and where time constraints exist. A
preliminary model has been constructed, based on the differentialimpact of time
on the parties, the effects of two-partyand restricted N-party environments, an
full information. The researchers are extending the model to deal with
situations where the information available to the agents is incomplete, to more
complicated N-party situations, and to agents with limited rationality. Parallel
to these theoretical extensions, the design of the automated negotiator is being
developed and a prototype created. The strategic model is used to identify
efficient strategies for the automated negotiator, for various
negotiationsituations. A library of meta-strategies in which the strategies will
be presented using the finite-automata framework is being built. The automated
negotiator identifies the appropriate parameters of its situation, searches for
the appropriate strategy, and negotiates according to that strategy. //
