9600017 Macek A number of projects involving the correlated motion of three
particles of arbitrary mass and charge will be undertaken. The mode of attack is
based on a recently developed integral expression which has been evaluated using
complex variable theory. Emphasis is on the confrontation of theory and
experiment to test the physical pictures of correlated motion which have arisen
in diverse fields such as ion-atom interactions, electron impact and photon
processes. ***
