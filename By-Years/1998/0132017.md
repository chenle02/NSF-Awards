This award from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program
of the Chemistry Division supports Dr. Klaus Theopold, Chemistry Department,
University of Delaware, for research into the reaction chemistry of paramagnetic
organometallic chromium and vanadium compounds. First, the synthesis of
paramagnetic alkyls of chromium and vanadium coordinated by various nacnac-
ligands will be developed. Important goals of this effort are the synthesis and
structural characterization of single molecule catalysts for olefin
polymerization. Secondly, high oxidation state chromium chemistry will be
developed. This will include an exploration of oxo alkyls both with and without
Cp-ligands, and the preparation of catalysts for O2-driven oxidation. Finally,
new ligands, including bidentate carbenes, will be utilized to support
paramagnetic organometallics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is fundamental
in nature but will have practical impact on commercial catalyst development. The
work will examine how oxygen atom transfers to and hydrogen is abstracted from
hydrocarbons takes place with presently employed hexavalent chromium catalysts.
Additionally, alternative catalysts that are more environmentally benign than
those now used will be developed. Undergraduate and graduate students will
experience a varied research culture and will gain a strong background in
synthetic chemistry which is in high demand in chemical and pharmaceutical
companies.&lt;br/&gt;
