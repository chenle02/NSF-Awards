9453091 Lewis The goal of this project is to help children understand phenomena
in science by allowing them and the adults with whom they work to create and
manipulate animated pictorial models. The project combines intensive study of
modelling and its impact in an elementary school setting with the development of
advanced computing technology, the pictorial rewrite system, that make model
creation dramatically easier than it is today. The technology will support
interactive classroom discussion, in which models can be created, manipulated,
and compared in response to student questions and suggestions. It will and also
support project work by individual students or teams working on topics of their
own selection. ***
