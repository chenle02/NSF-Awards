Building on classroom materials developed for the National Weather Service
(NWS), the COMET Program will create an innovative pilot module of interactive,
laboratory investigations for undergraduate introductory atmospheric science
courses. This pilot module entitled: "Weather Satellites: Types, Imagery and
Applications", is developed in collaboration with educators experienced in
curriculum, course, and materials development. It engages non-science majors in
active and visual representations, replacing existing, static laboratory
materials with four-dimensional illustrations of atmospheric sciences concepts
and weather phenomena. The project provides interactive data collecting
activities, and related field experiment guidelines. Additionally, it provides
imbedded K-12 classroom activities for the estimated (up to) 20% of introductory
course students who will go on to teach. Materials are developed in the context
of "best teaching practices" and science content standards published by the
National Research Council (1996). Project is the initial step toward the
creation of a series of comprehensive, contemporary laboratory activities for
introductory weather and climate courses.
