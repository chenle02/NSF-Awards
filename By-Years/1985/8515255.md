This work is part of a larger program, with the general title, "Molecular
Thermodynamics," which combines the methods of experiment, theory, and computer
simulation in a coordinated study of dense fluids. Experimental studies of
pressure-temperature-composition (PTX) phase diagrams are underway for a variety
of binary fluid mixtures that exhibit nonideal behavior, including gas-liquid,
liquid-liquid, and gas-gas phase equilibria. Emphasis is placed on mixtures
containing polar liquids (HC1, H;i2S, CH;i3OH, CH;i3C1, SO;i2, etc.) and on the
effect of molecular shape on phase equilibria. The principal purpose of these
experiments is to provide data of high accuracy, covering wide ranges of
temperature and pressure (70 to 500;soK and pressure to 4000 atm), for use in
testing and refining molecular theories of dense fluids. Among the molecules
studied are: HC1, HBr, CH;i3C1, (CH;i3);i2O, CO;i2, COS, BF;i3, c-C;i3H;i6,
NF;i3, NH;i3, C(CH;i3);i4, PF;i5, SF;i6.
