This project proposes to increase, within the NSF?fs broadening participation
initiative, the number and quality of SBIR/STTR proposals submitted to the NSF
by entrepreneurs from the Central Illinois Region, with a specific emphasis on
women scientists that tend to be underrepresented in many STEM fields (National
Science Foundation, 2013). This proposal also seeks to leverage regional
diversity knowledge, experience, efforts, and programs to attract a strong cadre
of participants and support their successful completion of the program. Members
of other underrepresented groups will be a secondary focus of our targeted
efforts, but no less important. The ultimate, long term goal is to foster
broad--?]based, sustainable economic development in the region. Currently, as
with most engineering and entrepreneurial programs, women--?]led teams comprise
a smaller than desired percentage of our participants. Through the programs
outlined in this proposal we plan on developing a model that can be used in
central Illinois and elsewhere to build a pipeline of future women entrepreneurs
and entrepreneurs from other underrepresented groups, training current
entrepreneurs, and supporting existing entrepreneurs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
proposed project will take a new approach to encourage the participation of
female entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs from other underrepresented groups. This
is done through taking a new approach of providing resources that encourage
those from underrepresented groups to participate in the available
entrepreneurial ecosystem and then surrounding them with support. Such resources
include making available an entrepreneur--?]in--?]residence familiar with the
needs of those from underrepresented groups and providing small
proof--?]of--?]concept grants to qualified teams. Once the teams are in the
system they will be supported through training and curriculum that introduces
teams to the skills to not only submit a high quality SBIR proposal, but also to
launch and execute a successful STEM--?]related new venture. The skills that
teams will be introduced to during the courses include: product development,
evaluating opportunities, and putting together a successful application.
