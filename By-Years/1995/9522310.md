A large but not exhaustive, collection of Henry Stommel's work will be published
as a three bound volume set. The works, from his seminal work on the explanation
of the Gulf Stream to more recent research on the thermohaline circulation, will
grouped by subject area with a brief introduction to each subject by a prominent
scientist who will describe the significant impact that Stommel's work had
within that area of research. This organization should be especially helpful to
students who can gain not only an appreciation for Stommel's influence, but also
see how science progresses by building on the work that has been done earlier.
