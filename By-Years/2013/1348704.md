The rapidly increasing volume of remote sensing data should, in principle, allow
accurate monitoring Earth surface changes and help gather objective information
about the impact of climate on landscape evolution. However, methods to exploit
these data are lagging behind. This project aims to address this challenge
through (1) development of a new method to co-register in three dimensions
optical images (from satellites and aircraft) with LiDAR (Light Detection And
Ranging) data; and (2) test proof-of-concept applications to monitor sand dune
dynamics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team proposes to develop new methods to
allow 3-D tracking of Earth surface changes due to geomorphic processes from
high-resolution optical images and LiDAR data. The methods will be implemented
as new tools in the COSI-corr software package. These techniques would provide
key observational data to study aeolian processes (sand transport and dune
dynamics in particular). The project includes application to at least one test
case to demonstrate the performance of the proposed methods.
