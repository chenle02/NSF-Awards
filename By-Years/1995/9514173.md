Evolutionary relationships among species of New World monkeys are poorly known.
Several different hypotheses of relationships have been generated with
morphological characters and nuclear DNA sequences. Three major groups o f New
World monkeys-callithrichids (tamarins and marmosets), pithecines (sakis and
uakaris), and atelines (spider, woolly, and woolly-spider monkeys), are well
supported in all of these studies. However, most of all other relationships show
weak support and differ across studies, suggesting that a fast sequence of
speciation events (or evolutionary radiation) occurred in some cases. Genes
located in the mitochondria (extranuclear cellular organelles) have a higher
rate of evolution on average than nuclear genes and chances are higher that more
mutations accumulate during rapid evolutionary radiations. Hence the potential
advantage of combining the existing data sets (morphological and nuclear) with
mitochondrial data. The major aim of this project is to clarify the
relationships among New World monkey genera. For this purpose, the researchers
intend to: 1) sequence a mitochondrial gene, the 12S ribosomal gene in all
genera of New World monkeys, to conduct a study of their evolutionary
relationships; 2) combine the 12S sequences with published nuclear,
morphological and preliminary mitochondrial data to generate a `total evidence`
evolutionary tree; 3) evaluate different methods to assign differential weights
to individual characters. The researchers will assume that a method that yields
the species of callithrichids, pithecines, and atelines, assorted in that way,
performs better than a method that does not, because these are well corroborated
relationships. The project is significance because: 1) it furthers knowledge
about the poorly known evolutionary relationships among New World monkeys; 2) it
provides a phylogenetic framework to test hypotheses of evolution in this group;
3) it provides a test of the performance of different weighting methods.
