Dr. W. Todd Wipke and other members of the Chemistry Department of University of
California at Santa Cruz are being supported for a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry. For the period 1993-5, eleven
undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in a
variety of research projects. Projects cover the traditional areas of chemistry-
inorganic, organic, physical and biochemistry. A unique feature of this program
is the focus on women, minority and handicapped students.
