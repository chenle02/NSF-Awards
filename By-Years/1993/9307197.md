9307197 Behringer A largely experimental investigation is to be carried out of
natural convection in porous media, complemented by numerical simulations. The
main thrust of the research is to further explore and exploit a novel non-
invasive diagnostic technique called the Modified Shadowgraph Technique (MST).
Specially arranged porous materials can be made to admit optical signals without
refractive attenuation. This technique can then visualize convective patterns.
Unexpected flow patterns in such media are to be further investigated, and the
utility of the technique for binary mixtures will be explored. Beyond further
developing this new tool for generating more and better insight into porous
media flow, the investigation is also relevant to the important phenomenon of
large scale flow pattern sensitivity to material microstructure. Application is
to variety of environmental and engineering systems. ***
