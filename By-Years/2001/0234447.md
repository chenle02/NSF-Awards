With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
(CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at The University of Southern
California will acquire a 400 MHz Fourier Transform NMR Spectrometer. This
equipment will enable researchers to carry out research on the following: 1)
activation and functionalization of alkanes; 2) development of new molecules and
polymers for optical and photonic applications; 3) bio-organic probes and bio-
active organophosphorus compounds; 4) selective functionalization of hydrocarbon
CH bonds catalyzed by homogeneous metal complexes; 5) new synthetic methods and
synthesis of bioactive molecules; and 6) studies of carbocations and related
chemistry. &lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most
powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of
molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific
arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of
interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR
spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research.
The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic organic
chemistry, biochemistry and materials chemistry. &lt;br/&gt;
