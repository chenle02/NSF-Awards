This project is engaged in an effort to pull together a diverse set of experts
to make research-based recommendations on how to implement massive professional
development that is needed to effectively employ the Common Core State Standards
(CCSS) in a way that will reform classroom instruction in mathematics for grades
K-12. Thirty-five states have adopted the CCSS in mathematics, and there is a
need to help teachers and the public learn about the standards and how to use
them to increase mathematics learning. The project is convening a meeting of
experts to recommend how to design, implement, and assess large-scale
professional development systems that have the potential to reform mathematics
instruction. A final report with recommendations and reactions from professional
organizations will be disseminated through the National Council of Teachers of
Mathematics.

The work of the project is assisted by the following organizations: Association
of Mathematics Teacher Educators, Mathematics Association of America, the
National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, National Council of Supervisors of
Mathematics, and the Association of State Supervisors of Mathematics.
