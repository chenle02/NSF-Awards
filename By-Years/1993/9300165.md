This award is for support of a 3 year project to establish an REU site at St
Olaf College to involve undergraduates in ice-radar and satellite remote-sensing
studies of glaciers and ice sheets. In addition to on-going work on radar data
obtained from field studies of ice streams in West Antarctica and glaciers in
Washington State, this project will use radar and satellite imagery information
to help improve models of ice stream flow. In addition to the laboratory work,
the students involved in this project will participate in field work on the
South Cascade Glacier, Washington. This work is in collaboration with
glaciologists at NASA-Goddard and the University of Chicago at no cost to this
grant.
