Professor Bloch will study relations between zeta functions and representations
of infinite dimensional Lie algebras and function groups. He will focus on
relations with values of zeta and L-series, quasi-modularity and related modular
properties extending known modular properties for characters in one variable and
relations with mirror symmetries. The investigator will also attempt to discover
a Riemann Roch theorem for vector bundles with flat connections, using algebraic
Chern Simons character classes.

This is a project in both representation theory and geometry. It is a common
occurrence in mathematics that a investigation will produce an infinite sequence
of numbers representing basic information about the objects under study. Such a
sequence can appear to form quite randomly, even though it is actually
completely determined by the way it was identified. Certain mathematical
functions, zeta and L-series, have long been known to contain important
information about the distribution of numbers in such sequences. Important
examples of zeta and L-series are often connected to the concrete
representations of the abstract mathematical constructions, algebras and groups.
Unfortunately, mathematicians do not fully understand either the connection
between number sequences and these series or the connection between the series
and the representations. If both of these connections were regularized,
mathematics would have a powerful new method of discovery. This project will
investigate the second set of these connections.
