Nucleotide sequence data from DNA and RNA have become the most exciting basis
on which to infer evolutionary relationships. However, biologists currently are
better able to generate these data than to analyze them, owing to the lack of
appropriate and well-tested statistical methods. Dr. James Cavender is a
mathematician interested in the use of these data for constructing evolutionary
trees, and he proposes an algebraic analysis of a new technique authored
recently by Dr. James Lake. This new approach ("evolutionary parsimony") takes
into account the different probabilities associated with different types of
nucleotide change. The proposed research would explore the limits of this new
method, establish the asumptions on which it is based, and the degree to which
these statistical assumptions are true. The proposed research has the potential
for openning a new approach to the use of nucleotide sequence data. Developing
and testing this method would have wide impact in systematic and evolutionary
biology, and in genetics, molecular biology, and biochemistry as well.
