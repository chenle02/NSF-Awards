The principal investigator will study the geometric invariants of elliptic
operators via the adiabatic limit method. In particular he will try to
understand their behavior under a general process of surgery. One of the
invariants to be studied is the analytic torsion. The eta invariant and
determinant will also be considered. One motivation for the research is the
recent work of Bismut and Lebeau on the arithmetic Riemann-Roch theorem. This
award will support research in the general area of differential geometry and
global analysis. Differential geometry is the study of the relationship between
the geometry of a space and analytic concepts defined on the space. Global
analysis is the study of the overall geometric and topological properties of a
space by piecing together local information. Applications of these areas of
mathematics in other sciences include the structure of complicated molecules,
liquid-gas boundaries, and the large scale structure of the universe.
