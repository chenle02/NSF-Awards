9705523 Fuhrman This project is a continuation of a survey of marine
microorganisms funded by DEB 9401110. During that study, three major groups
(potentially at the phylum or class level) of archaea were discovered, as well
as numerous examples of minor taxa. Many more new taxa are expected during the
phase of the project funded by this award. It has become clear that the deep sea
and coral reefs are two marine habitats that harbor many novel taxa. For that
reason, this current project will concentrate on probing samples of sea water
from these habitats with molecular tools (16s rRNA). The samples of sea water
are provided very cost-effectively by other researchers who are conducting
studies in the habitats of interest (primarily Indo-Pacific reefs). The results
of this survey will provide baseline information on which to build analytical
studies of the ecology, biogeography, and phylogeny of marine microorganisms.
