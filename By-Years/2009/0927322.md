Much of the physical properties (i.e., electronic, optical, thermal) of
crystalline materials stems from the periodicity in the atomic arrangement and
the nature of wave interactions with the underlying repetitive structure. With
the advent of nanotechnology there are now opportunities to introduce additional
geometric structures including an added layer of periodicity in order to
manipulate properties over broader spatial and temporal scales. The objective of
the proposed research is the development of theoretical and computational tools
for the analysis and elucidation of complex elastic wave phenomena in periodic
nanoscale materials and the design of integrated material-structure systems with
superior properties and advanced functionalities. This objective will be
approached by adopting a building blocks methodology where single unit cells are
first analyzed and designed. The cells will then be utilized at the structural
level to achieve target mechanical and thermal properties and functionalities.
In order to facilitate this multiscale analysis and design process, techniques
for fast lattice dynamics calculations will be developed and
utilized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed theoretical work, which will be
validated by experimental studies, will enable new approaches for
material/structure analysis and design at the nanoscale. This will lead to
substantial improvements in thermal properties and vibration response
characteristics in bulk nanostructured systems as well as reduced dimension
nanoelectromechanical system (NEMS) components. Of particular interest are
realizable material systems with reduced thermal conductivity for efficient
thermoelectric conversion and robust nanoscale structures capable of suppressing
vibration with minimum heat dissipation.&lt;br/&gt;
