Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning technologies are being used in
high-stakes decision-making systems like lending decision, employment screening,
and criminal justice sentencing. A new challenge arising with these AI systems
is avoiding the unfairness they might introduce and that can lead to
discriminatory decisions for protected classes. Most AI systems use some kinds
of thresholds to make decisions. This project aims to improve fairness-aware AI
technologies by formulating threshold-agnostic metrics for decision making. In
particular, the research team will improve the training procedures of fairness-
constrained AI models to make the model adaptive to different contexts,
applicable to different applications, and subject to emerging fairness
constraints. The success of this project will yield a transferable approach to
improve fairness in various aspects of society by eliminating the disparate
impacts and enhancing the fairness of AI systems in the hands of the decision
makers. Together with AI practitioners, the researchers will integrate the
techniques in this project into real-world systems such as education analytics.
This project will also contribute to training future professionals in AI and
machine learning and broaden this activity by including training high school
students and under-represented undergraduates. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project focuses on advancing optimization for threshold-agnostic fair AI
systems. The research activities include: (i) developing scalable stochastic
optimization algorithms for optimizing a broad family of rank-based threshold-
agnostic objectives; (ii) developing novel threshold-agnostic fairness measures
including Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (ROC) fairness, Area under the
ROC Curve (AUC) fairness, etc. and studying the relationship between them and
the existing fairness measures; (iii) developing efficient stochastic methods
for in-processing fairness-aware learning methods to directly optimize
threshold-agnostic objectives subject to new threshold-agnostic fairness-
ensuring constraints; and, (iv) investigating effective end-to-end deep learning
framework that not only automatically learns the feature representations, but
also satisfies the fairness constraints. The algorithms will be evaluated on
multiple tasks, including image recognition, recommendation, spatial-temporal
hazard prediction, and predicting studentsâ€™
performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
