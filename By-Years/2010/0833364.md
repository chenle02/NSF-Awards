The University of Colorado is establishing a Distributed Center for STEM
Education Research and Transformation that integrates education projects across
the campus. The Center addresses the three themes outlined in the National
Academy of Science report "Rising Above the Gathering Storm". These are: (1)
Teachers in K-12 education (10,000 Teachers, 10 Million Minds), (2) Research
(Sowing Seeds), and (3) Higher Education (Best and Brightest). This Distributed
Center involves eight traditional departments in three colleges and schools,
including: Education, Life Sciences, Mathematics, Physical Sciences, and
Engineering. Existing education projects being integrated into the center
include: ADVANCE (Increasing the Participation and Advancement of Women in
Academic Science and Engineering Careers); Course Curriculum and Laboratory
Improvement projects; Robert Noyce Teaching Scholarship project; Integrative
Graduate Education and Research Traineeship projects; and Research and
Evaluation on Education in Science and Engineering projects.
