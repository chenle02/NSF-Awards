This award to the National Academy of Sciences will support 30 early career
scientists to attend the International Union of Radio Science's General Assembly
and Scientific Symposium (URSI GASS), to be held in Montreal, Canada. The
triennial GASS is the most important meeting associated with
URSI.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award enables participation of early career U.S.
scientists at the URSI GASS, thereby allowing the United States to actively
contribute to the scientific union at its largest international meeting. Both
URSI and the U.S. National Committee for URSI (USNC-URSI) strongly support the
involvement of young scientists in the GASS. The program of U.S. young scientist
travel fellowships to the URSI GASS will allow early career researchers to
present their research in an international setting, hear about new areas of
radio science research, gain familiarity with the URSI Commission structure, and
build a network of international contacts. The fellows will be exposed to the
policy aspects of their field and learn how major decisions that affect their
field are made. They also will be encouraged to enter the International Student
Paper competition and to engage in URSI Commission
meetings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientists and students supported by this
award will enhance their education and their professional development.
Interactions with colleagues from both the U.S. and other countries will help
foster new collaborations and the development of new networks, ultimately
resulting in new scientific research that advances the field.
