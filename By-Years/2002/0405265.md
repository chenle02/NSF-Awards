Proposal 0405265&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Rudi Weikard&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Univ
of Alabama Birmingham&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Conference on the Titchmarsh-Weyl m
-function&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt
;&lt;br/&gt;The m-function was originally introduced by Weyl. Its implications
for the spectral theory of the underlying differential operator were first
investigated by Titchmarsh. In the intervening 50 years the scope of the
m-function and also its analogies for other mathematical systems have been
developed extensively. A meeting on the Titchmarsh-Weyl m-function is planned
for July 2004 in Cardiff, Wales, to bring together experts in the subject as
well as scientists outside of mathematics who may exploit its use to develop new
results in their own work. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this proposal is to
make it possible for American &lt;br/&gt;scientists (mostly graduate students
and recent Ph.D.s) to participate. Monies obtained through this proposal will
enhance the infrastructure for research and education by exposing particularly
young scientists and graduate students to a very active current research area.
In selecting participants the &lt;br/&gt;proposer will give careful
consideration to those groups which are underrepresented in mathematics.
