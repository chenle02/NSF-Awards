This work in theoretical nuclear structure physics will carry out research on
an improved calculation of an effective shell-model interaction; configuration
mixing within the IBM2 model to address shape coexistence, superdeformation and
F- spin analog states in nuclei; and tests of fundamental symmetry violations in
compound-nuclear reactions.
