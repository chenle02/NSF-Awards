Haptic interaction refers to the form of interaction with a real or virtual
environment based on the sense of touch. As the user experiences and interacts
with an environment through a haptic system, the haptic system directly or
indirectly alters the user's perception and motor control. Therefore,
understanding the effects of the haptic system on the perception and motor
control is important.

The purpose of this study is the development of a computational model of the
human haptic sensory-motor system for quantitatively capturing the user
performance in haptic manipulation tasks. The developed computational model,
which we call the haptic e-model, will be an objective tool for evaluation of
haptic systems with emphasis on human operator's sensory-motor performance.
Specifically, the developed haptic e-model will be composed of a benchmark suite
of representative haptic manipulation tasks, task performance measures, and
models for human perception and motor control.

The haptic e-model will be used as a benchmark evaluation model by the research
community to evaluate effectiveness and performance of haptic systems,
components, and algorithms. It will also be a computational tool that can be
easily integrated into the design cycle of haptic systems, and facilitate
quantitative analysis of design choices throughout system development.
