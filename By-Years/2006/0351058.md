&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study evaluates whether and when, if at all,
voluntary programs can be relied upon as tools for pollution reduction. First,
to determine whether selected programs do indeed achieve their goal, we ask: do
the programs lead to significant pollution decline among participants? Do they
unwittingly worsen environmental quality in poorer neighborhoods because
facilities in such neighborhood do not participate in these programs or do not
reduce pollution? Do these programs lead to firms substituting to more harmful
chemicals? Second, to identify the appropriate target for applying such programs
and the institutional features necessary to ensure its effectiveness, we ask:
how do consumer, investor, community and regulatory pressure and pollution
charges influence program participation and pollution reduction? This study
improves upon present studies in three ways: (1) extending the scope of study to
several facilities owned by non-publicly traded firms (2) using more accurate
data and more reliable estimation methods and (3) testing new hypotheses. The PI
is currently assembling a novel GIS-database that links facility-level toxicity
weighted pollution, neighborhood demographics, county/state level regulatory
pressure and pollution charges. This study provides a more careful assessment of
the true impact of the voluntary programs on pollution reduction than previous
studies, by isolating the reductions that are due to participation in the
voluntary program from those that result from mandatory phase-outs of Toxic
Release Inventory (TRI) chemicals and changes in TRI reporting requirements.
Multivariate regression analysis is implemented in this
study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
