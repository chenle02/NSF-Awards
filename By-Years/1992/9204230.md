The influence of elastic stress on the thermodynamic (equilibrium and kinetic)
behavior of single phase and multiphase, multicomponent crystalline solids is
examined. The proposed research includes theoretical analyses and experimental
approaches to the problem. There are two thrusts in the proposal: (1) the
development of a general paradigm for the treatment of phase equilibria,
including equilibrium phase conditions, phase coexistence and phase diagram
construction in homogeneously stressed and heterogeneously stressed systems; (2)
the effect of stress on material response to imposed gradients in such
thermodynamic potentials as the temperature, chemical activity, electric field
and deformation (stress or strain). %%% Although most crystalline materials are
subjected to various potential gradients in practice, little is known on how
elastic stress affects material behavior in such circumstances. Elastic stresses
can arise from internal sources such as composition gradients and coherency
strains between phases or from external sources such as applied load.
