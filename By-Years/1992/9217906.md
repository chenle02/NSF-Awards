Astrometric Research at the Yale University Observatory. Dr. Van Altena will
continue a wide range of current and planned long term astrometric research
based at Yale University. This award will provide some support for the reduction
of data from the Southern Proper Motion Survey, but the principal objective is
to support those operations that are closely related to the PI's facilities in
New Haven, CT. Dr. Van Altena plans to produce a catalog of Right Ascensions and
Declinations for faint stars seen from the Southern Hemisphere for use with
large telescopes in determining positions of faint extra-galactic objects and
positioning fiber optic probes for spectrographs. Work will continue on the
determination of parallaxes of selected stars of astrophysical interest and on
determination of reliable proper motion memberships in stellar clusters.
