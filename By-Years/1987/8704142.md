Mass spectral (MS) techniques such as Electron Impact (EI) and Fast Atom
Bombardment (FAB) are used to probe intimate structural details and to obtain
the molecular compositions of a vast array of organic, bioorganic, and
organometallic molecules. The acquisition of instrumentation capable of carrying
out these state-of-the-art techniques is essential for the prosecution of
frontier research in several fields of chemistry. The purchase of a new mass
spectrometer and the upgrading of FAB-MS capabilities will be facilitated by
support from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program and the Biological
Instrumentation Program. The major areas of research that will be enhanced
include: 1) The chemistry of phosphazenes 2) Glycosation-site analysis of rat
alpha-1 acid glycoprotein 3) Chemistry of pterins 4) Capillary zone
electrophoresis-mass spectrometry 5) Template controlled oligomerizations 6)
Synthetic organometallic chemistry
