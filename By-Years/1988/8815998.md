The objective of this project is to generate many different peptide sequences
in defined secondary structures through the use of specifically positioned
disulfide bonds, and to use such peptides to test the relationship of the
activity of the peptides with their secondary structure. Dr. Wemmer will
determine structures of small, naturally occurring, cystine containing peptides
using two dimensional NMR spectroscopy. Based on the peptides studies, he will
then select specific cysteine "basic" positions, and investigate the degree to
which changes in the surrounding peptide sequence can be made, while still
retaining the secondary stucture of interest. Proteins are typically very
complex biological structures which have evolved to meet specific structural
requirements for activity, regulation and stability. Natural proteins result
from simultaneous selective pressure along all of these lines. In these proteins
only a small part of the complete sequence may really be required for one aspect
of the multiple functions. Therefore it is possible to duplicate some of the
activity of the protein using only a fraction of its amino acids.***//
