9321813 Tong The objective of this research is to explore theoretical and
practical issues of fast converging "blind" channel identification,
equalization, and sequence estimation schemes to combat multipath fading and co-
channel interference. It aims to eliminate or significantly reduce training
signals for the equalization of time- varying wireless communication channels.
The research exploits the second -order (cyclostationary) statistical and
algebraic properties of communication signals and the communication channel; it
leads to a faster convergence rate than those of existing methods using higher-
order statistics. By combining equalization and coding techniques, the research
identifies a frequency selective fading channel and suppresses co-channel
interference. Using the so-called signal subspace concepts, an optimal blind
sequence estimation method via the Viterbi algorithm is investigated; its
structure is particularly attractive to time- varying channels. The research
consists of theoretical investigation, algorithm development, and experimental
verification. The significance of the work is that it addresses the two
important limitations of TDMA and GDMA based systems: the multipath interference
and the multiuser interference. It has the potential to increase transmission
capabilities by eliminating training sequences. The techniques developed in this
research have a wide range of applications including identification of periodic
systems and medical image processing. ***
