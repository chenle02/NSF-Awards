The project will investigate the estimation of volatility-like objects in the
context of the hidden semi-martingale model. Apart from volatility, we are
concerned with co-variations, ANOVA, leverage effect, and related quantities.
The project uses ideas from contiguity and unbiased estimation to find such
estimators. Data are assumed to have high frequency, so that small-interval
asymptotics will be used. A main part of the project is concerned with the
applications of such estimators. The investigator's earlier findings on
nonparametric, trading based, risk management for options will be interfaced
with the estimators to find complete procedures for safely unwinding dangerous
positions. The estimators will also be combined with forecasting techniques to
provide high-frequency based competitors to latent volatility models like GARCH.
We can here draw on the martingale type error structure in the high frequency
estimation. The economic value of the estimators in terms of portfolio
management will also be investigated.

A main background for the project is the increasing availability of high
frequency data for financial securities prices. This permits, in principle, very
precise determination of volatility and similar characteristics of prices. The
investigator's finding, however, that prices behave as if they have measurement
error, raises a number of questions about how the statistics is carried out.
This project will be concerned with both estimation, and applications to risk
management, forecasting, portfolio management, and regulation. The results are
of interest to investors, regulators, and policymakers.
