This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This engineering education
research award to Clemson University will employ researchers to investigate how
engineering students organize prior knowledge and develop effective problem
solving strategies. Tablet PCs will be used to capture a complete history of
students' solution processes including all strokes and erasures. This will allow
analysis of mistakes and identification of inefficient strategies and
misconceptions. Since effective problem solving is fundamental to all
engineering disciplines, the methods developed to analyze sequences of problem
solving steps and the results of the analysis will make important contributions
to cognitive science and engineering education. This work can provide guidance
for curricular changes to improve student learning by developing efficient
problem solving strategies and will contribute to better preparation of
engineers to fill engineering jobs.
