This research investigates several approaches to modeling dispersed turbulent
two phase flow in complex geometries. The models are aimed at one regime of
relatively high concentrations of the dispersed phase, including particle-
particle interactions for particles embedded in a carrier fluid. The approach is
theoretical and computational, with computer codes generated based on
mathematical modeling of the complex medium.
