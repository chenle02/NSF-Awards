Nontechnical abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of the most remarkable
discoveries are related to the existence and nature of magnetism, and magnetism
at a non-magnetic interface remains one of the greatest outstanding mysteries of
modern physics. Experimental evidence has revealed magnetism coexisting with
superconductivity, and the existence of magnetism at room temperature. This
project seeks to provide understanding of such unexpected phenomena. The
research requires proficiency in a variety of areas including physics, materials
science, and nanoscale engineering, making it challenging and rewarding for
beginning graduate and undergraduate students. Students also receive valuable
training and experience in an international research setting: this research
project is made possible by an international collaboration with a research team
from the Weizmann Institute in Israel and exposes students both scientifically
and culturally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical
abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The interface between two insulating oxides,
strontium titanate and lanthanum aluminate, exhibits an incredibly rich palette
of emergent behavior. Some of the most remarkable discoveries have related to
the existence and nature of magnetism, which coexists at low temperature with
superconductivity, and is strongly influenced by the density of mobile electrons
at the interface. Fundamental questions about the origin and nature of magnetism
at (non-magnetic) oxide interfaces are investigated using a suite of probes that
combine high spatial and temporal resolution. This project seeks an increased
understanding of coupled phases in oxides, greatly benefiting the oxide
community as a whole. The research focuses on developing a microscopic
understanding of the origin of magnetism at oxide interfaces, with a particular
emphasis on the role of both localized and delocalized electrons that are
otherwise confined to these interfaces. This research combines ultrasensitive
probes of magnetism at low temperature with the ability to create electronic
nanostructures using conductive-atomic fore microscope lithography. A variety of
complementary imaging techniques are employed to reveal magnetic properties at
the oxide interface, including magnetic force microscopy , time resolved Kerr
rotation, and superconducting-quantum-interference-device-on-a-tip microscopy.
This unique combination of techniques, made possible by an international
collaboration between the United States and Israel, is able to provide new
insights into the most important outstanding physics questions concerning this
remarkable material system.
