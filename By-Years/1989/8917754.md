This award funds the Mathematical Sciences Research Group in Number Theory at
Baruch College of the City University of New York. It is designed both to
support mathematical research and to widen the mathematical horizons of the
undergraduate students at Baruch College, many of whom are known to be
mathematically talented. By the creation of Mathematical Student Assistantships,
the project will bring to the students' attention the fact that a career in
mathematics is a real possibility, while by bringing the undergraduates into
contact with research mathematicians both from within and from without the
College, the project will show these students the excitement that is inherent in
mathematical discovery.
