With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
(CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of California in
Santa Cruz will acquire a 600 MHz NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will enable
researchers to carry out research in a number of areas, including a)
characterization of bioorganic compound mixtures; b) the role of protein
signaling and folding; c) radical reagents; d) new chiral synthesis tools; e)
metal ions in metalloenzymes and therapeutics; and f) dynamics of active site
iron in lipoxygenases. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the
elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown
substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and
to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to
state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out
frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in
synthetic organic chemistry and biochemistry. &lt;br/&gt;
