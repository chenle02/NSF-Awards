Professors Varadarajan and Babbitt will work on a variety of projects. The
first is a joint project involving the study of differential equations in a
broad framework which relates them to algebraic groups and their
representations. The questions to be studied have broad significance in such
areas as differential modules over schemes, moduli of vector bundles, theory of
algebraic groups, asymptotic analysis, and invariant differential operators and
distributions. Other projects involve representation theory of the Poincare
group, and scattering theory in the quantum Heisenberg model. The joint project
focuses on the behavior of solutions to differential equations with
singularities as a function of external parameters. The other projects fall
under the heading of mathematical physics and involve mathematical aspects of
quantum theory.
