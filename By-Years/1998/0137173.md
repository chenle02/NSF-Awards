The Endeavor Deep along the Juan Fernandez microplate exposes a 50 km-long 3-4
km-deep section of young ocean crust created at very fast spreading rates. This
projects involves combined geophysical surveys with in situ observations and
sampling along the northeast wall of the Endeavor Deep. High-resolution DSL-120
side-scan sonar will completely insonify the scarp and be used to map regional
trends in lithology and structure at 10 m resolution. Rock dredging will
identify specific targets for more detailed sampling. Digital imaging and
petrologic sampling transects with Jason II will groundtruth the regional view
and provide a high-resolution perspective of representative sections. Deep-towed
3-component magnetometer data will map the magnetization of oceanic crust at
these same scales.&lt;br/&gt;
