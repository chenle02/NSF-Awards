The research objective of the award is to combine materials science and
engineering and computational tools to elucidate the basic mechanisms underlying
nanoscale mechanically-induced damage in nanostructured materials at multi-
length scales. The concepts developed will enable fabrication of advanced
polymeric materials that are characterized by a combination of high modulus and
strength with the ability to experience high elastic recovery, together with the
benefit of inherent transparency. These properties are desired for a variety of
future defense-related applications such as scratch-tolerant face shields.
Mechanical models with predictive capabilities for a wide range of polymeric
material systems based on the inter-relationship between the internal structure
and mechanical properties will be developed. The potential impact of research
relates to the mechanistic understanding of nanoscale mechanical damage in
nanostructured materials that will have far reaching implications in
nanotechnology because of the widespread usage of polymeric materials in
applications including magnetic storage devices, biomedical components, and
micro-electromechanical systems. Graduate and undergraduate engineering students
will benefit through involvement in research and integration of research with
existing curriculum. High school students and teachers working together with
graduates and undergraduates will obtain first hand research experience, which
will motivate them to advanced level of learning and considering science and
engineering as their career, while the high school teachers will benefit in
designing experiments for classroom demonstration.
