This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is seeking the
transfer and further development and commercialization of a new low temperature
metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (LT-MOCVD) technology for boride
coatings. The project will work to develop coatings for characterizations of
adhesion, microstructure, morphology, composition and hardness. Selected
coatings will be tested for friction and wear and corrosion resistance under
laboratory test conditions on various common engineering substrate materials.
The precursor preparation process will be scaled up and deposition will be done
in an industrial scale deposition system. The coating process will be optimized
for high hardness and good adhesion. Optimized coatings will be applied to
components for testing at end users' facilities under production conditions.

The broader impact/commercial potential of wear and corrosion resistant coatings
are very attractive for their high hardness and good chemical stability, and
have potential for many applications in the manufacturing sector in United
States. The process developed in this project, of deposition of borides, will
enable a wide spectrum of applications including cutting tools, die casting dies
and inserts, transfer rolls for flat glass, components for chemical processes,
armament industries, automotive and aerospace industries.
