The goal of this collaboration between the PI and R¼di Seiler of the Technische
Universitªt Berlin is to study discrete integrable systems, classical and
quantum. This subject has interesting connections with geometry, number theory,
representation theory and other branches of mathematics. This work will focus on
the Hamiltonian aspects of these systems, their geometric applications, the
quantization of the systems, and the relation between C* algebras and
representations of the systems. In particular, the work focuses on quantum
integrable systems in the thermodynamic limit, and the potential uses of
integrable, infinite-dimensional systems over finite fields. The research will
also expose students to collaborative research in one of the best universities
in Germany.
