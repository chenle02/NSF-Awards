Girardeau, MO 637014753 ILI - Instrumentation Project: Geosciences Title:
Enhancement of Courses in Mineralogy, Petrology, and Soil Science with X-Ray
Diffraction Laboratory Experiences This project improves instruction in
geoscience and soil science courses through the incorporation of instruction in
X-ray diffraction (XRD). The courses to be effected are Rocks and Minerals,
Mineralogy and Petrology, Optical Mineralogy and Petrography, Clay MIneralogy,
and Soil Classification and Resource Management. The XRD equipment also opens
exciting investigations that can be pursued under Introduction to Geoscience
Research and the capstone course, Senior Research and Seminar. The development
plan involves introducing the XRD powder methodof identification early in the
sophomore year followed by progressively more sophisticated mineralogical
problem-solving in upper level courses. The impact will be assessed by student
evaluation and peer observation of laboratory activities, and publication of the
developments is anticipated.
