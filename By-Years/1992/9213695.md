This project, in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organo- metallic Chemistry
Program, will explore the redox properties of metal clusters, and the volumes of
activation of intra- molecular cluster processes. Cluster compounds to be
studied in the first area will contain carbon atoms as part of the core
structure. Substituents on these carbon atoms will have pi-donor/acceptor
properties that will serve to delocalize the unpaired electron density arising
from electron transfer processes. This is expected to stabilize the redox
products such that they can be characterized by conventional spectro- scopic
techniques. In the second area, volumes of activation for intramolecular
processes will be studied for several series of compounds, whose reactivity has
already been studied by other methods, to see if this parameter can be used as a
reliable measure of the nature of the transition state. This is particularly
important for reactions that are first order in cluster where it is presently
nearly impossible to determine whether metal-metal bond cleavage, bridge to
terminal ligand conversion, etc. is involved in achieving the transition state
for the reaction. The ultimate objective of these investi- gations is to
determine the ways in which the properties of ligated metal clusters differ from
those of small uncomplexed aggregates of metal atoms and to be able to
selectively modify these properties by changing the number of atoms in the
cluster and the nature of the ligating groups. %%% This project is aimed at
understanding the fundamental chemistry of organometallic compounds that are
composed of small numbers of metal atoms that are bonded together (in a cluster)
and are surrounded by donor ligands. In some ways the chemistry of these
compounds models that of catalytic reactions of molecules on the surfaces of
small metal particles that are routinely used in industrial processes.
