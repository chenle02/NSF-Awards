9409089 Mehdy Little is known concerning the molecular mechanisms regulating
mRNA stability in plants although direct and indirect evidence indicates that it
is an important determinant in the expression of many genes. The plant defense
response is characterized by a rapid loss of mRNAs encoding the bean proline-
rich protein, PvPRP1, an extensin, Beta-tubulin as well as a number of unknown
proteins. Among these mRNAs, the PvPRP1 mRNA down-regulation is currently the
best characterized mechanistically. The PvPRP1 mRNA is destabilized after
elicitor treatment and a protein which specifically binds this transcript has
been identified (PRP-BP). Purification of the RNA binding protein will be a
major goal in order to define its biochemical properties including apparent
post- translational activation by elicitor treatment and interaction with the
PvPRP1 mRNA. In addition, availability of the purified protein will allow
cloning of its encoding gene and production of PRP-BP- specific antibodies for
immunocytochemical localization of the protein. One of the most rapid processes
triggered by exposure to pathogens is the striking release of active oxygen
species (AOS) which is termed the oxidative burst. The possibility that AOS
serve as signal intermediates which induce phytoalexin biosynthesis has received
considerable attention. However, the mechanism(s) of AOS regulation of
phytoalexin accumulation and other intracellular defense-related changes is
unknown. This research will use biochemical and molecular approaches to clarify
the roles of AOS and changes in cellular glutathione levels in elicitor-induced
signalling pathways leading to regulation of PvPRP1 and phytoalexin pathway mRNA
levels. The experimental system being studied is the interaction between the
fungal pathogen and the host plant (bean). At a more general level, the results
of these studies will contribute to our understanding of oxidative stress
regulation of gene expression. ***
