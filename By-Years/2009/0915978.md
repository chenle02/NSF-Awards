The proposed work explores techniques for making static analysis
tools&lt;br/&gt;more effective in the hands of users. This will lead to
the&lt;br/&gt;development of new static analysis algorithms, techniques,
and&lt;br/&gt;interfaces that provide the information users need to find,
verify,&lt;br/&gt;and fix defects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The core of the proposed
work will be a framework for static analysis&lt;br/&gt;visualization and
interaction, with several components. First, the&lt;br/&gt;framework will
include checklists to help users triage defect reports,&lt;br/&gt;i.e., decide
whether they are true or false positives. The aim is to&lt;br/&gt;develop ways
to instrument static analyses to automatically generate&lt;br/&gt;checklists
based on imprecision introduced during the analysis.&lt;br/&gt;Second, the
framework will include lightweight query and search&lt;br/&gt;facilities to help
users work with static analysis tool results. Users&lt;br/&gt;need effective
ways to query the knowledge-base generated by a tool&lt;br/&gt;when trying to
understand an error report; current static error&lt;br/&gt;reports tend to
provide too little or too much information. Third, the&lt;br/&gt;framework will
include a generic visualization for program paths, a&lt;br/&gt;core part of many
static analysis tools' defect reports. While some&lt;br/&gt;tools include simple
path visualization, our framework will aim for&lt;br/&gt;far more effective
interfaces by applying information visualization&lt;br/&gt;principles.
