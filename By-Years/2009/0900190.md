This award supports experimental research investigating molecular collisions at
temperatures close to absolute zero. This "ultracold chemistry" is important for
understanding the fundamental physics underlying chemical reactions as well as
the chemistry of the cold interstellar medium. The research will enable the
delicate tools of ultracold atomic physics to be applied to traditional chemical
reactions. In this work, molecules and atoms will be cooled by a cryogenic
helium gas and their collisions and chemical reactions will be studied by laser
spectroscopy.

The broader impacts of this program include the training of graduate and
undergraduate students in cold molecule research and many areas of modern
technology, such as lasers, optics, high vacuum, and cryogenics. Potential
applications include the development of new methods to control chemical
reactions and chemical synthesis, a long- standing goal of physical chemistry.
