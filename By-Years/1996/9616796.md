The focus of this research is the use of the Murai reaction to achieve the
efficient RU catalyzed addition of ortho aromatic C-H bonds of acetophenone
across the C-C double bonds of alpha, omega dienes.. The scope and mechanism of
this regioselective reaction will be probed. The photoreactivity of polymer
bound o-alkyl aromatic groups will be studied and materials with unusual uv
stability will be sought. Hyperbranched materials and polymers containing
nonlinear optical chromophores will also be prepared. With this new award, the
Organic Dynamics Program is supporting the research of Dr. William P. Weber of
the Department of Chemistry at the University of Southern California. Professor
Weber will focus his work using Ruthenium catalyzed polymerization to produce a
series of novel polymers. It is possible that these materials will have unusual
stability towards uv photodegradation. Novel hyperbranched materials and
materials containing nonlinear optical (NLO) chromophores will also be prepared.
