ABSTRACT CTS-9624060 Paul J. Marto This proposal is to investigate enhanced film
condensation on tubes. A combination of hydrophilic and hydrophobic coatings
will be used to selectively control drainage from the tube. The tube surface
will be coated with a very thin titanium layer, followed by a gold layer to
which self-asqembled monolayers of organic molecules will chemisorb. Successful
augmentation using this passive technique could have important implications for
the power generation, refrigeration, and desalination industries.
