This project addresses the development and exploitation of a simple technique
for preparation of combinatorial libraries of compounds whose synthetic
histories are encoded by position along a one-dimensional solid support. This
approach combines the attractive statistical control, simplicity, and
flexibility of the split-mix synthetic procedure with the full library analysis
of a spatial encoding approach. Equipment requirements are simpler than those
for other spatial-encoding techniques, and Fourier transformation of the signal
output will lead directly to structure-activity relationships. With the support
of a Small Grant for Exploratory Research from the Organic Synthesis Program,
Professor Alan W. Schwabacher, of the Department of Chemistry at the University
of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, is developing an approach for the generation and
analysis of combinatorial libraries. By adapting known methods for the
preparation of such `libraries` (groups of related compounds) to incorporate the
libraries along a one-dimensional solid support, these studies may lead to the
development of techniques requiring only simple equipment and permitting rapid
analysis of structure-activity relationships.
