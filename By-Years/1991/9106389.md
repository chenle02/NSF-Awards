This is the first year of a two year continuing grant. One long-term goal of
this research is to develop and exploit techniques to make it possible for
scientists to study and solve problems in mathematics and physics that could not
be undertaken without automated assistance. Another long term goal is to deduce
general principles about the nature of human capabilities and limitations in
mental engagement with abstract data spaces. intelligent constraint-based
interaction (rule-based) methods will be combined with semi-automated
optimization techniques develop a domain-independent interactive system of
constraints. This system will be designed to allow manipulation of objects that
are transforms of non-observables which are conceptually difficult mathematical
properties. Simulations that transform non-observables into manipulatable
observables are useful to exploit human learning processes to master abstract
problems. The abstract concepts range from issues of relative size and speed
estimation, unfamiliar dimensions, and chaotic processes in physics and
interactions in many-body problems. Domain-dependent constraints on
representations are used to form a model of a desired class of spatial
configurations. This leads to a rational automation methodology. Direct,
context-free manipulation of objects, rather than manipulation of objects,
rather than manipulation of corresponding surrogate "control" objects, will also
be examined. This effort seek to lay a foundation for understanding human
capacity for mental engagement with visual representations of abstract concepts.
This will be useful as a basis for subsequent experiments on psychophysical
theories of visualization.//
