This award funds the research activities of Professor Savdeep Sethi at the
University of Chicago. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The origins of space and time are
one of the enduring mysteries of nature. Did space and time emerge in some kind
of Big Bang? Will the universe end in a Big Crunch? Can we sensibly describe
these singular highly quantum states of nature? In order to answer such basic
questions about the nature of space and time, we need a quantum theory of
gravity. String theory remains the best candidate for such a theory. In his
research, Professor Sethi aims to explore static and dynamical aspects of string
theory and quantum field theory. The static aspects include new ways of curling
up the extra dimensions of string theory to arrive at a four-dimensional
universe. These new types of compactification are closely tied to the dynamics
of chiral gauge theory in two dimensions. The dynamical aspects include the
study of stringy domain walls. These walls are bubbles of inflating space-time,
quite similar to the conventional branes of string theory, which offer the
possibility of a holographic definition of quantum gravity in an accelerating
universe. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project is also expected to have
significant broader impacts. Professor Sethi will involve graduate students and
post-doctoral fellows in his research, thereby providing mentoring to junior
physicists studying string theory and quantum field theory. He also intends to
interact with high-school students and undergraduates through continued
participation in the Chicago REU program and the Space Explorers inner-city K-12
enrichment program. The final aspect of the broader impacts comes from improved
interdisciplinary ties with both cosmologists and mathematicians through
lectures at schools and workshops, through direct collaboration, and by
organizing workshops at the interface between these disciplines.
