The project team has developed a way to seamlessly collect information from
mobile device owners. By presenting simple questions on the mobile device at the
right time (e.g., "Have you eaten breakfast?") and allowing a simple way for the
owner to provide an answer, this technology opens up a number of interesting
market opportunities. There are many applications of this simple interaction:
gathering real-time market research information, performing a unique form of
mobile crowdsourcing and a new form of peer-to-peer messaging that extends the
capabilities of mobile text messaging. The mobility of the device and the
frequency with which owners can perform this interaction provide an interesting
ecosystem for asking and answering simple questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
technology may have applications in areas as broad as personal health
monitoring, micro-learning, enhanced peer-peer communication, and surveying
techniques. With wide-scale adoption, many different stakeholders will find
value in the platform solution we will develop. These customers range from
mobile applications developers wanting alternative ways to get input from users
of their apps to large companies wanting to gather information from a large
segment of their consumer population, or, most interestingly, a way for smaller
entities to be able to effectively collect and benefit from their own market
research efforts.
