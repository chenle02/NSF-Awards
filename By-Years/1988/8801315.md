The objective of this research is to develop a robust algorithm for motion
detection and segmentation of dynamic scenes. Preliminary results in motion
detection using local structures of hypersurfaces in the spatio-temporal domain
are promising. They will be extended to dynamic scenes acquired using stationary
as well as moving cameras. The proposed approach will be based on a combination
of surface approximation and region growing for the segmentation of a dynamic
scene. The applicability of the proposed algorithn to sequences in the egomotion
complex log space will also be studied. Both laboratory and outdoor scenes will
be used for the experimental verification of the algorithms.
