Abstract

Principal Investigator: Rubenstein, Michael Proposal Number: DMS - 0753794
Institution: American Institute of Mathematics Title: Canadian Number Theory
Association X Meeting

The Canadian Number Theory Association (CNTA) was founded in 1987 at the
International Number Theory Conference at Laval University. The purpose of the
CNTA is to enhance and promote learning and research in Number Theory. To
advance these goals, the CNTA organizes major international conferences, with
the aim of exposing students and researchers to the latest developments in
number theory. The previous meetings have been held in Banff (1988), Vancouver
(1989), Kingston (1991), Halifax (1994), Ottawa (1996), Winnipeg (1999),
Montreal (2002), Toronto (2004), and Vancouver (2006). The tenth meeting of the
CNTA is scheduled to take place on the dates July 13-18, 2008 at the University
of Waterloo. The direct impact of NSF funding will be the training of a
significant number of junior US researchers (junior faculty, postdoctoral
fellows and graduate students), who will gain the opportunity to participate in
the workshop. Almost half of those who attended CNTA IX (Vancouver 2006) were
American (95 people); the rest were from Canada (57), Europe (32), Asia (13),
Africa (3), Australia (3), and Latin America (2).

The conference will contain 12 plenary lectures, including a talk given by the
winner of the 2008 Ribenboim Prize (an award for distinguished research in
number theory), and a lecture open to the general public. The conference will
also include more than one hundred lectures in several special sessions,
covering areas in algebraic number theory, analytic number theory, arithmetic
geometry, computational number theory, and diophantine analysis. These topics
form the core of number theory, a vast subject with origins in classic greek
mathematics and having important applications in a wide range of areas including
cryptography, graph theory, coding theory, combinatorics, and logic, to name
just a few.
