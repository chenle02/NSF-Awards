Abstract Lapidus Lapidus will study the vibrations of "fractal drums," both
"drums with fractal boundary" and "drums with fractal membrane." More
specifically, he will develop analysis on fractals and on regions with fractal
boundary, as well as investigate and use new connections with Connes'
noncommutative geometry and the associated "quantized calculus." The long term
objective is gain a better understanding of the fine geometric structure of
fractals by combining the traditional tools from harmonic analysis, probability
theory, dynamical systems, and PDEs with methods from noncommutative geometry.
This project has many potential physical and engineering applications, including
transport in porous media and percolation networks, fractal resonators such as
microwave cavities, phase transitions, and diffusions on fractally structured
media. Further, it is directly relevant to current technology, such as oil
recovery, computer microchips, radar imaging, and very efficient heat insulators
called "aerogels."
