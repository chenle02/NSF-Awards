The goal of the project is to develop a model for Chagas' prevalence factors,
using data from selected municipalities in which serological, insecticide
program, and migration data can be matched. Ideally, if individuals' serological
results can be matched to their specific household data from the vector control
programs, logistic regression modeling will be feasible, if the total available
sample power is adequate. Alternatively, if more than one annual serological
survey and vector program information is available for a region, a time series
analysis of regional prevalence change may be possible. This research reflects a
continuing interest in the influence of population migration and household
behaviors on health status.
