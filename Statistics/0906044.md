The primary aim of this project is to develop the concepts, methods and
algorithms to extract information about the nature of a joint distribution in
high dimensional space from samples generated by Monte Carlo algorithms. The
approach will be based on the equi-energy sampling approach recently developed
by the principle investigator's group under prior NSF support. The secondary aim
of this project is to implement Monte Carlo sampling methods based on radically
new hardware and computation model, such as those based on field programmable
gate arrays. Some of the Monte Carlo methods developed in the primary aim will
be implemented using these new architectures, in order to enhance our ability to
solve hard inference problem by Monte Carlo computation. This project will
provide interdisciplinary training of next generation scientists working at the
interface of statistics, computation and biology.

By developing methods to study the shape, topology and entropy for the posterior
distribution, this research will provide fundamental tools for Bayesian
inference. As such, it will have impact on numerous application areas ranging
from computational biology to economic analysis. Beyond Bayesian statistics,
this research will also have impact on other scientific areas that utilize Monte
Carlo sampling to study a distribution, e.g. in equilibrium statistical physics
where one is interested in understanding the energy landscape associated with a
Boltzmann distribution. This project will provide interdisciplinary training of
next generation scientists working at the interface of statistics, computation
and biology.
