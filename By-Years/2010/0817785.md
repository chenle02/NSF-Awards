Heather L. Eisthen &lt;br/&gt;0817785&lt;br/&gt;Centrifugal Modulation in the
Vertebrate Olfactory Epithelium&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The brain sends signals to
the sense organs to focus attention on the stimuli that are most important at
any given time, depending on the animal's behavioral context or physiological
state. Although this type of activity has been described in the eye and ear, it
has received little attention in the nose, or olfactory organ. Research by Dr.
Eisthen and her collaborators suggests that the terminal nerve, a nerve that
extends between the brain and nose, releases chemicals into the olfactory organ
that change its activity. Specifically, the terminal nerve contains two
chemicals, gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) and neuropeptide Y (NPY), that
change odorant responses and excitability of olfactory neurons in the nose. The
effects appear to depend on the animal's overall physiological condition: GnRH
is more likely to affect olfactory receptor neurons during the breeding season,
and NPY?s effects are limited to hungry animals. This is interesting, because in
other parts of the brain, GnRH functions to control release of hormones involved
in reproduction, whereas NPY is involved in controlling appetite and hunger. The
project will involve a combination of anatomical, electrophysiological,
molecular, and biochemical techniques, and are expected to reveal how specific
these effects are, as well as the cellular and molecular changes that underlie
these effects. The research will contribute to the training of students and
researchers at Michigan State University, and involves cooperation with
scientists in other parts of the United States as well as in Japan and Sweden.
