9302111 Karsten In this project the P.I. will investigate the origin of E MORBs
that are that are isotopically indistinct from N MORBs along the Endeavor
Segment of the southern JdF. She already has these samples from a previous
cruise. These samples along and across axis (25 Km out...80Ka) will give a
temporal perspective to the origin of E MORBs as well: whether the parameters
vary with volcanic cycles. Karsten will acquire probe data on the samples and
carry out NDIC (Nomarski Differential Interference Contrast) and CSD (Crystal
Size Distributions) of the phenocrysts in E and N MORBs to distinguish between
processes like effect of magma chamber crystallization processes, phenocryst
residence times, mixing and resorption histories. ***
