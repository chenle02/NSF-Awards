This award to the University of Michigan supports the dissertation research of
an anthropology graduate student in the Ukraine. The student will study the
production of national and local political identities in a border region near
Romania. Using methods of ethnography and of speech analysis and focusing on
local language use, the student will test the hypothesis that national identity
formation is impeded by local identities formed in contrastive interaction with
nearby different local speech-dialect communities. Methods include ethnographic
observation and formal linguistic analysis of biographic and topical
conversations recorded in formal interviews and everyday conversations. This
research is important because it will advance our understanding of how localized
identities are incompatible with the ideology of national unity that underlies
language standardization. Understanding how local identities contrast with
national identities is of primary importance in this era of increasing `ethnic
politics` and tendencies for local political fragmentation in multi-ethnic
nation states. In addition the project will add to the nation's capacity for
scientific research in this important region of the world.
