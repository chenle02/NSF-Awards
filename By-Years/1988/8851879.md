A Geographic Information System Laboratory is established to improve the
quality of undergraduate instruction in the Natural Resources Management and
Earth Sciences Programs. The laboratory includes three workstations, ancillary
hardware and GIS software in two formats (vector-based and raster-based in
common use. Junior and senior level students are applying GIS to problems in the
fields of natural resources management, geology, geography and planning. GIS is
used to obtain and manipulate special information, and the interpretation and
synthesis of this information. GIS allows students to address research problems
that normally require inordinate amounts of time and effort to answer using
traditional techniques of special analysis such as manual overlays. The use of
GIS technology is becoming increasingly common in the fields affected by this
award. This new laboratory enhances the problem solving, research, and
professional capabilities of graduates from the respective programs. The award
will be matched by an equal sum from the grantee.
