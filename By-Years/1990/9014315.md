The purpose of the P3D software, a metafile storage format for general 3D
models, is to provide a consistent form in which researchers can store,
transmit, and exchange models resulting from their research. The project
involves creation of interfaces to a number of different renderers so that
images can be produced on whatever hardware or software platforms are available.
