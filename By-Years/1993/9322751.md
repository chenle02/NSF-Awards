9322751 Stross This project supports the dissertation research of a linguistic
anthropologist from the University of Texas, studying the rhetorical functions
of parallel speech styles among native speakers of the Sierra Popoluca language
of rural Veracruz, Mexico. Parallelism (defined as repetition with systematic
variation of grammatical, semantic or prosodic structures of an utterance) in
Native American verbal performance has been shown to enhance meaning in
traditional narratives. This research will look at relationships in a variety of
speech genres from conversation to ritual speech to provide a comparative data
base of parallelism in discourse performance. The student will record,
transcribe and translate naturally occurring speech events in a variety of
contexts. This research is important because it will add to our understanding of
the role of parallelism in American Indian languages, will help train a junior
linguistic scientist, and will document and conserve native American linguistic
culture. ***
