9457964 Hemker Dislocation motion in intermetallic alloys is known to be
governed by the dislocation core geometry, but attempts to capitalize on this
knowledge have been inhibited by the small number of experimental observations
currently available. This study, which is unique in that it provides a very
quantitative measure of dislocation core geometries by combining transmission
electron microscopy with computer generated image simulations, provides a way of
experimentally observing and characterizing dislocation core structures in
intermetallic alloys. These quantitative observations are used to link the
atomic structure of dislocation cores with the macroscopic mechanical properties
in several different intermetallic alloys. It is known that the addition of iron
to nickel-germanium reduces the anomalous flow strength behavior and eventually
results in alloys in which the flow strength decreases "normally" with
increasing temperature. Deforming a series of specimens that vary systematically
in iron content and relating the measured fault energies with the yielding
behavior of the individual alloys will provide valuable information about the
sources of the flow strength anomaly in all L12 alloys. %%% A fundamental
understanding of the processes that control dislocation motion in intermetallic
alloys will allow alloy designers to modify alloy stoichiometry to maximize both
ductility and high temperature strength. ***
