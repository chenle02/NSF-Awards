The intent of this proposal is to continue basic studies on the cross sections
and branching ratios of atomic photoionization using synchrotron radiation. The
proposed work extends previous work in two directions: (a) Measurements will be
made on open shell atoms and high Z atoms over an extended range of photon
energies. (b) Detailed studies will be made of near threshold double
photoionization in order to provide data for comparison with theory.
