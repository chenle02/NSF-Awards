ABSTRACT Davidson 9633755 We propose to conduct workshops to help engineering
PhD students interested in becoming faculty members to succeed in their careers.
Each workshop will last one week and will include 30 PhD students selected from
a pool of applicants. Funding is requested for five workshops, one held each
summer beginning in July 1996. The program will include sessions on both
education and research. In the former category, examples of activities include
presentations on cognitive processes involved in student learning, interactive
discussions on teaching strategies, and exercises to permit workshop
participants to develop their own course outlines. In the latter category, there
will be discussions on being an effective advisor to graduate students and on
obtaining funding for research. The workshops will be evaluated using both
short-term and long-term assessments through questionaires and interviews.
Overall, the workshops are expected to have a significant effect on the
productivity of those faculty members who participate, and on other new faculty
members with whom our workshop participants interact. ***
