This award provides funds to the Department of Biology at the University of
Massachusetts at Boston to continue a successful REU SITE. The program will give
ten undergraduate students the opportunity to participate in research projects
in ecology and conservation biology working with one of eight faculty sponsors
in the Department. Students will be recruited intensively in the Boston area and
also elsewhere in New England. The two major component of the program are
complementary: (1) a series of lectures/discussions for all the students, and
(2) individual research projects in which each student is closely associated
with an advisor/mentor. Initial group meetings that address the theory and
practice of research continue as weekly meetings at which students focus on
topics that relate to the conduct of research or its implications They will also
visit two or more field sites and learn directly about each others' projects A
small hands-on workshop on molecular techniques will show the great potential of
such methods for ecology An end-of- session retreat at the University Field
Station will serve to articulate impressions, explore philosophical issues, and
weave together some of the summers' threads. Potential research topics are will
be suggested, several of which can effectively involve two or more
undergraduates. The topics are focused on issues of biodiversity and
conservation ecology but are intentionally diverse to illustrate several
approaches They include three on the behavioral ecology of rare/endangered
vertebrates, and others on the physiological ecology of Lepidoptera, the
diversity of bacteria, the genetics of endangered plants, and the genetic
diversity of deep-sea molluscs. At the end of the session each student will
prepare a written and present a short paper in a mini-conference.
