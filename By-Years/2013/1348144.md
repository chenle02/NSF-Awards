This project develops and field-tests a mathematics-specific coaching protocol
centered on the Mathematical Quality of Instruction (MQI) instrument, a Common
Core-aligned observational tool. The coaching model will consist of three
elements: a summer training workshop, personalized web-based coaching, and
access to a library of resources to support coaching and instructional change.
The project team works with 3rd through 8th grade mathematics teachers to
implement and evaluate the coaching model, randomly assigning teachers to
treatment and control conditions, stratifying on grade level. The project team
evaluates the effect of the coaching model in both the concurrent and post-
intervention year, as past studies have found effects only after teachers have
completed the full cycle of coaching (Allen et al. 2011; Campbell &amp; Malkus,
2011). The primary outcome measures include teachers' classroom performance as
captured by the MQI, students' perceptions of their teachers' effectiveness, and
student test scores.&lt;br/&gt;This study supports the development of a subject-
specific and Common Core-aligned coaching protocol. Moreover, it provides
further experimental evidence on the effect of web-based coaching, and the first
evidence on a subject-specific coaching tool. This information advances the
field?s understanding of the potential value in shifting resources from more
traditional professional development programs to web-based coaching.
&lt;br/&gt;The increasing demands being placed on teachers by new evaluation
systems and the adoption of the Common Core has created a growing need for
content-specific coaching models. If this web-based coaching model proves
successful, it could be widely adopted by districts to supplement the generic
evaluation feedback teachers receive in most large-scale evaluation systems. It
would also allow individualized feedback for teachers who concentrate in
mathematics, including elementary mathematics specialists and middle school math
teachers.
