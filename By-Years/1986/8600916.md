This work concerns the application of a "differential gamma scattering
technique" to the detection of voids, cracks and flaws in materials without
subsequent deterioration of the material (i.e., non-destructive testing). The
project will involve the determination of the scientific feasibility of the
technique, and validation of the fundamental engineering design requirements
needed for the development of commercial systems.
