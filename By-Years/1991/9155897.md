An educational computer program is to be constructed that will enable students
to observe and manipulate the internal mechanisms of a simulated computer
software and hardware system. The program will enable students to view the
workings of the compiler as it translates source language to machine language
and the machine architecture as it executes the machine instructions. The system
will also provide the basis for a number of exercises for students who will be
able to modify the existing simulation or create their own mechanisms. The
purpose of the system is to support the teaching of the first course in computer
science for all students. It is expected to facilitate the teaching of the
fundamental mechanisms of computing to an unusual level for such first courses.
The design of the system grows out of a course developed at Duke over the past
five years which is now being adopted at many major colleges and universities.
