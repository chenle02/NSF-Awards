A new center is to be planned named the Industry/University Cooperative Research
Center (I/UCRC) for Social Technologies and Analytics. The planned I/UCRC
intends to conducts research of high-end applications for accessing the Social
Media data ecosystem, where Social Media refers to how users generate content,
exchange information and share ideas in public and private platforms over the
Internet. Research foci of the planned center include Big Data analysis,
cyberinfrastructure, mobile applications, technology and people, business
intelligence and society and computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The social media
ecosystem represents a significant and growing global resource that offers a
wide and varied set of new applications with potential impact spanning the
private and public sector. The planned center has the potential to build a
corporate, government and university cooperative to address research challenges
in this area and accelerate its growth. The planned center would engage students
at all levels and train them in through its research. The effort will draw on
existing university programs to engage a diverse set of participants.&lt;br/&gt;
