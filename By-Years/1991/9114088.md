The principal investigator will attend the 8th International Conference on Wind
Engineering which will take place on 8-12 July, 1991, in London, Ontario,
Canada. He will present two papers entitled: the first, "Computation of
Pressures on Texas Tech Building", and the second, "Numerical Simulation of
Thunderstorm Downdrafts". These conferences are held every four years and are
the most important gatherings for this area of specialization thus, providing
the participants with the opportunity of exchanging information about the state-
of- the-art in wind engineering.
