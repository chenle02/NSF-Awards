This project examines a long-overlooked source of educational disadvantage in
inner-city communities - the increased involvement of youth in general and urban
minority youth in particular in the juvenile justice system. On one hand,
juvenile justice systems have long attempted to include education in its
rehabilitative mission. One the other hand, criminalization of youth may make
school achievement all the more difficult. The project thus investigates how
arrest and detention of juveniles exert positive and negative effects on
academic performance. To do so, the investigator first analyzes quantitative
data on 876 poor and minority Chicago youth arrested or detained between 1992
and 1999. Second, the investigator conducts face-to-face informal interviews
with a random sample of 20 youths ages 18-19 to obtain qualitative data on
experiences in school before and after criminal sanctions. The results from both
data sources provide unique insights into how the juvenile justice system shapes
the experiences and educational outcomes of juvenile offenders.
