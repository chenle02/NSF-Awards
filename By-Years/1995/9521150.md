program to collect data on the economic impact of lifeline disruption in the
January 17, 1995 Hyogo-ken Nambu earthquake in Kobe, Japan. Data to be collected
include: background information on lifeline systems and economic activity in the
Kobe region; lifeline damage and restoration information; direct and indirect
indicators of post-earthquake economic activity; and case study information on
economic impact and recovery. Information will be collected in Japan from
transportation and utility companies, government agencies, university
researchers, media sources, and personal interviews. The project will be
coordinated with the comprehensive multi- disciplinary research program on this
earthquake being undertaken at the Disaster Prevention Research Institute of
Kyoto University. ***
