ABSTRACT P.I. Alan Rogers SBR-9310105 During the past several years, a vigorous
controversy has surrounded the origins of modern people, Homo sapiens. Much of
this involves the interpretation of the new molecular genetic data (from
mitochondrial DNA) originally marshalled in support of the "Eve" hypothesis for
a relatively recent explosion of modern humans out of Africa, replacing archaic
forms of humans around the globe (as opposed to the "multiregional" hypothesis
of modern human origins, which sees evidence of modern human population
relationships to older fossil finds - for example, a relation between modern
Chinese and Pekin Man, who lived some 300,000 years ago). While this argument
has generated a great deal of interest, it remains unresolved for a number of
theoretical reasons. This project will provide a more rigorous test of the Eve
vs. the Multiregional hypotheses by 1) formulating and testing quantitative
models of modern human origins: 2) providing significance levels, confidence
limits, and power analyses: and 3) using nuclear as well as mitochondrial DNA
markers. The study will analyze materials from a sample comprising 75
representatives of each of three major continental populations. At least 150
mitochondrial DNA markers will be analyzed, and also at least 70 nuclear
markers, including 9 on the Y chromosome. *** P\anthro\jfried\9310105.abs # # 5
