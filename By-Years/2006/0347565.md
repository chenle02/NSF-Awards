The ever-increasing demand for Internet bandwidth has renewed interest in
photonic switching. This project aims to address the problem of switching speed
in an optical network infrastructure within a rigorous framework that bridges
research and education in several key areas of computer science and mathematics,
including probabilistic methods, combinatorial analyses, switching theory,
circuit complexity, and WDM network routing algorithms. An objective of the
project is to completely characterize the trade-offs between various design
options faced by photonic switch designers such as depth vs. size, and blocking
behavior vs. cost.

The project involves the investigation of (a) novel WDM switching fabrics
designs guided by practical criteria such as cost-effectiveness, speed, and
scalability (b) models to analyze switches qualitatively and quantitatively
using a graph-theoretic framework that also draws on techniques from circuit
complexity and probabilistic methods (c) combinatorial models to
probabilistically analyze switch designs and characterize design trade-offs,
such as between cost and blocking behavior (d) online and offline routing
algorithms that are formulated as problems in graph coloring.
