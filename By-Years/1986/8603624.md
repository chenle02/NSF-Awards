This project is one of three projects to study the seismic design of buildings
using data obtained from the March 3, l985 Chilean earthquake. Detailed analysis
is made of two particular buildings (the Hanga Roa and the Torres del Sol
Buildings) which suffered severe damage. Use of shear walls in the Hanga Roa
buildings is studied in great depth. Design and performance of beam-column
joints of concrete buildings are also evaluated.
