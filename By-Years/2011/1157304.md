This project will begin to answer the fundamental question of how bacteria
survive long-term starvation. A great deal is known about the mechanics of how
bacteria grow and multiply. By contrast, little is known about how bacteria
survive long periods of nutrient starvation. This is a considerable knowledge
gap given that natural environments tend to be nutrient-poor. As a consequence
bacteria are forced to persist in a state of non-growth or very slow growth. How
do bacteria survive long-term starvation? What is the genetic and physiological
basis for this? When cells do die ? what are the most common causes of death?
The proposed research will focus on a bacterium named Rhodopseudomonas palustris
that has been identified as a good model for these studies. This bacterium stays
alive for periods of weeks in a laboratory setting in a starved non-growing
state. A comprehensive program of mutagenesis and high throughput DNA sequencing
technology will define genes that contribute to starvation survival. These genes
will be validated and their role in starvation survival defined in an iterative
process of mutagenesis, laboratory studies and gene expression studies.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts. The project will establish a user group
in functional genomics of microbes. A group of eighteen investigators at the
University of Washington who focus on microbial biology will form the core of
this user group. The group will develop novel experimental and computational
tools for data analysis that will be freely available to the scientific
community. This will also serve as a focal point to train graduate students and
undergraduates to apply global systems biology approaches to bacteria. The user
group will seek to engage faculty and students from smaller schools in the area,
including University of Puget Sound, Seattle Pacific University, Seattle
University, Evergreen College, Bellevue Community College, and the Seattle
Community Colleges. This project will also support a female postdoctoral fellow
who will be trained to integrate data from bacterial genetics, physiology and
computational analyses to answer questions about how cells function at the whole
cell level. Finally, this research will lead to a better understanding of the
role of non-growing microbes, which dominate in nature, and drive the global
carbon and nitrogen cycles. It will also promote more efficient use of non-
growing microbes as cell factories for production of value added products like
biofuels.
