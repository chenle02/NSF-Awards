SUNY at Stony Brook&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The Center for Dynamic Data Analysis
(CDDA) will focus on advancing knowledge and understanding of large-scale,
multidimensional dynamic data. Rutgers University (RU) and SUNY at Stony Brook
are collaborating to establish the proposed center, with RU as the lead
institution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed Center will investigate
algorithms and potential solutions to analyze and visualize massive, complex,
multidimensional and multi-scale dynamic data. The algorithm design will be
tested, validated and improved based on the close collaboration and research
between the two participating universities and industry. RU and SUNY plan to use
the NSF planning grant fund to hold a meeting with prospective industrial
partners, and to develop an initial research agenda for CDDA of sufficient
commercial interest that attendees will be willing to invest in and sustain the
Center. The participating universities have research and education programs
whose strengths cover the technical scope of the
center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research projects will be useful to
industry and homeland security, and the proposed Center will transform
traditional research in computer science. Analysis and visualization of large-
scale dynamic data will also become a new area of research for many graduate
students. CDDA plans to have students spend time with the industrial affiliates
in the form of summer internships and during the academic year so they can
improve their skills. The participating universities also plan to leverage
existing outreach programs at their institutions, and programs sponsored by the
NSF, to encourage the participation of under-represented groups in our research.
For the duration of the planning grant the PIs will pursue several avenues for
broadening participation, including partnership opportunities with local and
national outreach programs. &lt;br/&gt;
