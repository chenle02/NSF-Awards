Neurotensin (NT) is an endogenous brain tridecapeptide which fulfills many of
the criteria for being considered a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator
substance. A particulary intriguing aspect of NT neurobiology is the interaction
of this peptide with dopamingergic neurotransmission. However, the neurochemical
mechanisms of NT/DA interactions are largely obscure. The goal of the research
project is to investigate the modulation by NT of specific protein
phosphorylation pathways which may mediate DA signal processing in both
dopaminergic and dopaminoceptive neurons. The specific experiments to be
performed are: (1) elaboration of the changes in specific protein
phosphorylation induced by NT in both broken and intact cell preparations, as
well as biochemical characterization and identification of NT-sensitive
phosphoproteins; (2) correlation between NT-induced changes in protein
phosphorylation and NT- induced stimulation of DA release from caudate nucleus
and nucleus accumbens brain slices; and (3) examination of the effects of NT on
the phosphorylation of DA-sensitive phosphoproteins. These experiments will aid
in understanding the molecular processes underlying the observed behavioral and
physiological NT/DA interactions.
