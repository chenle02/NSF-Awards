The principal investigator will investigate three aspects of statistical
inference for time series models: iterative methods of estimation for incomplete
dependent data, non-linear time series analysis, forecasting with a possibly
misspecified model. The non-linear time series analysis represents a
continuation of the investigator's work on a flexible class of threshold
autoregressive models, where the relationship between stability and ergodicity
of some time series models will be investigated. The work on estimation for
incomplete dependent data will involve algorithm development. The principal
investigator is working on various problems in time series analysis. Time series
analysis is used to model situations were data are sequential and dependent.
Current interest is to develope a class of models that account for non-
linearities in real data. Another area of investigation will involve situations
were data are incomplete. This again represents a situation that can occur in
real data.
