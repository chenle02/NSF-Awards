This study investigates the mechanisms of solar chromospheric heating in
relation to photospheric dynamics. The data available focus on NOAA Active
Region 8844, and feature observations from various satellites (Yohkoh, SoHO, and
TRACE) as well as a unique balloon-borne experiment (Flare Genesis Experiment).
Analysis should determine not only the photospheric magnetic and velocity
fields, but also the electron temperature and emission measure in the overlying
transition region. Particular emphasis will be placed on understanding small-
scale transient phenomena like Ellerman bombs. At the final stage of the
project, these events will be modeled by cellular automata models incorporating
the self-organized critical behavior of the solar atmosphere, as well as by
deterministic hydrodynamic and magneto-hydrodynamic calculations.
