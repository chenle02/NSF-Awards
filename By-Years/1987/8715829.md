He has used TdT as a model DNA polymerase to analyze the process of substrate
and primer binding. Several site-specific reagents and procedures for the site-
specific covalent modifications have been developed to label the desired site(s)
in TdT. Using an affinity labeling protocol, we have demonstrated the identity
of the substrate binding domain in the 3 molecular weight species of TdT. He
will now define the primary amino acid sequence of that domain as well as
identify the amino acid residue which participates in binding of the substrate
triphosphate. Studies are also planned to define the primer binding site domain
in TdT which utilizes a) covalent crosslinking of defined length oligomeric DNA
primer to various MW species of TdT and b) covalent chemical linkage of Ap5A, a
newly found inhibitor, to the primer binding site. An analysis of peptides
involved in primer binding and their primary amino acid sequence together with
investigation on the mechanism of inhibition of some Ap5A analogues is expected
to provide a general geometry of the active site structure involved in substrate
and primer binding in TdT.
