A richer understanding of how populations adapt to new environments is necessary
to answer several important questions in the genetics of adaptation.
Unfortunately, the data necessary to further this work are difficult to come by
in natural populations; for example, there are only a handful of cases in which
we can identify an adaptive substitution. In microbial experimental evolution
systems, however, data on adaptive evolution are much more easily obtained. In
the bacteriophage system we are using, for example, the identity, chronology,
and fitness effects of adaptive substitutions are all known. In my dissertation
work, I am adapting several lines of an RNA bacteriophage to a new environment
and studying the nucleotide substitutions. Here, I propose to extend this work
with two new projects. The first is directly related to my dissertation
research: I would like to directly measure the fitness effects of each adaptive
substitution by measuring the growth rate of each phage genotype. The second
project asks a novel question about adaptation: is evolution constrained by
sequential epistasis, i.e., is the identity of late substitutions dependent on
the identity of early substitutions? Together, these projects will shed much
needed light on the genetics of adaptation.&lt;br/&gt;
