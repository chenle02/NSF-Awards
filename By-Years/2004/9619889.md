Project Abstract Discrete Random Structures The five-year project "Discrete
Random Structures" will enable the Principal Investigator to further consolidate
his deep involvement with undergraduate research. He will lead eight students
each year in a series of meaningful mathematical research endeavours, each
designed to convince the participants that there are undeniable links between
several sub-disciplines, and that these bonds need to be recognized and
exploited. The team-members' problems will emanate in areas such as
combinatorics, number theory, geometry, algorithms, and molecular biology, but
contemporary probabilistic methods and classical analytic techniques will be
used as integral tools in their solution. We expect that most participants will
study recently developed probabilistic techniques such as Janson's inequality;
the method of bounded and unbounded martingale differences; Talagrand's
isoperimetric inequalities; and the Stein-Chen method of Poisson approximation
in their effort to understand the concentration in measure of a wide range of
discrete structures. The participants will be selected after a nationwide
search, and will spend two months at Michigan Tech University during the Summers
of 1997--2001. Based on the PI's track record over the last seven years, it can
be predicted that the student researchers will work on an average of three
problems, either individually or in teams of two or more, and be able to make
significant progress on about two of these endeavours. The students' findings
will be presented at national meetings such as the Annual AMS/MAA Meeting, or at
a carefully selected Probability/Combinatorics conference. As in the past, every
effort will be made to submit the students' papers to high-level journals for
possible publication. We shall select students from a broad range of colleges
and universities, and are totally committed to the vigorous recruitment of
women, minorities and disabled students.
