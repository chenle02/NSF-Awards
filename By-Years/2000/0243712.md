The proposal is a request for support to help cover the costs of organizing the
2003 meeting of the Division of Particles and Fields of the American Physical
Society. It will take place from April 5-8, 2003 in Center City, Philadelphia
and on the University of Pennsylvania campus. The funds will be used entirely to
support graduate students and young scientists who otherwise could not afford to
attend the meeting.
