This project is designed to improve the physics laboratory equipment and
instrumentation at North Idaho College in support of a program to develop a
contemporary high quality physical science curriculum at the undergraduate
level. The opportunity for students' active involvement in a laboratory setting
is essential and the absence of modern equipment will adversely affect their
attitudes to physics courses. In order to provide a contemporary laboratory
capability, the equipment includes computer interface units, smart pulley system
and sonic range finder, wave analysis system, precision interferometer,
thermodynamics quantitative measurement system, equipment to measure charge to
mass ratio, Franck/Hertz critical potentials and electron diffraction, and an
electron spin resonance experimental system. The project will provide new and
revised laboratory experiments and lecture demonstrations. In addition, it will
introduce this capability across other academic disciplines and support a
program designed to improve quality of mathematics and science instruction for
local teachers in grades 7-12. The college will match the award with an equal
amount.
