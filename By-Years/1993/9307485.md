ABSTRACT 9307485 Garrison This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation
Program will assist the Department of Chemistry at Pennsylvania State University
in the purchase of a Spectroscopic Facility for chemical research. At the heart
of this facility are two argon ion laser-pumped tunable laser systems and a
triple monochrometer. Included in the research to be done with this equipment
are: 1) Effects of optical orientation on chemical equilibria and state
selective photodissociation, 2) Time resolved fluorescence studies of the
dynamics of solvation in polar fluids, 3) Resonance Raman studies of molecular
association and of solvent effects on electronic states, 4) Near infrared
surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) studies of assemblies of colloidal
monolayers of gold particles, and time-gated surface-enhanced Resonance Raman
scattering (SERRS) studies, 5) Electron and energy transfer reactions at
interfaces, 6) Plasmon-enhanced surface Raman scattering of self-assembled
monolayers. The requested instrumentation will satisfy a critical need that has
resulted from the addition of new faculty and from new research developments
within the Department of Chemistry. %%% A laser spectroscopic facility can
provide important information about molecular structure, molecular interactions
and molecular dynamics in solution and on surfaces. This sort of information is
necessary for a basic understanding of chemical reactions. ***
