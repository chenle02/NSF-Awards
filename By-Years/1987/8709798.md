The long term objective of the research is to contribute theoretical and
experimental knowledge to the field of controllable biped machines. The goal of
this research project is to use this knowledge to allow a two legged machine to
be in equilibrium with its environment, and to be capable of dynamically stable
motion. Specific research results expected from this research are: new knowledge
of the dynamics of biped stability, simulation studies of balance and motion
using a biped model, an appropriate biped control model (emphasizing concurrent
processes), biped balance algorithms, biped motion algorithms, biped reflex
algorithms, and new knowledge of the relationship between balance and motion.
These theoretical and simulation results will be validated using an experimental
biped test bed. Several methods will be investigated for attaining standing
equilibrium and in-motion stability. One of these methods involves investigating
the separation of equilibrium (or balance) from motion. If feasible, this
separation will greatly simplify motion algorithms. It is expected that a biped
model will be finalized and that a dynamically stable biped experimental machine
will be demonstrated.
