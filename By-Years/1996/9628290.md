Billard The proposal requests support for fifteen U.S-based individuals from
academic and nonprofit institutions to participate in the International
Biometric Conference to be held in Amsterdam Netherlands on July 1-5, 1996. This
is the biennial meeting of the International Biometric Society. About one-third
of those supported will be those with an official capacity and two-thirds will
be new researchers, especially those traditionally underrepresented groups such
as women and minorities. Availability of awards will be advertised in
publications of the ASA, the IMS and the Biometric Society. Awardees will be
selected by an Awards Selection Committee.
