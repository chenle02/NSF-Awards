ABSTRACT

The Fifth Conference on Function Spaces at SIUE will gather mathematicians
working in the areas of function algebras, spaces and algebras of analytic
functions, Lp-spaces, geometry of Banach spaces, and related topics. It will
provide a forum to present both the "hard" and the "soft" aspects of these
areas.

The Fifth Conference on Function Spaces will take place at the Edwardsville
campus of Southern Illinois University between May 16 and May 20 of 2006. The
function spaces is a very active research area, it attracts mathematicians with
very diverse interests who use similar methods or similar ideas in variety of
different settings. The Conference will have abroad impact on a significant
number of mathematicians by providing a forum (i) to exchange ideas between
experts, (ii) to share new discoveries, and (iii) to educated graduate students.
We expect that the Conference will attract 120-150 participants, a significant
part of whom will be graduate students; approximately one third of the
participants will be from the Midwestern states, one third from other parts of
the U.S., and the remaining one third from foreign countries; the contributors
will deliver 60-80lectures, and the proceedings will be published in the
American Mathematical Society series Contemporary Mathematics. More information
