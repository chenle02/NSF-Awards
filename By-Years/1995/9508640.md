The reproducible preparation of gold electrodes modified by bilayers containing
cytochrome c oxidase is the goal of this research project supported by the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program. These electrode surfaces will be
designed to exhibit direct electron transfer activity between the enzyme and the
gold electrode surface, and functional electron transfer mechanisms of oxidative
phosphorylation will be probed using these modified electrode surfaces. The way
in which electrons are transferred in membrane systems is of fundamental
importance to the understanding of many biochemical problems. In this project
model membrane bound protein systems will be attached to gold surfaces and the
electron transfer processes that occur in them will be extensively
characterized. This will both provide an increased understanding of biological
processes and will lay the groundwork for the rational design of electrochemical
biosensors.
