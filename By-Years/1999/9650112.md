This project involves the purchase of a gas chromatographic, Fourier-transform,
infrared Raman spectrometer for use in the undergraduate teaching laboratories.
The instrument has a modern data system which is being connected to the computer
network, allowing exposure of large numbers of students to practical modern
separations and vibrational spectroscopy. The degree of exposure and `hands-on`
use of the instrument begins at the freshman level and increases to the senior
level. The department is very excited about the possibility of initial student
contact in the freshman chemistry honors section, for which a spectroscopic
experiment on greenhouse gases is being proposed. In the organic laboratory,
students separate mixtures and identify compounds that they have synthesized.
Students in the physical chemistry laboratory carry out experiments on hydrogen
bonding that require Raman capabilities and experiments involving IR and Raman
selection rules. The inorganic chemistry students can routinely use the
instrument to study the IR and Raman spectra of a number of organometallic
complexes that they have synthesized. In the analytical laboratories, students
extract a simulated urine sample and carry out a GC/IR drug screen. Existing
university IR spectrometers cannot handle the large numbers of students or the
more sophisticated experiments proposed even at the sophomore level. However,
careful choice of experiments, efficient use of instrument time, and easy data
access through the network enables the department to expose many students to
practical, `hands-on` separations and vibrational spectroscopy.
