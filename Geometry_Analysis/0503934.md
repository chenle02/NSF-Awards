In the last two decades of development in symplectic topology since the advent
of Gromov's pseudoholomorphic curves, the method of pseudoholomorphic curves
manifested many genuinely symplectic phenomena combining tools from geometric
analysis and Hamiltonian dynamics. Floer theory and its cousin, symplectic field
theory, have emerged as a unifying force of analysis, dynamics and geometry via
the language of homological algebra. With Floer theory and the relevant analysis
of holomorphic curves as the common tools of investigation, this project centers
around the investigation of deeper aspects of symplectic topology and
Hamiltonian dynamics up to the level of the topological category. The project
also aims at the study of the moduli space of pseudoholomorphic curves, both
open and closed, beyond the well-known stable map type compactifications and its
applications to symplectic topology and to mirror symmetry through adiabatic
degeneration and the blow-up analysis. The proposed research will put the method
of pseudoholomorphic curves in symplectic topology in better perspective and
further promote the existing interactions between geometric analysis, symplectic
topology and dynamical systems. The Hamiltonian formalism played a fundamental
role not only for solving problems in classical mechanics but also for
transforming the classical mechanics into quantum mechanics. When one considers
mechanics in a constrained system, i.e., mechanics on a curved space like
`spherical pendulum' or `billiards', description of the corresponding phase
space and the differential equation requires the Hamiltonian formalism in the
context of the symplectic structure and symplectic manifolds.

In symplectic geometry, there are two aspects of study, one the dynamical aspect
and the other the geometric aspect. Understanding the interplay between the two
aspects is the core of symplectic topology. Oh's proposed research aims at
deeper understanding of symplectic topology, and of its relation to the string
theory in physics. It also aims at easing an access of new coming graduate
students and mathematicians from related fields to the results derived from Oh's
research by proposing to write a graduate level textbook on Floer theory and its
applications.
