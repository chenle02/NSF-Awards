This project involves development of 24 new or revised experiments to inject
significant elements of investigation and discovery into introductory physics
laboratories. The project is using automatic data acquisition and analysis.
Students are being guided through a series of explorations of the applicability
of simple models for describing the phenomena under study. Computer-assisted
data collection is allowing students to quickly alter initial and boundary
conditions to get a broad overview of the validity of a model. The accuracy and
precision of the data is allowing students to observe systematic departures of
the observations from the predictions of a simple model. The students are
encouraged to develop more sophisticated models to account for the observed
discrepancies and to create a plan for subjecting those models to a test. The
exercises are being packaged in electronic format using a Computer-based
Instructional Development (CID) tool. This format is designed to allow students
to find within the CID shell text, video, audio, and graphics materials that
will serve as resources for how their equipment and programs function, and as a
collection of queries and hints that will help in synthesis and discovery
activities.
