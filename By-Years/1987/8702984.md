King will continue his work on the topological properties of real algebraic
sets. The main problem he will be working on is trying to determine necessary
and sufficient conditions for a topological space to be homeomorphic to a real
algebraic set. Since many problems which arise naturally in physics and
elsewhere have solution sets with algebraic structure, it is incumbent upon
topologists to examine the properties of such sets.
