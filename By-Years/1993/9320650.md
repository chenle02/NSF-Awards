9320650 Kalos This award funds an Iris Indigo workstation to gather network
performance measurements for traffic between the Cornell University
Supercomputer Center and the three other NSF-funded supercomputer centers. The
centers have joined together to form a national Metacenter, to be linked by a
high-speed network called the National Computational Environment. The dedicated
probe platform supported by this award provides a mechanism for testing,
measuring and improving network performance over the existing and future
communication links. Duration of the award is one year. ***
