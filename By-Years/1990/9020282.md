Despite numerous systematic studies, the relationships among many species
within the dog family Canidae remain unresolved. Two areas of continued
disagreement are the wolf-like species (in the genera Canis, Cuon,Lycaon, and
Speothos) and the South American species (in 5-7 genera). Together the two
groups include some 20 species, or more than half of those within the family
Canidae. Previous work based on morphology, allozyme variation, and karyology
have failed to provide a consistent picture of relationships among these taxa.
In large part, the lack of success of the molecular analyses was due to the
close relationships among many of these species. Associations among such closely
related taxa are best studied with more fine-scale molecular analyses, such as
those based on mitochondrial DNA sequence data. Here, it is proposed to test
several specific hypotheses concerning the systematics of these taxa using
phylogenetic analysis of approximately 850 base pairs of mitochondrial DNA
sequence obtained by polymerase chain amplification (PCR) of genomic DNA.
Because the mitochondrial DNA sequence of mammals evolves quickly (5-10 times
faster than the average nuclear sequence), it is particularly appropriate for
the study of closely related species. Many of these canid species have been the
focus of comparative studies of carnivore behavior and thus resolution of their
relationships will illuminate the potential effects of ancestry on observed
patterns.
