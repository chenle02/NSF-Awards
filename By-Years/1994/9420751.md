This project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, will
continue Professor Marcus' research into the fundamental and practical aspects
of the application of radio frequency glow discharge (rf-GD) devices for the
elemental analysis of solids by atomic absorption, atomic emission, and mass
spectrometries. The primary focus of the research will involve the development
of new methods for the analysis of nonconducting solids, such as oxides, depth-
profiling of solid materials, methods for the analysis of polymer films, and the
development of glow discharge sources for the generation of metal ions for
chemical ionization mass spectrometry. This research, supported in the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, will increase our understanding of the
fundamental aspects glow discharge devices and their application as sputtering
devices and metal ion generators for use with atomic and mass spectrometries for
the analysis of solid materials.
