Each year, the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program will allow
twelve students from around the United States and twelve students from the
University of Michigan to participate in a ten week summer research program.
Students conduct research in all areas of physics; including high energy,
atomic, nuclear, condensed matter, and astrophysics. Non-Michigan students are
recruited from undergraduate programs throughout the country with a special
emphasis on students from small liberal arts colleges and historically black
institutions that, ordinarily, cannot provide this range of research
opportunities. REU students will be fully integrated into a research group that
matches their intellectual interests and work as apprentices to their faculty
mentors. The work is primarily carried out at University of Michigan facilities,
where all the resources of a large research university are available. In
addition, there is access to major experimental facilities around the world,
such as Fermilab, the Advanced Light Source at Argonne, and the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey. Research work is augmented by an extensive array of other
educational and social activities. These include shop and radiation safety
classes, a lab tour to a major facility such as Fermilab, seminars presented by
faculty on research opportunities for students, and a variety of lunches and
dinners with other students and faculty. These activities allow students to put
their research experience in a wider perspective, to build a network of
professional contacts, to and develop professional skills&lt;br/&gt;in a
scientific environment. Near the end of the project, the students present their
results to their peers and faculty mentors. These presentations may form the
basis for further activities, such as presentations at national meetings or
publications.
