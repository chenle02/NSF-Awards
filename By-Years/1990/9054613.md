Three new field-based introductory science courses are being developed and
implemented for students enrolled in American Samoa Community College:
Environmental Science 120, Marine Biology 120, and Agricultural Science 120.
Each course will be based in the islands unique tropical environment (the
tropical rain forest, ocean shore and reefs, and tropical agriculture) to give
students experience with a "living lab." Selected students will also participate
in internships after completing the courses. The project is a cooperative effort
among the ASCC Math/Science divi`sion, ASCC Land Grant Program, and American
Samoa Government department of Marine and Wildlife Resources.//
