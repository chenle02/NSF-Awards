This research addresses the problem of adjusting, or correcting, the analytical
model of a structure to agree with experimentally measured data. Typically, in
vibration modeling, models determined analytically (i.e., by the finite element
analysis (FEA) method) are compared with experimental modal analysis (EMA) data.
Numerous incompatibilities generally exist between the analytical models and the
experimentally obtained data, and the view is taken that the analytical model is
in error and must be refined and corrected based on the experimental data. This
research recognizes that the model correction problem is similar to the
statement of the eigenstructure assignment problem and pole placement problem
common to control theory. The intent here is to utilize the control theory
algorithms to solve the model correction problem by adjusting the algorithms to
take advantage of differences between EMA and FEA data. The theory developed
will be subjected to verification through tests on a number of laboratory
structures.
