Under this award, the principal investigator, Dr. Mak, will undertake several
investigations involving atmospheric dynamics. The first area is related to
cyclogenesis in the extratropics. Dr. Mak will look at what role spatial
inhomogeneity of static stability plays in cyclone or storm development.
Motivated by observational studies which show, contrary to normal assumptions,
that static stability in the basic state is quite variable, Dr. Mak will
investigate this variability and its influence on stormtrack dynamics using a
simple atmospheric model. Another topic to be investigated is the temporal
variability of the Hadley circulation and the mechanisms involved. Again,
principally using a simple model, he will explore the roles of temperature and
moisture variations on the behavior of the Hadley cell. Finally, as time allows,
the PI will continue research in which he applies a statistical technique know
as dynamical-empirical orthogonal function analysis to global data sets for the
purpose of understanding the processes responsible for intraseasonal
variability. All of these studies will contribute to understanding the nature of
the general circulation of the atmosphere.
