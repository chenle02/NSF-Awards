9403668 Wilcock The distribution and characteristics of microearthquake activity
across the Endeavor segment of the Juan de Fuca ridge will be studied by
deploying a network of 15 ocean bottom seismometers for a two month period. The
array will span the axial valley in the vicinity of the main vent field and the
western flanks out to about 15 km. The objectives of the experiment are to
characterize the distribution and nature of off- axis microearthquake activity
and to use these data to evaluate and refine existing models of the tectonic
evolution of yound oceanic crust as it moves off axis, and to estimate the depth
of the brittle-ductile transition from the maximum depth of seismicity as a
function of distance from the ridge axis. ***
