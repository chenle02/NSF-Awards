This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to commercialize a
new technology for purifying silicon for photovoltaic (PV) solar cells using a
novel oxi-nitride chemistry and cold crucible induction melting. The process,
based on upgrading low-cost metallurgical grade silicon by employing
purification strategies that have led to high purity steel products, presents a
new approach to refining silicon that eliminates melt-crucible interactions that
otherwise limit the choice of chemistry and operational temperature.

The proposed technology is projected to result in reduced capital investment,
production cost reduction, reduction in electrical energy required; and a major
reduction in potential environmentally damaging processes. The new refining
process, once successfully commercialized, will play an important role in
reducing the cost of silicon-based solar cells that still accounts for over 90%
of the PV market.
