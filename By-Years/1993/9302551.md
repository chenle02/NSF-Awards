This award supports a meeting, planned for September, 1993 in Panama City, to
bring together researchers who are interested in the study of past global
changes in the Americas. The focus of the meeting is to foster cooperative
research strategies and link with already existing initiatives to further our
understanding of dynamics of past climate change in a trans-equatorial transect.
Such coordination is urgently needed to assess global predictions of future
climate change. The outcome of the meeting will consist of documentation of an
encompassing research strategy of paleoclimate research in the Americas,
including existing and proposed research plans and possible international
cooperation strategies for their implementation.
