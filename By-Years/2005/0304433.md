The focus of this NIRT project on Investigating Nano-carbon Particles in the
Atmosphere: Formation and Transormation is to gain a clearer understanding of
the chemical and physical processes occurring in the formation of carbon
nanoparticles and their subsequent transformation in the diesel engine exhaust.
The project has three thrust areas: (1) development of theoretical and
experimental methodologies to describe the formation of heavier hydrocarbons and
particle inception; (2) modeling and measurement of the particle size
distribution of nanoparticles formed in combustion and diesel exhaust; and (3)
modeling of the optical properties of soot precursors an soot as it ages. This
project includes a collaboration with the University of Naples, Italy. The
Italian investigators will contribute to this activity by several measurements
including optical measurements in flames, and conagulation models.
