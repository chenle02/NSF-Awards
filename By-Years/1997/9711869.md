9711869 Schmitt This award to Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in
Massachusetts supports the development, jointly with industry partner Falmouth
Scientific Incorporated, of new, relatively high-precision and inexpensive
sensors for the long-term, unattended measurement of ocean salinity, temperature
and pressure. It is anticipated that this new class of sensor will be deployed
on multi-year drifting buoys to investigate large-scale ocean circulation
problems and refine models of ocean circulation and climate. The award includes
a substantial cost-share commitment by Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, and
is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation Program and the Division of
Ocean Sciences. ***
