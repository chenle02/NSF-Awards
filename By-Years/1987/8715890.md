This action would provide funds for participants of the Advanced Study
Institute on Techniques and Concepts of High Energy Physics to be held July
14-25, 1988. Four sessions of the Institute were held in 1980, 1982, 1984 and
1986. The primary goal of the Institute is to present material both in
experimental techniques and in phenomenology at a level appropriate for superior
young experimental physicists. Proceedings of the previous Institute have been
published and the plan is to publish those from the present Institute. Nine
lecturers, recognized for their achievements and scholarship, have been invited.
