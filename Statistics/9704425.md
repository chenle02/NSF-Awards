NSF DMS-9704425 Non-Stationary Models for Spatial Statistics and Bayesian Image
Analysis. David Higdon Duke University Abstract: This research develops
anisotropic spatial models for fully Bayesian inference with applications to
data which are correlated over space and time. Two distinct directions are
taken. First, in continuation of previous research, Markov random field priors
for lattices are considered for modeling processes with occasional large shifts
in level. Second, using a constructive convolution approach, continuous models
are developed that allow non-stationarity and correlation structure that can
vary over space (and/or time). Using such models for inference requires that one
account for uncertainty about just how flexible or varying such models are. A
key part of the research is developing methods which incorporate this source of
uncertainty in the statistical analysis. Statistical modeling of phenomena that
evolve over space and possibly time is critical in areas such as medical
imaging, environmental monitoring, and detecting changes over time in global
climate. Most spatial models in statistics assume that over a given area, the
underlying properties of a spatial (and possibly temporal as well) pattern
remain unchanged over the region. Though this is a useful simplification over
limited regions, on a larger scale such an assumption often results in an
unsatisfactory model. This research will develop statistical models that account
for abrupt changes in the nature of the spatial phenomenon. Also, models will be
developed that allow properties of the spatial process to evolve over spatial
location. This research will lead to more realistic models for large scale
spatial and spatio-temporal phenomena. Fitting these models to large datasets
will require a substantial computing effort and will likely rely high
performance computing resources. Applications in global ocean climate change,
agriculture, genetics, and medical imaging will be considered.
