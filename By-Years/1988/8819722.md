The distinction that once separated the nervous and endocrine system is
becoming increasingly blurred. Attention is now being focused on hormones as
neuromodulators. Since neurons communicate by means of neurotransmitters
released at the synaptic terminals, it is important to examine how hormones
interact with or modulate this process. Dr. Raible is examining this
relationship. She has found that a neuropeptide, alpha- melanocyte stimulating
hormone (MSH), produces both a short term (same day) and long term (one week
later) inhibition of steroid- induced reproductive behavior. Interestingly, MSH,
which is released during cervical stimulation, is thought to be involved in the
induction of pseudopregnancy. Dr. Raible will systematically examine the role of
ovarian steroid hormones (estrogen, progesterone) and the neurotransmitter,
serotonin, in mediating the inhibitory effects of MSH. These results will
increase our knowledge of hormone-neurotransmitter-peptide interactions in
modulating reproductive states. Elucidating the physiological mechanisms
underlying the inhibition of reproductive behavior will lead to a better
understanding of infertility and, thus, contribute to the development of
successful methods of treatment.
