This study will look at the difficulties that arise in defining appropriate
medical technologies for four different types of organizations: non-profit
foundations, multilateral United Nations-based organizations, bilateral aid
organizations such as the United States Agency for International Development,
and government contractors. This project will examine how recipients in
developing countries have historically actively contested and negotiated the
definition of appropriate technology. It will explore their role as designers of
some of the technologies and the policies advocating for their adoption. This
project will consider how technology transfer in foreign aid often affects women
differently than men, specifically when looking at small-scale everyday health
technologies. It will be of interest to development workers, citizens and
policymakers because it could contribute to ensuring that development
technologies are appropriate.

From its inception, the study of development and modernization has been bound
up with questions of technology. Development critics often point to the over-use
of certain technologies or the unavailability of others. Yet underlying these
claims is the assumption that there must be a more appropriate level of
technology that would lead to better economic and social development. This study
will explore what makes a given technology appropriate. It will use oral history
interviews, archival materials, and participant observation at the sites of
current-day health technology projects in South Africa and Zimbabwe. Through
this work, this study will consider how historical precedents have and have not
carried through development practice in the modern day and will inform
development professionals and policymakers of the specific ways in which the use
of health technologies in foreign aid work have impacted the communities they
intend to serve.
