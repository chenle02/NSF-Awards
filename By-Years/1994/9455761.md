Integrated circuits, and the computers they drive, introduced a new era in
electronics. Each year faster, more powerful computers are produced increasing
the demand for a skilled work force and an educated public. Increasing an
awareness about manufacturing processes in the semiconductor and computer
industries is an educational challenge_one which is hindered by the loss of
visual imagery due to the inaccessibility of industrial sites to students,
educators and the public. The SILICON RUN two-part series addresses this
educational challenge by capturing the rich images of manufacturing on
film/video to provide a clear overview of semiconductor and computer
manufacturing. SILICON RUN I, produced in 1986, explores crystal growth, the
effects of doping, CMOS transistors, and the design and fabrication of IC
wafers. The recently completed SILICON RUN II continues with testing, packaging,
printed circuit board and system assembly, and multi-chip module technology. The
series is being used for education and training; thousands of students in
universities, colleges and technical schools are viewing these films/videos
every year. The many changes in technology since the completion of SILICON RUN I
make it necessary to update the first film with the production of SILICON RUN
I.2. The goal of this project is to re-film the industrial manufacturing footage
so the series can continue providing students with viable information about
today's manufacturing. Responses from recipients' surveys overwhelmingly show
that the series is an asset to undergraduate education.
