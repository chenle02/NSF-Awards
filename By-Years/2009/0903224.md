The Synergy Collaborative Laboratory for Research, Practice and Transformation
builds on research on scale up and diffusion of innovation to create and grow a
national network of expertise to help projects and centers realize potential
scale and impact. An ongoing academy of thought leaders identifies and
aggregates challenges and successful practices in achieving scale and impact of
ATE initiatives. Professional growth and team development workshops using a
problem-based learning format are created and implemented to research and
develop the competencies necessary to help a broad range of initiatives in the
ATE program achieve scale. A knowledge management system is created and
implemented to support the capturing and disseminating of the knowledge and
expertise resulting from individual efforts in achieving scale. Assessment tools
and appropriate processes are developed and tested to measure progress in
achieving scale along the various stages of the continuum from aspiring to
understanding to implementing to coaching others. Formative evaluation provides
guidance to the project and summative evaluation measures the success of
projects bringing innovations to scale. Sustainability is defined in terms of
the ongoing use of the activities to bring projects to scale.
