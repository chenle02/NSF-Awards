This collaborative project will study the structural and stratigraphic
evolution of the Pliocene-Quaternary Loreto Basin, which lies along the margin
of the Gulf of California in Baja California Sur. A transform-rift system
beginning at 5Ma formed the Loreto and related basins but they have not been
studied in detail until now, despite good exposure and accessibility.
Magnetostratigraphy will be combined with radiometric dating of four tuffs and
paleontological data of other workers to give good chronostratigraphic control
of the basin's evolution. These data will permit investigation of the role of
growth structures on the stratigraphic geometries in the basin. The results will
resolve major outstanding problems in the tectonics of the Gulf of California,
and will have important implications for the tectonics of obliquely-rifted
margins in general.
