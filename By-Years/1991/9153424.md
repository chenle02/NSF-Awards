This project evolved from Georgia Institute of Technology's FUTURESCAPE
initiative, an effort initiated in 1985 which has served more than 3,000 girls
by using professional and undergraduate role models as the primary agents for
changing girls' attitudes about science and mathematics. In this project, a
series of activities have been developed to raise the aspirations, confidence,
and preparation of young girls in science and mathematics. These include: (1)
the K*I*D*S Club open to girls, ages 9 through 12, which provides activities
designed to enhance interest in science; and (2) a Tech Summer Academy, a two-
week summer enrichment program for rising 9th and 10th grade girls, to provide
opportunities for academic enrichment and peer support.
