Internet. D'Youville College is an independent liberal arts institution in
Western New York with nearly 2000 graduate and undergraduate students. The

Internet service provider. The campus needs the Internet connection to be able
to access information resources throughout the state, the nation and the world.
The connection will benefit the faculty, staff students of this institution as
well as the community in general. The award provides partial support of the
project for two years.
