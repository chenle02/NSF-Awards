A broad program of research in theoretical gravitational physics will continue
at the University of California, Santa Barbara. This effort will touch most
theoretical aspects of gravitational physics. In classical gravitation this
group will study gravitational collapse, the generation of gravitational waves,
the dynamics of black holes, and tests of general relativity. In cosmology,
continued studies of possible quantum initial conditions for the universe will
correlate observations today on large, and perhaps even small scales. In quantum
gravity, fundamental studies of string theory, topological quantum field theory,
and wormholes, will be continued.
