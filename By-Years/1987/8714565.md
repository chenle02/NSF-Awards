Today, geometric data and geometric structures are used in almost all branches
of science, if only in the display of results and data. In the majority of the
applications, the geometric data is inherently degenerate in the sense that it
is very different from data obtained in a random fashion. Unfortunately,
degenerate configurations often bring about serious robustness and correctness
problems for computer programs that manipulate the data. The two main reasons
for this weakness of current software are the bizarre structure of the space of
degeneracies and the accuracy problems that arise if we attempt to detect and
classify degenrate configurations. This research is a systematic study of
degeneracy in geometric data that spans the investigation of its combinatorial
structure, the computational complexity of determining degeneracy, and - most
importantly - systematic ways to cope with degenerate data.
