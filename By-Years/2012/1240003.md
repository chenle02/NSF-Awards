North Carolina State University is providing 14 new scholarships to academically
talented mathematics majors through the Noyce Mathematics Education Teaching
Scholars II (METS II) program while continuing to monitor 24 current Noyce (METS
I) scholars funded from a previous Noyce award. Modeled after the very
successful METS I program, the METS II program is providing scholarships for six
new undergraduate scholars, some of whom are recruited by encouraging existing
Mathematics Education majors to pursue a double degree in Mathematics or
Statistics. The Noyce METS II program also is recruiting eight STEM
professionals and encouraging them to enroll in one of three masters programs
that lead to a mathematics teaching license. Scholars are servicing surrounding
high-needs schools in North Carolina including those in Wake, Johnston, Orange,
Granville and Lee counties. The program is designed to purposefully develop
strong content knowledge, pedagogical content knowledge and specialized
mathematical knowledge for teaching. In part, the project manifests this by
including compulsory observational hours in high-needs schools, using double
degree programs with compulsory mathematics-rich curricula, using instructional
coaches and implementing a mandatory 1-credit hour structured seminar course.
The evaluation of the Noyce METS program also is identifying strategies that
lead to attracting, preparing and retaining diverse, high-quality secondary
mathematics teachers.
