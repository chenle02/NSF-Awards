Graduate student Paul Kemp proposes to study the relationship between tissue
and shell growth in gastropods, using a combination of shell morphometrics,
computer modelling and controlled growth experiments. Based on his published
undergraduate thesis, Kemp hypothesizes that variations in the growth rate of
body tissue has a profound effect on the both the thickness and coiling geometry
of the snail's shell. In that study, Kemp found striking shell differences
within a species that differed principally in food supply. He proposes to raise
populations at varying levels of food and calcium in the substrate. The project
has broad implications not only for systematic practices among gastropod
workers, but for the integration of biological and morphometric studies.
Systematists will gain new insight into the direct effects of environemntal
conditions on those characteristics often used to distinguish species. Paul Kemp
is a quadriplegic. The proposal requests a specially modified microcomputer-
based image analysis system. This award will support a valuable dissertation
research project, allow Mr. Kemp to pursue a career in research, and aid in the
design and development of research equipment for spine-injured scientists.
