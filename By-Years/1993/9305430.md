The main objective of this research is the study of computational and
constructive aspects of orthogonal polynomials. Special attention is to be given
to the development and analysis of constructive methods for generating
orthogonal polynomials of Sobolev type, i.e., polynomials that are orthogonal
with respect to an inner product involving derivatives. These have originally
been introduced to approximate functions and their derivative simultaneously,
and have since received a considerable amount of attention but largely from
approximation-theoretic and algebraic points of view and with little regard to
computational aspects. Other topics to be considered involve the question of
computing polynomials orthogonal relative to a Hermite weight on a finite
interval and the analysis of the remainder terms of special quadrature rules.
Orthogonal polynomials are basic tools of approximation. They provide orthogonal
expansions and least square approximations to functions and contribute to a
variety of quadrature processes. In addition they are used extensively in the
numerical solution of ordinary differential equations and in the application of
iterative methods for solving systems of linear algebraic equations.
