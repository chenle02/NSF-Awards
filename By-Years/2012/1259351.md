This project is providing financial, academic, and peer support of high-need
STEM majors who, because they desire both to be trained as a professional
scientist or mathematician and seek a career in teaching, are traditionally
marginalized by the culture of the research university. The project is enabling
these talented students to give back to the community, to make a difference, and
to serve as a steppingstone for graduate school as appropriate to each
individual S-STEM Scholar. A robust assessment and evaluation plan includes
longitudinal data that will assess the impact of research experiences and
mentorships on a teacher's classroom practices and its subsequent effect on
motivating the teacher's students to purse STEM education and careers. The
assessment is also establishing the effect of the mentoring experience on
graduate students' confidence and success in entering academic positions in
higher education.

As a scientist or mathematician, each S-STEM Scholar adds one person to the
workforce; as STEM teacher, each S-STEM Scholars can inspire many students to
pursue STEM careers. The scholarships are reducing unmet financial need, thereby
enabling S-STEM Scholars to concentrate on course-work during the academic year,
to pursue strategies to shorten time-to-degree, to have time to engage in
meaningful near-peer mentoring activities, and to participate in a variety of
professional networking opportunities. The project is devoting equal resources
to continuing UCLA students and to students completing their final years after
transferring to UCLA from a 2-year school.
