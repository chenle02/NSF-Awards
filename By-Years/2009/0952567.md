Alternate Reality Games (ARGs) are a new genre of interactive experience that
requires players to collaborate in order to solve problems using the real world
as a narrative platform. The goal of this project is to understand and tailor
this new genre for use as (1) an engaging educational activity that provides
hands-on experience using a range of collaborate technologies and computational
strategies, and (2) a platform on which to co-design and evaluate novel
collaborative tools that may be used in unanticipated ways. The proposed work is
unconventional and high risk, yet could lead to significant payoffs. Success in
the knowledge economy requires that students develop strong instincts and
expertise in applying cooperative technologies and tools to effectively collect
multimedia data, make sense of it, and use it to solve practical and challenging
problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this project will
produce broader impacts that focus on recruitment and retention of science,
technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) students. ARGs have the
potential to attract a wide variety of students from diverse socio-technical
backgrounds, as well as introduce scientific and mathematical problems (e.g.,
puzzles) in non-traditional ways.&lt;br/&gt;
