EAR-0437642&lt;br/&gt;Farmer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will fund a
workshop that will bring thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS) users and
instrument designers together to discuss the needs of the TIMS geoscience
community and to jointly develop a plan for fostering and disseminating
innovation in TIMS instrumentation and related analytical techniques. There has
never been a workshop convened in the USA with the sole intent of discussing the
near and far term needs for TIMS in the earth sciences. The intent of the
workshop is to construct a road map, set out in a whitepaper developed from
workshop discussions, for TIMS development in the USA and to forge new
relationships between traditionally isolated groups of scientists with common
interests.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
