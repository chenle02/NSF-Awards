The Interactive Calculus Laboratory consists of a network of NeXT workstations
running Mathematica. Students are learning calculus by experimenting
symbolically and graphically with fundamental concepts, concentrating less on
routine calculations, and thinking more about underlying principles and
graphical realizations. The NeXT workstations facilitate the use of Mathematica
by their simple user interface, their l5- MIPS speed, their high resolution
screens, their ancillary software', and their networking features.
