Data is presented suggesting that Slow Component a (SCa) of axonal transport
involves the movement along microtubules of an insoluble complex of tubulin,
neurofilament, spectrin, and other proteins. These structures have been given
the provision acronym "SCAPs." The goal of this research is to gain a fuller
understanding of these structures. The protein composition of highly purified
SCAPs will be analyzed by routine biochemical and immunochemical approaches. A
microtubule-stimulated ATPase is present in SCAP preparations, which appears to
be responsible for the in vitro phenomenon of microtubular gelation-contraction.
This ATPase activity will be characterized biochemically, with the goal of
identifying and understanding the action of the enzyme(s) involved. The
properties of this ATPase activity and its relationship to microtubule gelation-
contraction in vitro (and possibly to SCAP movement in vivo) will be analyzed.
These experiments will provide significant new information relevant to the
validity of the hypothesis that SCa involves the translocation of SCAPs along
microtubules.
