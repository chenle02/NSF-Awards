This dissertation is a study of Japanese youth culture. It focuses on the
relationship of societal opportunities provided by education to commitment to
academic performance in a sample of vocational and regular high school students
from different socioeconomic backgrounds. Two methods of collecting data will be
employed. Students and their mothers will be surveyed on their values, and a
qualitative observation will focus on lifestyles of the two high school groups.
This study will provide data that may be useful in encouraging academic
performance among American high school students.
