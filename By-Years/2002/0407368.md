AST-0407368&lt;br/&gt;Burns&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will use
synthetic observations applied to detailed, high-resolution simulations of
cosmological structure formation to focus on three specific problems that may
hinder progress with surveys of the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect (SZE). First, the
transient boosting of a cluster's SZE signature due to cluster mergers may
significantly complicate comparison of observed clusters to cosmological models.
Second, measurement of cluster masses may introduce both systematic errors and
bias. Finally, internal flows act as a contaminant to measurements of cluster
peculiar velocities through the kinetic SZE, but are themselves an interesting
observable. To maximize the impact of this research, all simulation results, in
their entirety, will be available for use by the scientific community through
the Simulated Cluster Archive. Research projects will be generated to involve
undergraduate astrophysics majors, and the investigators will partner with an
area high school via a university initiative that targets under-represented
groups.
