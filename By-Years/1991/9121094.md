Associative learning is one of the basic processes of knowledge acquisition,
and one that is generally recognized to be central to the scientific
understanding of human memory and cognition. Dr. Wagner's research follows in an
approach to characterizing the fundamental mechanisms involved that is shared by
a substantial group of investigators, namely the use of a simple, experimentally
well-controllable instance of associative learning about which a great deal of
supporting behavioral and biological information is available (in this case,
Pavlovian-like eyeblink conditioning in the rabbit), and the attempted
development of a quantitative, "neural-network" account of the regularities
observed. The focus of Dr. Wagner's research at this juncture is on the manner
in which associative learning appears to involve distinguishable emotional and
non-emotional components that, although experimentally separable, may generally
interact, with emotional associations having the effect of modulating the
behavioral consequences of non-emotional associations. Studies are aimed at
providing a better understanding of the conditions under which such modulation
does or does not occur, the consequences it may have for observing related basic
phenomena of learning such as "long-term habituation," where in the stimulus-
response processing sequence it is effected, and whether it is limited to the
modulation of performance, as has been observed, or includes the modulation of
associative learning as well. The answers to these questions are very basic to
providing a computational neurobiological theory of associative learning.
