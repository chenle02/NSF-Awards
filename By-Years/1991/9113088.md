The purpose of this proposal is to being together robust control and algebraic
topology. It is argued that such robust control issues as structured singular
values, multivariable phase margin, Kharitonov's theorem, etc. receive their
natural and unifying formulation in the context of algebraic topology, as
formulated by Poincare, Cartan, Eilenberg, and many others. The central
mathematical issue is whether the mapping of the high dimensional manifold of
structured uncertainties into the Nyquist template commutes with the boundary.
While in the simple Kharitonov case it does, in the over-whelming majority of
situations the Nyquist mapping does not commute with the boundary. However, the
simplicial approximation theorem provides us with an approximate Nyquist map
that does commute with the boundary. Fast implementation of the simplicial
approximation theorem opens the road to a variety of fast, "simplicial"
algorithms. Finally, performing some algebra on the simplicial approximation
yield the "topography" of the stability boundary, that can be very complicated.
