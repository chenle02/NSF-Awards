The University of Illinois will receive a planning grant for an evaluative
study of the nine NSF Middle School Teacher Preparation Projects. These five-
year projects were funded in 1986 as the result of a special program
solicitation targeting the preparation of teachers of mathematics and science
for the middle school level. These projects have prepared a new generation of
middle school teachers, have created courses and materials for middle school
teacher preparation, and have greatly added to our knowledge base about the
preparation of middle school mathematics and science teachers. Therefore, it is
important that these projects be carefully documented and evaluated, and the
results be disseminated. This planning grant will immediately begin to lay the
groundwork for the evaluation activities while the projects are still active.
