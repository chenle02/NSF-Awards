9726458 Allen This project aims to investigate a variety of basic materials
issues in thin films and at interfaces, e.g., coalescence during initial stages
of film growth, silicide formation with restricted dimensions, and dimensional
stability and reflow of aluminum nanostructures through the use of a recently
developed nanocalorimetry technique. The proposed research seeks new insights
into effects of particle/cluster/island size and of surfaces in stability and
kinetics of materials, and to reveal new information about behavior of materials
at nanometer length scales. %%% The project addresses basic research issues in a
topical area of materials science having high technological relevance. The
research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a fundamental
level to important aspects of electronic/photonic materials. The fundamental
knowledge and understanding gained from the research is expected to contribute
to improving the performance and stability of advanced devices and circuits by
providing a fundamental understanding and a basis for designing and producing
improved materials, and materials combinations. An important feature of the
program is the integration of research and education through the training of
students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area. ***
