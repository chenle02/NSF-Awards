Handing dynamics has long since been a unique challenge in wireless network
resource management. While the accelerated proliferation of smartphones and
tablets has drawn considerable attention to the issue of efficient wireless
resource management, the problem actually gets further exacerbated, resulting in
inferior application performance at massive scale and negative societal impact
to a larger user base. The objective of this project is to establish a solid
theoretical foundation for wireless resource management that handles dynamics in
its core design. It is based on a novel time-scale decomposition approach, in
which dynamics play the foundational role in the clean-slate formulation of a
new resource management optimization framework. Through diverse educational
efforts and channels, including course development, on-line education systems,
research and outreach programs, this project will reach a diverse group of
students, influence and inspire them with inter-disciplinary thinking and enrich
them with hands-on experiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will establish
a significant step towards the relief of "wireless data network congestion"
problem. The results from this project will enrich and transform the field of
wireless resource management from heuristic adaptations of static solutions into
one that is oriented towards wireless network dynamics. In addition to the
traditional knowledge distribution channel such as academic publications, this
project will also disseminate its results through distribution of software
packages and the collected network traces. The impact of this project will also
be demonstrated in a remote medical care system.
