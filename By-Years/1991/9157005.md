This Presidential Young Investigator Award is aimed at the synthesis and
characterization of new solid state materials with interesting electrical
properties, and will include a study of inorganic polymers. Characterization
will stress the relationship between structure and ionic or electronic
conduction, and novel properties will be achieved by structural modification.
