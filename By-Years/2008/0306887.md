Abstract:

The project will provide support for travel by US-based scientists to the XIV
International Congress on Mathematical Physics (ICMP) to be held at the
University of Lisbon, Portugal, July 28 - August 2, 2003. The ICMP conference is
organized every three years and covers all areas of Mathematical Physics. In
this area, it is the single most important event of its kind. The outstanding
list of plenary speakers and the subjects of the topical sessions represent all
traditional as well as some novel areas of mathematical physics.

The grant will allow approximately twenty researchers from the US to attend the
conference. In addition, partial support is provided for six invited lecturers
to the Young Researchers Symposium, which is being organized in conjunction with
the Congress.

A panel of eight experts from various areas of mathematical physics will review
applications for support from the grant. Preference will be given to young
researchers (postdocs and advanced graduate students).
