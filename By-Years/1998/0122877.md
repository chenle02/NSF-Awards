This project addresses variability of the tropical diurnal tide in the
mesosphere on timescales of the intraseasonal, or Madden-Julian Oscillation
(MJO, approximately 30-60 days) and the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO,
approximately 2-10 years). Low-latitude medium frequency (MF) radar wind
measurements suggest that diurnal tide amplitudes are modulated on intraseasonal
(IS) and interannual time scales. The propagating diurnal tides are a strong
agent of coupling between the tropical troposphere and the upper atmosphere.
Thus, if the forcing of tropospheric diurnal tides undergoes systematic, large-
scale variations on MJO and ENSO time scales, such variability may be
transmitted into the upper atmosphere by means of the tide's vertical
propagation at low latitudes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tropical radars at Kauai
(22 degrees N, 159 degrees W) and at Rarotonga (22 degrees S, and 160 degrees W)
are uniquely situated with almost perfect symmetry around the equator. These are
key locations for monitoring the structure and temporal variability of the
diurnal tide, since they are near the latitude where the tidal wind amplitude
maximizes. In addition to supporting scientific analyses of tidal variability,
this project will provide operational support for the tropical radars. The
operational support includes maintenance, system upgrades, minor repairs and
data archival. We anticipate that this support would allow the radars to operate
continuously, reliably and with enhanced capability for the duration of the
TIMED mission.
