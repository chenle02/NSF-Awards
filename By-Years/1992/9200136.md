This award provides funds to the Department of Environmental Sciences at the
University of Virginia to establish a research program for undergraduates where
basic principles of ecology will be taught, and the methods by which scientists
increase our understanding of the natural will be detailed. Two major objectives
will be to: 1) teach students that science is a process of acquiring evidence
and making inference, and not a collection of immutable facts; and 2) increase
the ecological and environmental literacy of scientists, professionals, and
policy makers. The program will include a diversity of students in terms of
their interests, backgrounds, and career goals--participants will be recruited
from the hundreds of colleges/universities in the mid- Atlantic area. The focus
of the program is on testing hypotheses related to plant-animal interactions, a
topic of considerable basic and applied interest, and one that has considerable
heuristic value. Students will conduct research in a field-station setting at
the Blandy Experimental Farm, a biological field station of the University of
Virginia, and will be immersed in a community of 15 to 20 graduate/post-doctoral
researchers. Field trips will focus on issues related to conservation; a weekly
seminar series at the Farm will also add to the research experience. Faculty
wages, and fees for laboratory space and dorm rooms will be contributed as cost
share items.
