The proposed research encompasses three problem areas whose common feature is
the prominent role played by singular perturba- tion theory. The first area
deals with boundary-value problems for differential-difference equations. The
goal is to initiate an in-depth study of representative classes of problems of
mixed type (involving both positive and negative shifts) and problems with small
delays. The second area concerns singularly perturbed integral equations. The
emphasis will be on problems whose solu- tions involve boundary and interior
layer phenomena. Various classes of kernels will be considered including those
with singu- lar behavior. Finally, the third problem area involves a study of
certain nonlinear elliptic partial differential equations. Of particular
importance is the sensitivity of singular points such as bifurcation and limit
points to a small perturbation of the domain. The latter work has important
application to elastic structures and to tubular chemical reactors.
