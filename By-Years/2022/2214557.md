Should government regulators, particularly those that supervise financial
institutions, be subject to the whims of politicians, who might demand actions
in their personal or partisan interests, or should regulators operate
independent of politicians in the short run? Independent regulators are
appointed by politicians to accomplish tasks defined by legislatures but can
only be fired for “good cause,” which means that the regulators serve their
terms in office as long as they fulfill their duties and do not violate the law.
Today, regulatory independence is the norm. It forms a cornerstone of the
financial system. All federal agencies that regulate banks, like the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation and Federal Reserve System, operate independently.
Questions, however, have been raised about the effectiveness and
constitutionality of regulatory independence. The effectiveness of regulatory
independence is difficult to study today. So, we study historical analogies,
particularly during the Progressive Era, when U.S. state governments
experimented with the structure of regulatory agencies and transitioned from
politically independent to politically dependent regulators. To assess the
impact of these political experiments, we gather new data that will allow
scholars to better understand the history of the Progressive Era and the impact
of government intervention on the financial system and rest of the
economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will examine how political control
of bank supervision affected financial institutions and firms, and how financial
and political instability contributed to the spread of political polarization
during the Progressive Era. To answer these questions, the project will build a
new dataset on business and bank foundation and failure rates by state and
quarter from the 1890s through the 1930s as well as the aggregate liabilities
and assets of these institutions. The project will also build a new dataset on
the structure of financial regulation in the 50 states. This information will be
merged with existing data on politics, political structures, voting by the
public and political representatives, and the state of the national and local
economies. The new dataset will advance knowledge of the Progressive Era,
lifting a veil on relationships between economics and politics that existing
data obscures. The data will also advance knowledge related to current policy
debates, particularly the optimal design of institutions regulating financial
institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
