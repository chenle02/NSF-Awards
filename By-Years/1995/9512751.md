9512751 Frankel Recent technological advances in genetic techniques have now
made it possible to begin to analyze the biology of complex mammalian traits.
The aim of this conference is to bring together researchers with knowledge of
different complex trait systems to formulate ideas for defining a realistic
strategy for advancing this emerging field. The Jackson Laboratory, a renowned
center for genetic research, which will be the site of the workshop. The
organization of the workshop will offer the opportunity for the participants to
engage in discussions concerning the latest technologies, their own work using
these methods, and the potential impact of complex trait analysis on the field
of Developmental Biology and Neuroscience.
