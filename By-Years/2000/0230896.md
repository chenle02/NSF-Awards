Musical acoustics, or "Physics of Music" courses present an opportunity for
physics departments to address undergraduate scientific literacy. We are
developing a series of software tools called Virtual Labs that guide students
through basic concepts in acoustics. These Virtual Labs capture the dynamic
nature of music and sound by permitting visualization of acoustical phenomena.
In addition, our design for Virtual Labs permit an inquiry-driven analysis of
the science of sound by enabling sophisticated manipulations on data students
have acquired, without resorting to a "black-box"
approach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The labs are inquiry-driven and are designed to
promote active learning. The structure of each lab session is built around peer
instruction. We have designed a three-tiered evaluation scheme that enables us
to measure how much the students learn, both over the semester and during each
class. Our evaluation plan determines how much learning is attributable to the
Virtual Labs. Dissemination of results is provided to colleagues and educators
via the National Science Digital Library, online notes, journal publication,
commercial web sites and in talks given at AAPT meetings&lt;br/&gt;
