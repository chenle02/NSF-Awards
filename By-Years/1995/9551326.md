This project modifies the existing biochemistry laboratory with the improvement
and addition of experiments in enzymology that provide students with a
laboratory experience similar to one they might experience in a research
environment. The addition of two instruments, a kinetic plate reader and a UV-
visible spectrophotometer, to the biochemistry laboratory is allowing the
students to perform three complete enzyme isolations in which they can collect
kinetic and protein concentration data rapidly at every step to determine the
extent of purification. They can also determine the kinetic properties of three
different enzymes using rapid analytical techniques so they can collect a
significant amount of useful data and also have time to adjust experimental
conditions and to correct mistakes. In particular, the addition of the kinetic
plate reader provides the means to use a unique two-dimensional method of enzyme
and protein analysis in the teaching laboratory. This new two-dimensional method
not only greatly decreases time required for data collection but also provides
rapid and clear visualization of experimental results. The time savings provides
the additional advantage of having the instructor available to help the students
with data interpretation prior to leaving laboratory. This equipment enables the
students to perform a number of meaningful experiments so that they can become
acquainted with the techniques and use of modern, computer controlled
instrumentation.
