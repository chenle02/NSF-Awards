The goal of this project is to develop new saddlepoint theory and methods,
branching into areas not attacked in any depth to date. In particular, attention
will be directed toward the use of saddlepoint approximations in the analysis of
sample survey data, to saddlepoint expansions for resampling problems, and to
saddlepoint expansions for a general quadratic form to be used in constructing
confidence regions for nonparametric function estimation. For many modern
statistical techniques employing sophisticated and often complicated estimators,
there is an important technical difficulty in assessing the accuracy and
precision of statistical estimators. For example, complex surveys yield data
which usually require complicated mathematical forms for estimators of the
quantities of interest. Making a clear statement about the amount of variability
inherent in the estimation process is hindered by the intractability of the
exact distributions of these estimators. Close approximations may replace these
distributions; this work will utilize saddlepoint theory to develop such
satisfactory approximate distributions.
