A 10M Submillimeter Wavelength Telescope (SMT) will be constructed on Mt.
Graham, in southeastern Arizona. It is being constructed jointly by the
University of Arizona and the Max- Planck-Institute fur Radioastronomie in Bonn,
Germany. The telescope utilizes reflecting precision replicated Carbon-Fiber
Reinforced-Plastic (CFRP) panels. The nature of the reflecting surfaces and the
improved telescope enclosure will allow operations during daytime.
