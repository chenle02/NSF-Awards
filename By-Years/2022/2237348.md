Nowadays, hundreds of millions of human users use the world wide web every day.
These users generate tremendous amounts of data related to all aspects of life
and contain a lot of information about local societies, human activities, and
social behavior. By nature, such human-generated data have a spatial aspect, as
the geographic location is inherent in many human activities. This makes such
data a rich and up-to-date source for social scientists to study different
aspects of modern societies to improve peopleâ€™s life. However, the excessive
amount of such data makes it computationally challenging to process complex
analyses and extract meaningful insights at a large scale. The project innovates
new technology to analyze spatial aspects of user-generated data at a large
scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project innovates novel scalable data
management techniques, especially query processing techniques, to support
spatial data science on large user-generated datasets. The project supports two
families of queries that are widely used for spatial analysis of user-generated
data: spatial estimation queries and spatial grouping queries. The proposed
research on spatial estimation includes learning-assisted modules that
incorporate machine learning models to improve spatial scalability and accuracy.
The proposed research on spatial grouping scales up the grouping of various
spatial data types, including points, lines, and polygons, to provide a variety
of building blocks that support various applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
