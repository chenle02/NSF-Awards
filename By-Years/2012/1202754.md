Testing and developing new tools for analyses of phylogenomic data to resolve
the tree of life

Resolving rapid radiations in the tree of life is a major challenge of
evolutionary biology. Advances in next-generation sequencing technology aim at
ameliorating this challenge by expanding the amount of sequence data available
for each species. The incorporation of next-generation sequencing into current
phylogenetic approaches requires innovative methods of analysis. This project
will develop new models for the analysis of next generation sequence data with
the aim of resolving the phylogenetic relationships of rapid radiations. The use
of complex and realistic simulations will test current and new phylogenetic
models for the efficacy of analyzing next-generation data. Simulation studies
will provide the benchmarks for next-generation phylogenetic study design.

Training objectives include developing expertise in mathematical modeling, data
simulation, and bioinformatics. Educational outreach includes mentoring of
undergraduate and graduate students in biological sciences and creation of
public exhibits in the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture. Broader
impacts include development of open-source software tools and incorporation of
new models into existing programs such as BEAST, BEAGLE, and RevBayes.
Dissemination of results will occur through peer-reviewed publication in open-
access journals, presentations at scientific meetings, and all data will be made
publicly available.
