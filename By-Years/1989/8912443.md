Several problems involving viscous flow near solid boundaries will be simulated
numerically using molecular dynamics calculations. The effect of various wall
rigidities and thermal properties will be investigated. In addition, lubricating
layers, wetting films, and the motion of phase-change boundaries over a solid
surface, both rough and smooth, will be simulated. The molecular dynamics
approach is a semi-microscopic simulation of near-surface phenomena, and bridges
the gap between microscopic and continuum theories. The justification for
various boundary conditions used in continuum models will be clarified.
