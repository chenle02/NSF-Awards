EIA-0103215&lt;br/&gt;Lydia Sohn&lt;br/&gt;Princeton
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nano Exploratory Research: The Single-Molecule
DNA Transfer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this project is to investigate
the possibility of using single molecules of DNA for molecular-based electronic
devices. Recent results of single-molecule DNA transistor shows a Coulomb
Blockade Staircase and a gate-voltage dependence of the conductance enabling
reliable and reproducible conducting DNA devices. This project is furthering
this work to investigate the mechanism for DNA conduction and its dependence on
various chemical and structural parameters. The single-molecule DNA transistor
is being further investigated too understand the mechanism by which DNA
conducts. Various questions such as dependence of conductivity of DNA to length
and sequence; differences in conductivity between single-stranded and doubled-
stranded DNA; dependence of the conduction in DNS to salts from the buffer
solution; where are possible scattering centers located in the DNA molecule?
Answers to such fundamental questions are expected to lead to a number of future
novel molecular-scaled DNA-based electronic devices.&lt;br/&gt;
