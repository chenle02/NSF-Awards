Speech sounds form the building blocks of spoken languages. Sounds are combined
into words, but languages have different rules regarding how sounds can be
combined. Sometimes sounds change in complicated ways, depending on other sounds
in a word. Languages have different patterns for changing sounds as well. Of the
roughly 7000 languages remaining in the world, these rules and patterns have
been studied in only a handful, and our understanding of why such rules and
patterns exist is incomplete. Extending traditional methods of describing and
documenting speech sounds, Laboratory Phonology is an approach that incorporates
a rich array of experimental methods and interdisciplinary approaches to
understanding human speech sounds as the building blocks of language as part of
a linguistic, cognitive, and communicative system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four of
the last five Conferences in Laboratory Phonology (LabPhon) have been hosted
outside of the US, and Cornell's Department of Linguistics will bring the
conference back to the US, July 13-16, 2016, with the theme of Speech Dynamics
and Phonological Representation. This conference will bring together not only
phonologists and phoneticians, but also researchers from other subfields and
allied fields including psycholinguists, sociolinguists, clinical linguists, L1
&amp; L2 acquisitionists, computer scientists, cognitive scientists, and
neuroscientists and others with an interest in the nature of speech. These
scholars and students from around the world will share recent advances in our
understanding of the sound systems of human language. LabPhon15 will focus on
increasing the participation of graduate students and early-career scholars in
the LabPhon research community, and will strengthen the visibility of
outstanding research done by women scholars.
