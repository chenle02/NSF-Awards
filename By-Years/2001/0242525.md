This work will upgrade laboratory capabilities for use of new materials under
carefully controlled conditions for fabricating superconducting heterodyne mixer
elements. This University of Virginia laboratory is one of two in the country
that specializes in superconducting devices for radio astronomy, and the award
will allow modernizing improvements to the facility. Over the past few years the
lab has produced 3mm and 1mm mixers for ALMA bands 3 and 6, and 2mm devices for
the Taeduk Radio Observatory; in addition, it is collaborating with the
University of Massachusetts and the University of Arizona on the design of new
hot electron bolometer devices.
