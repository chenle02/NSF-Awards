Applications EAR-0228968 Susan Pfiffner, Kim Davis and T. C. Onstott University
of Tennessee

This is a continuation of an educational effort begun last year, culminating in
a workshop for U. S. and South African minority undergraduates in order to
provide a field laboratory experience for minority students within the U. S. and
South Africa. This workshop, to be held in December 2002 and jointly hosted by
the University of Tennessee and the University of the Free State, consists of
two parts. The first part of the workshop will be a five-day undergraduate
hands-on field laboratory logistics and research experience (20 participants).
The second part will consist of a day and a half of information exchange of
research results of life in extreme environments and biotechnological
applications (40 participants).
