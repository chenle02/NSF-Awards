The overall goal of this award is to continue developing a fundamental
engineering knowledge base in separations technology applicable to the
manufacturing of biological products on a large scale. Key components to this
base include: new separation techniques; separation technologies combined into
novel systems which fit special requirements of new bioreactor and cell culture
production methods; and fundamental models for scale-up of recovery and
purification techniques. This award will also seek to educate bioprocess
engineers and scientists in the cross-disciplinary approaches needed for
invention, development and operation of commercial-scale bioprocesses.
