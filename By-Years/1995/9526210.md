This award, in the Small Grants for Exploratory Research mode, will examine and
test a first-principles approach for determining the relative depths of objects
in images using only knowledge about the medium and the intensities acquired in
a single view. Most methods for inferring depth (or range) in computer vision
have depended on the use of multiple cameras and normally require the
identification of corresponding points in the resulting images. Alternatively,
rangefinder methods depend on sharpness-of-focus measures that require
calibrated-focus lenses and an unambiguous definition of focus. The planned
approach is based on the physics of light transmission and attenuation in a
translucent diffuse medium. These investigators have shown, in theory and with a
small set of experiments (in simulated biological tissue), that it is
straightforward to infer the relative depths of structures when they are
embedded in such a medium. This work is particularly exploratory because the
original results arose as a byproduct of other research and so the extent of its
applicability in a more general setting is not known. Two of the questions to be
probed are: what are the limitations (e.g., minimum detectable depth difference)
and sensitivities (to assumptions, and to changes in parameters) of the model;
and what is the effect of the size and shape of the object on determination of
its relative depth. The research is aimed at the development of a capability to
identify unambiguously the relative depths of structures in an image, and thus
to prevent confusion about which structures overlie which others. Because a
single view is sufficient, it will be possible to make this identification
retrospectively, as long as the properties of the medium are known. This should
be useful in evaluating images arising, for example, in underwater, biological,
and atmospheric applications, as well as in more-turbid environments.
