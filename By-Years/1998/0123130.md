This program provides financial and academic support for students in marine
engineering technology, marine engineering technology with license option and
maritime systems engineering. Students from eight especially diverse high
schools in the Houston/Galveston area are recruited to participate in the
program as entering freshmen, and are tracked as a cohort over the four year
duration. Selection of participants is based on an application process reviewed
by a selection committee and is competitive based on standard criteria including
financial need and merit. The program provides specialized diagnostic testing,
tutoring, supplemental instruction, mentoring and career services to help them
successfully persist, graduate and find employment or pursue a graduate degree
in the engineering field. A summer bridge workshop in mathematics is a critical
element in preparing the entering students.&lt;br/&gt;
