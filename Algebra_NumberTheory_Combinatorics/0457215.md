The proposed research involves several interrelated areas in spectral graph
theory, extremal graph theory and random graphs. A main goal is to deduce the
fundamental properties and structures of a graph from its graph spectrum (or
from a short list of easily computable invariants). Various combinatorial,
geometric and probabilistic techniques are being developed for examining the
relations and behaviors of various graph invariants and properties. The proposed
research project includes: (1) Research in spectral graph theory, including
spectral Tur'an theorems, quasi-randomness, random walks in directed graphs,
Cheeger's inequality for directed graphs, (2) Research in random graphs with
emphasis on random graphs with given degree distributions, and examining various
aspects including giant components, average distance, diameter and eigenvalues
distributions, (3) Mathematical models for information networks that generate
random power law graphs, including the growth-deletion models of preferential
attachments, generalizations of Polya urn's model, duplication models for
biologic al networks and the development of tools such as generalizing martigale
inequalities for rigorous probabilistic analysis of large networks.

Although graph theory has more than 250 years of history, it is only been very
recently observed that many realistic networks arising in numerous arenas have
astounding coherence --- similar shapes (power law degree distribution) and
having the so-called "small world phenomenon" (small distances and clustering).
Examples include WWW graphs, call graphs, biological networks and numerous
social networks. The study of the graph models for various information networks
has led to exciting new directions for research in graph theory. In the other
direction, graph theory provides tools for analyzing and utilizing large complex
networks. The primary objective of the proposed research is to advance our
understanding of the intrinsic characteristics and underlying principles that
govern large information networks. Such principles are quite effective and
essential in dealing with problems in computation and communication involving
massive information networks that arise in Internet computing and massive data
sets.
