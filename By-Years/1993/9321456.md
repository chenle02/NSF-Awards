Proposal #: 93-21456 The grant supplies funding to purchase shipboard
instrumentation in support of NSF-funded research. The instruments will be used
aboard the R/Vs MELVILLE, a 279 foot vessel, NEW HORIZON, a 170 foot vessel, and
the SPROUL, a 125 foot vessel. The MELVILLE is owned by the Navy, but the NEW
HORIZON and the SPROUL are owned by the University. All the ships are operated
by the Institute in support of oceanographic research funded by a variety of
Federal, state and private organizations. Instrumentation requested includes
both shared-use equipment for specific ships and shared-use instrumentation that
will be maintained by the central Ocean Data Facility (ODF) and used aboard a
variety of ships. The instrumentation requested is required for support of NSF-
funded cruises aboard the MELVILLE, NEW HORIZON and SPROUL during 1994 and will
enhance the scientific capability of the vessel in the future. Some of the
equipment will also be used aboard the R/V KNORR, a vessel operated by Woods
Hole Oceanographic Institution, during WOCE cruises in the Arabian Sea.
