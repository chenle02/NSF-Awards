The purpose of this proposal is to develop a plan for new information on trends
in employment status of new scientists and engineers in six professions based on
information collected by professional associations. the Commission has
established important linkages with professional associations that can be used
to develop standard statistical sources. the data collected would provide
feedback to policymakers, faculty, and students. It would assess the quality of
information on employment of graduates of several professions, improve and
coordinate the data collection methods of professional societies, and
disseminate the results via electronic means.
