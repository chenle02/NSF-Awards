9400698 ALLDREDGE A new class of large, abundant particles has recently been
discovered which exist as transparent films, sheets and strings in seawater.
These transparent exopolymer particles (TEP) appear to be formed from dissolved
polysaccharides excreted by phytoplankton and bacteria. The existence of
microbial exudates acting as large, discrete particles rather than as dissolved
molecules as a coatings on other particles has far reaching implications for
carbon cycling, microbial processes, food web structure, and transformations of
organic matter in the ocean, but because of their recent discovery, the
significance of these particles is largely unknown. This research will conduct
preliminary studies to elucidate the potential significance of these invisible
particles to several oceanographic processes. These studies will 1) determine
how TEP is formed and what factors most influence formation, 2) determine which
taxa are the most significant contributors to TEP formation, 3) establish
whether TEP serves as a food source or inhabits feeding of zooplankton, 4)
investigate degradation of TEP by bacteria, and 5) examine seasonality of TEP in
nature.
