The Biotechnology in Practice (BIP) S-STEM scholarship program at Hartwick
College provides scholarships for academically-talented entering students or
transfer students who demonstrate financial need and are interested in careers
in biotechnology, an area of growth in jobs in industry and academia. The
program offers scholarships of up to four years in duration to two cohorts of
six students each, over five academic years. It is focused on biology and
biochemistry students, since they form a natural cohort, and because of existing
interactions among biochemistry students and faculty in terms of advising and
co-advising senior research projects and use of equipment and other facilities.
The BIP program builds on these existing cohorts and collaborations to work
towards its major goal of creating a sustainable environment of scholarship and
achievement in biotechnology. A learning community composed of a supportive and
interactive network of student scholars and faculty mentors is being formalized
through the BIP S-STEM program. This learning community is helping to create an
atmosphere of confidence and achievement for the S-STEM scholars, and to prepare
the scholars for graduate work and/or careers in biotechnology. Existing student
support services (such as peer tutoring, supplemental instruction services, and
academic support workshops) are being enhanced to meet the scholars' specific
needs, and new opportunities for mentoring, internships, research, and career
exploration are being developed and implemented. Students in the BIP program are
strongly encouraged to participate in student/faculty collaboration on research
in an emerging field or in internships in academia or industry, and to attend
regional and national conferences to give presentations on their research
projects. The program is being designed to offer a high quality educational
experience in biotechnology to a wide range of students, including first
generation college students from low-income rural and urban communities.
