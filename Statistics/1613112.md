In modern statistical analysis, datasets often contain a large number of
variables with complicated dependence structures. This situation is especially
common in important problems in economics, engineering, finance, genetics,
genomics, neurosciences, etc. One of the most important measures on the
dependence between variables is the correlation coefficient, which describes
their linear dependence. In the new paradigm described above, understanding the
correlation and the behavior of correlated variables is a crucial problem and
prompts statisticians to develop new theories and methods. Motivated by this
challenge, the PI proposes to study the correlation through novel geometric
perspectives. The overall objective is (1) to develop useful theories and
methods on the correlation and (2) to build a stronger connection between
geometry and statistics. The PI anticipates the achievement of his goals through
an integration of research and education plans.

The research agenda is to systematically investigate three fundamental aspects
of the correlation: (1) the magnitude and distribution of the maximal spurious
sample correlation; (2) the detection of a low-rank correlation structure; and
(3) the probability measure over the space of correlation matrices. In these
studies, the novel integration of statistical and geometric insights
characterizes the proposed solutions and facilitates precise probability
statements. Completion of the proposed research will provide a comprehensive
understanding of the correlation and a stronger connection between geometry and
statistics. The PI also has comprehensive plans on educating graduate and
undergraduate students and on disseminating the research results to the broader
scientific community.
