Cryptography is an essential and widespread tool for providing information
security. Traditional cryptographic models assume only black-box, or
input/output access to devices, thereby limiting the class of attacks. In
practice, an attacker may obtain non-black-box access to a device and attack a
particular algorithm or specific implementation such as through timing or fault
injection attacks. Exploiting non-black-box access has been a remarkably
effective technique for compromising cryptosystems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project investigates mechanisms to protect against such non-black box attacks.
The research goals of this proposal are: (1) design and analyze new algorithms
for secure computation in threat models that capture non-black-box attacks, and
(2) provide a better understanding of the effectiveness of non-black-box
techniques in the construction of cryptosystems.
