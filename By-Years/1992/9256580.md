This award to a group of 27 Faculty will provide positions for 5 graduate
students in a new computational biology training program at the Center for
Computational Biology established jointly by three institutions (Rice
University, Baylor College of Medicine and the University of Houston). The
faculty come from Departments of Cell Biology, Biochemistry, Chemistry, Computer
Science, Statistics and Electrical Engineering. A few also participate in the
STC for Research on Parallel Computation at Rice University. The training
program will emphasize visualization, algorithm development and advanced
computation in biology, biochemistry and biophysics. Also included are courses
offered by the individual institutions, a course taught jointly by faculty from
all three, and a Center-sponsored seminar series. The award includes funds to be
used to aid in recruiting and to promote student participation in meetings &amp;
workshops.
