The theory of L-functions is central in the study of number theoretical
questions, especially in the realm of analytic number theory. For most
applications, the relevant questions usually involve the analytic continuation
of the L-functions, their functional equations, estimates for their growth in
vertical strips, and knowledge of the distribution of their zeros. This project
deals with both very general questions (the classification of Dirichlet series
with functional equations and Euler products and their connections with
automorphic forms) and particular questions (mean-value theorems for particular
L-functions, and the distribution of their zeros) in the theory of L-functions.
This research falls into the general mathematical field of Number Theory. Number
theory has its historical roots in the study of the whole numbers, addressing
such questions as those dealing with the divisibility of one whole number by
another. It is among the oldest branches of mathematics and was pursued for many
centuries for purely aesthetic reasons. However, within the last half century it
has become an indispensable tool in diverse applications in areas such as data
transmission and processing, and communication systems.
