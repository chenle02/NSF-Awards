This project is concerned with the far infrared properties of a number of
semiconductors at large hydrostatic pressures. High resolution far infrared
Fourier transform spectroscopy of ground state to bound excited state
transitions of donors associated with conduction band minima which become global
minima at large hydrostatic pressures will be performed. The effect of hydrogen
on the formation of DX-centers in gallium arsenide and other compound
semiconductors wil be studied. Th formation of DX-centers in gallium arsenide
alloyed with aluminum presents a major technical problem in the design and
fabrication of a number of optoelectronic devices. These novel studies promise
to yield important data on the band structure and on dopants and defects at
large hydrostatic pressures. This effort is made possible through advances in
the design of high pressure diamond anvil cells and sensitive far infrared
photoconductive detectors.
