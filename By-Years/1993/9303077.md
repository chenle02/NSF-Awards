Abstract Bolton 93-03077 It is proposed to upgrade an existing NMR spectrometer
to a two-channel spectrometer of more modern design. The spectrometer will be
configured with existing proton detection probes with X channel capability
between 15N and 31P and a proton probe. The upgraded spectrometer is required to
be able to perform natural abundance heteronuclear correlation experiments, to
perform carbon- carbon correlation experiments at natural abundance, to perform
proton two-dimensional and other experiments on samples in water, to obtain high
quality COSY, TOCSY, ROESY and NOESY data for quantitative analysis and to
perform three-dimensional NMR experiments. The upgraded console will offer
significantly greater effective sensitivity for basic carbon, nitrogen and
phosphorus since the level of artifact signals will be substantially reduced.
The major value of the upgrade is to allow a range of entirely new experiments
to be performed.
