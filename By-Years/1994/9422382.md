Agroecological and Market Roles of Biologic Diversity in the Cacao Agroforestry
Systems of Bahia, Brazil This research will integrate environmental and market
factors to examine the agroforestry systems in southeastern Bahia, Brazil which
produce cacao exclusively for an international market. The objective is to
understand the rationale of the region's farmers to shade their cacao trees with
either a dense, diverse canopy of native rainforest trees, known as cabrocagem,
or to modernize with a thinner, homogeneous cover of imported trees and
incorporate fertilizers and other technological inputs. The research methodology
will employ regional and farm-scale phases. The regional-scale analysis will,
for the first time, establish the cultivation patterns of the two farm types
based on archive data and aerial photography held in Brazil's Center for Cacao
Research near Itabuna, Bahia. This analysis will examine natural environmental
gradients in climate and soil type along with regional variation in credit and
technology availability for their role in determining the type of cultivation.
The proposed dissertation research will contribute to the understanding of the
interacting roles that factors of the natural environment, products markets, and
individual farmer attitudes and goals play in shaping the level of biological
diversity within an agroforestry system. This is especially significant since
the agricultural policy environment of many tropical countries favors
development of market-oriented systems of agroforestry.
