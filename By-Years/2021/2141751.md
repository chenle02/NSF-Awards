As natural language systems become ubiquitous (e.g. phone trees, chatbots, and
smart homes) they must learn to adapt to users by modeling them each as
individuals with different abilities, knowledge, and tastes. Theory of mind is
the human ability to reason about the hidden mental states of others, but is a
complex phenomenon that does not emerge in children until late in their
development compared to other more basic communicative skills. The questions of
interest to this EAGER project are: (1) what makes this skill hard for children
to learn, (2) what can computers learn from how children are taught, and (3) in
what ways can machine learning models provide insight into human development.
This project sits at this intersection of machine learning, developmental
psychology, and pedagogy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project includes formal
models of information sharing and teaching grounded in shared referential games.
Agents and children are tasked with asking an instructor to efficiently
distinguish similar objects -- a task which requires understanding common ground
and identifying distinguishing features. While the learner will often make
ambiguous statements, the teacher will provide corrections and instruction to
guide the learning process. This formulation allows for variation along several
dimensions of relevance to successful communication: working memory, visual and
lexical complexity, and specificity of instruction. Experiments with children
will provide benchmarks against which computational agents can be compared, and
experiments with agents will allow us to decompose the contribution of each of
these factors to the difficulty of developing a theory of
mind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
