With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, Tulane
University will acquire a growth/preparation apparatus for nanoscale and
materials science. The new setup will combine a plasma source for non-invasive
surface cleaning with thin film deposition equipment (physical vapor deposition,
plasma-assisted vapor deposition, pulsed laser deposition) and basic in-situ
characterization facilities (RHEED and XPS). The primary users will be
researchers from Tulane University and Xavier University of Louisiana.

This apparatus will be used for the synthesis of a wide variety of magnetic
catalytic, biocompatible, nanoscopic and structural materials, and will play a
key role in integrating Tulane's and Xavier's materials synthesis and advanced
surface characterization programs. It will also enhance instruction through
research training of undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate students;
through implementation in several courses; and as a hands-on component in
outreach programs.
