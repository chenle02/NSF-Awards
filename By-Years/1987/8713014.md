The University of Chicago is being supported to establish a Research Experiences
for Undergraduates (REU) SITE. The purpose of this SITE is to provide meaningful
hands-on research opportunities in contemporary chemistry for outstanding
undergraduate students under supervision of experienced research chemists. The
program will support 8 students for the summer of 1987, of which almost half
will come from other institutions. Research activities will include: o Laser
Spectroscopy in supersonic Molecular Beams o Chemistry of Nucleic Acids and
Nucleotides o Electronic Structure of Molecules and Solids o Electronic and
Atomic Properties of Surfaces
