9451752 Wall This project supports instrumentation for an urban archaeological
initiative at the institution. The program introduces undergraduates to the
scientific method as it applies to problems in urban archaeology. Unlike most
undergraduate archaeological programs, the program also engages undergraduates
in the entire analytical process that results in archaeological interpretation.
The phases covered include formulating a research problem, background historical
study of a site, excavation, processing and analyzing artifacts and field data,
and applications of the scientific method. The results of the students' work are
also incorporated into professional site reports.
