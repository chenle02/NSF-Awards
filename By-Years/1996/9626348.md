DMS 9626348 Samarov This research addresses the question of how intuitive and
concise linear model concepts and techniques can be extended to nonparametric
settings. Nonparametric counterparts of such commonly used linear model ideas as
regression coefficients, correlation coefficients, coefficient of determination,
and principal components are considered. The research also studies nonparametric
techniques for model diagnostics that can be used for dimensionality reduction
and to address the question of adequacy of particular models. Both asymptotic
and finite sample properties are studied, and the problem of developing reliable
data-based methods for smoothing parameter selection for functionals and curves
is addressed. With the advent of computer data bases of unprecedented size and
complexity and with the dramatic increase in computer power, it as become
increasingly more desirable and possible to develop more flexible models,
concepts, and procedures that can be used to study relationships between
variables and to construct models without relying on rigid global assumptions.
Much of the recent work in statistics have addressed this need for more general
and flexible methods. This research further extends this work with a special
focus on procedures that are counterparts of many commonly used linear model
concepts and that expose important features in the data using intuitive and
familiar ideas.
