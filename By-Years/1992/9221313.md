This grant is for partial support of a conference on "Perspectives and
Opportunities in Bioengineering" which is the theme of the 1992 Fall Meeting of
the Biomedical Engineering Society. Six major symposia will address topics
related to the theme of the meeting. The symposia are: 1) Cardiovascular
Bioengineering; 2) Micro and Nano Bioengineering; 3) Bioengineering in Society;
4) Cell and Tissue Bioengineering; 5) Bioengineering in Outer Space; and 6)
Clinical Bioengineering. This grant will support speakers whose topics will be
on either emerging areas of Bioengineering or on areas that could benefit from
additional research in the Bioengineering field.
