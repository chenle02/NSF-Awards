Watershed boundaries, or drainage divides, control the flux of water and
sediment in a landscape and drive evolution and speciation of aquatic organisms.
Over geologic time, drainage divides move in response to changes in climate and
tectonics. This work explores how the motion of divides differs between gently
sloping, soil-mantled landscapes and steep, mountainous, rocky areas.
Specifically, the researchers will compare landscapes where soil creeps along
hillslopes with those where material is primarily transported through
landslides. They will use digital mapping techniques, field measurements of soil
and sediment characteristics, and theoretical models of landscape evolution to
investigate the ingredients that affect divide motion. Unlike previous research,
which focuses on river channels, this work emphasizes processes that occur on
hillslopes. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Topographic analysis, field measurements of
grain size, and erosion rates from cosmogenic nuclides illustrate the role of
non-fluvial processes in modulating topographic change of drainage basins. To
capture hillslope and colluvial transport regimes in landscapes ranging from
soil-mantled to rocky, this work leverages measurements from field sites across
a range of regional erosion rates (Ozark Plateau, Oregon Coast Range, San
Gabriel Mountains). In addition to testing existing topographic metrics for
divide instability, this work seeks quantitative methodological improvements to
better incorporate steep landscapes into theoretical frameworks that describe
and predict divide instability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
