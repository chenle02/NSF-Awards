Education Development Center, in conjunction with the Urban Mathematics
Collaborative and Sunburst Corporations, is requesting funding for a conference
to plan "Teaching and Schooling for a New Vision of Secondary Mathematics." The
Geometric Supposer software will serve as a focus and exemplar for developing
the conference themes. The conference will bring together representatives of the
school restructuring movement, a range of secondary school mathematics
educators, and mathematicians. The conference will address questions related to:
the defining characteristics of a new vision of secondary mathematics
instruction as exemplified by the use of the Supposers: the new roles and
responsibilities required of teachers by these approaches: and the place of
these experiences and approaches within the school restructuring movement.
Recommendations for continued activity by participants will be the major
conference outcome, and will be disseminated through a variety of vehicles.
Cost-sharing is provided as 100% of the NSF award.
