We develop novel and provably stable polynomial time solutions for solving the
recursive robust principal component analysis (PCA) problem. Here, "robust"
refers to robustness to both independent and correlated sparse outliers. The
goal of PCA is to find the principal component (PC) space, which is the minimum-
dimension subspace that spans (or, in practice, approximately spans) a given
dataset. Computing the PCs in the presence of outliers is called robust PCA. If
the PC space changes over time, there is a need to update the PCs. Doing this
recursively is referred to as recursive robust PCA. Key potential applications
include automatic foreground extraction from similar-looking backgrounds in
video; sensor-network-based detection and tracking of abnormal events such as
forest fires; online detection of brain activation patterns from functional MRI
sequences; and speech/audio extraction from large but correlated background
noise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key idea is to reformulate this as a problem of
recursively recovering a time sequence of sparse signals in the presence of
large but correlated noise. The noise must be correlated enough to have an
approximately low rank covariance matrix that is either constant or changes
slowly. The change in the support of the sparse signal sequences may or may not
be slow, but it is highly correlated; e.g. the support can move, expand or
deform over time. We ask the following practically relevant questions about
performance guarantees of the proposed algorithms. (a) Under what conditions can
we prove exact recovery? (b) When can be obtain time-invariant and small error
bounds (i.e., show stability)? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be
included in the curriculum at various levels and in undergraduate senior design
and summer research projects.
