A request is made to fund Oceanographic Instrumentation on the R/V Atlantic
Explorer, a 168? general purpose research vessel owned and operated by Bermuda
Institute of Ocean Science (BIOS) as part of the University-National
Oceanographic Laboratory System. BIOS is a U.S. 501 (c) 3 and 509 (a) not-for-
profit research and educational institution incorporated in the state of New
York, and geographically located on the Island of Bermuda. The mission of the
ship is to support funded science research throughout the Central Atlantic but
specifically work in support of the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series (BATS) program.
RV Atlantic Explorer had 120 days funded in 2017, all but 7 of which were for
NSF. In 2018, the vessel is scheduled to sail 183 days with 178 (98%) of them
funded by NSF. With this proposal, BIOS provides technical descriptions and
rationale for the acquisition of the following
Instrumentation:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Upgrade for CTD Cable
$20,954&lt;br/&gt;Data collection upgrade $26,107&lt;br/&gt;Technician
Workstations $11,761&lt;br/&gt;Internet accessibility in port
$6,398&lt;br/&gt;Video over IP system $7,826&lt;br/&gt;Rack expansion
$5,782&lt;br/&gt; $78,828&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit
Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides
infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use
instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects
(which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of
NSF). The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation
allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working,
calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research,
and expanding the base of potential researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
