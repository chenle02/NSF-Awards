This project continues prior reseach and initiates new research in three areas
of computational complexity: 1. Computational complexity of real functions. The
concepts and techniques of NP-completeness theory will be applied to continuous
problems. 2. Structure of intractable problems. Structural properties of
intractable problems, such as polynomial isomorphism, Kolmogorov complexity, and
polynomial-time bounded reducibilities will be investigated. 3. Feasible
inductive inference. Polynomial-time inferability of pattern languages and
probabilistic automata will be investigated in the setting of worst-case exact
learning.
