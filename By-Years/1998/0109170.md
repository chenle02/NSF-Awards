0109170&lt;br/&gt;Smith / Norman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This dissertation research
by an anthropology student from the University of Washington will gather and
analyze data on western Torres Strait (Australia) Islander marine resource use,
in order to evaluate two competing models of human use of natural resources.
Optimal foraging theory predicts that defendable territories of limited access
are likely to produce conservation-oriented behaviors, such as foregoing the
harvest of marine animals based on individual size or local population
depletion. An alternative view of small-scale human society holds that people
are often socially invested in conserving future stocks without regard for
specific territorial rights. Hypotheses from these alternative theories will be
tested in this research, using measurements of catch, patch time allocation, and
return rates. The data and will contribute to an enhanced understanding of the
microecology of fishing, and will be useful for localized and cooperative
management institutions to provide them with a stronger basis of effective
management of coastal resources. The project in addition contributes to the
training of a young social scientist, and advances our understanding of this
important region of the world. &lt;br/&gt;
