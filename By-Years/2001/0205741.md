ITR/AP: Simulation-Based Medical Planning for Cardiovascular
Disease&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current paradigm for interventional and surgery
planning for the treatment of congenital and acquired cardiovascular disease
relies exclusively on diagnostic imaging data to define the present state of the
patient, empirical data to evaluate the efficacy of prior treatments for similar
patients, and the judgement of the surgeon to decide on a preferred treatment.
The individual variability and inherent complexity of human biological systems
is such that diagnostic imaging and empirical data alone are insufficient to
predict the outcome of a given treatment for an individual patient.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific objectives described in the present proposal
are to develop a Problem Solving Environment for Simulation-Based Medical
Planning combining (i) the construction of patient-specific preoperative
geometric models of the human vascular system directly from medical imaging
data, (ii) the modification of these models to incorporate multiple potential
interventional and surgical plans, (iii) the generation of finite element meshes
of the treatment plans, (iv) the simulation of blood flow in these patient-
specific models, and (v) the visualization and quantification of resulting
physiologic information. Techniques for identifying vessel boundaries from
computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data using two-
and three-dimensional level set methods will be improved to enhance accuracy and
efficiency. &lt;br/&gt;The ultimate result of the successful completion of the
outlined tasks will be the development of an integrated Problem Solving
Environment for Simulation-Based Medical Planning incorporating image
segmentation, geometric modeling, mesh generation, computational mechanics, and
scientific visualization techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
