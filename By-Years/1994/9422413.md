9422413 Ravenel Neisendorfer's project is to compute the homology of certain
spaces that are inverse limits, for example, a union of infinitely many spheres
of radii converging to zero and with one point in common. Using the new
algebraic result that an inverse limit of connected free Lie algebras is free,
methods of rational homotopy theory can be applied. Deeper results seem to be
obtainable using the geometric methods of Pontrjagin and Thom. Ravenel is
studying problems in stable homotopy theory related to the telescope conjecture.
This appears to be the best approach to understanding the stable homotopy groups
of finite complexes, which is one of the oldest problems in algebraic topology.
In more general terms, algebraic topology is the study of geometric problems
(often in more than 3 dimensions) in their qualitative rather than quantitative
aspects, classifying and counting structures rather than measuring their sizes.
For example an essential difference between a 2-dimensional plane and a
3-dimensional space is that removing a line separates the former but not the
latter into two separate pieces. Topologists have devised methods called
homotopy and homology for keeping track of such properties systematically in
very complicated geometric objects (objects than can arise, for example, as the
spaces of solutions to sytems of ordinary or differential equations).
Neisendorfer and Ravenel's research is concerned with refining and extending
these methods. ***
