Lysosomal proteases are active in cellular protein turnover and degradation of
molecules which enter the cell by phagocytosis. Like secretory proteins, they
are synthesized on membrane-bound ribosomes. Two pathways exist for their
subsequent sorting from secretory proteins and transport to lysosomes. In
fibroblasts, a phosphotransferase adds phosphate to mannose residues, forming
the mannose-6-phosphate recognition marker which enables lysosomal proteins to
react with specific receptors which carry them to lysosomes. In kidney and liver
cells, an alternative pathway exists but the sorting sequences on the lysosomal
enzymes and the cellular receptor it reacts with have not been characterized.
Thus transport to the lysosome is not a default pathway but rather requires that
biosynthetic forms of the lysosomal enzymes be recognized by specific cellular
enzymes in a complex sequence. While the active sites of lysosomal cysteine
proteases have been carefully studied, virtually nothing is known about the
structural motifs which constitute processing enzyme or receptor binding sites
on lysosomal enzymes. We will define these surface sequences for the lysosomal
cysteine protease cathepsin L by coupling analysis of protein structure with
molecular biology technology. Mutant enzymes will be constructed by site-
specific and/or saturation mutagenesis techniques and introduced into eukaryotic
cells by electroporation. Proper cellular segregation of the mutant enzymes will
be assayed by immunofluorescence, pulse-chase analysis of the biosynthesis of
the expressed protein, and cell fractionation. By this method we hope to
identify the specific amino acid sequences recognized by the phosphotransferase
and to identify surface sequences critical to the recognition of cathepsin L by
processing proteases responsible for propeptide removal, asymmetric cleavage
into light and heavy chains, and removal of carboxyl terminal amino acids. This
research addresses an important and timely problem in modern cell biology,
namely, what are the mechanisms responsible for the correct sorting of cellular
or secretory proteins. A successful outcome of this work will increase our
understanding of section protein-protein interactions and the basis of
recognition specificity.
