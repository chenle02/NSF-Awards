The objective of this study is to identify the mechanism through which integrins
mediate retroviral gene transfer. Two different but not mutually exclusive
hypotheses will be tested. First, it will be examined if integrins are involved
in binding to the cell surface and/or internalization of retroviral particles in
the cell cytoplasm. Second, it will be examined which - if any - integrin-
mediated signaling pathway(s) affect the retroviral life-cycle and consequently
gene transfer. The intellectual merit of the proposed studies lies in their
potential to increase the understanding of virus-cell interactions and provide
novel ways to promote gene transfer to the stem cell compartment of the skin.
Such advances will improve the capacity of epidermal keratinocytes for treatment
of disease or injury and the prospect of tissue engineered skin as
isbioreactorla for local or systemic delivery of therapeutic proteins. The
proposed studies are designed to have significant broader impact by integrating
research and education, by engaging participation of underrepresented minorities
and by broad dissemination of research results using state-of-the-art
communication technologies.
