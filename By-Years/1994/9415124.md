9415124 LOFTIN This is a project to develop a coordinated and integrated agenda
for scientific research on violence. A workshop will be held in which leading
social scientists who conduct research on violence will discuss ways to
integrate studies from different theoretical perspectives and different levels
of analysis. A recent National Academy of Sciences report stated that federal
support for violence research was insufficient, short-term, and fragmented
across specific problem areas. The report recommended a coordinated effort with
long-term support so that information gained from individual projects could be
developed into a cumulative knowledge base for planning effective policies. The
present project will provide the basis for a coordinated knowledge-building
effort in the conduct of scientific research on violence. ***
