0118200&lt;br/&gt;Kamenkovich/ USM&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is proposed to study
transport between the Pacific and Indian Oceans by assimilating current meter
data collected in the Makassar Strait into a regional circulation model. Results
of the model will be compared with observations of the distribution of
chlorofluorocarbons in the waters of the region and with the trajectories of
drifting floats. The goal is to develop a clearer picture of the regional
circulation and its variability and to understand the mechanisms controlling the
bifurcation of the flow leaving the Makassar Strait. The work will include an
analysis of momentum and energy budgets and a study of the dependence of
transport through the Makassar Strait on the pressure head. In addition to work
with a numerical model in a realistic domain, the project will also include an
idealized process study to examine the influence of different aspects of the
regional topography on the flow bifurcation at the southern end of the Makassar
Strait. By developing a better understanding of the nature of the regional
circulation and of the mechanisms that control it, the project will contribute
to an improved knowledge of the processes controlling the exchange of heat and
fresh water between two major oceans.&lt;br/&gt;
