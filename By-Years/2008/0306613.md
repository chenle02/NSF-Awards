ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;0306613&lt;br/&gt;Perry, Dewayne&lt;br/&gt;U of
Texas&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The transformation of a system's software
requirements into an appropriate architecture is an extremely difficult task.
The architecture represents the creation of a system structure that provides the
context of how a software system will implement what the system is supposed to
do. The difficulty of this transformation task is exacerbated by the fact that
requirements are often ambiguous, incomplete and unstable. Factoring in the need
to accommodate as yet unknown uses of the system and requirements that will
change during the evolutionary life of that system only makes the task more
difficult.&lt;br/&gt;Our proposal is a continuation of our initial research (the
Preskiptor Process [2, 3, 4]) on bridging the gap between a requirements
specification for a software system and the architectural specification of that
system. This initial is an approach that begins with formal requirements
specifications (in van Lamsweerde's KAOS [6, 11, 12]) that are transformed by
means of a systematic process into an architectural prescription [11, 12] where
the formal logical language for specifying the architectural prescriptions is
the same language as that used for specifying the requirement goals. The
advantage of this approach is that the abstractions (i.e., the domain specific
concepts, the concepts in the problem domain) used in both specifications are
easily understood in both contexts and represent the problem domain. Our initial
approach solves the basic problem: creating an architectural structure that
satisfies the functional requirements specification.
