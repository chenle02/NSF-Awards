Integration of multiple Internet sources poses many novel challenges such as
handling semistructured data, creating views without complete knowledge of the
source structure, adapting to the limited query interfaces (capabilities) of the
sources, and answering queries referring to virtual objects which are the result
of complex information fusion operations. Recent works have provided flexible,
though very often inefficient, ways to rapidly develop mediators that achieve
the above goals. This research develops data structures, algorithms and systems
which can enhance the performance, often by orders of magnitude, and improve the
user interface without compromising the development flexibility. Data guides are
proposed for describing the concepts (or combinations of concepts) that
significantly appear in each source and in the integrated view created by the
mediator. Data guide computation algorithms use (1) the mediator specification,
(2) the parser of the source data, and (3) actual data of query results.
Mediators and user interfaces are extended to make use of the data guides upon
query processing and query formulation. This research also develops algorithms
that (1) further extend the mediator's ability to adapt to the limited
capabilities of the sources, (2) use knowledge (e.g., dependencies) of the
source data to enhance the performance of object fusion queries, and (3)
optimize the delivery of partial answers. This research will demonstrate how
flexible integration systems (such as systems for constructing virtual malls by
integrating multiple Web shopping sites or systems for fusing all available
financial information relating to a company) can be rapidly developed while
still achieving the performance of hard-to-built custom made integration
systems.
