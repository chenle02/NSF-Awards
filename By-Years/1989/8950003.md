An innovative short course on Fourier analysis is being given to groups of 18
college faculty at SIU's Touch of Nature Conference Center during the summers of
1989 and 1990. Lectures are discussing Fourier's representation of discrete and
continuous functions; the operator identities that facilitate a deep
understanding of the rules and symmetries of this discipline; the fast Fourier
transform from Gauss` interpolation bases on derivation to modern variants such
as Bracewell's recently patented fast Hartley transform; an elementary new
theory of generalized functions, i.e., distributions, that are widely used in
mathematics and its applications; and selected applications of these ideas from
the mathematical, physical, and engineering sciences. Participants are using
personal computers (with especially designed user friendly software) to deepen
their understanding of the rules and operator identities developed in the
lectures, to experience fast, i.e., 0(N log N), as opposed to slow, i.e., O(N2),
N-digit arithmetic, and to solve practical problems using fast transform
methods. The lecture notes, exercise sets, and computer discs from the short
courses are preparing the participants to introduce corresponding
interdisciplinary undergraduate Fourier analysis courses in their home
institutions or to enrich and modernize existing courses in numerical analysis,
Fourier series, ordinary and partial differentials equations, etc., already in
place in the curriculum. The Division of Mathematical Sciences is also providing
support for this project. The University is contributing to the cost of the
program, with the individual participant's home institutions also bearing a cost
of the participation.
