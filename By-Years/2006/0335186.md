This Americas Program award will support for a second year the American
Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) Latin American Lecture Series
on Women in Science. The lecture series aim to showcase the achievements of
distinguished U.S. women scientists to wide audiences in Latin America.
Organized by Marina Ratchford of the AAAS Directorate for Education and Human
Resources, the initiative seeks to increase both the visibility of U.S. women
scientists' careers, and the participation of women in the scientific enterprise
in the U.S. and Latin America.

The AAAS proposes to extend the lecture series to three more events in the
course of Year 2 of the project (August 2003-July 2004). In the selection of
nine new participants, they will continue to look for inspirational personal
stories about pursuing a scientific career and overcoming obstacles to
professional advancement, giving preference to fields traditionally
underrepresented by women, and looking for a diversity of fields and sectors. In
addition, applicants will be encouraged to nominate a graduate student from
their organizations to be considered in the selection process, which will
furnish role models for other students in Latin America and allow the comparison
of student experiences across regions. Nine scientists and three students will
be selected to participate in events in Argentina/Uruguay, Mexico and Jamaica.
The AAAS will work in partnership with several national and regional scientific
organizations to organize and publicize these events, to ensure the
participation of local women scientists and students, and to plan additional
visits to primary and secondary schools, universities and research institutes.
