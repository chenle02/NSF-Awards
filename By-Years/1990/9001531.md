This research is to develop further the theoretical basis for determining 3-D
earth structure from long-period seismic data. The next major advance will be to
invert a dataset that is an order of magnitude larger, of the order of 50,000
source-receiver pairs which will be developed elsewhere. Attention here will be
focused on the accuracy and possible biases of the various approximations and
techniques that will have to be employed in such a large-scale study. Specific
topics to be addressed are the accurate computation of synthetic long-period
seismograms, evaluation of approximate methods and inversion techniques, and
theoretical studies of geometrical optics, anisotropy, and the Born
approximation.
