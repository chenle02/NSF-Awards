This proposal seeks funds ($41,724) got activity, including research, that
builds upon AAAS' This Year In School Science and Assessing Higher Order
Thinking In Mathematics. The research involves the collection of data supplied
by the 50 State Education Officers regarding the status of each state in the
evolving "assessment of student learning vis-a-vis science and mathematics. This
data, and other data collected prior to a planned conference on this topic will
serve to frame the discussion. The outcome will lead to plans to share costs
across states as the states continue to unfold activity in the assessment area.
(This project should be of great assistance to the states and to AAAS. I
recommend funding this effort.
