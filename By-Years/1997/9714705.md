The investigator is measuring vertical distribution of the Joule heating rate in
the high latitude E region, and the influence of E-region neutral winds on this
distribution. He addresses neutral dynamics, electrodynamics, and energetics
throughout the vertical column of polar E region and coupling aspects with the
magnetosphere and lower atmosphere. Other issues he is hurdling: (1) to what
degree the Lorentz force on neutral wind extends downward into the E region; (2)
how the level of geomagnetic activity and its duration impacts the Joule heating
rate, accounting for neutral winds; (3) what are load/generator characteristics
of the high-latitude ionosphere and neutral winds' effect on them; and (4) the
correlation of enhanced Joule heating rates with local ion temperature. The
physical coupling occurring in high-latitude E and interplay of tidal forcing
from below, magnetospheric from above, have, until now, been poorly understood.
This study, highlighting the importance of the Joule heating rate as a primary
high-latitude energy source, will change the tide significantly.
