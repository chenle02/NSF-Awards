This career advancement award supports the research of Professor Shubov to
study the asymptotic behavior of resonances for Schrodinger operators with
Coulomb-like potentials. Professor Shubov also intends to investigate many-
particle quantum systems. Modern physics, quantum mechanics and relativity, is a
product of the twentieth century. It is founded firmly in the last century's
attempt to address the microstructure of matter and to come to grips with the
concepts of action-at-a distance, electro- magnetism, and heat radiation. The
mathematical foundations for these developments, collectively called
mathematical physics, ranges from detailed analysis of Schrodinger operators,
which governs the dynamics of particles, to unified field theory, which attempts
to unite the four known forces into a single theory.
