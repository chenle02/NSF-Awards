The Ecosystem Model-Data Intercomparison (EMDI) program of the International
Geosphere- Biosphere Programme (IGBP) task force on Global Analysis,
Integration, and Modelling (GAIM) is facilitating interactions between
international modeling and data synthesis teams, beyond what any individual team
can reasonably propose or fund. This proposal is for a third EMDI workshop to be
held at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) in
March, 2002. The proposed workshop will focus on the development of a new
understanding of the nature and geographic variations in the carbon cycle, based
on two earlier workshops in which model intercomparisons and model-data
comparisons have been carried out. This workshop will focus on spatial analyses
of regional and global ecosystem model results with observed annual net primary
productivity (NPP), seasonal NPP, and time-series of carbon fluxes from FluxNet
flux tower observations. Further analyses of model results and the new IGBP-
DIS/GAIM Global Primary Production Data Initiative (GPPDI) data sets will be
made. The comparisons of model outputs with field measurements will help to
establish the level of confidence that we have in the processes and mechanisms
that underlie the modeled carbon cycle dynamics. The workshop will also increase
the ongoing collaboration between scientists developing models and those
conducting field measurements.
