The National Science Foundation began the development of the National Science
Digital Library (NSDL) several years ago and it is scheduled to come online this
coming year. The NSDL is a connection or system of separate data or information
sources. Bringing these disparate sources together is a complex issue, from both
the technical perspective and organization dynamics

This study will focus on the institutionalization of NSDL from both a technical
and contextual perspective. The latter includes such factors as priorities and
culture of the participating organizations, how they interact with the technical
considerations. A comparative case study will be used, with the internet serving
as a comparison, a system that has already been institutionalized and studied.
The study will provide an evaluative framework to employ with the NSDL as it is
implemented but will be applicable to large-scale IT systems, as well.
