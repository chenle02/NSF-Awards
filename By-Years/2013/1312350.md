The goal of this proposal is to provide a comprehensive catalog of nearby young
stellar objects fully accessible to the astronomical community. At present, data
regarding the approximately 10,000 - 30,000 young stellar objects within ~800pc
of the Sun are scattered throughout various archives and the published
literature. These include stars in young clusters, associations, and molecular
clouds, with photometric/spectroscopic data in one or more of the following
wavelengths: x-ray, optical, near-infrared, mid-infrared, and sub-
millimeter/millimeter. In addition, derived quantities such as stellar
parameters, angular momentum indicators, activity measures, circumstellar disk
diagnostics, etc. are also available through various resources.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will provide targeted and flexible access to
basic data products, as well as higher level data products that are relevant to
young stars through a relational database populated with data from all known or
suspected members of the population. The database will also have broad
educational value useful to a wide spectrum of users from teachers in the
classroom to experienced scientific researchers.
