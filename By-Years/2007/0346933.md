ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OCE-0346933&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An investigator
from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution proposes to examine submarine
groundwater discharge (SGD) in Plum Island Estuary and Pamet River Estuary, two
contrasting salt marsh estuaries in Massachusetts. Plum Island Estuary is
characterized by freshwater inputs dominated by surface runoff and Pamet River
Estuary has groundwater as its major source of freshwater. The investigator
hypothesizes that seawater circulation (total SGD) through salt marsh sediments
will dominate at Plum Island Estuary, whereas freshwater SGD will be more
important at the Pamet River Estuary. Total SGD represents the amount of
freshwater that enters the coastal ocean from a hydraulically connected aquifer
and freshwater SGD refers to the advective flow of mixtures of fresh and
brackish waters into the coastal zone. To test the hypothesis, the investigator
proposes a multi-tracer approach using radium isotopes and radon to estimate
total and freshwater SGD. A main goal of this study is to provide an approach
which will help quantify the source of nitrogen to salt marsh estuaries.
