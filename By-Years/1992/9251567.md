The realism of computer graphics images increases with the development of new
algorithms which model reality. Such algorithms are now possible with the
increasing power and affordability of computers. Graphics is different from
photography as it can create images which do not exist or cannot be
photographed. For example, images of the rings of Saturn can be created from the
data sent back from space probes and the interaction of atomic particles can be
displayed from data developed on supercomputers. This project will continue work
which animates the process of a system, the algorithm of a solution. Educational
computer videos will be developed showing the steps in an algorithm or the
progress of actions within a system. The videos will use state-of-the-art
graphics tools such as photorealistic rendering and scientific visualization.
The project will also develop software tools to aid the process, and manuals to
make the techniques accessible to others. Powerful color workstations which can
support the use of these tools will be acquired as part of this project.
