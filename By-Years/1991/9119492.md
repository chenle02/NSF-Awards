This is an award to support preliminary research on the potential use of low
intensity, ultrasonic radiation for desorption of contaminants from solid
surfaces to which they have been adsorbed including contaminated soils and for
regeneration of activated carbon used in water treatment processes. The
investigator plans on using ultrasonic radiation that is below the cavitation
threshold of the fluid in contact with the solid surfaces. The investigator's
research plan includes steps to separate the effects of abrasion, temperature
and ultrasonic vibrations. Results of this project are expected to identify the
nature of the chemical alteration and possible degradation when organic
contaminants of soil and water are exposed to high intensity ultrasonic
radiation. This research is expected to provide knowledge as to potential
applicability of a process using ultrasonic energy for decontamination of soil
and adsorbents used in treatment of water and assist in characterizing the
process for potential use in engineering design of decontamination systems.
