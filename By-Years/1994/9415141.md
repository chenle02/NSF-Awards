Constructed in 1938, the Engineering Science Building is one of three buildings
that houses the Department of Electrical Engineering at the University of
Mississippi. However, the majority of research and research training activities
are performed in the Engineering Science Building. Faculty research in the
department can be broadly described as Applied Electromagnetic Theory, which is
based on the extensive use of high performance computers and instrumentation.
Current research is conducted in the areas of dielectric resonator antennas,
antennas near lossy media, crosstalk on IC interconnections, material properties
measurements, and microwave hardware description languages and development.
Faculty members are, however, severely limited by inadequate conditions in their
pursuit of research because of insufficient heating and cooling systems, poor
acoustics, and deficient lighting. The most serious problem that impedes
research performance is related to the poor control of temperature and humidity
within research laboratories, which is detrimental to the operation and
maintenance of computers, workstations, and equipment. Funds from the Academic
Research Infrastructure Program will be used to assist the University of
Mississippi in its effort to renovate research and research training space in
the Engineering Science Building, the center for all electrical engineering
research. Renovations will consist of: reconfigured space, an upgrade of
heating, cooling and electrical systems, improved lighting, and installed
acoustic tile. The new facility will eradicate an enduring impediment to the
performance of quality research, and the recruitment, retention, and training of
students and faculty for research careers.
