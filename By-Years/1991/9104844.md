This award provides 50% of the funds needed for the acquisition of a directly
coupled plasma spectrometer (DCP) and a spectrophotometer (SPM) to analyze
natural geologic and synthetic fluids produced in laboratory experiments. The
university is committed to provide the additional funds required to make this
acquisition possible. This equipment ,which will be housed in the Department of
Geological Sciences at Southern Methodist University, will be used extensively
by the PI and his students and by a number of other faculty and graduate
students. The DCP and SPM will be used to determine chemical compositions of
bulk rocks and groundwaters, solubilities of minerals, and mineral fluid
reaction rates.Faculty and students using this equipment will be obtaining
chemical analyses that will be an important component of a diverse set of
research projects. These projects will include studies of : weathering and soil
formation, global cycling of carbon dioxide, paleohydrology in different
terrains, and fluid-rock interaction during metamorphism and mantle
metasomatism.
