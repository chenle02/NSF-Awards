This award supports U.S. Ph.D. student travel to a doctoral consortium held at
ICRA 2014 in Hong Kong, China, from May 31 to June 7, 2014. The goal of the
doctoral consortium is to highlight the research work of US Ph.D. students. This
gives an opportunity for the students to interact with senior faculty and get
feedback on their work. Participants and recipients of this travel support will
be selected by the 2014 ICRA organizing committee based on their thesis work.
Participating in a conference is a critical component of graduate student
development. This award aims to have a diverse representation of participants in
terms of gender, ethnic background, academic institution, and geographic
location.
