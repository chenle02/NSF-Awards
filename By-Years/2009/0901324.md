The objective of this research is to understand and develop novel graded-grating
plasmonic nanostructures, capable of simultaneously slowing or stopping of light
at multiple wavelengths, the so-called trapped "rainbow" effect. The approach
exploits recent breakthroughs in simulation of metallic nanostructures, and
introduces novel designs for this unique nanoplasmonic platform that will enable
broadband trapping of light in photonic chips at arbitrary temperatures.
Applications include optical buffers for ultra-high capacity optical
communications.

Intellectual Merit

The vision of this research is to trap and release broadband light at telecom
wavelengths through coupling to surface plasmon polariton (SPP) modes in novel
graded-grating nanoplasmonic structures. Innovative design and fabrication
schemes are advanced to overcome current fundamental performance limitations.
Physical mechanisms and performance metrics are investigated by FDTD numerical
simulation, including mechanisms for multi-wavelength trapping and release,
light coupling enhancement, propagation loss, and pathways for increasing the
photon lifetime of SPP modes. Selected experiments will be performed to validate
simulations, fabricate nanoplasmonic test structures, and perform near-field
imaging of the SPP modes. If successful, it would create a new paradigm for
optical buffers in photonic integrated circuits.

Broader Impact

This research will provide exciting multidisciplinary educational opportunities
for graduate and undergraduate students, directly impact Lehigh's photonics
curriculum track, and promote K-12 outreach. The research promises fundamental
breakthroughs in optical science, could have a transformative impact in the
critical field of photonic integrated circuits. If successful it could open the
door to commercial enterprises, and have a huge impact on high-capacity optical
fiber communications by enabling long sought after optical buffers.
