This award in mathematical physics supports basic research into the
mathematical foundations of statistical mechanical systems, quantum field
theories and fluid dynamics. Multiscale analysis or renormalization group
techniques will be applied to study solutions of incompressible fluid dynamics,
represented by the Navier-Stokes equations. A long term goal is provide a
rigorous basis for understanding turbulence phenomena.
