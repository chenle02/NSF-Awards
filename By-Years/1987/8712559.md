The University of New Mexico is being supported to establish a Research
Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) SITE. The purpose of this SITE is to
provide meaningful hands-on research opportunities in contemporary chemistry for
outstanding undergraduate students under the supervision of experienced research
chemists. The Program will support 9 undergraduate students for the summer of
1987, of which almost half will come from other institutions. The research
activities will include the following: o Development of the Differential
Polarization Microscope o Organic Synthesis of Sterols related to Cholesterol o
Interactions of Polymers with singlet molecular oxygen o Preparation of new
ceramic materials
