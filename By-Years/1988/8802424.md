Workshops in geometric topology will be held in three successive years. In 1988
John P. Hempel of Rice University will be the principal speaker at Colorado
College. His subject will be 3-manifold theory. The 1989 workshop will be held
at Brigham Young University, and the 1990 workshop, at Oregon State University.
Appropriate principal speakers will be selected. This series of workshops has a
history going back five years. The host institutions will provide honoraria for
the principal speakers and most of the local costs. NSF will provide modest
travel and subsistence expenses for participants.
