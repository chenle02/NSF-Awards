This project involves the analysis of helium and oxygen isotope, and strontium-
neodymium-lead isotopes in samples of young lavas from the Rungwe, South Kivu,
Virunga and Toro- Ankole volcanic provinces of the East African Rift. A diverse
suite of rock types will be analyzed. These samples are petrologically well
characterized, well located, many have been dated by K-Ar, and some are now
being studied for Os isotopes. Isotopic variability will be investigated at
three different scales; along the rift, within volcanic fields, and within
individual volcanoes. The coherent data set will provide constraints on the
petrogenesis of these various rock types in a young continental rift, the nature
of the associated fluid and melt transport from the mantle to the crust, and a
better understanding of mantle and lithospheric sources in the magmatic
development of the East African Rift system.
