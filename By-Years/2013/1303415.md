The PI will work on several fundamental problems in algebraic geometry with a
focus on compact moduli spaces of stable curves and stable surfaces (introduced
by Kollar, Shepherd-Barron, and Alexeev). One of the goals is to introduce and
describe various effective divisors on these moduli spaces and study how they
affect their birational geometry. New methods of constructing stable surfaces of
general type are proposed, with the moduli space of simply connected fake del
Pezzo surfaces studied in detail.

Algebraic geometry studies algebraic varieties: shapes defined by systems of
polynomial equations. Varieties are classified by discrete (topological) and
continuous (geometric) parameters, called moduli. The study of the moduli space
allows us to understand all possible geometric structures on a given shape. The
proposed research program has several points of contact with other disciplines,
for example introduction of Landau-Ginzburg models made moduli spaces of
varieties of general type attractive to physicists.
