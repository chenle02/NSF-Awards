The investigation concerns the study of generalized zeta functions and the
concept of analytic torsion. Topological questions will be considered along with
the dynamics of holomorphic vector fields on complex manifolds. Applications to
several deep questions in mathematical physics concerning holomorphic dynamics,
are envisaged.
