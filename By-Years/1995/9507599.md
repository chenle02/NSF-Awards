Zedeno With National Science Foundation support Dr. Maria Zedeno will analyze a
sample of archaeological ceramics from the site of Point of Pines located in
east-central Arizona. The site saw the development of large multi-ethnic
communities between ca. AD 1250 to 1400. It presents a strong prehistoric case
for migration and co-residence and well dated architecture and human remains
provide a secure background for the proposed ceramic study. Dr. Zedeno will
identify local ceramic traditions, nonlocal ceramics obtained before migration
occurred, nonlocal ceramics associated with immigration episodes, local
manufacture of foreign pots, and development of hybrid technologies. This will
be accomplished through the application of neutron activation and petrographic
analyses to 20 samples of decorated and plainware shreds and the reconstruction
of manufacturing technology. A survey to identify and sample raw material
sources will also be conducted. One goal of archaeologists is to trace the
movement and intermingling of different cultural groups and often this is
extremely difficult to do given the limited nature of the archaeological record.
The Point of Pines region is important because data derived from a number of
sources indicates that just such immigration and mingling did occur. Because of
its widespread use and its durability, abundant pottery remains are recovered on
many sites and Dr. Zedeno will use the controlled Point of Pines situation to
determine how ceramics are affected by these social processes. The work is
important not for the information it will provide about this site but because
the insight gained will provide a useful archaeological tool which can be used
to analyze ceramics in many parts of the world. The potential impact of this
research is extremely broad.
