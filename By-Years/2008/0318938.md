This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop
chemical strategies for the fabrication of membrane protein microarrays.
Membrane proteins are important to many aspects of biomedical research because a
major percentage of drug targets are membrane bound. Thus, the ability to
fabricate membrane protein arrays will greatly aid the drug discovery process.
In principle, the success of a membrane protein array requires two critical
ingredients: (1) the membrane must be immobilized on a solid surface with
sufficient robustness to survive repeated contacts with liquid environment under
physiological conditions ; and (2) protein molecules must be present in the
membrane environment with sufficient membrane mobility to ensure their activity.
The fine balance between these two factors requires the understanding and
development of necessary surface chemistry. This Phase I project will
demonstrate that such a balance could be achieved by controlling the
electrostatic interaction between the supported membrane and the solid surface.
The research is centered around this hypothesis and includes two specific aims:
(1) to develop robust lipid membrane bilayers supported on a solid surface based
on electrostatic interactions , and (2) to immobilize membrane proteins and
demonstrate their functions in protein-ligand interactions using a model system:
opioid receptors.

The commercial application of this project is in the area of membrane protein
microarray technology. The technology is expected to accelerate efforts aimed at
drug discovery and development.
