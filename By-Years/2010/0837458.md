Engineering - Electrical (55)

This project seeks to increase students' knowledge about the technology used in
forensic investigation with an emphasis on biometrics. Two new courses are being
developed to achieve this. The first course is an upper-level course for
electrical and computer engineering students and focuses on the use of signal
processing in biometrics. This course is taught with a forensic project theme
where students are asked to identify an unknown individual from biometric clues.
The second course is a general education course that is available to all
students and covers the basic principles and technologies of biometrics and the
social and ethical issues surrounding their use. This course educates a broader
and more diverse group of students and also exposes students who may be
undecided about their education to engineering. Students in both courses
participate in hands-on biometric experiments in a common biometrics laboratory.
Undergraduate research projects also utilize the biometrics laboratory. The
project includes a detailed assessment and evaluation plan that uses a concept
inventory style instrument to measure student learning.
