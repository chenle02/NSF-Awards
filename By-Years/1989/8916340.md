Emplacement of magmas represents one of the major processes in orogenic belts
for transferring heat and materials from mantle and lower crustal levels. One of
the accepted models for the forceful emplacement of plutons is that of
"ballooning" or in situ inflation of a diapir. However, many of the features
used to support ballooning can also develop during other types of emplacement.
This project will re-examine several classic plutons thought to have formed by
ballooning using modern micro- structural analysis and porphyroblast-matrix
relationships to develop and constrain thermo-mechanical models for each. The
results from this study will have important implications for the emplacement of
granitoids, particularly the nature and timing of deformation/metamorphism in
orogenic belts, and for the process of transferring heat and magma in the crust.
