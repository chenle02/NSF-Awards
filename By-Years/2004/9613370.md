9613370 Richey Toward an Integrated Regional Model of River Basins of the
Pacific Rim This research will contribute to the creation of a regional-scale,
integrated model of the active processes and functioning of river basin systems
within the Pacific Rim. The PI will focus on the development and application of
spatial modeling and data synthesis with a particular emphasis on East and
Southeast Asia. Data from the Changjiang (China), Mekong (SE Asia) and Cagayani
(philippines) Rivers will be used in a modification of a model structure
originally developed for the Amazon basin. The investigation will specifically
address issues related to the space and time scale of physical data used to
define, characterize, and model large river basins.
