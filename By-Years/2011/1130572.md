How can we explain the widely observed mismatch between voter support for
redistributive policies and actual levels of redistribution achieved? In
contrast to most extant research, this project focuses on the redistributive
role of tax policy. The project relies on an analysis of state-level
administrative data as well as an analysis of media coverage to pursue three
substantive goals: It examines how political, institutional, and organizational
factors have affected variation in tax progressivity across states. It also
examines whether the way tax rates are structured subsequently affects the
redistributive character of state expenditure policies. Finally, the proposed
research investigates how the way tax issues are framed in public discourse
affects voter support for redistributive policies. In addition, the project
seeks to develop a way to measure actual voter support for redistributive
policies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The general public has
repeatedly demonstrated a pronounced interest in how taxes are used to finance
entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare. Federal income tax
progressivity has declined in recent years, while noticeable state-level
differences in income tax policies persist. This research will produce a
comprehensive data set of value to the public. Findings from this study may
further our understanding of the substantial role that taxes play in
redistributive policies. These findings may be of interest to a broad range of
stakeholders, including taxpayers, policy makers, and government officials at
all levels.
