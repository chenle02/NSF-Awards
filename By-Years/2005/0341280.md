This project is building an educational software engineering simulation
environment, called SimSE, and is demonstrating how students benefit from using
this simulation environment in gaining both a broad and deep understanding of
the software development process. This tool provides the missing process
experience that is a key part of the gap between the skills taught in a typical
software engineering course and the skills needed to successfully function in an
industrial software development project. SimSE addresses this gap by introducing
students to many aspects of the software process in a virtual environment that
fosters experimental, interactive, and independent learning. SimSE addresses
specific situations, such as inspections or integration testing, and overarching
practices, such as the waterfall model or the spiral model. This tackles issues
that can be taught abstractly, but are difficult for students to practice and
experience comprehensively in lectures or class projects.&lt;br/&gt;
