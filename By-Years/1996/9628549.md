9628549 Johnson During the Mesozoic a well developed continental magmatic arc
was active along the Pacific margin of the U.S., which by late Cretaceous to
early tertiary time became fragmented and extensively rearranged by the
development of extensional collapse and San Andreas transform faulting. The
Salinian Black is a displaced and distinded fragment of the central link of this
arc. The Gualala Basin contains late cretaceous -early tertiary conglomerates
related to this fragmentation, thus provides an opportunity to help track
tectonic blocks of arc rocks by examining affinities of the basin's cobbles and
conglomerates. This work is to use modern isotopic analysis to establish
lithologic and temporal links between cobbles in the Gualala Basin and proposal
source terranes. Definitive correlation's produced would be valuable in
dueriminating between the several extant models for the collapse and
fragmentation of this arc.
