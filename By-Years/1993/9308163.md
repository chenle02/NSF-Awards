9308163 Schunk The proposed research is a continuation of theoretical studies of
the effects that plasma transport processes have on the ionosphere. The proposed
research spans a 3-year period and will be conducted by five senior scientists,
two postdoctoral fellows, and a graduate student. The research involves
model/data and model/model comparisons, theoretical studies of ionospheric
dynamics and electrodynamics, ionospheric outflow studies (polar wind), and
certain plasmaspheric studies. The overall scientific approach is to consider
the ionosphere as an integrated system, which interacts with both the
magnetosphere and thermosphere. The various members of the group will study
different, but related, ionospheric problems, with the result that almost all of
the major ionospheric regions will be studied, including the E-region, F-region,
and topside ionosphere at equatorial, middle, and high latitudes. In the course
of the studies, certain models will be upgraded and/or improved, but the bulk of
the proposed studies will be conducted with existing ionospheric, plasmaspheric,
polar wind, and electrodynamic models. The proposed research is directly related
to one of the main goals of both the international/STEP and NSF/CEDAR programs,
which is to elucidate the processes linking the ionosphere-magnetosphere-
thermosphere system. ***
