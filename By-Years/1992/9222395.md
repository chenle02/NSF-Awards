The principal investigator was previously funded by NSF/ATM to initiate an
experimental science education project in the Bronx public school system. The
project is entitled the District Eleven Weather Study Program (DEWS). Its
primary object is to demonstrate that when fourth-, fifth-, and sixth-grade
students are given the opportunity to participate in highly-motivational
activities in weather study, they will acquire skills in basic scientific
procedures, positive attitudes towards the study of science, and a greater
awareness of career opportunities in the sciences, especially in meteorology.
The DEWS program is a successful activity within the Bronx public school system
and has required only intermitted and nominal NSF support. Recent events
prompted the principal investigator to request additional support from NSF under
a new proposal. The support under thiss award will be used to partially cover
the increased cost of weather data received under the UNIDATA contract with
Zephyr Weather Information Service, Inc.;
