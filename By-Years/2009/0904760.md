This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is centered around the
study of complex version of the very famous Ricci flow, Kahler-Ricci flow. Many
closely related objects, for example, complex Monge-Ampere equation, are also
discussed in order to achieve deeper understanding. The ultimate goal and
original motivation would be to provide a geometric analysis point of view for
algebraic geometry objects of great interests, for example, minimal model or
general big line bundle. Meanwhile, using this flow in a more extensive way has
been bringing up intriguing problems in geometry and analysis. One classic
theory in the study of several complex variables, pluripotential theory, turns
out to play a crucial role. The methods and techniques improved or invented
during the process have been attracting wider attention far beyond these
research fields, thus strengthening the fruitful cross-field
collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are motivations and impacts of this
proposal beyond the study of pure mathematics itself. The results of the
research will be broadly disseminated to the scientific community using
traditional channels (publications, conference talks, etc.) and electronic media
(electronic preprint server, personal web-site, etc.). There have been quite
some seminars, workshops and conferences on this research and related topics in
and out of the United States. With the help from NSF, the exchange of ideas can
be promoted to a whole new level. Similar to most fundamental research, its
benefits to the society are usually not so immediate. The challenge we created
for ourselves has been one of the most fundamental driving force to make this a
better world. In the mean time, any research that improves our understanding of
the world, being its physical models or abstract mathematical world, can
potentially yield significant benefits, but it will likely take a while before
these benefits eventually get materialized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
