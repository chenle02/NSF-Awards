Language comprehension is an amazing phenomenon. Sound waves hit your ears, or
squiggles on a page impinge on your retina, and with no awareness of the
processes that unfold, you end up with the impression of understanding events
and worlds that you have never experienced before. How does this happen? For the
past 50 years, the dominant view has been that language comprehension is
fundamentally a process of abstract symbol manipulation, much like the way that
variables are manipulated by computer programs. With funding from NSF, Rolf
Zwaan and Michael Kaschak will investigate an alternative to the dominant view
of language processing. They will conduct experiments to test the hypothesis
that language comprehension makes use of the body's systems of perception and
action planning. On this hypothesis, the actions and events described in
language are understood as if the comprehender is actually experiencing them
firsthand. For instance, when understanding a sentence such as, "The car
approached you," it is hypothesized that comprehenders will recruit those
components of their visual system that would be active if they were actually
perceiving an approaching car, even though there is no car in the surrounding
environment. This hypothesis will be tested by studying 1) the planning of
perception and action during language comprehension, 2) the retrieval of
perceptual and motor information from memory during language comprehension, and
3) the role of the body in comprehending language that describes the actions of
other people.
