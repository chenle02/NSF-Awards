9408323 Harnishfeger The goal of this RPG project is to investigate
developmental changes in cognitive inhibition in children's memory performance.
Cognitive inhibition is defined as the process of actively suppressing
previously activated cognitive contents of cognitive processes. The theoretical
basis of this research is that children's cognitive inhibition increases in
efficiency with age over the middle childhood years, and this increasing
efficiency contributes to developmental improvements in memory performance. This
research will focus on one specific form of inhibition, retrieval inhibition,
which has been identified as a central component of performance in directed-
forgetting memory tasks. Results from this research will be important in the
continuing attempt to determine the underlying bases for age-related
improvements in memory and cognitive processing.
