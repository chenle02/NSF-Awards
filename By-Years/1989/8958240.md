This Presidential Young Investiator award is to support research into protein
trafficking of immunologically important molecules. This award will support a
promising young investigator/teacher at the University of Texas, Austin.
Experimental approaches to be employed include in vitro mutagenesis/gene
transfer, biochemistry and cytology. Questions being asked include what
constitutes a signal for endocytosis of histocompatibility antigens. This
research has fundamental importance to our understanding of the immune system,
especially the role of endocytotic and exocytotic processes of the plasma
membrane and its component parts on immune function.
