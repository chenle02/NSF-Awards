ABSTRACT James Goodwin CTS-9312519 This is study of the effects of readsorption
and diffusion in solid-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis (SSITKA).
Several modelling techniques, including nondimensionalizing,
compartmentalization, and parameter lumping, are used in modelling the
processes. Laplace transforms produce model transients for comparison to
experiments. The important parameters of readsorption and diffusion effecting
SSITKA are determined. Readsorption is modeled without diffusion or reaction,
and these parameters are then added sequentially. Intraparticle diffusion is
treated similarly, and the two approaches combined into a total SSITKA model.
Solid-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis is a powerful method for the
study of catalytic reactions and provides kinetic and mechanistic information
that often is otherwise unobtainable. This effort will add a major element of
finesse to the technique and should make SSITKA data more useful for process and
reactor design.
