This project is investigating the use of wormhole networks in supporting cache-
coherent multiprocessors. Cache coherence gtraffic, characterized by fixed
length messages that arrive in bursts, is generated by an execution-driven
simulator. This traffic is used to evaluate alternative message scheduling
schemes, adaptive routing schemes, virtual channels, and interface designs. New
coherence and synchronization schemes are being developed and evaluated as part
of this research. The project is divided into three phases. In the first phase
the effect of congestion in the interconnection network in performane of cache-
coherent multiprocessors is being investigated. The second phase emphasizes the
development of techniques to reduce cache coherence traffic and invalidation
time. The third phase is the development of new protocols that use wormhole
networks effectively.
