The Extensible Terascale Facility (ETF), or "TeraGrid" involves nine resource
providers (RP's) operating high-performance computing, information, and
visualization facilities interconnected with a dedicated optical network and
integrated with a set of common software that presents the user community with a
cohesive set of resources and services. On October 1, 2004, the ETF will
conclude a three-year construction effort to create this distributed environment
and will transition into an operational state. This proposal outlines a set of
services to be provided at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) as part of the
TeraGrid system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ORNL RP's goal is to bring a new
scientific community to the TeraGrid - Neutron Science, and to provide them with
computing and data storage resources needed to make full use of next generation
neutron sources. Neutron scattering provides a unique probe of the structure and
dynamics of materials. It has found application in many fields, including
nanoscience, polymer science, chemistry, soft condensed matter, biotechnology,
biology, materials science, metallurgy, solid-state physics, semiconductor
manufacturing, engineering, earth sciences, genomics, and proteomics. A next-
generation neutron source, the $1.4 billion Spallation Neutron Source (SNS), is
being built by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) at ORNL. The SNS has an order
of magnitude greater flux than any other facility in the world. Neutron
scattering centers provide beam time on a peer-reviewed merit basis to
researchers in all areas of science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With over a thousand
users a year, these facilities are national and international scientific
resources. Recent facilities upgrades and the commissioning of SNS will greatly
increase beam intensities and available beam time. Foreseeing the massive
increase in data, the neutron-science community is discussing how to proceed.
They recognize the need for new ways to manage data to optimize both beam time
and scientific output. &lt;br/&gt;The ORNL RP effort focuses on bridging the
Neutron Science (particularly the SNS) and Computational Science communities to
provide transparent access to the massive TeraGrid computing and data storage
resources. The ORNL RP is creating and will operate an enclave to make Neutron
Science data streams and data stores available for reduction and analysis on
TeraGrid resources and to facilitate the comparison of experimental data with
computational simulation. The ORNL RP construction effort is building the
network and computer systems infrastructure needed to access the SNS through the
TeraGrid. The early operations effort will bring TeraGrid resources to Neutron
Science users by operating the resources built during the ETF construction phase
and continuing to develop the infrastructure to enable neutron scientists to use
the TeraGrid to leverage their work. The ORNL RP effort is also exploring
collaborative opportunities with other Neutron facilities in the US and
internationally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
