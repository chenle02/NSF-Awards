This is the first year of a three-year continuing award. The research focuses
on analytical and experimental study of dynamical dexterity in robotic
manipulation, addressing fundamental issues in planning, coordination, and
effective use of limited sensory capabilities. The research builds on the PI's
previous research on robot juggling of objects in two dimensions; this will now
be extended to three dimensions. The paradigm of juggling demands a holistic,
task-oriented approach to planning and control, involving tracking of one or
several objects in space, trajectory matching, making compliant intermittent
contact or impact, and coupling of sensing and manipulation in real time. The
results should provide a rich addition to the knowledge base for design and
execution of a wide variety of robotic tasks including dynamical manipulation of
objects on the fly for rapid assembly-line operations, and some forms of dynamic
legged locomotion.
