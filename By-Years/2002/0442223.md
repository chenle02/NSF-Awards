An integrated approach focusing on synthesis and characterization of new
membrane materials for fuel cell applications is proposed. In addition to
nanoclays, nanohybrid membranes will be synthesized using nanospheres and 3D
nanoporous inorganics. To that end, random structured xerogels and 3D meso and
nanoporous silica and zeolites will be investigated. Besides Nafion, we plan to
include other polymers including newly developed poly(arylenethioether) sulfones
at AFRL/MLBP. The proposed work provides a framework for rationally developing
new proton exchange membranes and combines the expertise in nanocomposites at
Cornell, nanoparticles technology at UOP, polymers for fuel cells at AFRL/MLBP
and testing and evaluation at MTI MicroFuel Cells.

Proton exchange membrane fuel cells offer significant advantages as clean and
efficient energy conversion systems. One of the big challenges facing the
scientific community is to engineer a membrane material that fulfills all
materials requirements, is inexpensive and endures the aggressive fuel-cell
environment for a long period of time. The objective of this program is to
design and develop nanohybrid proton membranes, which combine high proton
conductivity (especially at low relative humidity/high temperature), low gas
permeability and methanol crossover, decreased swelling, and mechanical
robustness for fuel cell applications. The Approaches to Combat Terrorism
Program in the Directorate for Mathematics and Physical Sciences supports new
concepts in basic research and workforce development with the potential to
contribute to national security.
