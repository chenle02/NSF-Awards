TECHNICAL AND NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In July 2015, the
University of Washington will be hosting the 12th International Symposium on
Functional pi-Electron Systems. This is an international meeting that is held
every two years and focuses on the latest developments in the area of organic
semiconducting materials. Organic semiconducting materials are an exciting class
of materials with applications in the area of flexible electronic devices with
the potential of being embedded into textiles or used in tactile sensors or
electronic skin. They are already being used as the active material in a number
of commercially available electronic devices such as organic light-emitting
diodes (OLEDs) in cellphone displays. More recently, much effort has been put
forth towards developing organic semiconducting materials for use in flexible
organic photovoltaics (OPVs). Flexible OPVs represent a unique opportunity in
renewable energy where organic semiconducting materials can afford high power-
generation-to-weight ratios that will simultaneously reduce the module,
installation, and transportation costs associated with these devices.
Furthermore, there is increasing interest in the area of bioelectronics to
enable electronic devices that can directly communicate with our bodies.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three primary goals for this conference: (i)
Provide a forum where scientists who work in this area of research can share
their latest results with each other to accelerate mutual knowledge, progress in
the field, and international collaborations; (ii) To make sure that the US
remains a leader in the area of organic semiconducting materials by hosting this
conference that has not been held in the US in six years, and in this way also
to enable US students and other attendees to obtain the latest knowledge in this
field; (iii) To increase diversity of the scientists who work in this area of
research, and enhance participation of women and underrepresented minorities and
their inclusion among invited speakers in the conference.
