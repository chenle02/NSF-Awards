This three-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research in structural
biology involves Palmer Taylor of the University of California at San Diego and
Pascale Marchot of the University of Aix Marseille II in Marseille, France. The
objective of their research is to investigate the interaction of the enzyme
acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and its neurotoxin, inhibitor fasciculin 2. They
propose to obtain a crystal of the apoenzyme and analyze the kinetics of the
enzyme-toxin interaction. The project takes advantage of complementary expertise
of the U.S. and French investigators and provides access to synchrotron
facilities in France. It will advance our understanding of the mode of
interaction between enzymes and toxins.
