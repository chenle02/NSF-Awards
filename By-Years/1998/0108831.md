This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is designed to
build a prototype miniature fiber optic NOx sensor for the control of auto
emissions. The proposed sensor is based upon a company invention on miniature
chemilluminescence detector for gas chromatography. The prototype will be
miniature in size (4 cubic inch approximately), weight (1/2 lb) and capable of
ppt level detection as a result of the innovative design.

Commercial applications will focus on pollution monitoring, insitu auto NOx
emission monitoring and reduction, and biochemical/drug analysis when coupled
with a miniature catalytic converter.
