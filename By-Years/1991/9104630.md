The long-term objective of this research is to determine the growth conditions
that limit the structural perfection of protein crystals and, thus, the
structural information obtainable by diffraction techniques. Towards this end,
the growth kinetics of selected proteins will be studied and correlated to
growth morphology and x-ray diffraction resolution. The growth kinetics and
morphology will be investigated in a temperature controlled microscope-stage
growth cell using transmission differential interference contrast and reflection
interference microscopy in combination with digital image processing.
