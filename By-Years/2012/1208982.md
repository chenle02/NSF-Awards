High dimensional data are becoming increasingly available from a wide range of
scientific investigations, including genomics, bioinformatics, engineering, and
climate studies. Sound analysis of such datasets poses many statistical
challenges. It calls for new statistical theory and methods as well as new
technical tools. In this collaborative research project, the investigators will
first develop results and technical tools in random matrix theory and then take
a unified approach using the technical tools developed to study several
important problems in high dimensional statistics as well as applications in
signal processing, physics, and mathematics.

The statistical and scientific objectives outlined in this proposal are
interdisciplinary and will establish connections among different fields - random
matrix theory, high dimensional statistics, signal processing, physics, and
mathematics. The research will also provide technical tools as well as
methodology, to researchers in other scientific fields who collect and analyze
high dimensional data. These include, but are not limited to, genomics,
biostatistics, and electrical engineering. The procedures and algorithms
developed in this project will be implemented and softwares developed will be
made freely and publicly available on the web as open source code along with the
associated research reports so as to facilitate the dissemination of knowledge.
