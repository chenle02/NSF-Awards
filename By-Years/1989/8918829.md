Experimental investigations on the stability of the interface between an arsenic
overlayer on a silicon substrate, and between silicon films and high-Tc oxide
substrates. In the arsenic- silicon work, low-energy electron diffraction will
be employed to determine structural changes caused by varying temperature and
arsenic coverage. Exploratory studies on the effect of adding gallium to the
arsenic-silicon interfaces will also be carried out. In the high-Tc oxide-
silicon work, electron spectroscopies will be used to determine the thermal
dependence of chemical reactions between the superconductors and silicon.
