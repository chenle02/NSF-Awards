Cold air masses crossing relatively warm lake waters account for many important
features of winter weather in the Great Lakes Region. In addition, local snow
storms, called lake-effect storms, form in the vicinity of the downwind shores
and inundate lake shore communities with heavy snow. The structure of these
storms as well as the effects the Great Lakes have on large weather systems is
an important topic both scientifically and practically. Under National Science
Foundation sponsorship a field program was held near Lake Michigan during the
winter of 1983-84. Data from aircraft, surface stations, satellites, upper-air
soundings and radar were successfully collected on a number of well- organized
lake-snow events. The Principal Investigator will continue analysis of this rich
data set. Two primary goals are to develop a three-dimensional model of the low
level flow atmospheric flow structure that is responsible for the locally heavy
snows and to provide a quantitative model of the details of the cloud and snow
processed within these storms. //
