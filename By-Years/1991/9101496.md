Professor Xia will study the C*-algebras of random singular integral operators
and Toeplitz operators associated with n- dimensional flows. He will analyze the
ideal structure in these algebras and address questions such as their
solvability. He will compute the K-groups of certain important sub-C*-algebras
and their ideals with the goal of classifying these kinds of algebras. Professor
Xia's project deals with C*-algebras. These algebras are families of Hilbert
space operators each of which can be thought of as an infinite matrix of complex
numbers. The algebras which Professor Xia will consider consist of operators
which arise in more applied fields such as the study of partial differential
equations.
