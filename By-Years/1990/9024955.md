Advances in the fabrication of alloys have led to an increased emphasis on
accurate structural characterization. The research conducted here involves a
study of the internal strains in random solid solutions caused by the size
effect of the different atoms. Recent work has shown that analytic solutions are
possible in terms of simple lattice integrals which characterize the topological
rigidity of the lattice. The many body aspects of dense random arrays of
overlapping strain fields are emphasized. The aim of the research is to produce
analytical results for physical quantities that can be experimentally measured.
These include the Bragg and Huang components of x-ray and neutron diffraction,
and the mean and variance of the near neighbor distances obtained from EXAFS
experiments. The analytic work will be verified by computer simulations using
realistic potentials to generate relaxed samples from which quantities of
experimental interest can be extracted. This unified approach will be applied to
semiconductors, FCC metals and rare gas solids.
