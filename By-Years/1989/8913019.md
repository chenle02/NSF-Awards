The emerging field of biotechnology has resulted in the need for the
establishment of engineering principles for the manufacture of proteins, cells
and other cell products. This field is also expanding into the area of tissue
engineering. Critical for the development of this field is a forum where
engineers and scientists can present and discuss scientific and engineering
principles for both animal cell culture processes and tissue engineering. To
facilitate this, the Engineering Foundation has agreed to sponsor this
conference in Santa Barbara, California, from December 3 to December 8, 1989.
The participants of the conference are to be from various universities,
industries and government laboratories. A special effort is to be made to
attract young investigators.
