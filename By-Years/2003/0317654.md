This award will test whether tropical Holocene climate was subject to decadal to
millennial scale changes in rainfall amount associated with the El Nino/Southern
Oscillation (ENSO), which is the largest source of interannual climate
variability on the isthmus of Panama, and/or solar irradiance changes. Isotopic
paleoclimate proxy records from Central American stalagmites covering the
Holocene will be generated and compared with proxy and meteorological records of
ENSO, solar irradiance, and temperature. The primary objective of this research
is to document Holocene ENSO and rainfall variability. The records will be
produced using mass spectrometric methods to analyze the stable isotopes of
oxygen, deuterium, and carbon in water and carbonate, radiogenic U-series
isotopes to determine stalagmite chronology, and annual layer thickness counts
where appropriate. This research is original and pertinent and should make
important contributions to understanding of ENSO variability through the
Holocene. Data developed during this study should be useful for comparisons and
correlations to other tropical paleoclimate records.
