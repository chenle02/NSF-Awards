This research project is centered on development of improved numerical
algorithms for application to large-scale systems that include, for example,
signal/image/video reconstruction and processing, bioinformatics, and automated
learning or mining of information from very large data sets. Operator splitting
is a class of methods that decomposes a difficult problem into simple sub-
problems. Within the past decade, operator splitting methods gained popularity
due to the growing demand to handle ever-larger models. For example, signal
processing and machine learning applications often have multiple parts that are
easy to handle separately but are very challenging when combined. Ideas from
operator splitting have led to efficient algorithms for broad classes of
objective functions that are used to define the underlying systems. There is
still, however, much to be done to handle complex situations. Through further
development of operator splitting techniques, this research has the potential to
provide efficient and stable approaches to solve a yet wider class of
challenging problems. The project also includes educational impact through the
development of courses, presentation of seminars, and graduate student training
opportunities.

The principal investigator intends to design and implement algorithms that
improve the speed and stability of operator splitting methods. This project aims
to extend the principle of operator splitting in two ways. First, operator
splitting algorithms will be introduced that recognize infeasible and feasible-
but-unbounded optimization problems, as well as those that have finite optimal
values but unattainable solutions. Such pathological problems are not rare and
cripple existing techniques. The new algorithms will address these pathologies
and make future solvers more robust. Second, by incorporating second-order
information in a novel fashion, the project will address two significant
drawbacks of operator splitting algorithms. These are the slow tail convergence,
and the sensitivity to severe problem conditions. Techniques to ensure global
convergence will be developed. Because operator splitting is a high-level
abstraction, the results of the project will apply to a broad range of numerical
methods that arise in science and engineering.
