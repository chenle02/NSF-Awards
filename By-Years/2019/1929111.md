This project will enable up to 7 students from educational institutions in the
US to attend the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)
Communications Society Conference on Sensing, Communication, and Networking
(SECON) conference - SECON 2019, to be held in Boston June 10 - 13, 2019. The
conference has established itself as the IEEE Communication Society's premier
venue for research in sensor, mesh, ad hoc networks and cyber physical systems.
This award will especially benefit students who identify as members of under-
represented groups (women, minorities and people with disabilities), and
students who are attending the conference for the first time, from universities
not represented in the conference program.

Conference attendance is an integral part of the life of a researcher. By
creating new opportunities for students, especially those from under-represented
groups, to attend a high-quality conference, this project will benefit the
research community in several ways. The students themselves benefit from (1) the
opportunity to meet and interact with many other researchers in a favorable
setting; (2) seeing research presented that may be related to what they are
working on; and (3) the inspiration to pursue new directions. Leading
conferences such as SECON also provide an opportunity for students to interact
with industry researchers and recruiters helping pave the way for the next step
in their careers. The research community benefits from the training and
experience of the students in the pipeline, and the introduction of new diverse
research perspectives.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
