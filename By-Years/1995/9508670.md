950870 Phaff This award provides partial support for the transfer of a large
collection of yeasts and yeast-like organisms to long-term storage in liquid
nitrogen, and for the systematic transfer of strain records and other
information about the collection to a computerized form where it will be readily
accessible by others. The collection consists of strains isolated by the PI from
desert environments over a period in excess of fifty years. The collection is of
proven and potential importance for both basic and applied biological research.
The effort supported through this award will help to insure continued
availability of the collection and will facilitate access to information about
the content and diversity of the collection. ***
