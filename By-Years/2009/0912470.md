This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will focus on developing
a desktop-specific distributed architecture to provide enterprise grade, highly
available and scalable virtual desktop systems that cost no more than a regular
PC. In order to accomplish this, the focus of the research will be 1) to create
a seamless, scalable and self-managed distributed fabric that is easy to deploy
and 2) to develop an approach that will allow the distribution of large desktop
templates (in the order of tens of gigabytes) to tens of thousands of desktops
in less than an hour.

This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project takes advantage of a
sizable and growing demand for virtual desktops that offer lower management
costs and superior data security. However, existing solutions on the market many
times the cost of regular PCs and require highly skilled personnel to operate,
thus hampering their adoption. If the research team is able to overcome the
technical challenges and create a solution that costs no more than a regular PC,
it may be able to open up the market consisting of an installed base of 500
million commercial desktop PCs with 84 million new units purchased each year
worldwide.
