9414335 Bucksbaum This proposal to study, "High Intensity Laser-Atom and
Molecule Interactions", is for research into the behavior of atoms and molecules
under the high optical fields associated with high intensity lasers. Under such
conditions the systems become highly non-linear and by using very short pulse
durations (compared to natural decay times) coherent control can be exercised on
the electron states. The proposal will examine the role of coherence in atomic
and molecular stabilization, study control in autoionizing and field-ionizing
systems, and study recently proposed connections between strong field phenomena
such as ATI and high harmonic generation, and classical scattering models. ***
