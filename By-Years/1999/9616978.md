Proposal AST 96-16978 PI: Roberta Humphreys Institution: University of
Minnesota-Twin Cities This award supports travel expenses for participants to a
workshop at U. MN on "Proper Motions and Galactic Astronomy". About 50
participants are expected. All-sky surveys (e.g. Hipparchos) in progress provide
new, large, highly accurate databases. These will be particularly useful in
selecting candidates for brown dwarf and extrasolar planet searches, in which
there is a strong current interest. The new data also help tie down the first
step in the distance scale, on which cosmological theories depend. For these
reasons, this is a timely workshop.
