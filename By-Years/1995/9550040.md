ABSTRACT ESI-9550040 This five year project will provide 45-days of physics
content and leadership training each year for 24 Texas physics teachers. One
cohort will begin in the first year and continue for three years while the
second cohort will begin in year three and continue for the final two years.
These 45-days include 2-week summer institutes, a series of academic year(AY)
follow-up workshops on supplementary topics and a series of visits to their
classrooms. Leader teachers can earn 3-semester hour of graduate credit each
year. Those participating for the full three years will be enhanced in all the
typical areas of introductory physics. Following each summer's workshops they
will conduct second tier workshops for colleagues in grades K-12 in their local
district and surrounding districts. These workshops will also provide their
colleagues with a minimum of 100 hours of teacher enhancement. In addition to
professors from Texas A&amp;M University the strong network of Texas physics
teachers built around the Texas Physics Teacher Resource Agents will have an
instructional and networking role in the project.
