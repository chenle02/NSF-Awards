This is a study of the decline in fertility in the American South between 1910
and 1940. Most studies of the transition from high to low fertility has focused
on the national pattern. There were, however, striking regional variations in
the timing and pace of the fertility decline. This study will pay special
attention to the sharp decline in childbearing in rural black families which
took place between 1910 and 1940. Public Use Samples from the 1910 and the 1940
Census will be used. These data will be combined with data on the local area in
which the household lives. This study will provide a significant contribution to
the large literature on the fertility transition by focusing on a part of
American society which has not been much studied earlier. The study will
contribute to our understanding of why couples decided to have fewer children,
and it will in particular shed light on the experiences of rural black families
during the early part of the twentieth century.
