A study will be conducted by the Educational Testing Service (ETS) of the
educational progress of black, Mexican American, Puerto Rican, and American
Indian students of high ability (scoring 550 or above on SAT math and scoring in
the upper quartile on achievement measurement in HS &amp; B) who intend to
enroll in college and to major in mathematics, science, or engineering. Three
cohorts will be studied: (1) the students in high school and beyond who were
high school seniors in 1982 and subsequently were followed up at two-year
intervals; (2) SAT-takers who were high school seniors in 1984; and (3) SAT-
takers who were high school seniors in 1986. All the qualifying SAT-takers will
be surveyed by mail and a randomly selected subsample of at least 100 in each
cohort will be interviewed by telephone. The combination of cross-sectional and
longitudinal data will permit an analysis of variables related to the progress
of the persisters and non-persisters in each cohort at various time points.
Whether these characteristics are changing will be of importance.
