This award is for support of a study of cosmogenic in-situ produced carbon-14 in
polar ice. Carbon-14 produced in-situ has a signature which is distinct from the
trapped atmospheric carbon-14, and can be used as a tracer for ice
accumulation/ablation processes and rates. Work carried out under a previous
grant established that an appreciable amount of in-situ carbon-14 is retained in
firn, and therefore conventional carbon-14 compaction ages can be considerable
underestimates since they do not consider the in-situ component. This study will
examine samples from several ice cores from the Antarctic, including Vostok, the
Dominion Range, McMurdo, South Pole, Allan Hills and the Adelie Coast.
