The international mathematical conference ``Resolution of Singularities,
Valuation Theory and Related Topics'' will be held from June 29 - July 3, 2020
in Zacatecas, Mexico. The conference will be held at the Zacatecan Council of
Science, Technology and Innovation. &lt;br/&gt;The conference will be devoted to
recent progress in singularity theory and valuation theory. This meeting will
allow participants to establish new working relationships with leaders in this
area, and to develop ongoing collaborations. NSF will provide travel and lodging
support for 10 U.S. based participants to the conference. The emphasis on the
funding will be towards students, postdoctoral scholars and young participants
who do not have federal support. A particular emphasis will be on supporting a
diversity of participants, especially from under-represented groups. The

conference is focused on applications of Valuation Theory to Resolution of
Singularities in positive characteristic and to other areas of Algebraic
Geometry, Commutative Algebra and Singularity Theory. Besides local
uniformization in positive and mixed characteristic, applications to local
resolution of vector fields and the Pierce-Birkhoff conjecture will be given.
Recently there have been significant advances in this area, and this conference
will cover this progress in talks by the authors of this work. The gathering
will provide an opportunity for researchers from diverse fields to interact and
establish research connections with each other; in particular, the participants
will benefit from this interaction and from seeing recent developments in the
field and its relationships with other areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
