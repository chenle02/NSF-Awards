Shin This is a project to build and experiment with a multiprocessor for real-
time applications. The multiprocessor will ultimately consist of 19 nodes
arranged in a hexagonal mesh, with each node containing three 68020 processors
for computation, a commercial controller for communications control, and a
custom chip for communications routing. An initial multiprocessor containing
only a few nodes is being developed to allow experimentation that will guide
full-scale construction. Experiments on the system consist largely of synthetic
benchmark programs produced by a workload generator. The workload generator
produces benchmarks that have computation, communication, and deadline
characteristics of several classes of applications, but are easier to vary an
instrument than real applications would be.
