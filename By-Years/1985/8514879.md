International travel support is provided for a participant to attend the
International Symposium on Fuzzy Mathematics in Earthquake Research (ISFMER), to
be held in Beijing, China on September 3-6, 1985. ISFMER is the first scientific
meeting of its kind to be held on an international forum. The application of
fuzzy mathematics to earthquake engineering problems such as damage and hazard
assessments has received increasing attention from researchers and
practitioners. The purpose of this meeting is to provide an opportunity for
scientists and engineers to present ideas, methods, and achievements and to
exchange their experience and information on applications of fuzzy mathematics
to different aspects of earthquake engineering and related fields.
