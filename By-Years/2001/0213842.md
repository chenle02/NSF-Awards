Policy-makers and policy entrepreneurs across the political spectrum tout
community-based environmental protection (CBEP) as the future in environmental
policy. Locally implemented and enforced environmental policies should produce
more democratic, more civic-oriented, less contentious, more inclusive, and more
efficient environmental decisions compared to traditional federal "command-and-
control" environmental regulation. The community -- not federal bureaucrats --
makes the core decisions in implementing policy and evaluating policy tradeoffs.
At the same time, these procedural innovations should yield superior
environmental outcomes because decisions are informed by local knowledge,
involve local stakeholders, and are sensitive to local conditions. In short,
CBEP is supposed to produce better law, better policy, better politics, and
better environmental outcomes.

Enthusiasm notwithstanding, the CBEP model raises a number of serious
questions: Are local environmental "policymakers" able to access and use the
latest and most relevant scientific, engineering, and economic knowledge in
decision-making? Is CBEP actually more inclusive, or do locally-based
environmental decisions become captive of narrow economic and development
interests? Is CBEP really a universal model for American communities, or do
disparities in community wealth and capacity portend uneven (inequitable) levels
of environmental protection across communities? More broadly: Do communities
with substantial control over environmental protection actually attain better
environmental outcomes compared to traditional "command and control" regulation.

To address these questions, this project analyzes the implementation of
Massachusetts' Wetlands Protection Act (MWPA), which has existed as a "natural
experiment" in community-based efforts to protect the environment for over 20
years. We examine two contrasting forms of CBEP: (non-bylaw) communities versus
(bylaw) communities. The non-bylaw approach is a "weak" form of CBEP in which
town (volunteer) conservation commissions act as an implementing agents for the
state Department of Environmental Protection, where state regulations and
oversight strongly proscribe local environmental decision-making (189 towns) in
protecting wetlands. In contrast the bylaw approach is a "strong" form of CBEP
where town (volunteer) conservation commissions act to protect wetlands under
their own locally-produced bylaws and rules, independent of state regulations
and oversight (161 towns).

It is the comparison of these two forms that interests us. In a broad-based
statistical analysis we are examining the record of wetlands protection across
all 351 Massachusetts towns. Combining graphic information system (GIS) data,
site-specific wetlands permitting data, and community socio-economic data we
address the questions posed above in the specific context of wetlands
protection. Our analytic approach involves four innovations over existing
studies. First and foremost we devise a set of consistent, reliable, and
substantively meaningful measures of environmental performance across
communities. Second, we set up a design that controls for the many confounding
influences and characteristics that have plagued the analytic utility of prior
scholarship on CBEP. Third, and derived from the above, we devise consistent and
rigorous measures for categorizing communities most directly relevant to
evaluating environmental decision-making. Fourth we study a single environmental
domain - wetlands - that is broadly salient to community development policy and
politics.
