The Board on International Comparative Studies in Education contributes to a
better understanding of national education policy issues by working to ensure
that data from comparative studies in education are available and are of
adequate quality for policy purposes and curriculum design. The board was
established by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS)--National Research Council
(NRC) in 1988 at the request of the National Center for Education Statistics
(NCES) and the National Science Foundation (NSF). The purposes of the board are
to (1) improve the scope, quality, and utilization of comparative education data
in the United States; (2) serve as a forum for informed deliberation about the
range of international education studies in which the United States
participates; (3) promote institutional mechanisms and commitments to encourage
cooperation in worthwhile studies by other nations; and (4) enhance
infrastructure and research methodology, both nationally and globally. While
board activity relevant to all of these responsibilities serves the policymakers
and the education research community in the United States, the board's influence
extends internationally through its activities related to the latter two
purposes. Also included in this grant is funding for several international
comparative studies, the largest amongst them is the Third International
Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS).
