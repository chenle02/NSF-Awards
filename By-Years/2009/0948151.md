This award provides support for junior researchers including undergraduate,
graduate, and post-graduate students working in the area of molecular materials
at US institutions to attend the 3rd International Advanced School: Molecular
Switching and Functional Materials and the 5th Japan-France Symposium on
Molecular Materials: Electronics, Photonics and Spintronics at the University of
Rennes, France, Oct. 26-30, 2009.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this
proposal is to expose young US researchers to four priority areas in molecular
materials that are an integral part of the training program of the young
researchers:&lt;br/&gt;(1) Multifunctional materials: to work in emerging areas
of materials design, synthesis, and measurement.&lt;br/&gt;(2) Measurement in
extreme environments: materials research involving high magnetic fields, high
pressure, and high intensity neutron and light sources.&lt;br/&gt;(3) Time
resolved dynamics: optical and femtosecond methods to explore the dynamics of
optical, spin, charge, and lattice mechanisms in molecular
structures.&lt;br/&gt;(4) Device applications: to adapt molecular materials to
electronic (field effect) and optical (light harvesting, emitting, and
switching) devices for technology.
