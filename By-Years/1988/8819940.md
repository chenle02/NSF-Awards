Fundamental research aimed at elucidating principles that underlie the
conservation and restoration of biological diversity is of utmost importance.
This is the priority of Dr. Owens' own research program. His goal is to
determine the interrelationship between endocrine systems, behavior and
environmental cues of one of the most endangered species, the Kemp's ridley sea
turtles. Presently, we know very little about the biology of this population
which is now nearing extinction. Along with graduate students from the United
States and students and senior scientists from universities in Costa Rica, Dr.
Owens plans to capture by hand the turtles an then prepare them for sonic and
radio tracking. Tracking the animals will provide important information about
their aquatic environment and social systems. In addition, blood and
cerebrospinal fluid samples will be taken for subsequent hormone analyses. The
extensive endocrine measurements will be used to evaluate the physiological
components of their behaviors, especially reproduction. Dr. Owens extensive
involvement with the Costa Rican students and scientists represents a true
collaboration dedicated towards understanding the conservation of these animals
within their natural habitat. The outcome of this work will be instrumental in
establishing successful captive breeding programs.
