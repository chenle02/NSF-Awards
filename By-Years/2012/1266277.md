This research is about understanding and controlling the functional properties
(wetting, corrosion, and adhesion) of metals by surface patterning. The approach
of this research will be to utilize viscous softening of amorphous metals to
impart controlled topography (micro, nano, and hierarchical) for desirable
functionality in metal components. The scientific objectives of this research
are to 1) decouple the contribution of surface topography and chemistry and 2)
to understand the effect of atomic structure (amorphous vs crystalline) on
surface properties of metals. For objective 1, effect of systematic variation in
topography on properties will be characterized without altering the surface
chemistry of a metallic alloy. Objective 2 will involve fabrication of
comparable surface topography from a metallic alloy in its amorphous and
crystalline state. This will be achieved by crystallizing the patterned
amorphous metal without significantly changing the surface pattern. The outcomes
of these objectives will quantify the effect of topography, composition, and
crystal structure on the functional properties of metallic alloys.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the benefits of this research
will include a new avenue for surface engineering of metals by patterning, which
has been historically limited to polymers and semiconductors due to their
advanced fabrication techniques. By integrating surface pattering and net-
shaping, complex metals parts with desirable properties can be fabricated
without additional functionalization steps. The multi-disciplinary research will
provide a stimulating learning environment for the undergraduate and graduate
students involved. Outreach activities will include demonstration of correlation
between surface properties (hydrophobicity and adhesion) and topography
(structure of lotus leaf and fibrillar adhesives) to promote K12 students?
interest in the field engineering and science.
