The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to open the path for resource extraction
on the Moon, creating an in-space manufacturing industry, allowing for a
permanent presence on the Moon, and expanding the ability to explore the inner
planets of the solar system. The technology may result in the ability of humans
to operate and live in space: building state-of-the-art research infrastructure,
exploring the solar system, creating a space economy independent of Earth, and
moving terrestrial manufacturing and power generation into
space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase
II project may provide new insights into electrorefining metal oxide feedstocks,
specifically lunar regolith simulants, through high-temperature electrolysis to
yield oxygen and metals. Additionally, the proposed technology will address
anode stability and advance studies in novel platinum group metal anodes. The
team will use multi-physics modeling for high-temperature electrolysis and for
modeling low gravity and lunar vacuum environments. The project may result in
the ability to extract oxygen and raw metals from lunar regoliths advancing
research in space resource extraction efforts. This advancement in knowledge may
aide in the research and development efforts in the fields of materials science,
inorganic chemistry, and metallurgy which could result in the carbon-free
production of steel and other metals on Earth, new anode materials for high-
temperature electrolysis, new electrochemical processes for electrorefining raw
feedstocks, and the ability to source oxygen and metals from the Moon and other
planetary bodies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
