The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project can lead to a revolution in 3D microgeometry and
reflectance properties measurement of object surfaces at the micron-scale. The
proposed technology will significantly improve photorealistic rendering and
enhance the workflow efficiency in physically-based rendering. This can impact a
broad range of industries, including video games, product visualization,
animation, visual effects, scientific rendering and virtual/augmented reality.
The superior performance and greatly reduced cost will allow the same system to
be used in the manufacturing industry, which requires high-resolution depth
measurement. This technology will result in the broader adoption of non-contact
3D metrology and 3D machine vision for manufacturing quality control and defect
inspection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will develop a
computational imaging system that allows for high-resolution 3D microgeometry
and reflectance properties measurement of object surfaces. The current
approaches for 3D surface measurement at the micron scale are based on
sophisticated optical and mechanical components that are expensive and can be
difficult to use, and most of these approaches cannot decouple the direct
reflection and sub-surface scattering. The goal of this research program is to
develop a combination of hardware and software that can measure 3D surface
microgeometry and reflectance properties with micron-scale accuracy. The
proposed technology is expected to achieve superior performance and greatly
reduced cost.
