This award provides 54% of the cost of equipment for the rock magnetism
laboratory at the Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory of Columbia University.
The University is committed to providing the remaining 46%. The equipment
consists of an alternating force piezoelectric magnetometer, an optical
microscope, and the components for constructing a translation Curie balance.
Together this equipment will significantly enhance the observational and
experimental capabilities of the rock magnetism laboratory at Lamont which is
engaged in the fundamental study of the origin of rock magnetism and its
applications to the interpretation of paleomagnetism in ancient rocks.
