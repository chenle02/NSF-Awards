This project involves a 3-year interdisciplinary effort to build on new advances
in information technology to develop an adaptive real-time system for active
management, processing, modeling and visualization of environmental and
geoscience data. The P.I.s will develop a set of real-time, integrated data base
management and field data acquisition tools for rapid and adaptive assessment of
the various phenomena following and during major catastrophic events, such as
earthquakes, fires, hurricanes, and floods. The P.I.'s interest is in real-time
integration of the incoming information such that predictive models of expected
site and structure response are continuously updated. Specifically, the P.I.s
will integrate their efforts in the following areas: a) development of GIS
databases capable of real time updating with multiple streams of information; b)
adaptive digital field data acquisition/mapping; c) development of robust, low
cost, intelligent field instrumentation capable of real time data transmission
(MOTEs); and d) data visualization and adaptive modeling of the observed
phenomena. ***
