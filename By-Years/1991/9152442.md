This project is central to development of a new interdisciplinary course in
global change for non-science students at Rhodes College. The course is
providing students with an understanding of the changes that are occurring that
affect the Earth's environment, illustrating that the biosphere, atmosphere,
hydrosphere and lithosphere all interact, on a global scale, to define this
environment. Students are examining models, interpretations, measurements and
physical principles used by scientists to study these global, interrelated
problems. This course and approach had been defined, over the last two years, by
a group of university and college scientists and educators who were selected and
sponsored by the National Center for Atmospheric Research. Rhodes is the liberal
arts college test-case for the concept.A major emphasis of the project involves
the use of system modeling software, a powerful pedagogical technique, to aid
students in understanding complex systems. Since the students are mainly non-
science majors, time is spent during the first weeks of the course teaching use
of the computers and modeling software.NSF grant funds are being matched with
funds from non- federal sources.
