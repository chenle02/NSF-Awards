This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II proposal aims to
commercialize a new mesoporous silicate nanoparticles for the reinforcement of
thermoplastic polymers used in the manufacture of U.S. cars and light trucks.
Whereas nanoparticles, in general, provide some polymer reinforcement benefits,
they typically lack the ability to provide strength as well as stiffness. Also,
they normally require extensive organic surface modification for dispersion in
the polymer matrix. Organic modifiers limit nanoparticles thermal stability and
compromise their suitability for nanocomposite manufacturing through cost-
effective melt processing methods. The purely inorganic mesoporous silicates
this project plans, circumvent all of the limitations caused by organic modifies
by providing a unique combination of surface polarity, mesopore size, surface
area, and pore volume which optimizes interfacial interactions between the
particles and the polymer matrix for effective dispersion and reinforcement. In
addition to providing stiffness at particle loadings, the mesoporous silicates
provide strength, which allows the amount of polymer needed to produce an
automotive part to be reduced in proportion to the added strength. The polymer
savings alone allow users of the technology to reduce the weight of the vehicle,
achieve stiffness, and improve fuel economy at no added cost.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of automotive
nanocomposites can directly impact the US energy economy, as well as
environmental quality. The combination of reduced vehicle weight and increased
fuel economy translates into a reduction in petroleum consumption and green
house gas emissions. The process for producing mesoporous silicate nanoparticles
is neither energy-intensive nor environmentally harmful. Based on aqueous sol-
gel chemistry, this project's nanoparticles are manufactured in yields at a
temperature of with no harmful waste released to the environment.
