The objective of this research is an intensive study of the crust in the
transition zone from the stable Colorado Plateau to the extended Basin and Range
province. We will rely primarily on recently collected seismic reflection data -
data collected as a "piggyback" experiment to the U.S. Geological Survey PACE
(Pacific to Arizona Crustal Experiment) refraction survey in Arizona -- although
the data will be supplemented and integrated with existing COCORP (Consortium on
Continental Reflection Profiling) data. The four areas of proposed research
include: 1) a P-wave structural interpretation of the transiton zone emphasizing
the lower crust and Moho, 2) an analysis of the unusually reflective upper crust
seen on indsutry and COCORP data, as well as the new data, 3) a study of wide-
angle and fan profiles collected in the piggyback experiment and 4) analysis and
interpretation of 3- component data from the new experiment with an emphasis on
crustal composition derived from P and S velocities. The piggyback reflection
data are uniquely suited to study the transition zone because of the excellent
data quality and close trace spacing of the survey.
