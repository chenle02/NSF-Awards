The Arctic summer poses a number of problems for migratory birds that exploit
the rich productivity of the tundra for reproduction. The breeding period is so
brief that the time required for the establishment of a territory, pair bonding
and courtship may be truncated into a few days or even hours. Birds must arrive
early to begin nesting so that the young are produced while conditions are still
favorable for their survival. Frequently, weather conditions in the Arctic
spring are severe, resulting in serious metabolic problems not only for the
onset of breeding but even for survival. This research will elucidate the
mechanisms by which Arctic birds resist the rigors of the Arctic summer. Among
the questions addressed are why there is variation in the adrenocortical
responsiveness to stress both among and within species, whether this is related
to behavioral effects of stress hormones such as corticosterone and the
distribution of receptors in neural tissue, and whether the variability is
regulated by photoperiod through the action of gonadal hormones. Additionally,
the hormonal basis of variation in breeding strategy will be explored in the
white-crowned sparrow that shows spatial opportunism on arrival and then defends
neither a territory nor a nest site; and in the snow bunting that shows an
intermediate strategy and defends a nest site at least during egg-laying, but
does not appear to be territorial later in the season. Comparisons of these
species, and receptor distributions for steroid hormones in the brain will shed
new light on the diversity of hormone-behavior adaptations in Arctic birds, and
will have considerable significance for the regulation of reproductive processes
of vertebrates in general. Both of these objectives are alligned with program
goals for Polar Biology and Medicine.
