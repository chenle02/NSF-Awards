The Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division supports Dr. John Ellis, Department of Chemistry, University
of Minnesota, for research into low valent transition metal chemistry. The
overall objective of the project is to obtain transition metal species
containing metals in rare or previously unknown low formal oxidation states. The
study will seek to define the boundaries of "superreduced" transition metal
chemistry and provide insights on the relative susceptibility of coordinated
ligands towards reduction. Polyarene complexes of transition metals in formal
oxidation states that are unprecedented, such as Ni(I-), Pt(I-), and Cu(I-), or
very rare, such as Hf(0, II-), and Ta(0) will be prepared by reduction of metal
halides in the presence of arenes. The ability of species such as isocyanides,
phosphanes, phosphites, and cyclooctatetraene to displace the arene ligands will
be explored as a route to heretofore unknown types of low valent metal
complexes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Polyarene metal complexes are possible reagents
for nitrogen fixation, catalysts for the polymerization of a variety of
unsaturated organic species and precursors to novel polymetallics. This project
will develop simple preparations for polyarene complexes and extend the
chemistry to metals where low valent complexes are either unknown or very
unusual. Thus, it will form the foundation from which applications, such as
catalysis, can be devised. A most important broader impact will be in the
education, training and professional development of undergraduate and graduate
students and postdoctoral associates. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
