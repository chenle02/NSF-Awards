This project focuses on problems in computational complexity theory, with the
goal of clarifying the power and limitations of various important classes of
algorithms (known as ``complexity classes''). Complexity classes provide the
best tools currently available for understanding the computational complexity of
real-world computational problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent progress in the
field has given rise to (cautious) optimism that routes can be found that avoid
some of the known barriers to proving lower bounds on the circuit size required
to compute various functions, by capitalizing on the property of ``strong
downward self-reducibility''. For problems that possess this property, modest
lower bounds can be ``amplified'' to obtain superpolynomial lower bounds. This
project aims to investigate the power and applicability of this new approach. In
parallel, we will investigate whether certain well-studied proof systems are
incapable of proving even the modest lower bounds that would be required in
order to bootstrap this ``amplification'' procedure. The project also will
investigate other approaches to proving conditional circuit lower
bounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will also aim to build on the recent
discovery that that the ``counting hierarchy'' (a subclass of PSPACE) is able to
perform a large class of numerical computations, and thus contains some
complexity classes related to computation over the real field, as well as
capturing the complexity of some fundamental problems in numerical analysis.
There are several important and seemingly-related problems that are still not
known to lie inside the counting hierarchy; this project will investigate
whether these problems also are in the counting hierarchy.
