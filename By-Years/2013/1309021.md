The PI will investigate various problems in three-dimensional topology. Specific
topics that will be addressed are: (1) Exceptional Dehn Filling, (2) Bridge
Number, Heegaard Genus and Dehn Surgery, and (3) L-Spaces and Left-Orderability.
The context of (1) is the desire to classify all hyperbolic three-manifolds with
two non-hyperbolic Dehn fillings; the present emphasis will be on the case where
one of the fillings is Seifert fibered and the distance between the fillings is
at least 5. Project (2) will consider manifolds obtained by Dehn surgery on
knots in the three-sphere, the aim being to find upper bounds on the Heegaard
genus of the manifold and the bridge number of the dual knot. The focus of (3)
is the conjecture that a prime rational homology three-sphere is an L-space if
and only of its fundamental group is not left-
orderable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three-dimensional topology is the study of the
large-scale structure of three-manifolds, abstract spaces that are locally like
the ordinary space in which we live. As a result of Perelman's proof of the
Geometrization Conjecture about ten years ago, we now have a very good picture
of the qualitative nature of such spaces. Nevertheless, three-dimensional
topology is extremely rich, with many different kinds of mathematics playing a
role, and the proposed research will seek to further our understanding of
various aspects of the subject. Specifically, (1) will study when the geometry
of a three-manifold degenerates on having a certain simple space attached to it,
(2) is part of the exploration of the fundamental relationship between three-
manifolds and knots, and (3) will investigate a mysterious connection that
appears to exist between two very different aspects of three-dimensional
topology, one analytical, the other algebraic.
