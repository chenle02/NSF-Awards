The field of service robotics holds the potential to increase the quality of
life of millions by removing people from situations that are dirty, dull, and
dangerous. However, current robots are far too expensive, have limited task
flexibility, and lack the robustness required for use in service applications. A
paradigm shift is required if service robots are to ever be as ubiquitous as
personal computers. The goal of this research is to develop a "toolbox"
containing simple actuators and structural elements together with a design
methodology which governs how the components should be assembled for specified
service tasks. The cornerstone of this approach is the use of binary (two-state)
actuators such as pneumatic cylinders because of their high payload to weight
ratio and very low cost. When used in combination with passive damping elements
(dashpots) such actuators provide smooth and well-behaved motion between binary
states with very little backlash. Within a specified set of tasks the robot
constructed from this toolbox is essentially a dedicated machine. The dedicated
nature of the resulting machine reduces the cost requirements and increases the
reliability of the robot as compared to general purpose robots.
