OPP-9701730 UTTAL, TANEIL NATIONAL OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION This
research project is a key component of a large, coordinated, multi-investigator
program, Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic (SHEBA) Ocean. The research program
will be conducted for 14 months from a ship frozen into the ice pack. This
investigator will use a large instrument array of instruments to measure cloud
properties and cloud-base through a full annual cycle. This research will be
important for the determination of the effects of cloud conditions on the flux
of incoming heat radiating onto the ice floe as a function of changing
atmospheric and oceanic conditions. Their results will help determine how
atmospheric heating is coupled to adsorption of heat by the sea ice. These
measurements are critical to understanding how heat is reflected or absorbed by
the ice as it melts in the summer and thickens in the winter in response to
seasonal variations in climate. This cloud properties measurement program makes
an essential contribution to the SHEBA team of researchers who will measure
atmospheric variables with a large array of instruments on the ice floe and
aircraft flying above as well as ice and ocean property measurements made on and
below the ice floe. The combined set of measurements in SHEBA will allow
refinement of climate models for the Arctic region. Those improved models will
lead to better predictions of the climate and the permanence of the Arctic ice
cap under a proposed global warming that could occur if atmospheric carbon
dioxide levels are increased above present levels.
