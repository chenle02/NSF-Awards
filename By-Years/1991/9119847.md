This award funds continuation of the outstanding work on the search for
anisotropies in the Cosmic Microwave Background of the group at the Owens Valley
radio Observatory. This group has done some of the most sensitive attempts to
measure such anisotropies, which must exist, according to current theories of
galaxy formation. So far, no such anisotropy has been unambiguously measured,
and the extension of these attempts to lower levels places strong constraints on
our models of the early universe.
