9319447 Kaler In the first two-year research period, electron microscopy, light,
X-ray and neutron scattering, time resolved fluorescence quenching, and NM self-
diffusion measurements were used to discover and chartreuse a menagerie of novel
microstructures in synthetic and biological surfactant systems. The key to
enlarging the realm of surfactant solution microstructure (from the limits of
simple micelles and lamellar phases) has been the "physical synthesis" of new
materials by mixing surfactants to achieve a desired set of properties. This has
been most clearly the demonstrated in the catanionic vesicle systems we
discovered and investigated during the first research period. The cationic
surfactant cetyl trimethylammonium tosylate (CTAT) and the anionic surfactant
sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (SDBS) associate in solution to form a quasi-
double-tailed surfactant that forms bilayers rather than micelles. The bilayers
of the catanionic mixture have different properties than do covalently bound
zwitterionic double-tailed surfactants; the catanionic mixture forms unilamellar
vesicles while the covalent zwitterionic surfactants form multilamellar phases.
It is hypothesized that new microstructures are produces in mixtures because the
intermolecular and interaggregate forces are altered in ways impossible in
single component surfactant solutions. In this renewal, experimental and
theoretical efforts are used to design new microstructures of mixed surfactant
systems by understanding how the components of the surfactant mixtures alter the
intermolecular and inter-aggregate forces. ***
