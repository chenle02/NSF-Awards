The thermodynamics and kinetics of metastable alloy formation are investigated
in alloys formed by mechanical alloying, ion irradiation, and vapor deposition.
Enthalpy and free energy calculations are performed that account for excess
specific heat of an undercooled liquid. Effects of stress and structural
relaxation on phase equilibria and reaction kinetics in thin film diffusion
couples are studied by X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, and Rutherford
backscattering spectrometry. Electron irradiation of amorphous alloys in
metastable equilibrium with terminal solution precipitates is employed to
examine diffusion mechanisms in amorphous alloys and the effects of point defect
supersaturation on phase equilibria. %%% This research is expected to advance
our understanding of both the thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of metastable
alloy phase formation. These unusual materials can be made in large quantities
and have commercial possibilities.
