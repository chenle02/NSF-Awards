9456125 Lewis The project is conducting planning to undertake a strategy to
improve the integration of mathematics in science courses and of scientific
material in mathematics courses. The second year mathematics curriculum would be
modularized to enable students to acquire mathematical skills at different times
as needed and mathematics courses will incorporate student projects designed and
evaluated collaboratively with other disciplines. The goal is to incorporate new
pedagogical strategies, including an emphasis on interactive instruction,
cooperative and group leaning, proficiency in communication of technical
material, and use of technology in all departments. To assure wide applicability
of methods, collaborations with other schools are being developed and serious
attention is being paid to dissemination of project results through many
channels.
