9311545 Aref Research is to be conducted on the interaction between multiple
vortices. These interactions are relevant to the dynamics of turbulence. The
approach is primarily numerical and partly theoretical, based on tools from
dynamical systems theory, physical kinetics, and renormalization group theory.
Numerical modeling will be from Direct Numerical Simulations. Results will have
relevance to various aspects of turbulent flow, particularly the fragmentation
and merging or reconnection of embedded vortex structures. Clarification of such
mechanisms will impact the development of more rational models for predicting
turbulent flows in various areas of engineering. ***
