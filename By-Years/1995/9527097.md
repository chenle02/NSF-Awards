Abstract ATM-9527097 Richard D. Clark and Russell L. DeSouza Millersville
University UNIDATA: A Computer Equipment Request to Expand Meteorological
Interactive Computing Capabilities for Education and Augment UNIDATA's Internet
Data Distribution Center. Funds will 1) expand the present meteorological
interactive computing capabilities which extensively employ UNIDATA-supported
software and 2) enhance and augment the UNIDATA Internet Data Distribution (IDD)
system by serving as a relay and/or archiving sight. The requested workstations,
and others presently on hand from previous NSF/UNIDATA awards, will become part
of the local area network supported and maintained by the meteorology program in
two teaching labs and a research lab.
