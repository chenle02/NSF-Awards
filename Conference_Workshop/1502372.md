This award supports participation in the "Rocky Mountain Dynamical Systems
Conference," held on June 8-11, 2015, in Provo, Utah. The mathematical field of
dynamical systems provides fundamental ideas and tools for the modeling,
analysis, and prediction of complex phenomena. Theoretical development in
nonlinear dynamics has been in the forefront in many areas of scientific
endeavor such as environmental fluid dynamics, geophysical flows, climate
dynamics, networks of neurons, genetics, and physiology. The purpose of this
conference is to nurture high quality scientific activity, to strengthen
scientific collaboration, and to stimulate interest among young scientists,
students, and those from underrepresented groups working in the field of
dynamical systems.

As the discipline of dynamical systems has matured, it has divided into many
subfields such as smooth, topological, complex, Hamiltonian, symbolic, ergodic,
etc. However, solutions to important dynamical problems increasingly require
techniques from various areas of mathematics, and progress in the field will be
catalyzed by more collaborative research. The conference will not focus on a
specific area of dynamical systems, but instead will invite speakers from
diverse areas in the subject. This will help provide a venue to develop
collaborations from various research areas within dynamical systems.
