Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;This conference will be held at Stonehill College
in Easton Massachusetts from August 7-12, 2011. The conference is known for its
cutting edge science and breadth of coverage, providing a forum for the
exploration of a wide range of epigenetic phenomena and epigenetic regulatory
mechanisms in numerous model organisms, as well as humans. By stressing the
presentation of unpublished data, the conference will facilitate the exchange
and dissemination of information that will help move the field into new areas of
inquiry, employing the latest methods and technologies. This year the conference
will have 9 sessions: 1-Epigenetic mechanisms I: DNA methylation; 2-
Environment, aging, memory and behavioral epigenetics; 3 Epialleles and
epigenetic inheritance; 4- Developmental programming and reprogramming; 5-
Epigenetic mechanisms II: RNA-mediated heterochromatin formation and gene
rearrangement; 6- Epigenetics and disease; 7- Gene dosage control mechanisms; 8-
Epigenetics and the genome: position-effects, replication and nuclear
organization; and 9- Instructing the next generation through DNA imprints and
RNA signaling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;In addition to
invited, established investigators who are leaders in the field, the conference
program developed by the organizers of the 2011 Epigenetics Gordon Research
Conference includes a substantial number of young investigators who are new to
the conference and whose exciting work expands the frontiers of the field.
Registration and/or travel support will be made available to attendees from
domestic minority-serving institutions. Sixteen (33%) of the confirmed speakers
and discussion leaders for the 2011 conference are women.
