Freshwater mussels are successful ionic- and osmotic-regulators but they
maintain blood ion concentrations well below other freshwater animals. Using
various procedures including ion fluxes, ion substitution studies, isolated
tissue techniques, morphology and histochemistry, cAMP and prostaglandin
biochemistry, we have demonstrated that the gill is the a major site of ionic
regulation. We have found that freshwater mussels transport Na, K, Rb, and Cl at
rates that equal or exceed the transport rates found inmost freshwater forces
involved in ion transport, the electrical gradient across gill epithelial cells
must be measured. In addition, the types and their respective conductances of
ion channels present in epithelial cell membranes will be determined using the
inside-out patch clamp technique. Preliminary data indicate that mussel
membranes have ion channels with remarkably high (&gt;300 pS) conductances.
These studies will provide information about how mussels function with low blood
ionic strengths, and yet tolerate substantial modification of blood ion
composition when subjected to changes in their environment. Understanding the
cellular mechanisms that allow freshwater mussels such remarkable adaptations is
relevant to our understanding of the limits at which cells and organisms can
function. //
