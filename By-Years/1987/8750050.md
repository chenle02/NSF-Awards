A Measurements Group 4000 data acquisition system will be added to the strength
of materials and advanced structures laboratory. Engineering technology students
will be able to rapidly gather data on yield points, moduli of elasticity, and
ultimate stresses. In addition, with the computer taking data rapidly, the
students will be able to study the statistical variation of the measurements and
the effect of changing variables.
