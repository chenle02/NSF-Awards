This Small Business Innovation Research Phase (SBIR) I project proposes to
develop a sensor system that will overcome many of the current limitations of
the public works infrastructure. The design will be based on optimally
partitioning the desired system functionality into the various components such
that overall the system can achieve the system-level goals of adequate
performance and low life-cycle costs. The various system functions, such as
power distribution, signal communications will be included as elements of the
design rather than focusing solely on sensor sensitivity or some other single
variable. The primary objective of the project is to develop a sensor for
application of large numbers of sensors in a very compact and portable manner in
civil structures. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The commercial potential is a fiber
optic sensor based on a high finesse Fabry-Perot that has the potential to meet
the needs for structural health monitoring. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
