9618101 Kurz The overall goal of this research is to use the noble gas
distribution and isotopic compositions in oceanic volcanic rocks to constrain
the long-term degassing behavior of the earth's mantle. New measurements will
related helium isotropic variations to the heavier noble gases (particularly Ne,
ar, and Xe) as well as other geochemical tracers such as Sr, Nd, and Pb
isotopes. Of particular interest is a suite of oceanic basalt glasses from the
super-fast spreading East Pacific Rise, and the nearby seamounts, which are
extremely well documented and are ideal for the noble gas studies. Laser
extraction techniques will allow direct examination of the noble gas
distribution within individual samples from the mid-ocean ridges and oceanic
islands, thus identifying the noble gas residence sites in mantle derived
volcanic rocks and constraining the degree of noble gas compatibility within
important mantle mineral phases. The data will also help constrain the dynamic
of melting beneath the mid ocean ridges and the mechanisms by which seamounts
are formed.1
