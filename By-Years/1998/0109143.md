Numerical Analysis of Transient Slab-on-Grade Heat
Transfer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Building mechanical
systems are selected to quickly respond to time-varying conditions that occur
outside and within buildings. Designers of these systems must often balance
conflicting needs such as, for example, the requirements for improved indoor air
quality and reduced energy use. But where concerns dictate increased energy use,
conservation measures may be employed elsewhere to offset that increase. One
place in many buildings that still has the potential for significant energy
savings is their foundations. Unfortunately, mechanical systems designers do not
have sufficient models readily available to quickly and accurately evaluate
building foundation energy use. The objectives of this grant are to model heat
transfer between modern slabs-on-grade and the ground, to evaluate their dynamic
behavior, to prepare enhanced simplified equations that describe that behavior,
and to evaluate coefficients for these equations.&lt;br/&gt;To achieve these
objectives a dedicated and detailed computer code will be written and hour-by-
hour weather data will be used to predict and observe the transient phenomena.
Via enhanced simplified equations and their coefficients found in this project,
others can improve their building heating and cooling loads and energy-use
prediction software. Such tools will then be used by building design engineers
to further optimize energy use, predict thermal comfort, improve indoor air
quality, and increase workers productivity.&lt;br/&gt;
