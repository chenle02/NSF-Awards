EvaluATE is a national resource center dedicated to supporting and improving the
evaluation practices of approximately 250 ATE grantees across the country.
EvaluATE conducts webinars and workshops, publishes a quarterly newsletter,
maintains a website with a digital resource library, develops materials to guide
evaluation work, and conducts an annual survey of ATE grantees. EvaluATE's
mission is to promote the goals of the ATE program by partnering with projects
and centers to strengthen the program's evaluation knowledge base, expand the
use of exemplary evaluation practices, and support the continuous improvement of
technician education throughout the nation. EvaluATE's goals associated with
this proposal are to: (1) Ensure that all ATE Principal Investigators and
evaluators know the essential elements of a credible and useful evaluation; (2)
Maintain a comprehensive collection of online resources for ATE evaluation; (3)
Strengthen and expand the network of ATE evaluation stakeholders; and (4)
Gather, synthesize, and disseminate data about the ATE program activities to
advance knowledge about ATE/technician education. The Center plans to produce a
comprehensive set of evaluation resources to complement other services, engaging
several community college-based Principal Investigators and evaluators in that
process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EvaluATE's products are informed by current
research on evaluation, the National Science Foundation's priorities for the
evaluation of ATE grants, and the needs of ATE PIs and evaluators for sound
guidance that is immediately relevant and usable in their contexts. The
fundamental nature of EvaluATE's work is geared toward supporting ATE grantees
to use evaluation regularly to improve their work and demonstrate their impacts.
All of EvaluATE's products are available to the public. EvaluATE's findings from
the annual survey of ATE grantees aid in advancing understanding of the status
of technician education and illuminate areas for additional research. The new
survey investigates ATE grantees' work to serve underrepresented and special
populations, including women, people of color, and veterans. Survey data are
available upon request for research and evaluation purposes.
