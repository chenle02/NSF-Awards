9221293 Bertsekas This award will support collaborative research between Dimitri
Bertsekas, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Stefano Pallottino,
University of Pisa, Italy. The collaborative research will focus on optimization
problems that have a network structure, in particular, shortest path problems.
The research will seek to understand the performance of existing shortest path
and other network algorithms, with particular emphasis on a recently proposed
class called auction algorithms. The primary benefit of the collaboration is the
joining of complementary skills and compatible research views. Professor
Pallottino is one of the world's foremost experts on shortest path algorithms,
and Professor Bertsekas is a principal developer of the class of auction
algorithms for network optimization. The research will focus on three main
aspects: 1) algorithm development; 2) performance and complexity analysis, and
3) experimental validation, in which each of the collaborators takes primary
responsibility for one or more of these areas. ***
