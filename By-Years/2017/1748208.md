The physicist Richard Feynman is often credited with the remark 'What I cannot
create, I do not understand'. The recent history of cell biology is one in which
cells have been studied at increasingly simpler and fundamental levels through
'reductionist' experimental approaches. The purpose of this workshop is to
utilize that knowledge to address the Feynman dictum and begin the process of
building synthetic cells to more fully understand the functions of their natural
counterparts. This has the exciting possibility of not only advancing our
understanding of biology and regenerative medicine, but also impacting
significantly our food security and biomanufacturing
industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will bring together leading
scientists from disparate fields of research including cellular and synthetic
biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics and bioengineering to plan the
construction of synthetic cells. They will address many different questions
including 'what is the minimum set of genes, proteins, organelles, small
molecules necessary for a cell to function?' and 'what is the minimum set of
activities that would define 'function'' among others? By the end of the
meeting, the participants should have identified key barriers to success as well
as opportunities where concentrated effort could significantly advance the
field. They results of the workshop will be a video record of the proceedings, a
written report highlighting obstacles and opportunities and the state of the
field, and a plan for future collaboration to leverage the work started at the
workshop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop is jointly funded by the Cellular
Dynamics and Function Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular
Biosciences and the Physics of Living Systems Program in the Division of
Physics.
