Computer Engineering (32)&lt;br/&gt;We are adapting testing quidelines and
techniques from a variety of federal and industrial sources and implementing a
course in testing embedded systems and software. We are working with partners
from DoD, NASA, and industry to focus on those techniques commonly used in
industrial environments. Students learn both the theoretical and practical
aspects of testing embedded systems through case studies obtained from these
partners and laboratory experiments.
