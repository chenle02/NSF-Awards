Enhancing Access to the Radio Spectrum (EARS) is a multi-disciplinary activity
whose goal is to improve the efficiency with which the radio spectrum is
utilized and to improve access to the radio spectrum in support of current and
new technologies. Achieving these goals will, among other impacts, improve the
availability of wireless broadband to Americans presently without broadband
access. Because the radio spectrum is a valuable but finite natural resource,
improvements in spectrum efficiency will have significant economic impact to the
nation and the world. Building upon the NSF EARS research program, this
invitational workshop will bring together some of the key researchers and other
stakeholders involved in radio spectrum access to discuss the state of current
research and policy in this area, and chart a course forward for research and
technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All relevant fields will be represented,
including science, engineering, economics, and policy. Key federal agencies with
stakes in wireless spectrum management and usage will be invited as well. The
output of the workshop will include a vision for the future of radio spectrum
access and use, and a prioritized list of research areas that can help achieve
that vision.
