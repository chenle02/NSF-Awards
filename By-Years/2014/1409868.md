The modern web experience is dynamic, providing users with a highly responsive
interface through which to interact with the world. Today's mechanisms allow
servers---even those which are controlled by an attacker---to download arbitrary
programs into a user's browser. It is extraordinarily difficult to secure the
web browser (and its user) against attack in this scenario. While tools and
techniques are useful to analyze and restrict downloaded code, they are by their
very nature incomplete. As a result, the security of web services relies on a
series of ad hoc, service-provided techniques. Thus even large organizations
routinely outsource too-difficult-to-secure web
services.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will explore an alternative: A
modern, dynamic web experience with a focus on safety. Rather than attempting to
make arbitrary code safe, it aims to design a safe interface which is far less
complex than today's browser environment. This interface will be analyzed for
its security properties. It will result in a more tractable environment in which
to secure web applications than exists today. Many security properties will be
built in; such properties are not dependent on the server side-efforts to secure
them. Thus, when using this interface, visiting web sites will pose a smaller
threat to users, even from sites which are under the control of an attacker. The
project will develop a new semantic foundation for web security and make
available open source tools and educational materials for the next generation of
web developers.
