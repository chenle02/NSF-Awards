a T1 (1.544 thousand bit per second) line through MichNet. Faculty and students
will benefit from access to the resources of the Internet, including libraries
and supercomputers. In addition, they will be able to communicate and
collaborate with colleagues at other institutions in pursuit of research and
educational projects. The award provides partial support of the project for two
years.
