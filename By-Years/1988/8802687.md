Oswalt and his collaborator Sion will obtain spectra of white dwarfs in order to
determine their masses, to learn more about their evolutionary histories, and to
recognize new white dwarfs, especially those of unusual classes. White dwarfs
are Earth-sized stars, the final state of stars like the Sun after they have
exhausted all nuclear fuels. Recent observations have demonstrated surprisingly
many kinds of atmospheres on white dwarfs. Oswalt and Sion will take spectra of
several hundred white dwarfs in order to determine their masses. These
fundamental parameters provide information how stars originally rather like the
Sun end up as members of apparently rather unlike sets of white dwarfs. Oswalt
and Sion also expect to identify many more white dwarfs, so that the more
unusual kinds can be studied better. This award is made under the Research in
Undergraduate Institutions Program. Partial support is provided through the
