Gammarid amphipods form an important trophic link between algae and meiofauna,
and fishes, birds, and seals in high Arctic latitude environments. Their success
may be attributed to physiological mechanisms that allow them to flourish under
extreme cold temperatures and changing salinities induced by freezing and
melting sea ice. The proposed research focuses on extraordinarily abundant
Arctic amphipod that lives in the intertidal zone and under sea ice. Energy cost
of osmoregulation will be examined by direct measurement of oxygen consumption
in a graded series of salinities and temperatures. Physiological measurements
will be complemented by determinations of activity of ion-transport protein:
Na-K ATPase. In addition, the ultrastructure of gill membranes will be examined
for changes in quantity of ion transport sites and structure as a function of
salinity and temperature. The project will be done in collaboration with
scientists from the University of Trondheim, and in cooperation with the
Norwegian Polar Institute for Arctic Research. Norwegian scientists will be
conducting parallel experiments on the response of internal sodium, potassium,
chloride and free amino acids to changing salinity and temperature.
