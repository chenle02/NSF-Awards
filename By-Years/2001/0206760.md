The investigators will conduct a survey of genetic variation for a set of
fitness related genes (the Major Histocompatability Complex or Mhc) in a locally
threatened endemic canid, the Island fox (Urocyon littoralis). The goal is to
understand the role that natural selection has played in maintaining variation
in small populations. This understanding will also allow for a more effective
management of the endangered Island fox and other species that are declining or
threatened. An initial survey of polymorphism at the Mhc has revealed an
unprecedented level of genetic variation in Island foxes. The investigators will
survey molecular variation of four Mhc genes in Island foxes using PCR
(polymerase chain reaction) based techniques, and compare this to the null model
of neutral genetic variation.

Mhc genes are integral to vertebrate immune function, and variation in the Mhc
affects individual fitness (e.g. resistance or susceptibility to pathogens).
This study will attempt to illuminate, though direct observation and computer
simulation, the strength of natural selection necessary to maintain genetic
variation in a species with limited genetic variation. These results will have
direct implications for conservation and management of the Island fox, as well
as provide a greater understanding of the extent of natural selection operating
upon an immunologically important set of genes.
