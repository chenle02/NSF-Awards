This project connects Trinity College to the Internet over a 56kbps line.
Faculty and students at the school benefit from access to the resources of the
Internet, including libraries and supercomputers. In addition, they are able to
communicate and collaborate with colleagues at other institutions in pursuit of
research and educational projects. The award provides partial support of the
project for two years.
