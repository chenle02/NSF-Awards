This proposal seeks support for the PIs studies on microlithographic processes.
A new set of exposure bleaching model equations, applicable when standing wave
effects are present and non-negligible are being developed. The ray-tracing
model for resist dissolution will be formulated in terms of path integrals and
exact differentials to yield the developed line contours in closed forms.
Analytical solutions derived earlier for the image reversal and CEL processes
will be convoluted with the exact formulation of the dissolution process. Multi-
level resist processes will be explored by explicitly considering thickness non-
uniformities and various interface reflectivities. Deep UV induced image
stabilization and hardening in positive resists will be studied by relating
measured optical density changes and cross link gradients in the resist film.
Finally, the extended exposure-bleaching models of Ag-doped Ge Se resists will
be studied and the resolution capability of these inorganic resists
investigated.
