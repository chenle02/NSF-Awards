9416074 Houghton The objective of this study is to investigate the flow of the
bottom boundary layer (BBL) in the vicinity of the shelfbreak front in the
Middle Atlantic Bight using a novel technique (a dye as a Lagrangian follower)
in order to resolve the small scale flow near the moving frontal boundary. One
of the goals of the study is unambiguously confirm the existence of a mean
Lagrangian flow offshore of the BBL and its convergence at the frontal boundary.
These results will be importnat ina dvancing our understanding of the dynamics
controlling exchange of shelf and slope water at the continental margin and the
circulation responsible for enhanced biological productivity at the shelfbreak.
