This project involves the dissertation research of an anthropology student from
Washington University-St. Louis on the effects of women's land tenure security
on agricultural productivity in Kenya. The student, a native speaker of the
local language, will conduct a survey of agricultural practices and output on a
randomly selected set of 120 households after participant observation and in-
depth ethnographic fieldwork to learn the important variables and issues which
affect farm productivity. The hypotheses to be tested involve the assumption
that the greater the degree of women's security about land the more productive
their farming will be. This research is important because aside from training
students in economic anthropology the knowledge to be gained will advance our
understanding of causes of variations of productivity in African agriculture.
This information will be useful to local and international planners as they
develop programs to solve the problem of food production in Africa.
