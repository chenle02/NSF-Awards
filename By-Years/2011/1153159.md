With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program, and co-funding
from the Chemical Catalysis Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professors
Louis Bouchard and Omar Yaghi and their groups at University of California, Los
Angeles are proposing to develop novel methodologies to visualize chemical
reactions in real-time and in a non-invasive manner. Chemical catalysis and the
optimization of chemical reactors rely on the accurate knowledge of chemical
reaction thermodynamics, but methods to probe reaction dynamics non-invasively
are currently lacking. Such methods would enable the optimization of catalysts
and help improve the design of chemical reactors. Any improvements in the
reaction efficiency could potentially translate into economic savings and
reduced negative impact of chemical catalysis to the environment. In this
project, the reserachers will develop novel imaging methods to be applied to
existing and emerging catalysts such as metal organic frameworks and metal
nanoparticle catalysts, which are attractive not only to conventional industrial
catalysis but also for modern microreaction technology.

The learned knowledge from the development of novel imaging technology will be
used to devise new experiments to benefit undergraduate education. The
researchers are involved in developing new experiments for undergraduate
chemistry labs and in developing extracurricular teaching activities that
benefit local public schools, where many minority students are enrolled.
