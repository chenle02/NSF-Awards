In concept learning, the learner is typically given a sample of instances
labeled according to some unknown target concept. The learner?s task is to
construct a hypothesis that is a good approximation of the target in a
reasonable amount of time. Building concept learning systems has become an
important research area due to the ever-increasing need for analyzing huge
amounts of stored data. Although many efficient algorithms were constructed for
learning various classes of concepts, these concept classes are extremely
simple. Further, numerous hardness results seem to suggest that learning more
expressive concept classes is extremely difficult.

Two research directions have evolved in an effort to address the difficulty of
learning more expressive concepts. One is to construct multiple classifier
systems (MCS) and the other is to consider the possibility of actively
interacting with the environment (a.k.a. active learning). Currently, due to the
success of the Adaboost algorithm, theoretical research on MCS (and in fact
machine learning in general) tends to focus rather narrowly on ensemble methods.
Similarly, active learning research has been concentrated on the use of
membership queries, and to some extent the teaching model. Other types of MCS
and active learning that may lead to more intelligent learning systems have not
been well studied. A good understanding of how to build more sophisticated MCS
and exploit other possibilities of extracting information from the environment
will move us one step closer to achieving the original intent of machine
learning, which is to automate the knowledge acquisition process. This proposed
research will investigate complex multiple classifier and active learning
systems so that the learning of difficult concept classes becomes more
tractable.
