The goals of the BioTiER (Biological Training in Education and Research)
Scholars S-STEM Program project at Cal Poly Pomona are to (1) increase
recruitment and retention of underrepresented minority and financially
disadvantaged students pursuing advanced degrees in the biological sciences, (2)
increase graduation rates and decrease time to degree, and (3) offer career
development opportunities so students adapt and excel once in the STEM
workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit derives from the sector-
specific training program along three career tracks offered in (1) STEM
industries including biotechnology, environmental/green technology, biomedical
engineering &amp; pharmaceutical, (2) academia &amp; faculty training, and (3)
pursuit of other STEM fields requiring advanced degrees. This project is poised
to create an educational network comprised of community colleges, companies in
the STEM industries, and research universities with the Biological Sciences
Department at Cal Poly Pomona serving as the central point of training and
education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts are realized by providing a
better educated workforce entering the U.S. and California life sciences and
engineering industries where demand for skilled workers with degrees beyond the
Bachelor's level is growing. Further, this project provides high-quality life
science educators available to institutions of higher learning, in particular
community colleges. The activities created for the program are planned to become
part of an already existing infrastructure, so that the novel benefits of the
program will continue even after the end of the grant period. Plans are in place
to share project findings, instructional materials, and best practices models
with local and national entities with a similar purpose.
