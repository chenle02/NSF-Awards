This award supports an airphoto reconnaissance investigation of raised beaches
in Victoria Land, Antarctica. The work will result in a catalog of raised marine
features that could potentially be studied to determine the history of sea level
change since the last glacial maximum. The history of sea level change is in
Victoria Land is a key element to understanding the geographic distribution of
ice during the last glacial maximum and to understanding the global water
inventory since this time.
