This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project proposes to develop a
dynamic simulation model as applied to fuel cells, one of the most promising
technologies for distributed generation. To facilitate high penetration into
utility grids, fuel cell power plants are desired to be fully automated with
remote monitoring, capable of load-following, and availabilities of more than
95%. The distinctive feature of dynamic simulation approach to control of power
plants is to enable the designers to test power plant's transient response to
load variations, system upsets, and other modes of operation prior to plant
construction. Another unique feature of dynamic simulation includes: increased
flexibility in implementing advanced control strategies and utilizing state-of-
the-art algorithms such as robust, fuzzy logic and neural network in fuel cell
power plants. It will also include development of power management and
supervisory control of such plants, leading to a highly automated generation
system. Use of advanced control systems make it possible to improve the
operating flexibility and enhance the life of a power plant and will ensure the
plant's reliability during rapid load changes without stressing the key
components of the plant. The dynamic simulation and intelligent control will
ultimately lead to cost-cutting benefits associated with operator training,
efficiency, availability and reliability of the fuel cell power plants.
