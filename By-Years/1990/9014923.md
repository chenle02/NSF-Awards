In this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organo- metallic Program of
the Chemistry Division, Wayland will continue his studies of the organometallic
reactivity of macrocyclic complexes of Rh(II) and Ir(II). These fundamental
studies have the long range goal of providing proper design of metal complexes
that will convert simple hydrocarbons into more useful compounds. A primary
objective will be to achieve a fundamental under- standing of the thermodynamic
and kinetic-mechanistic basis for the observed reactivity of Group 9
metallomacrocycles. The focus will be on examining reactions of alkanes and
carbon monoxide with Rh(II) and Ir(II) porphyrins. Both thermodynamic and
mechanistic criteria will be used in designing metal complexes for the purpose
of expanding the range of reactivity and producing reaction selectivity. Major
long range goals include the systematic use of ligand and metal variation to
tune thermodynamic factors and design of ligand systems that provide
preorganization of the transition states for specific reactions.
