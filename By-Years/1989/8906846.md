An Engineering Research Equipment Grant will be used to develop a laboratory on
Solidification Fluid Dynamics of Metallic Melts. The thrust of the research to
be conducted in the laboratory will be on low Prandtl number convective flow
visualization and quantitative experiments for computer code verification. The
equipment consists of X-ray generator, image processor, and furnace.
