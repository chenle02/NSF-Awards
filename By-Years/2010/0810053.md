The goal of the proposed project is to help programmers create correct,
efficient, reliable, and secure software systems by providing improved static-
analysis techniques that can (i) verify properties of a program's behavior, and
(ii) find potential bugs and security vulnerabilities in programs. The project
will concentrate on the analysis of machine code: the objectives are to enhance
the scientific basis for static analysis of machine code, to create prototype
tools that apply the techniques developed in tools for analyzing safety
properties of machine-code programs, and to measure how well the tools perform.
