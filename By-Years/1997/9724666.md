9724666 Jen, Erica Sante Fe Institute Major Research Instrumentation: A New
Computational Infrastructure at the Sante Fe Institute The Sante Fe Institute
(SFI) will be acquiring a cluster of multiple processing desktop systems
together with individual workstations, and a 3D graphics engine dedicated to
fast graphics and visualization. The equipment will support a research
initiative in the simulation of Complex Adaptive Systems. The focus of the
initiative will be on the computational, mathematical, physical, biological, and
social sciences. Research areas to be supported include adaptive computation,
simulation of physical processes, simulations of biological processes, dynamics
of evolutionary and ecological systems, artificial life, and computational
economics. Although SFI is not a degree-granted institution, it has demonstrated
a commitment to training the next generation of scientists. Each research area
described in the proposal has senior personnel working together with visitors,
postdoctoral fellows and students from Universities. SFI also runs the Complex
Systems Summer School whose attendees are predominantly graduate students. For
several years SFI has offered NSF-funded REU Sites projects.
