Westpheling 9722960 The primary long-term objective of this study is to
understand the regulatory interconnection between carbon source catabolite
repression, activation of antibiotic biosynthesis and morphological development
in the Streptomyces bacteria. The general approach of this project has been to
use catabolite controlled genes involved in complex carbohydrate utilization as
tools to probe the connection between carbon utilization and morphogenesis.
Using this approach, a new class of mutants was identified that are at once
defective in catabolite control and morphogenesis, and also overproduce
antibiotics. The most pleiotropic of the known morphological mutants of
Streptomyces, bldB, was shown during the course of previous work to be
pleiotropically defective in the regulation of carbon utilization. The bldB gene
product is required for catabolite repression, the initiation of morphogenesis
and antibiotic biosynthesis in S. coelicolor, and the study of how this gene
functions in the interconnection of these processes is a major focus of the
current project. To facilitate the isolation, cloning, and characterization of
new mutants, transposon mutagenesis and generalized transduction methods in S.
venezuelae are being developed to be used in combination with S. coelicolor for
genetic analysis.
