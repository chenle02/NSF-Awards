This award is made as the starter grant increment of Dr. Jeffrey Moore's
Postdoctoral Fellowship in Chemistry Award insupport of his research at the
University of Michigan. The main thrust of Dr. Moore's research is the
development of new polymerization strategies for synthesizing macromolecules
that contain main group elements in their backbone. These macromolecules are
valuable intermediates for ceramics and other novel solid-state materials. The
initial approach will be the synthesis of bicyclic cyclohexadiene monomers
containing main group elements. The objective of these studies is to identify
systems which can catalytically eliminate the inorganic substituents by
simultaneously extruding an aromatic fragment. These reactions may be initiated
by either cationic or anionic reagents. Once systems have been identified, model
reaction studies will be used to optimize molecular parameters relevant to this
chemistry.
