One of the most significant problems in concurrent-software analysis research is
achieving a balance between general theoretical concepts and specific practical
techniques. The focus of this research is on applying and adapting petri net
theory for solutions to pragmatic problems in concurrent-software analysis. We
will investigate algorithmic mapping of various concurrent-software
specifications to appropriate types of Petri net models and we will seek
effective analysis procedures that work by combining concepts from general net
theory with domain specific information. Both qualitative properties, like
deadlock, and quantitative properties, like complexity, will be studied.
