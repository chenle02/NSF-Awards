This award will fund a Mathematical Sciences Research Group in harmonic
analysis. The goal is to sustain a highly interactive community of
mathematicians, including students and young investigators, whose work is
related to the shared interests of the principal investigators. Those interests
are in the general area of function theory, operator theory, and harmonic
analysis.
