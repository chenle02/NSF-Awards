This is a renewal of NSF grant ECS-8645108 and represents collaborative work
with G. J. Kalman of Boston College (ECS-8716328). Continued theoretical work on
collective modes and dynamical transport coefficients of strongly coupled
plasmas is to be carried out. The theoretical scheme developed by Golden and
Kalman and already successfully applied to various physical situations will be
employed to the study of physical systems of engineering importance. These
include electron gas in metals, 2-dimensional electron gas in MOS devices,
heterostructures and molten salts. All these systems share the property that the
Couloumb interaction between the particles is strong which renders the use of
customary perturbation methods inadequate. The GK scheme is a novel non-
perturbative approach developed for the analysis of such systems.
