This research project presents a novel practical solution for providing a
routing service under a strong adversarial model, capable of adversarial
omissions (black hole attack). An ad-hoc wireless network is an autonomous self-
organizing system of mobile nodes connected by wireless links where nodes not in
direct range can communicate via inter-mediate nodes. A common technique used in
routing protocols for ad hoc wireless net-works is to establish the routing
paths on-demand, as opposed to continually maintaining a complete routing table.
A significant concern in routing is the ability to function in the presence of
Byzantine failures, which include nodes that drop, modify, or mis-route packets
in an attempt to disrupt the routing service. This project designs an on-demand
routing protocol for ad hoc wireless networks that provides resilience to
Byzantine fail-ures caused by individual or colluding nodes. The first proposed
adaptive probing tech-nique detects a malicious link after log n faults have
occurred, where n is the length of the path. These links are then avoided by
multiplicatively increasing their weights and by us-ing an on-demand route
discovery protocol that finds a least weight path to the destina-tion. A great
deal of work will be required in order to further improve and experimentally
validate the proposed solution. This project would involve further development
and an implementation of the secure routing protocol and provide a detailed
comparison with other existing ad hoc routing protocols under both normal and
adversarial conditions.
