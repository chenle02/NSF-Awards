The PI will investigate gravity wave induced fluctuations in mesosphere/lower
thermosphere (MLT) airglow emissions. The investigation will utilize a two-
dimensional, fully non-linear model describing the variation of minor species
densities in the MLT with dynamical (wave) transport and diffusion processes,
coupled with a fully mature full-wave model for realistic simulation of gravity
waves' propagation. This research addresses fundamental science issues of the
mesosphere's energetics and chemistry. It enhances understanding of observed
airglow variations, and facilitates the interpretation of these observations.
