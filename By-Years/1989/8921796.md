This research explores the formation of cube texture in face- centered cubic
metals. The past research has revealed that the deformation and
recrystallization textures in polycrystalline copper deformed by rolling and
channel-die compression are significantly different. Computer simulation
suggests that the differences could be due to lateral widening in rolling
deformation; and this is the basis for the new approach in the research,
controlled lateral widening in channel die compression. In this study of texture
development single crystals and bicrystals are employed using controlled
orientations. The bicrystals are used to characterize orientation effects on
recrystallized grain nucleation at grain boundaries. The orientation of
nucleated grains is critical to the texture development, and this is monitored
using the new electron back scatter pattern technique to measure microtexture.
