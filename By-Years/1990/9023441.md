This award supports the research of Professor D. Bump to work in automorphic
functions. He intends to work on extending the Rankin Selberg method and on new
uses of the metaplectic group. These include the study of non-unique Whittaker
models of theta functions on the n-fold cover of GL(2). Modular forms arose out
of Non-Euclidean geometry in the middle of the nineteenth century. Both
mathematicians and physicists have thus long realized that many objects of
fundamental importance are non-Euclidean in their basic nature. This field is
principally concerned with questions about the whole numbers, but in its use of
geometry and analysis, it retains connection to its historical roots and thus to
problems in areas as diverse as gauge theory in theoretical physics and coding
theory in information theory.
