This project tests the ability to reconstruct climate during Marine Isotope
Stage 3 (MIS3) using sediments, pollen, and radioisotopic analysis of tree
macrofossils recovered from a debris flow site in Oregon. Additionally, the
researchers aim to explore the potential to use such logs that have measurable
Carbon-14 to establish a floating chronological sequence to around 50,000
years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary broader impacts involve extending
radiocarbon dating back more than 12,000 years in fossil logs containing tree
rings for climatic analyses. The research would be done in close collaboration
with the Oregon Department of Transportation and its contractors, resulting in a
strong interaction between the scientists and technical and engineering experts,
although it was not clear how this would advance science and engineering in the
next generation. Science results would become part of an outreach effort at the
university and an Oregon state exposition. Graduate students from two
universities (University of Arizona and California State University at Fresno)
would be part of the research.
