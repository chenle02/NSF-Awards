Catchments are fundamental landscape units for understanding water quality and
managing water resources. Contemporary environmental problems are being
approached more than ever by stakeholders on the geographic basis of catchments,
where the underlying physical, biological, and chemical science is complex. This
conference focuses on catchment science, exploring the interactions among
hydrological, biological and geochemical processes that shape terrestrial and
aquatic ecosystems. An understanding of these processes is required in order to
consider responses of catchments and ecosystems to climate warming, atmospheric
deposition, land use shifts, catastrophic events, and other drivers of
environmental change. Participants in this conference are typically scientists
(e.g., hydrologists, ecologists, biogeochemists) from colleges, universities,
and government agencies around the world. The principal product of the
conference is the summary and dispersal of ideas throughout the broader
scientific community.
