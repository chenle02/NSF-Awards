Heteroepitaxial interfaces composed of II-VI and III-V compounds will be
fabricated under highly controlled conditions by utilizing modular molecular
beam(MBE) and chemical beam(CBE) epitaxies in order to investigate the effects
of valence mismatch on interfacial structures and physical properties. The
interfacial atomic structures will be investigated primarily by utilizing high
resolution transmission electron microscopy. Chemical and electronic properties
of the interfaces will be sutdied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy(XPS) and
optical spectroscopies. In- situ spectroscopic studies will be undertaken by
integrating spectroscopy instrumenatation to the MBE system for investigation of
local chemical bonding arrangements during real time formation of the
heterovalent interfaces. %%% The technological goal of this research involves
the development of new innovative optoelectronic and electronic devices
consisting of II-VI/III-V heterojunctions, and the integration of newly
developing light emitting devices of wide bandgap II-VI semiconductiors to
existing III-V semiconductor devices as well as the improvement of the
electrical contact to these devices. This research is expected to provide
advances in materials understanding and in the synthesis and processing of novel
material combinations which will be beneficial to the development of improved
devices and integrated circuits used in computing, information processing, and
telecommunications.
