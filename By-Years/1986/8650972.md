A statistics laboratory has been established at Carleton to support
undergraduate courses in the departments of Economics, Political Science,
Sociology/Anthropology, Psychology and Mathematics. Students will have
substantial hands-on experience with real data about real problems of interest
to them, and will gain understanding of both the power and limitations of
statistics. The statistics laboratory is based on: o microcomputers having the
memory and calculating facililty to make effective use of complex statistical
and data management programs on large data sets; o the SPSS and MINITAB
statistical packages, related graphics programs, relational data base programs,
and data communication programs; o data files, some from each of the several
disciplines, containing real information of significant current interest to
social scientists; and o lab assistants trained in the technical details
involved in running the several programs against the various files.
