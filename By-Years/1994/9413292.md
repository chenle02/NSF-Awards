The response of the tropical and equatorial ocean turbulent boundary layer
system to unsteady atmospheric forcing on time scales from doiurnal to annual
will be studied using a variety of numerical models. The surface layer mixing
paramerization will be used to explain the transition from an eastern and
central Pacific system to that of the western Pacific warm pool, reallistically
responding to differences in localand advective forcing regimes. This study is a
contribution to the Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean Atmosphere
Reponse Experiment (TOGA COARE).
