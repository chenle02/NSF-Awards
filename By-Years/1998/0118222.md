0118222&lt;br/&gt;Egami&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;International Conference on LOCAL
AND NANOSCALE STRUCTURE IN COMPLEX SYSTEMS will be held September 16-21, 2001 in
Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA. The purpose of this meeting is to discuss how the
nanoscale arrangements of atoms in solids and molecules determine the properties
of complex systems, from experimental as well as theoretical perspective.
Examples of complex systems include strongly correlated electron systems such as
superconducting cuprates and magnetostrictive (CMR) manganites, heavy fermion
metals, relaxor ferroelectrics, catalysts, polymers and other soft or molecular
compounds, and proteins. &lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;The subject of this conference
is at the cutting edge of condensed matter and materials physics. Graduate
students and postdoctoral fellows will be greatly stimulated and learn from
attending this conference. We plan to spend 60 % of the grant on students and
postdoctoral fellows who do not have other means of support. The rest will be
spent for inviting young and promising researchers who will not be able to
attend the conference without
support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
