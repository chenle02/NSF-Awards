The proposed research is aimed at eventually developing a "Mendelian" and
molecular framework for quantitative genetics using height in maize as a model
system. By correlating dwarf loci exhibiting extreme effects upon plant height
(particularly those involved in gibberellin biosynthesis) with loci demonstrated
by RFLP analysis to affect variation in height quantitatively, it should be
possible to verify the hypothesis that major "Quantitative Trait Loci" and
"single-gene mutant loci" in many cases will simply represent alternative
alleles at the same locus. This effort will follow up on earlier RFLP analysis
which demonstrated a casual positional correlation between the two types of
loci. By measuring the effect of exogenously-added gibberellin (GA) upon the
actions of plant quantitative loci and determining the positions of maize dwarf
loci with respect to RFLP marker loci, a stronger linkage could be obtained that
will demonstrate that plant loci controlling GA levels can affect phenotypic
variation, both quantitatively and qualitatively. The results of this work will
directly facilitate cloning efforts for these genes that could then be used to
study how variation in individual gene action contributes to variation in
complex phenotypes and how that variation is modulated by environmental
influences.*** //
