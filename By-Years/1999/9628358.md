96-28358 Crossley The PI proposes to determine to what extent gravity
observations could provide important and direct determinations of 1) the density
jump at the inner core/outer core boundary (ICB), 2) the gravity stability
profile of the liquid core and 3) the ellipticity of the core/mantle boundary
(CMB). Determinations of the relationship between core gravity signals at the
earth's surface and the dynamics of the liquid core of the earth should help our
understanding of the earths geomagnetic dynamo and the related issues of
convection in the earth's core and mantle. ***
