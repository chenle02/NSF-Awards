An early introduction to computers, during the first year of a pre- engineering
or physics program will motivate the students, and enhance their educational
experience. Students will learn the hardware, software, and related peripherals,
as they learn the concepts of physics. Students will become more familiar with
modern data acquisition and analysis techniques, which they are likely to
enounter when they transfer to B.S. degree programs in physics or engineering,
graduate school, or the work force. To facilitate this goal, the Physics
Department of Medgar Evers College will install a computer-based physics
laboratory for the first three semester of the four semester introductory
calculus level physics course, and integrate its use into five experiments each
semester. The computers will be used for data acquisition, analysis and control.
The physic laboratory will have 8 work stations centered on the Macintosh SE
computer, with MacADIOS Data Aquisition System, and it will contain a local area
network with a Macintosh II computer as the file server. The grantee provides
funds for this project that are an equal match for the NSF award.
