The Bethe algebras are important commutative subalgebras found in many infinite-
dimensional algebras such as universal enveloping algebras of polynomial current
algebras, Yangians, affine quantum groups, etc. Recent progress in the study of
the Bethe algebras led to the proofs of the B. and M. Shapiro conjecture, of the
tranversality conjecture, of the reality of Schubert Calculus, of the simplicity
of the spectrum of the gl(N) Gaudin model, of the simplicity of the Heisenberg
XXX chain, of the correspondence of the Bethe vectors and Fuchsian monodromy-
free operators as part of the geometric Langlands program and others. The PI
expects that the ideas used to obtain these results can be systematized and
further developed to a procedure which can be applied to many other important
cases. In particular, the PI intends to study the images of the Bethe
subalgebras in natural representations of the larger algebras by identifying it
with a ring of regular functions on a suitable algebraic variety and then
combining the information from the representation theory and algebraic geometry.

PI intends to establish and study new close relations between algebraic
geometry and theory of integrable models. Such a connection is expected to
produce a variety of new results in both disciplines.
