9603917 Sachs Certain conceptual issues have continued to vex scientists
throughout history. For example, distinctions between nature vs nurture and
between appetitive vs consummatory elements of behavior. This debate is fueled
by the difficulty in distinguishing between a strong desire (appetitive) and the
outcome of that desire (consummatory) just as it is difficult to separate the
role of biology (nature) from the environment (nurture) on behavior. Dr. Sachs
may have the model system to address the appetitive-consummatory issue since he
is able to separate arousal from the motivation-performance aspect of the
behavior. Using a variety of techniques ranging from the classic endocrine
manipulations to analyzing immediate early gene expression in specific brain
regions, he will identify the sensory, neural, and hormonal mechanisms that
underlie this autonomic armusal process. Dr. Sachs will use his model to explore
the relationship between autonomic arousal process, brain, and behavior. The
results will not only provide novel information about the central and peripheral
mechanisms underlying arousal but will also contribute to our conceptual
understanding of the distinction between appetitive and consummatory elements of
the behavior.
