This award from the Academic Research infrastructure Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at SUNY-Stony Brook acquire a 500 MHz NMR, and an
upgrade of an AMX 600 MHz NMR to a DMX600 MHz NMR which will be used in
research. The research activity to be supported includes the structural
investigations of five major users who work in organic chemistry and in
biological chemistry; the research includes studies of steroidal diamines as
DNA-targeted antibiotics, of electronic effects in face selection in addition
and elimination processes, of applications of the -lactam synthon method and of
4+4 photocycloaddition processes in approaches to taxol analogs, and of the
configurations of synthetic oxidosqualene cyclase and squalene epoxidase
inhibitors. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy is the most powerful
tool available to the chemist for the elucidation of the structure of molecules.
It is used to identify unknown substances, charcterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential
to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR
studies are useful in areas such as polymers and catalysis, and in biology.
