Electronic monitoring (EM) has the potential to address environmental concerns
around fishing, such as illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing (IUU
fishing). Electronic monitoring is a system of onboard cameras that records
fishing catches for later analysis, verification, and alignment with fisheries
regulations. There is a link between environmentally harmful fishing practices
and the exploitation of people, with dire consequences for workers at sea (e.g.
working conditions, occupational health and safety, forced labor, and modern
slavery). Recent research indicated that the environmental data captured by EM
may also reveal the social and labor conditions borne by workers and human
observers on vessels. Some environmental groups and governments have articulated
a vision of the potential of EM to save fish populations, while making the
fishing industriesâ€™ work easier for data reporting, traceability, and subsequent
profit increase. However, this vision pits human rights to decent working
conditions and fair treatment against human rights to
privacy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is an exploratory study to
investigate the overarching research question: How is the global environmental
imaginary and competing sociotechnical imaginary shaping the current use and
futures of EM in fisheries? The methods of investigation are semi-structured
interviews and documents analyzed with a grounded theory approach, participant
observation, foresight methods, and qualitative systems mapping (QSM).
Constrained Choice Theory serves as a lens to identify emerging competing
imaginaries and the drivers behind them. This project will: 1) contribute to the
comparatively small literature of how institutions create imaginaries; 2)
explore imaginaries at different scales from the global to local; 3) explore the
drivers that lead to reconfigured imaginaries; 4) explore the socio-cultural and
human dimensions surrounding EM; 5) and further develop the nascent method QSM.
Importantly, the research project will advance both theoretical and applied
understanding that could help reduce human rights abuses, including modern
slavery, in fisheries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is jointly funded by
the Science and Technology Studies program in SBE and Division Of Environmental
Biology in Biological Sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
