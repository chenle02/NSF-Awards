This project aims to develop a set of composite indicators of international
technological competitiveness. Preliminary indicators have already been
developed in a just-completed project by Viking Instruments and Georgia Tech.
These are based on data from available statistical data sets and new data
derived from expert opinion. The data cover 20 countries through 1985. Validity
of the indicators and their utility for policy purposes appear promising based
on initial analysis. The current project extends this work by: (1) augumenting
the data from statistical series and expert surveys; (2) conducting sensitivity
analyses on indicators developed; (3) analyzing the validity of the indicators
by several methods, including comparing the indicators against the several
underly- ing dimnesions of competitiveness and comparing the ranking of
countries on each new indicator against similar rankings using existing
indicators; and (4) performing reliability tests on data sets by tracing them
back to their sources and on opinion data by resurvey of respondents and
analysis of interrespondent reliability. The anticipated result is a set of
practical indicators of technological comptetitiveness suitable for inclusion in
subsequent editions of Science & Engineering Indicators.
