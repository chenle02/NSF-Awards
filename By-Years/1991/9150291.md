This project performs pilot studies to facilitate laboratory- based learning of
concurrent engineering concepts. The learn- by-doing laboratory approach to
teach concurrent engineering is made possible by rapid prototyping technologies,
in which a product design on a CAD system is transformed to its physical
counterpart using either stereo lithography appratus, selective laser sintering
or 3-D printing. This project develops a comprehensive architecture for
laboratory development, including equipment specifications, experiments, and
curricular recommendations which serve as a national model for adoption at other
universities. The project develops laboratory experiments and case studies to
teach concurrent engineering concepts with respect to manufacturability,
serviceability/maintainability, testability, quality and reliability during the
product design process.
