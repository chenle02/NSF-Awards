Raman spectroscopy is a technique that uses monochromatic light, usually
furnished by a laser, to provide detailed information on molecular vibrations
and the motions of molecules relative to each other. The technique therefore
provides chemists with a sensitive probe for understanding the structure of
complex materials. The Department of Chemistry at the University of California,
Riverside will use this award from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program
to help acquire a Raman spectrometer. The areas of chemical research that will
be enhanced by the acquisition include the following: 1) On-line Raman
spectroscopy of compounds separated by capillary supercritical fluid
chromatography 2) Raman studies of linear conjugated molecules 3) Studies of the
conjugate acids of vinylogous amides 4) Studies on the binding of vitamin D
steroids to receptors 5) Gas chromatography-matrix isolation-Raman spectroscopy.
