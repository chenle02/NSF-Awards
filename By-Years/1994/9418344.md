9418344 Byrne Ancient deformed accretionary prisms commonly preserve patterns of
multiple microstructure such as cleavage generations, fiberous overgrowths and
oriented vein sets. Inversions of these kinematic indications to relative plate
motions during the deformation event, which is of fundamental importance, is
quite speculative due to lack of rigorous tests of the hypothesis that they
accurately reflect such motions. This project will examine the pattern of
overprinting fabrics and kinematic indicators from the Shimanto Belt of
Southwest Japan, an example selected because of a well-known and significant
change in convergence directions during the deformation of the Belt, and because
this well exposed area has recieved considerable geologic study. Results should
provide a clear test of the idea that such features can be inverted to obtain
the relative convergence directions between the plates involved. Success in
assessing the degree to which such inversion results in accurate plate motions
will be widely applicable to other origins.
