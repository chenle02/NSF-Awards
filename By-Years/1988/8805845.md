The purposes of this study are to increase knowledge about standard setting in
the telecommunications and computer industries and to contribute to the
development of the body of theory on standard setting. The study employs a
taxonomy that divides standard setting into classes based on (a) the extent to
which there are strong interests in promoting the adoption of any universal
standard and (b) whether there are vested interests in the adoption of a
particular standard. This gives rise to a classification in which the possible
outcomes are Pure Coordination (where voluntary standards emerge because there
is strong interest in adopting a standard and few vested interests), Pure Public
Goods (where there are few vested interests but small interest in promoting a
standard, so that government intervention may be required), Pure Private Goods
(where no agent wants standardization because there are few private benefits and
large vested interests), and Conflict (where each agent wants its preferred
technology to be the standard). The taxonomy is used to guide case studies that
include those involving standards for Open Network Architectures, European
telephone systems, data base software, the Unix computer operating system, and
electronic mail. The study identifies those factors that determine whether these
cases involve Pure Coordination, Pure Public Goods, Pure Private Goods, or
Conflict and why different agents may prefer different outcomes. The study will
provide important empirical information about the rate of diffusion of new
technologies and about the nature of competition in telecommunications and
computers. Also, empirical evidence is needed to inform theory development in
this relatively new area of inquiry.//
