ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;02 July 2012&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:
1216510&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Skidaway Institute of Oceanography&lt;br/&gt;PI:
M. Richter&lt;br/&gt;Co-PI: J. Sanders&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal
requests two Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment items for the University of
Delaware for use aboard the R/V HUGH R. SHARP; namely a new double-articulated
side A-frame and up-grades to an existing portable deck winch. Both items will
enhance safety and provide greatly improved support capabilities to a wide
variety of scientific projects.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact
and Intellectual Merit: The PI addressed the Broader Impact and Intellectual
Merit of the proposed equipment specifically for the R/V HUGH R. SHARP. The
research projects supported have been individually peer-reviewed for scientific
merit. During operations, these vessels routinely expose graduate and
undergraduate students to seagoing oceanography. Specifically, College of Marine
and Earth Studies participates in a large number of outreach programs including
open house events (Coast Day), participation the MATE program, and educational
cruises. The College also hosts the UNOLS East Coast Van Pool. The R/V HUGH R.
SHARP is scheduled to support over 90 NSF-funded days in CY 2012.
