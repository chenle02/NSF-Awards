The NSF is partially supporting the nineteenth in a series of Atomic Physics
Gordon Research Conferences held at the Tilton School in Tilton, New Hampshire
from June 28 to July 3, 2009. The NSF supports students traveling to attend the
meeting. This meeting continues the tradition of focusing on emerging areas of
research within atomic physics and related fields. The areas addressed at this
conference include both theoretical and experimental developments, with emphasis
on areas that offer significant challenges and opportunities looking to the
future of the field. Sessions cover Precision Measurements, Quantum Information
Science, Mesoscopic Physics and Condensed Matter connections, Quantum Optics,
Ultrafast and X-Ray physics, Bose/Fermi Gases, and Atomic/Molecular Collisions.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2009 conference will continue the long tradition in
atomic physics of exploring the strong intersections with other areas of
physics. Talks in 2009 will brush up against ideas in condensed matter physics,
biophysics, astrophysics, particle physics, and information
science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
