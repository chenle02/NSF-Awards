9612360 King, Willis IEEE Computer Society Special Project: Annual International
Workshop on Computer Science and Engineering This proposal, from the IEEE
Computer Society, partially supports an International Workshop on CS and CE
accreditation. Selected visitors from foreign countries will be brought to the
meeting November 10-11, 1996, immediately following the FIE Conference in Salt
Lake City, Utah. Goals include the understanding of educational objectives and
standards of different nations, to attempt to form a common set of criteria for
accreditation and to work toward mutual recognition of computing degrees among
nations. The workshop is an IEEE-CS initiative and the Computer Society will
provide 50% of the total cost. Other cooperating societies include ACM, ABET,
CSAB, and IEEE. ***
