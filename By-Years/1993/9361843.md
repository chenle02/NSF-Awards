9361843 Chun This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is
in the general area of computational chemistry.The goal of the research is to
develop an algorithm which recursively finds an exact solution to Lagrange
multipliers. Simple unconstrained molecular dynamics simulations need to use
small steps to track the high frequency dynamics that result from stiff springs
representing chemical bonds and angles. To increase the step size, constraints
are often introduced in the particle equations by including a term representing
the constraint gradient multiplied by a Lagrange multiplier. While rigorous,
this method introduces new computational overheads, which has led to the
approximate and not entirely satisfactory SHAKE algorithm. SHAKE works well with
bonds and angles, but fails to generalize arbitrary constraints. In this
feasibility research, an algorithm, called EXACT which represents an exact
constraint technique, will be developed which will handle open and closed loops,
is highly efficient, can generalize arbitrary constraints and will be well-
suited for parallel implementation. %%% Computationally efficient molecular
dynamics algorithms are an enabling technology to deal with practical problems
such as rational drug design and design of advanced polymer composites. The
EXACT algorithm will be directly useful for real-world applications and, if
successful, by the end of Phase II will be incorporated into various commercial
software systems for dissemination to the computational chemistry community. ***
