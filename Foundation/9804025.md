The Mid-Atlantic Mathematical Logic Seminar (MAMLS), formed in the fall of 1982
under the aegis of Lee Stanley, has supported 3-4 regional meetings per year of
1-2 days' duration since then. These meetings are held at various locations and
cover a broad spectrum of mathematical logic with particular emphasis on
complexity theory, theoretical computer science, fragments of arithmetic, pure
and applied model theory, recursion theory, set theory, subsystems of analysis
in accordance with the program of H. Friedman and S. Simpson, and topos theory.
NSF support is provided for some of the expenses of the speakers and attendees,
in particular of the graduate students who attend.
