9501541 Toutanji This is a Career Development award. The research plan includes
the investigation of the deterioration of fiber reinforced plastics (FRP). The
studies will include consideration of the fibers, the matrix or resin, and the
interfacial bond between fibers and matrix. Durability will be evaluated under
wet-dry cycles, and freeze thaw cycles. Fresh and sea water will be considered.
The education plan will include undergraduates in research projects, integrate
state-of-the-art computer programs and have the students undergo practical, real
world experiences. Develop outreach services to the community involving
undergraduate and graduate students. ***
