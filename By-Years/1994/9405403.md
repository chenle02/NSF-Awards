Fisher 9405403 Advanced computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software for
distributed memory multicomputers will be developed to provide the resolution
capabilities (106-107 gridpoints) and high-order accuracy required for large
eddy simulation (LES) DG1 DG2 of turbulent flows in complex domain. The choice
of distributed memory parallel architectures is motivated by high performance
and economy which derives from their intrinsic ability to exploit data locality.
This work will be based on the spectral element method for the incompressible
Navier-Stokes equations, with emphasis on improving elliptic solver performance
and increasing geometric flexibility. Enhanced geometric and resolution
flexibility will be achieved through implementation of three-dimensional
nonconforming spectral element discretizations. The software will have a variety
of applications. The scope and complexity of the proposed activities will foster
further research in large scale parallel computation. {PAGE \# "'Page: '#'
