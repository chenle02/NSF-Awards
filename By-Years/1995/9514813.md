Wouter den Haan University of California, San Diego SBR-9514813 The research
will attempt to refine and formulate estimators and descriptive statistics
useful in macroeconomic research. Part of the research will emphasize empirical
research, other parts will emphasize econometric methodology. The specific areas
to be investigated, which are highly technical, include business cycles, long
variation in macroeconomic variables and forecast errors. Research of this type
will produce econometric tools which will allow macroeconomists to more
accurately analyze the economy.
