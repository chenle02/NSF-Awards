The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to bring agility to the network
infrastructure in data center networks. While modern data centers leverage
server virtualization to quickly and easily deploy applications, and storage
systems that abstract away the hard drives and enable applications to access any
data from any server at any time, the network infrastructure that protects and
makes the network more efficient is still largely hardware appliances. With
cloud traffic expected to quadruple over the next several years (according to
Cisco), a rapid growth in the number of devices (with the Internet of Things
emerging), and an ever increasing complexity and scale of security threats, this
project will provide data center operators with the agility to quickly and
easily deploy infrastructure to keep up with these trends and threats. In doing
so, society will experience more reliable networked applications with reduced
data breaches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research
(SBIR) Phase I project will provide technical validation for a new approach to
network function virtualization, invented at the University of Colorado,
Boulder, in which network functions are disaggregated into separate processing
and state storage components. Experiments in the lab have shown seamless
scalability, disruptionless failure management, and processing rates in line
with other software solutions. The goal of this project is to run in a
production environment (a data center with real traffic) to fully quantify the
throughput, latency, scalability, resilience, and cost effectiveness when faced
with production conditions.
