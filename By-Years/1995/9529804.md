9529804 Delong The primary objective of this research is to investigate the
physiological properties, metabolic activities and ecological significance of a
newly discovered abundant component of marine picoplankton: planktonic marine
archaebacteria. Recently results have demonstrated that planktonic marine
archaebacteria are widely distributed and can be relatively abundant in marine
prokaryote assemblages. Available data suggest that these microorganisms may
significantly influence carbon and energy flux in marine picoplankton. In
addition, since all other known archaebacteria have unique metabolic and
physiological properties, it is quite possible that planktonic marine
archaebacteria have unique characteristics which influence their ecological
function, and qualitatively distinguish them from other prokaryotic
picoplankters. This study will investigate the qualitative properties of
planktonic archaebacteria, and their quantitative contributions to picoplanktom
biomass and production in the Santa Barbara Channel. Methods that selectively
detect planktonic archaebacterial presence, metabolites, and activities will be
used to assess their ecological significance. Measurements of archaebacteria
relative abundance and distribution will be used to estimate their contribution
to picoplankton biomass. Techniques that estimate incorporation of radiolabel
into specific archaebacterial cellular metabolites (rRNA, lipids) will be used
to determine the relative flux of nutrients into planktonic archaebacterial
metabolic pools. This study will provide new information on a ubiquitous but,
little understood component of marine picoplankton. The ultimate goal of this
research is to relate the unique properties, biomass, and metabolic activities
of planktonic marine archaebacteria to the biological interactions and
biogeochemical processes through which they influence flows of energy and matter
in the sea. ***
