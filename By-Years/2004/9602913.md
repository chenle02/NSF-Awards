9602913 Goodman This U.S.-Brazil Program award will fund cooperative research
between Dr. Morris Goodman of Wayne State University and Drs. Horacio and Paula
Schneider from the Federal University of Para in Belem, Brazil. The Physical
Anthropology and Systematic Biology Programs are providing substantial support
as well. The goal of this research project is the gathering of conclusive
molecular evidence on the phylogeny and systematics of Neotropical primates and
to make this evidence available to the scientific community via an electronic
database. The Federal University offers access to the unique biodiversity of the
Amazonian region. The university is home to the Goeldi Museum of Natural
History, a national primate center and genetic laboratories, making it a major
scientific center for this type of research. In addition to a prime site, Dr.
Goodman brings his expertise as a leader in molecular phylogenetic studies. The
Brazilians are internationally recognized for their superior work on Neotropical
mammalogy. The resulting findings of this project will be of value to scientists
who deal with the problems of ceboid systematics below the generic level. They
will provide a phylogenetic classification of Neotropical primates from the
generic to the superfamily level in which each taxon accurately represents a
monophyletic group. Their World Wide Web page will work toward providing a
comprehensive monographic treatment of the phylogenetic systematics of
platyrrhine primates. ***
