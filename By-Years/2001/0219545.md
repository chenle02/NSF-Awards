Reducing energy consumption is a key challenge in the design of modern
microprocessors. Until recently, the primary source of energy dissipation in
CMOS microprocessors has been the dynamic switching of load capacitances, but
with continuing reductions in feature size and the accompanying reductions in
threshold voltage, static leakage power is increasing exponentially. Most
leakage power is dissipated on critical paths, especially after slower, low-
leakage transistors are used on non-critical paths. To reduce leakage energy
further, it is necessary to dynamically deactivate the fast leaky transistors on
critical paths when they are not needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is
developing fine-grain dynamic leakage reduction techniques, whereby small pieces
of an active processor are put to sleep for short periods of time. The project
is investigating circuit-level leakage reduction technique that have low sleep
transition energy and rapid wakeup times, together with micro-architectural and
compiler techniques that increase the sleep time of micro-architectural
components without impacting performance or dynamic power dissipation. Accurate
static power models that capture the sleep-time dependence of leakage energy are
being developed for use with architectural simulators. This work enables a new
class of limited critical activity architectures, where fast but power hungry
logic can be selectively enabled to speed critical paths while limiting overall
power consumption.&lt;br/&gt;
