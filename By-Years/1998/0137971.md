The PI plans to develop a strong program of research and education activities in
experimental magnetic resonance at George Mason University. The planned research
consists of two lines of investigation: (i) study of the physical mechanisms
responsible for the relaxation rates associated with quadrupolar nuclei in
crystalline materials using nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR); (ii) study of
the flow of polarization from laser-polarized xenon to its surrounding
environment using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The proposed research on NQR
has applications to the detection of landmines, explosives, and narcotics. The
proposed work on NMR/laser-polarized xenon has applications to quantum
computing, as well as many other important applications to increase the
sensitivity of NMR. By exposing women students to research projects on the
proposed topics, the PI hopes to encourage them to continue their careers in
science, engineering, and related fields.

The planned education activities include the development of engaging
introductory level courses to retain student interest in physics, the
introduction of new laboratory experiments and demonstrations to promote hands-
on learning of physical principles, mentorship of women students, and
supervision of undergraduate and graduate research projects. It is anticipated
that the ADVANCE award will not only advance the PI's career in academic
science, but also allow her to serve as a role model and mentor to women
students who are pursuing careers in academic science, engineering, or related
fields.
