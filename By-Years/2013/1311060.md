This action funds Alena Mikhaylova of the University of Texas at Arlington to
conduct a research project in Engineering during the summer of 2013 at Kyungpook
National University in Daegu, Republic of Korea. The project title is "Effect of
Steel Fiber Distribution and Orientation on Mechanical Characteristics of Zero-
Slump Concrete." The host scientist is Yeol Choi, Ph.D., P.E.

The application of steel fiber as alternative reinforcement in concrete has
gained popularity in recent years due to added ductility and crack control,
which leads to more sustainable structures. The proposed research program is
aiming to establish the relationship between uniformity of fiber distribution
within concrete matrix and material strength in concrete specimens. Quantitative
and statistical analyses are being conducted for the representative sample of
specimens by counting the number of fibers in a specimen per unit area.

Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce. Furthermore, the results of the study conducted at the
host institution will be presented at international conferences and related
concrete meetings and organizations. The findings will also be submitted as
journal manuscripts to the top tier peer reviewed journals such as ACI
Structural, ASCE structural and Transportation Research Record. The results of
this study and experience abroad will be presented to the meetings of Society of
Women Engineers (SWE) in order to excite other female undergraduate and graduate
students to join NSF programs such the EAPSI.
