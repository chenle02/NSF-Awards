Dr. Richard Crutcher, at the University of Illinois, together with his
colleague Dr. Thomas Troland, at the University of Kentucky, will continue a
very successful long term program to measure magnetic field strengths in
interstellar clouds, and they will extend the program into new areas. Using the
Very Large Array in New Mexico, a major effort will be made to map the
distribution of the Zeeman effect in lines of neutral atomic hydrogen and
hydroxyl from interstellar clouds. Another part of the project is to continue
survey observations of the Zeeman effect on spectral lines of hydroxyl toward
central regions of dark clouds using telescopes at the National Radio Astronomy
Observatory in West Virginia and at the National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center
in Puerto Rico. Single-antenna measurements of magnetic field strengths will be
extended to denser regions by observations of the Zeeman effect in the 3-mm
lines of CN. This experiment will allow for the first time direct probing of
magnetic field strengths at the crucial stage in the star formation process when
core fragmentation and collapse are taking place. The observational program
supported by this award will provide fundamental tests of theoretical studies of
magnetic fields in interstellar clouds. This research will therefore lead to the
essential empirical framework for understanding the role of magnetic fields in
the evolution of dense interstellar clouds and in star formation.
