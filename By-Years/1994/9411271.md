The hormones of the posterior pituitary are known to function in regulating
water/mineral balance, stimulating contractions of the reproductive tract, and
controlling lactation. Recently these hormones have been discovered to be
distributed throughout the brain and have been implicated in the regulation of
behaviors such as attention, learning, communication, aggression, reproduction
and parenting. This project examines whether the pituitary hormone vasotocin
plays a crucial role in coordinating the body's physiological responses to
changing environmental conditions while at the same time modulating the
individual's social behavior. The hypothesis is that environmental stress causes
massive vasotocin release into the bloodstream, inhibiting gonadal function,
inhibiting vasotocin action in brain areas regulating social behavior, and
inhibiting reproductive behavior. In contrast, nonstressful environmental
conditions decrease vasotocin release into the bloodstream while increasing its
production in brain circuits modulating social behavior, leading to the onset of
reproduction and paternal behavior. Experiments will measure the distribution of
vasotocin in the brain and observe social behavior under different environmental
conditions to test the hypothesis. If this hypothesis is correct, it suggests
that it may be very difficult for the body to respond to physiological stress
without inadvertently affecting social behavior.
