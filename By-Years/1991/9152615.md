Toward Making Mathematics a Laboratory ScienceUsing state of the art Computer
Algebra Systems and working in teams, students are experimenting with applying
mathematics to physics and engineering problems. Emphasis is on modeling,
insight, conceptual understanding and interpretation of results, rather than on
routine calculations. The aim of the projects is to profoundly effect the
teaching of the freshman/sophomore sequence, and ultimately all of the
curricula. The plan is to focus on the relatively few truly central ideas, to
make them memorable, and to stress the interrelation between these key
mathematical concepts and their relevance to the world of science and
engineering.
