The Department of Physics at the State University of New York at Stony Brook
will purchase a Process Systems International model 1410 helium liquefaction
system to replace (and upgrade) the 20years old deteriorated existing one. The
equipment will be used for several ongoing materials research projects,
primarily work on high temperature superconductivity in cuprates and fullerence,
Josephson junctions and electronics, fractional quantum Hall effect, macroscopic
quantum phenomena, and single-electron tunneling. Use of a closed cycle helium
liquefaction system will significantly reduce the cost of research funded by NSF
and other federal and state agencies and contribute to conservation of a limited
natural resource-helium gas.
