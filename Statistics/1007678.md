The investigators study statistical analysis of multinomial counts with a large
number K of categories and a small number n of sample size. This "large K and
small n" problem is a very challenging problem that requires thinking about
statistical inference at a fundamental level. Employing an auxiliary data-
generating approach to reason directly toward probabilistic inference , the PIs
develop methods that are probabilistic and have desirable frequency properties.
A sequence of topics to be investigated include 1) one-sample and two-sample
"large K and small n" multinomial inference; 2) large-scale simultaneous
hypothesis testing; 3) application in genome-wide association study; and 4)
associated efficient computational methods. The "large K and small n"
multinomial inference is motivated by genome-wide association studies with a
large number of genotypes from single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) data. SNPs
are major genetic variants that may associate with common diseases such as
cancer and heart disease. With new statistical methods and computing software to
be developed in the project, the research is expected to generate useful tools
for applied statisticians and scientists who are challenged by very-high-
dimensional count data.
