The Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium (LUMCON) will initiate a six-week,
commuter and residential Young Scholars project in the Marine Sciences for 10
students entering grade 12. During the first 2 weeks of the summer activity,
participants will be provided with a daily lecture on Marine Science and a
hands-on laboratory or field trip. Lectures, labs and field trips will be
conducted by LUMCON faculty and invited faculty from Louisiana universities
having marine science programs. During Week 3, all students will participate in
a three-day/two-night cruise aboard the R/V Pelican to the Mississippi delta
region of the Gulf of Mexico. At the end of this three-week familiarization
experience, each student will be matched with a mentor for a research experience
of variable length and type, to take place sometime later in the summer. The
objective is to provide participants an opportunity for deeper involvement in an
active research program -- not to give the students independent projects.
