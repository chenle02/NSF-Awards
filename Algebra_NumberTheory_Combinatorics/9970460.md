The main focus of this proposal is the study families of algebraic surfaces of
type K3 with total space equal to a 3-dimensional Calabi-Yau manifold. The
string theories compactified on such Calabi-Yau manifolds and their dual
theories suggest some interesting relationships between the theory of
automorphic forms and thegeometry of such families. We propose to relate this
study to some known mathematical constructions of automorphic forms on the
period spaces of K3 surfaces.

The area of research in this proposal is algebraic geometry. This is the branch
of mathematics dealing with geometric objects connected to systems of algebraic
equations of arbitrary degree and in arbitrary number of variables. It has roots
its in the ancient Greek geometry of conic sections and the method of
coordinates of Rene Descartes.
