Dr. Madnia's proposed research involves the use of numerical methods for
nonpremixed turbulent combustion. His research plan involves the study of
turbulent combustion using (1) Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) with affordable
chemistry (reduced chemistry) in order to obtain flame structure and concepts,
and (2) Large Eddy Simulation (LES) of chemically reacting flows using
Lagrangian Monte Carlo methods for the solution to the subgrid transport
equations. Flame structure and extinction will be investigated and compared to
experiments. Methane flames with reduced chemistry using DNS will be studied in
order to assess the flamlet and distributed flame models. The PI also intends to
pursue several exploratory ideas for numerical models of plasma thick film
processes, pulsatile flows for bioengineering, and CVD techniques. He intends to
write an undergraduate textbook on CFD, develop interactive basic fluid videos,
perform outreach in high schools and industry and involve undergraduates in
research.
