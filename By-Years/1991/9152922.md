The goal of this project is to initiate teaching of nerve, muscle and cardiac
physiology in animal physiology and introductory biology laboratories. Computers
are used with modern physiological instrumentation to acquire and analyze data
from physiological events in nerves and muscle. Computer simulations will
reinforce principles of nerve and muscle function. Students in Biology of
Organisms are introduced to data acquisition systems to teach them principles of
muscle physiology in a hands-on setting. Force transducers and amplifiers are
interfaced with computers equipped with data acquisition software to record and
store data from contraction of frog muscle. The oscilloscope of the new software
will permit analysis of nerve action potentials. Students will use these
physiological work stations extensively when conducting experiments in nerve,
muscle and cardiac function during the research-projects portion of Animal
Physiology. This project will significantly extend the instructional capability
of our department into areas of physiology that currently cannot be taught
because of a lack of modern instrumentation. Computerized data acquisition is
the most cost-effective means of initiating these kinds of laboratory
experiences.
