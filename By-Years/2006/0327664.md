This is a proposal for continued support of the International Arctic Research
Center (IARC) at the university of Alaska Fairbanks. Under the theme of Climate
of the Arctic: Modeling and Processes (CAMP), IARC will fill needed roles in
arctic climatic research by using its unique international character to
integrate and synthesize across discipline boundaries, thereby forming a
connection between the arctic modeling and global modeling communities. IARC's
projects are intended to enhance strategic collaboration for IARC's synthesis
and integration efforts by international researchers who have agreed to
participate in IARC's efforts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The present renewal
proposal outlines research plans, and provides specific descriptions of the
activities planned for the first year. Research areas central to the IARC effort
include (1) permafrost/frozen-soil modeling, in which state-of-the-art soil
hydrology and thermodynamic formulations will draw upon comprehensive field
measurements and integrated datasets of permafrost, including data from the
Barrow Permafrost Observatory; (2) changes of arctic biota/vegetation, for which
pan-Arctic data will be used to drive simulations of changes in vegetative
cover, the role of disturbance (e.g., fire), and feedbacks to externally forced
climate change; (3) Arctic Ocean/sea ice studies in which the intersection of
core activities (the Arctic Ocean Model Intercomparison Project and the Nansen-
Amundsen Basin Observational System) will provide new insights into the
disposition and variability of Atlantic water inflow to the Arctic; and (4)
studies of arctic atmospheric processes that are central to simulating and
projecting climate change, including studies of cloud-radiative and moisture
feedbacks, changes in extreme events (e.g., floods, droughts, storms), and
strategies for downscaling coarse-resolution model output to the Arctic.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The international dimension will be enhanced by
collaborative projects with Japanese scientists. Outreach activities will
include the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment (ACIA), for which the Secretariat
is at IARC.&lt;br/&gt;
