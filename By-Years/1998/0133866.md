Dr. Tracy A. Hanna, Department of Chemistry, Texas Christian University is
supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program of
the Division of Chemistry, National Science Foundation, for her work under a
CAREER Award to study solution models for SOHIO oxidation/ammoxidation
catalysis. The SOHIO process is used industrially to oxidize propylene to
acrolein and to effect the ammoxidation of the same feedstock to produce
acrylonitrile. The active SOHIO catalyst involves both bismuth and molybdenum.
The objectives of this research are to investigate the formation and reactivity
of bismuth(II) radicals and prepare bimetallic calixarene-supported models of
the SOHIO catalytic components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is integrated
with undergraduate education, outreach programs, international collaboration and
the inclusion of under-represented groups. In conjunction with this, both
advanced and introductory chemistry courses at TCU are being reshaped and
modernized. Primary components include the development and implementation of a
"write-your-own" laboratory program in general chemistry, curricular reform,
web-based course material development, and the incorporation of peer
instruction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
