Nontechnical summary Relationship Among Demographic, Social, and Genetic
Structure Recent results from Altmann's studies provided the most complete
genetic analysis of any wild nonhuman primate group and identified paternity and
genetic structure in a baboon group that is striking for its reflection of
observed behavior. The analyses relating social structure, behavior, and genetic
structure can now be extended to enable evaluation of the magnitude of
variability over time and space for these long-lived animals that, like humans,
mature slowly and exhibit a considerable range of behavior and group
composition. The extent of variability in behavior and in its effects on genetic
structure is important for its implications for evolution and biodiversity. A
second major goal of the present study, therefore, will be to identify
particular behavioral and other mechanisms that produce the relationships
between social and genetic structure. These include investigations of the
conditions and mechanisms whereby mate choice and alliances modify the power of
male dominance status to determine paternity and those whereby close relatives
are recognized and avoided as mates when the ubiquitous mechanism of emigration
from the group of birth is not sufficient for avoiding inbreeding. These kinds
of behavioral and other mechanisms are essential components of basic
evolutionary processes. They may also be significant determinants of survival
under critical conditions such as low population density or population
fragmentation, in which case an understanding of mechanisms and their
functioning can provide not only a potent predictor of population response but
also a powerful management tool for shaping outcomes.
