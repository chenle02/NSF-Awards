9626315 Pena-Mora This project seeks to explore how negotiation models can best
be shaped to fit needs of the large-scale engineering environment, and hoe the
negotiation table within that environment might benefit from the model. Because
the negotiation "table" under consideration is a computerized communication
network, this research will include recommendations on how to capture the
theoretical knowledge and translate it into a usable element within a
computerized decision- making system or computer supported design environment.
