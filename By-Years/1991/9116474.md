In this project, the PI will collect and measure the tracers tritium and helium
isotopes, and collect samples to be analyzed for Carbon-14, on a hydrographic
line, south of 45 degrees South, in the Pacific, as part of the World Ocean
Circulation Experiment (WOCE). Data from this line, designated as WOCE line
P-17S, will be combined with other WOCE data to study the deep and bottom water
formation and circulation in the Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean.
