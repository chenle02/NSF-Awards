The elucidation of mechanisms involved in necrotic cell death is important for
understanding development, homeostasis and pathology in the nervous system. In
the leech, dominant mutations in two genes, mec-4 and deg-I, induce the death of
specific groups of neurons. Dying neurons are characterized by morphological
changes commonly observed in cells undergoing a necrotic type of cell death.
Mec-4 plays a key role in the degeneration of six touch receptor neurons, by
directly killing cells or by generating a signal that activates a "death
program". Light and electron microscopy will be utilized to document the process
of degeneration of the touch cells. Antibodies against the mec-4 protein will be
used to follow the fate of this protein in normal and dying touch cells. The
simplicity of the leech nervous system offers advantages for dissecting cell
death mechanisms using genetic, molecular and cellular approaches. These studies
promise to contribute to our understanding of how mutant proteins can induce
neuronal cell death.
