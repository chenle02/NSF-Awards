9402324 Chave This experiment is designed to provide direct observational
constraints on the distribution of melt and the pattern of upwelling beneath a
mid-ocean ridge. Studies of electromagnetic and seismic wave propagation in the
mantle with arrays of ocean- bottom instruments will furnish measurements that
can be inverted to find horizontal and vertical variations in velocity and
conductivity structure that can be used to test theoretical models of flow. 56
seafloor electromagnetic instruments will be deployed for one year at 17 degrees
south on the East Pacific Rise. ***
