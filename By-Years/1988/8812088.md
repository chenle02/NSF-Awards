This ocean sciences instrumentation development project will develop, construct,
and test a transient electromagnetic sounding system to be deployed from the
Scripps Deep Tow Vehicle or other remotely operated vehicles. The TDEM (time
domain electromagnetic method) system is a deep-water adaptation of a similar
instrument that was successfully tested in shallow water and one that has been
employed in terrestrial studies. The system will be towed across the seafloor to
continuously map the electrical conductivity of the underlying sediment and
rock. A switched magnetic source generates a signal which diffuses through the
seafloor rocks and is detected by magnetometers towed a fixed distances behind
the source. Modifications in the detected signal from the source signal that are
brought about by differing properties of underlying rocks, provides an estimate
of electrical conductivity as a function of depth. Information may then be
inferred about sub-seafloor hydrothermal circulation, sulfide ore deposits,
sedimentation rates, and other geological features. Features may be measured as
far as a few hundred meters beneath the seafloor and electromagnetic
measurements are independent from those provided by seismic or sonar surveys.
