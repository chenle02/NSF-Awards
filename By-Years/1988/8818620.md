Cytokin are a group of plant hormones which play an important role in cell
division and differentiation. The mechanisms controlling the appropriate levels
of cytokinins in plants are poorly understood. The long term goal of the
research project is to identify regulatory elements controlling cytokinin
metabolism in the genus Phaseolus. Recent findings led to the discovery of
genetic differences in cytokinin metabolism in Phaseolus embryos, identification
of novel zeatin metabolites and isolation of three cytokinin specific enzymes.
As the activities of these enzymes are species specific and the resulting
metabolites display higher biological activity than the parent compound,
selective expression of key metabolic enzymes may be a significant mechanism of
regulating active cytokinin levels. To elucidate the metabolic control
mechanisms, we propose to further characterize the enzymes, to generate
mononclonal anti bodies for detection of enzyme activity at different
developmental stages and to conduct molecular analyses of the regulation and
expression of these enzymes. The proposed work is important to the formulation
of a working model governing the overall controls of hormone metabolism in
higher plants. Cytokinins are a group of hormones which regulate plant growth
and cell division. The proposal work is designed to isolate and identify aspects
of these plant hormones and their functioning to better understand plant growth.
