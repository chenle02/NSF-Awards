The proposal requests equipment to modernize undergraduate training in
pharmacology by introducing the techniques of molecular biology and immunology
into both an undergraduate majors course in experimental pharmacology and an
undergraduate independent research course. Three faculty members will
collaborate to accomplish this goal. One is expert in molecular biology
techniques; another is expert in immunological methods and quantitative imaging
techniques; the third member contributes a classical pharmacology perspective
and, as Director of Undergraduate Studies, is skilled at incorporating research
developments into the undergraduate teaching program. The department is
currently equipped with a DNA sequencer, an oligonucleotide synthesizer, a
fluorescence imaging system, and a blot analyzer. The additional equipment
requested will be coupled with the existing sophisticated instrumentation in
order to revitalize the two courses.
