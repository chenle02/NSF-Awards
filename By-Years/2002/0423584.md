This project from an EPSCoR state, acquiring A Zmini camera that captures 3D
information (real time color and depth) at video rates, aims to model and render
3D information. Activities include Acquiring a cloud of points using the Zmini
camera from multiple viewpoints, Generating a surface using a modified marching
cubes algorithm, and Automatically binding the model to a skeleton for character
animation (called auto-rigging). Thus, point cloud modeling from the camera will
be used to create surfaces, specifically humanoid, that can be auto-rigged and
animated. Both Computer Science Graphics (CSG) and Digital Production Arts (DPA)
programs will use the camera. The research involves the following projects:
Surface Reconstruction from Point Cloud and Stream Line Digital Character
Generation.

Broader Impact: The use of the Zmini camera to capture and animate 3D images
promises to have significant impact in teaching and learning, as well as
advancing discovery and understanding of learners. The device will provide
students and faculty with the opportunity to incorporate image-based modeling in
their work at the DPA program. The camera will be used in classes with a high
percentage of minority enrollment where students will gain research experience
in the conference presentation interactive program.
