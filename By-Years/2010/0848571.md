Dmitri Makarov of the University of Texas is funded by an award from the
Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to study biological phenomena
that involve the translocation of proteins through pores. Professor Makarov and
his research group are developing computational tools and applying them to
characterize the relationship between the structure of proteins and their
resistance to co-translational unfolding. These computational studies complement
recent single-molecule protein translocation experiments. An interdisciplinary
workshop on single molecule dynamics that brings together theorists and
experimentalists from a variety of disciplines is being
planned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advances in molecular level understanding of the
mechanisms of protein translocation may have a broad impact in terms of
understanding the diseases that are related to defects in translocation
machinery.
