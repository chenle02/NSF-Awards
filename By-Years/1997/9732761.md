9732761 Heyliger An experimental device is acquired to detect resonant modes of
unrestrained free vibration of solid objects with anisotropic properties using
impulse excitation.Such modes are difficult to detect using more traditional
acoustic spectroscopy techniques, particulary for specific geometries of the
solid. Combining the measurements with numerical calculations and an inverse
scheme, a powerful method is developed to determine material properties of
materials with unknown constitution. The apparatus is also used for
nondestructive evaluation of transportation structures and classroom
demonstration of principles in dynamics and vibration. ***
