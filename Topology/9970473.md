9970473 Kirillov This research is concerned with the theory of tensor
categories, in particular, with the categories of representations of quantum
groups and affine Lie algebras arising in mathematical physics. The principal
investigator will work on the geometric realization of these categories in terms
of sheaves on configuration spaces. In particular, he will work on a geometric
construction of the unitary inner product in such categories, which is extremely
important for physical applications. He will study the combinatorial identities
that arise, generalizing Macdonald's inner product identities to affine root
systems. The principal investigator will also work on a book containing an
accurate and complete exposition of the theory of tensor categories, modular
functors, and topological quantum field theory, using as the main example the
category of representations of quantum groups at roots of unity, whose physical
counterpart is the Wess-Zumino-Witten modular functor. This study is in the
general area of representation theory of Lie algebras and related objects, or,
more generally, mathematical structures appearing in physics (conformal field
theory). This is a very actively developing field, in which mathematics is
greatly enriched with the new ideas and intuition coming from physics.
Unfortunately, sometimes there is a large gap between the physical ideas and
mathematically rigorous construction or proof, which can take years to fill.
This project should fill some of these gaps and pave the way to new mathematical
discoveries. ***
