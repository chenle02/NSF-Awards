Cholecystokinin (CCK) and gastrin are members of a family of neural-
gastrointestinal peptides. CCK is one of the most abundant vertebrate brain
peptides. The function(s) of CCK in nervous tissue is unknown. This proposal
outlines studies of a CCK/gastrin homologue in the invertebrate, Drosophila.
Genomic and cDNA clones have been isolated which contain two tandem DNA
sequences, each with strong homology to CCK. Chromosomal localization maps the
gene to the third chromosome. Preliminary in situ tissue localization indicates
the presence of the transcript in the adult Drosophila head. The immediate goals
of the proposal include: 1) complete genomic and cDNA sequence analyses, 2)
isolation of naturally-occurring peptides and subsequent structural
characterization, 3) identification of specific cells that express the gene by
in situ hybridization, 4) generation of antibodies to synthetic peptides whose
structures have been deduced from the DNA sequences and 5) construction of an
anatomical map for the peptides by immunohistochemistry. DNA sequence analysis
will provide information on possible control elements within the gene. Isolation
of the naturally-occurring peptides will confirm processing sites, identify
structure and demonstrate peptide existence. Structural data will be used to
design synthetic peptides for future physiological studies. Localization data
will suggest a function. This will provide information on regulation, processing
and sites of action in Drosophila neural and gastrointestinal tissue.
