This award is to purchase a multiple degree of freedom, high precision, light
weight stereo camera head. The same equipment is being purchased at three other
institution in a shared research effort. Research topics include gaze control
and target tracking, stereo and motion analysis, landmark- based navigation,
automatic acquisition of object and environmental models, hands-eye
coordination, dextrous manipulation with multi-fingered hands, real-time
perception and manipulation. System software, algorithms and subsystems will be
shared across the institutions. The University of Pennsylvania will be
purchasing equipment to support a multi-institutional shared research effort in
active vision for robot navigation and manipulation. Other members of the
consortium are the University of Rochester, University of Maryland and the
University of Massachusetts. Each institution will acquire the same stat-of-the-
art binocular camera head of high precision and high speed, and will share in
the development of systems software and applications software.
