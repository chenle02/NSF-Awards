The photosynthetic ultraphytoplankton dominate ocean systems, both in terms of
primary productivity and biomass, especially in stratified waters. However, the
eukaryotic ultraplankton are only poorly known. This lack of basic information
probably results from their small size, fragility, and resistance to culturing
efforts. General studies of pigments in diverse oceanic systems reveal several
abundant pigments which undoubtedly are from the eukaryotic ultraplankton and
they undoubtedly will be of utility in classifying and identifying the taxa.
However, there has been no systematic attempt to correlate these pigments with
the taxa---a result of lack of species definition. It is unclear whether the few
recorded instances are characteristic of the oligotrophic systems. The PIs
propose to characterize oceanic ultraplankton populations through the seasons
and at a variety of stations in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. They will use
ultrastructural analyses of cultured specimens to provide reference materials
and correlate those morphological entities with their pigment- signatures. The
resultant information will provide valuable information for studies on
distribution, physiological ecology, and systematics of the oceanic
ultraphytoplankton.
