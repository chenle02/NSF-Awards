This workshop grant is for an Academic-Industrial Workshop on Complex and
Evolving Multiphase Flows.

The intellectual merit of the effort lies in establishing a stronger
understanding of the topic of complex systems research, specifically in evolving
mixture flows. Intellectual partnerships are expected to develop directly from
the workshop. The need to bring talents together to attack a range of problems,
maintaining a focus on deep fundamental understanding while addressing a group
objective, is expected to result in development of approaches to classify and
organize understanding of the hierarchy of issues involved in complex systems.

Broader impacts from the effort include a reorientation of research philosophy
toward team environments for complex systems research. Demonstration of the
importance of complex systems issues of major societal impact, in which
fundamentals of science and engineering play a central role, is expected to
promote better direction and retention of highly motivated students. The
interaction of industrial and academica researchers in this effort will expand
the opportunities for student exploration of topics early in their careers.
