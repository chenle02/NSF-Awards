This REU Site will support ten undergraduate students per year to carry out
research on reconstructing climate impacts on hydrologic, soil, and ecological
systems, and on energy-water nexus and infrastructure adaptations. The new
10-week REU incorporates the previous program's unique aspects and particular
strengths, including: (a) cross-cohort field exercises, seminars, and peer
shadowing (b) recruiting of highly-diverse, competitive student cohorts, (c)
STEM professional development, (d) an emphasis on campus sustainability
practices, and (e) significant undergraduate research publication. In
recognition of the critical links between scientific research and societal
implications, the new REU site will include an environmental policy component
through new workshops, seminars (Climate Science BootCamp), and 1:1 interactions
between students and policy mentors. In addition, there will be opportunities
for research in Botswana, China and Guam, the fields of study of have been
broaden, and several new aspects to the evaluation have been added (including a
comparison of semester long vs. summer REU research experiences).
