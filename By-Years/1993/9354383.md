9354383 Dubeck This project will write a 1OO-page-long environmental supplement
(A World View of Environmental Issues) which will be published by Saunders
College Publishing to accompany the textbook Physics: A World View, by
Kirkpatrick and Wheeler, which has sold 15,000 copies in its first year. Over a
3-5 year period, an estimated 50,000 copies of the supplement will be
shrinkwrapped with the text and offered free of charge to all students and
faculty. Formative testing of the supplement and student evaluations of the
topics covered will be conducted in large introductory physics courses at Temple
University. Each topic will describe the way society reacts to scientific and
technological developments through the legal system. The depiction of these
issues in the visual mass media will also be analyzed. The environmental issues
to be discussed are: nuclear power plants and-nuclear waste; indoor air
pollution; stratospheric ozone depletion and the greenhouse effect; and
electromagnetic waves: effects on humans. The staff consists of one physicist
who has co-authored several textbooks/instructor's manuals, one environmental
lawyer with a biology background, two environmental engineers, a media
specialist, and a research librarian. The authors of Physics: A World View and
Saunders staff will help produce the supplement. The staff will write articles
describing the supplement and student reactions to the topics.
