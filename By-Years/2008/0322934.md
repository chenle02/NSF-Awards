The Detroit Area Pre-College Engineering Program (DAPCEP) is a request for a
Youth-Based project to engage students in activities that will increase their
access to information technology within the context of engineering and increase
their opportunities to explore related college and career paths. The students
use information technology to solve engineering problems. The focus of the
project is on promoting fluency with information technology concepts and skills
within the context of engineering. The project targets 120 African American and
Latino students and 180 parents in a series of planned courses for 7th and 9th
grades in automotive engineering. Students will receive 136 contact hours per
year while parents receive 18 contact hours per year. DAPCEP is a three-year
initiative to implement a two-year curriculum, with the third year of NSF
support being used to support year one of the two-year curriculum for a new
cycle. Students participate in the program for two years, 3 hours each Satruday
for 6 weeks and for 4 weeks during the summer. Students will have the
opportunity to stay on the University of Detroit campus for one of the two years
of the project. The project has four major components: recruitment strategies,
student courses, parent/guardian workshops and information dissemination.
