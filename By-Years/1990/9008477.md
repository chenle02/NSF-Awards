Under a Research Initiation Award, an investigation of near- wall vortex
structures in a turbulent boundary layer is to be carried out. The approach is a
theoretical one, and is focused on the origin, stability, and dynamics of
longitudinal, streamwise vortices. Turbulence structure, wall shear, and their
control depend on resolving the characteristics and evolution of organized
vortex structures embedded in the turbulence.
