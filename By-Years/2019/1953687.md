Many random growth models, such as fire propagation or bacterial colony growth
are believed to share certain universal pattern. Analyzing the mathematical
mechanism of such pattern has been an active research area in the last twenty
years. Due to the breakthrough progress in the probability and mathematical
physics community, an increasing number of models have been successfully
analyzed and they are found to share the same large time limiting behaviors.
These models are called to belong to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality
class, named after Mehran Kardar, Giorgio Parisi, and Yi-Cheng Zhang who
introduced a non-linear stochastic partial differential equation, the so-called
KPZ equation, to describe the random growing interfaces.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to study models in the KPZ universality
class with spatial periodicity. One goal of this project is to analyze the
periodic solvable growth models and understand their universal limiting
behaviors under different parameter scales by probing the structure and
asymptotics of the Bethe roots associated with these models. The other goal is
to develop a new direction to approach the KPZ universality class in the
infinite space by obtaining exact results of periodic solvable growth models
when the period becomes sufficiently large.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
