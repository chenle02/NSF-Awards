This project is an investigation of some of the fundamental processes behind
interannual and decadal variability in the coupled ocean-atmosphere system of
the tropical Pacific. One focus of the proposed research is whether there are
energetic coupled modes in different frequency bands: "fast" - on the order of 1
year; "intermediate" - the ENSO mode; "slow" - a decadal mode, and whether,
together these modes and their nonlinear interactions can produce some of the
complex time dependence seen in the tropical Pacific. Several approaches will be
used to study the problem. First, the linear modes of a hierarchy of different
linearized coupled models will be determined. The most complex of these models
is a coupled MOM3 multi-level ocean and a multi-level spectral atmospheric
model, linearized around a steady state. The response of the linearized models
to high-frequency stochastic forcing will also be examined. The upper-ocean
energy budgets of these models will be diagnosed in order to understand the
dynamics responsible for each mode. A modified version of the Cane-Zebiak
intermediate model will be used to examine nonlinear interactions between the
different modes. It is anticipated that the fast coupled mode and the ENSO mode
will interact primarily through the effects of zonal advection on temperature
while the ENSO and decadal mode will interact through ocean thermocline
displacement. The effects of using more general stochastic wind stress and heat
flux forcing (using observed spatial EOFs with amplitudes that are white noise
processes) will also be examined. The process modeling approach will be
augmented with analysis of decadal variability in climate model output through a
collaboration with Dr. Kimoto of Tokyo University (CCSR). This research is
important because it has the potential to improve the physical understanding of
the observed behavior of coupled ocean-atmosphere climate phenomena in the
tropical Pacific and, hence, projections of climate phenomena such as El Nino.
