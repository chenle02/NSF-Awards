The research is directed toward improved modeling of urban climates. An existing
simulation model will be extended and improved by: (a) considering a wider range
of conditions (seasons, meteorological conditions, canyon geometries) in the
simulations; (b) incorporating more complex, but realistic, components that will
account for buoyancy effects, moist surfaces, and advection; (c) eliminating
unrealistic aspects of the current model; and (d) validating the model against
observational studies in the literature. The model can then be used to
investigate the causal elements of urban microclimates, and it will also serve
as a tool to be used by planners concerned with urban design. Results from this
type of modeling are likely to become more important in the design of future
cities given that urbanization is increasing at an unprecedented rate and there
is greater concern with human comfort and safety in urban environments.
