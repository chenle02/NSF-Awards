This project is an interdisciplinary cooperation between a leading neural
network researcher, a computer scientist, and a chemical engineer, to develop
and test advanced concepts of neural networks to control systems. The methods
under study promise, in the long-term, an ability to handle noisy nonlinear
systems beyond the reach of more conventional forms of control theory. Practical
applications to chemical engineering problems will be attempted, in a realistic
context.
