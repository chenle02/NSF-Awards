The concept of a group appears in several areas of pure and applied mathematics.
Often a group has a topological space, its "boundary at infinity", that gives us
some information about the group. The study of this brings the fields of
topology, algebra, and dynamics into play. This project addresses the broad
question of how much the boundary of a group determines the group. The principal
investigator continually seeks to spread mathematical knowledge to a wide
audience, including under-represented groups in mathematics and people working
in industry and technology. This is done through speaking at and organizing
conferences in a wide variety of venues aimed at wide audiences, and encouraging
people in these groups (including industry) to attend her classes. In addition,
all of the PI's mathematical results and findings are freely available to the
public.

The project addresses important and fundamental problems involving which
hyperbolic or relatively hyperbolic groups can have certain boundaries. For one
part of the project the principal investigator plans to extend known results
about hyperbolic groups with planar or two-sphere boundaries to the relatively
hyperbolic case, strengthening the connection with Kleinian groups and the
fundamental groups of 3-manifolds. The proof methods sometimes are similar to
the case of hyperbolic groups but often require different techniques. For the
other part of the project she is exploring the wealth of planar boundaries than
can occur as the complement of round disks in the 2-sphere.
