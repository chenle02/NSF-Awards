In this project, PI's from three institutions will carry out sampling on a
transect in the Southern Ocean along 65 degrees South latitude across the Ross
Sea. The sampling will be carried out on the USSR vessel, R/V IOFFE. Scientists
from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography will be responsible for the
hydrography and nutrients, while scientists from Oregon State University will
provide overall coordination and contribute to the data analysis. The Lamont
contribution (this project) will be to acquire and analyze samples for the
tracers, Tritium, Helium, Oxygen-18, and Carbon-14. This section constitutes a
joint contribution by the USA and the Soviet Union to the International World
Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE), specifically Hydrographic line S-4.
