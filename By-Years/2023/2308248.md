Many natural questions in mathematics cannot be answered in terms of the
standard axioms of mathematics alone. The most famous example is the Continuum
Hypothesis, which states that any infinite subset of the real numbers is either
countable or in a one-to-one correspondence with the whole set of real numbers.
The technique known as forcing can be used to show that the Continuum Hypothesis
is logically independent of the standard set of axioms for mathematics, known as
Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice (ZFC). A major theme in
modern set theory is development of relative consistency results and ZFC-
strengthenings. ZFC-strengthenings are given by large cardinal hypotheses, which
assert the existence of certain highly compact mathematical objects, called
large cardinals, with strong reflection properties, that is, if a property holds
at the large cardinal, it must hold at many cardinals below it. Assuming large
cardinals exist, the method of forcing can be used to create various
mathematical models. This project analyzes these constructions, motivated by two
complementary notions: what is mathematically necessary? what is mathematically
sufficient? The project provides research training opportunities for graduate
students.

The main objectives of the project are analyzing what is possible from large
cardinals and forcing, versus what constraints are imposed by ZFC. Forcing in
the presence of large cardinals is the main tool to create models of ZFC and
prove consistency results. In contrast to having large cardinals, GÃ¶del's
constructible universe L is the minimal class model of set theory. Two central
questions are how much the universe resembles L, and how much compactness can be
achieved by forcing. Compactness is the phenomenon where if a certain property
holds for every smaller substructure of a given object, then it holds for the
object itself. It follows from large cardinals, and often fails in L.
Compactness is captured by some key combinatorial principles such as the tree
property and its strengthenings. On the other hand, square properties are the
canonical instance of incompactness and serve as a yardstick how close a model
is to L. The project will focus on the interplay between these principles and
forcing extensions constructed from large cardinals. The PI will also
investigate how they interact with cardinal arithmetic and especially with
singular combinatorics.
