Secondary organic aerosols (SOA) are particulate phases that form in the
atmosphere through oxidation, transformation and condensation of gas phase, or
volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Source VOCs can be either biogenic or man-
made compounds. Recent scientific investigations have demonstrated that some SOA
particles exhibit the physical properties of a solid rather than those of
liquids normally expected of aerosol. Intermediate behavior of a hard solid of
negligible viscosity (&gt;10^12 Pa s) and a thick liquid of high viscosity
(&lt;10^2 Pa s) is observed in a transitional range, herein termed semisolid.
The diffusion of molecules in such a semisolid may be orders of magnitude slower
than in a liquid, yet still fast enough that reactive chemistry can take place.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The set of questions raised in this project are
investigative, even speculative in nature, designed to shed light on the
mechanical properties of semisolid SOA, individual (and bulk) properties of
aerosols. A first objective is to quantify how semi-solidity varies with
relative humidity and SOA chemistry. A second objective is to measure how
chemical reactivity, including both the loss of gas-phase reactants and the
appearance of particle-phase products, varies with SOA semi-solidity. The study
will make extensive use of an environmental chamber in which VOCs will be
oxidized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The atmospheric occurrence of organic semisolid
particles may have important implications for gas uptake and subsequent chemical
aging of SOA particles, which in turn are of interest to their climate forcing
properties and their effects on public health.
