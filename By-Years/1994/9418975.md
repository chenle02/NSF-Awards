9418975 Lawton This award deals with the PR5K gene from Arabidopsis thaliana
which encodes a novel receptor with structural features related to plant defense
proteins. The kinase domain of PR5K is presumed to be involved in cytoplasmic
signal transduction. The extracellular domain is closely related to a group of
antimicrobial proteins that includes the pathogenesis protein PR-5, osmotin,
thaumatin and a bifunctional inhibitor of maize. By analogy with other receptor
kinases, this domain is the predicted binding site for a polypeptide ligand. The
structural relationship between the extracellular domain of PR5K and known
pathogenesis-related proteins suggests a possible functional relationship in the
expression of the defense response. Thus, cellular targets of antimicrobial
proteins such as PR5 might also serve as ligands for activation of the PR5K
receptor. A close structural relationship is also seen for the secreted and
kinase-linked forms of the S-locus glycoproteins of Brassica and these molecules
have been proposed to form a functional unit that specifies self-
incompatibility during pistil-pollen interactions. This proposal is concerned
with characterizing the PR5K receptor and dissecting its possible role in the
perception of plant defense signals.
