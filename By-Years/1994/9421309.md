9421309 Baym This project aims to develop the fundamental theory of nuclear and
other many-particle systems including astrophysical and condensed matter
applications. It includes basic studies of the quark-gluon plasma, hadron
structure, nuclear forces, the structure of nuclei, nuclear and hadronic matter.
A wide range of electron-nucleus and hadron-nucleus and hadron-nucleus
scattering experiments and heavy-ion collisions are analyzed in conjunction with
these basic studies. The emphasis in astrophysics is on understanding neutron
star structure and evolution, low- energy nuclear reactions, and the effect of
phase transitions in the early universe. Fundamental problems in the theory of
quantum liquids, quantum liquid drops, superconductivity and superfludity are
also studied. ***
