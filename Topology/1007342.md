The proposed research concerns low-dimensional topology, specifically geometric
classification of topological 4-manifolds and certain aspects of quantum
topology. Krushkal proposes an approach to solving the topological 4-dimensional
surgery conjecture in the context of the homotopy A-B slice problem. A
convenient framework for this approach is provided by topological arbiters, a
notion recently introduced in collaboration with M. Freedman. The project
includes a number of problems in quantum topology, specific questions concern
spin networks, and as a special case a categorified relation between the
chromatic polynomial of planar graphs and the Temperley-Lieb algebra. The
project also aims to use topological methods to address classification problems
for free and certain classes of interacting fermions, an important class of
systems in condensed matter physics. Topological invariants have played an
important role in recent work on classification of gapped phases of non-
interacting fermions by Kitaev and others. K-theory and Bott periodicity turned
out to be crucial ingredients in classifying systems with various symmetries.
Krushkal plans to work on a number of related problems, including invariants of
families of free fermions and extensions to certain classes of interacting
systems.

One goal of the project concerns classification of possible large scale shapes
of objects that locally look like the Euclidean space. The classification of
three- and four-dimensional shapes is a particularly important and challenging
problem. This project is aimed at a better understanding of 4-dimensional
objects with large fundamental groups, which contain many loops that cannot be
contracted. Another part of the project concerns quantum topology, a subject
influenced by ideas from both physics and mathematics and connected with
statistical mechanics, representation theory, topology, and combinatorics. In
particular, the goal is to gain a new conceptual perspective on spin networks, a
notion whose origins are in quantum physics, in the recently developed
mathematical framework of categorification. The third part of the project
explores interdisciplinary connections between Topology and Condensed Matter
Physics, focusing on topological insulators. This research, in collabor ation
with physicists, will build on recent advances in classification of this
remarkable class of physical systems.
