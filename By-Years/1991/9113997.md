The primary objective of this US-Hungary physics research project between Dr.
Aaron Galonsky of Michigan State University and Dr. Ferenc Deak of the Central
Physics Institute, Budapest, Hungary, is to study nucleus-nucleus collisions
which produce hot zones. For low projectile energies the dominant mode of
cooling is neuron emission, but fragments are occasionally emitted too. During
the cooling of these zones, changes occur in both the kinetic energy spectra and
the distribution of internal excitation energy of such fragments. Using a
colinear neutron- fragment coincidence technique, the researchers plan to
collect experimental information on the dependence of internal energy on kinetic
energy as a means of testing de-excitation models. This project in nuclear
physics fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by
enabling leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine
complementary talents and pool resources in areas of strong mutual interest and
competence.
