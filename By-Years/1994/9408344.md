ABSTRACT CTS-9408344 CHARLES MENEVEAU JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY The proposed
research is an experimental study of turbulence small-scales from the point of
view of subgrid modeling fop Large-Eddy-Simulation, a technique of increasing
engineering usefulness in dealing with the `turbulence problem'. The
measurements are to be performed at high Reynolds numbers, using multi-component
hot-wire anemometry. The main flow to be studied is the `complex wake', a free
shear-flow that displays both a non-monotonic energy spectrum as well as spatial
complexity. Comparisons between real and modeled subgrid stresses will be
performed using several reference quantities. For example, the rate at which the
real stress dissipates large-scale kinetic energy will be compared to the rate
of dissipation accomplished by the models. Other quantities on which the
comparisons will be based relate to energy spectra, enstrophy, probability-
density functions, correlation coefficients, etc. Measurements will be performed
across distinct flow regions and regimes, in order to explore the impact of
complex geometry. Also, the analysis will be based on a wide range of length-
scales or filter sizes, in order to ascertain the effect of the spectral
complexity (e.g. spectral `humps') expected in regions of the proposed flow-
field. Models that will be scrutinized include eddy-viscosity models, similarity
and non-linear models, global and local dynamic models, etc.. This research is
expected to significantly contribute to the foundation of Large-Eddy-Simulation
and associated modeling in complex flow conditions, based on real data at high
Reynolds numbers.
