This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will investigate the
feasibility of developing a biohydrometallurgical process for extracting gold
and silver from bio-oxidized ore by means of leaching that does not incorporate
use of cyanide, thiourea, thiosulfate, or other conventional lixiviants. Gold
and silver mines are often located in pristine environments that are highly
susceptible to pollution by mining and metals recovery activities. While
biotechnologies have been developed for freeing precious metals from refractory
ores, cyanidation is still the process of choice for extracting gold and silver
values. Whereas the ultimate goal of the research is to develop a heap leach
process, a simplified working model will be used to study the process during
Phase I. The working model will comprise a continuous stirred tank reactor
(CSTR) containing a slurry of ore particles to minimize mass transfer
limitations. The project includes using mathematical models to infer optimum
processing conditions, designing an experimental working model of the process,
fabricating the working model and developing experimental techniques, conducting
proof-of-concept experiments, and analyzing the data from those experiments. A
significant change in the basic technology of gold and silver extraction is
proposed that will reduce mining-associated pollution at its source.
