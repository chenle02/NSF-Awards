Large-scale gasdynamical processes are extremely important to an understanding
of the structure and evolution of the Galaxy. The development of instabilities
in gas flows in the Galactic disk and halo may give rise to the intricate
structures in the Galactic system that are seen directly in optical and radio
images. Ultimately, structure on the smallest scales leads to star formation. By
and large, what is seen is not well- understood. What is the origin of the gas
seen at high Galactic latitude, and why does it seem to be in a very peculiar
state of ionization? What is the fate of hot gas in the disk, and under what
conditions can cool thermal condensations form in a dynamically active flow to
give rise to the high velocity features which are observed? Why are spiral arms
generally unkempt with spurs and branches often present, but with some galaxies
showing an exquisite "grand design" structure while others appear completely
chaotic? The theoretical research carried out with this grant addresses the
questions posed above. The dynamical structure and the stability of
astrophysical gas flows will be examined. The projects involve primarily studies
of flows on a Galactic scale, but in some cases there are interesting and
fruitful applications on larger scales.
