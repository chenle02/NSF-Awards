9322112 Cotter Ten women will be involved in field and laboratory research to
determine the origin of glacial and postglacial deposits in west- central
Minnesota. This includes the continuation of three closely related projects
which have in common the utilization of till provenance analysis to determine
the origin and glacial history of three problematic deposits. These deposits
are, 1) the Alexandria Moraine Complex, 2) Tunnel Valley Eskers, and 3) the
striated and faceted Boulder Pavement of the Minnesota River Valley.
Additionally, paleoenvironmental studies of lacustrine deposits will be expanded
and will include micropaleontological, palynological and geochemical
investigations. U.M.M., an undergraduate institution, offers excellent
facilities and close faculty contact. R.E.U. women will have the opportunity to
develop collegial ties with other undergraduates doing geologic research and to
serve as mentors, instructors and role models to underrepresented high school
students participating in college level research. The research experience and
the unique opportunity to interact with a scientific community when
underrepresented individuals are in the majority will both break down a number
of traditional barriers and aid in the maturation of these students as
scientists. The culmination to the program, the "Friends of UMM REU" conference,
will provide these women with the opportunity to present results and discuss
ideas with experts in the field. Additionally a field trip to the Canadian
Rockies will show participants active glacial processes and glacial
environments. The REU program will contribute to the personal growth of these
women and the research to be accomplished will contribute to the understanding
of the glacial history of Minnesota.
