Research will be carried out to rigorously understand the effects of disorder on
interacting many-body quantum systems. Of central interest are questions of
electron transport and conductivity properties of disordered materials. Among
models to be studied, particular attention will be given to random quantum spin
systems. These are frequently used in statistical physics as models of
interacting particle systems, but are also relevant in quantum information
theory, where they describe interacting quantum bits. The research will combine
methods from the theory of single-particle models such as the Anderson model
with recent progress in the theory of quantum spin systems, such as improved
Lieb-Robinson bounds and decay properties of ground state correlations.

Modern nanotechnology aims at building powerful electronic devices of smaller
and smaller size. As a result, quantum effects play an increasingly important
role and mathematical models originally developed in theoretical physics have
increasing practical relevance such as, for example, in quantum computing. The
physical properties of quantum devices are strongly influenced by effects of
impurities and disorder, as present in semi-conductors, alloys and amorphous
materials. In particular, disorder has a strong effect on electrical
conductivity. It is the goal of this research project to contribute to the
understanding of the mathematical reasons for disorder effects on quantum
systems. In particular, we will study the effect of disorder on large systems of
interacting electrons. Work will include the training of several PhD students in
this area of research.
