Professor Przebinda will investigate distribution characters of irreducible
admissable representations of classical Lie groups from the viewpoint of
microlocal analysis. This will be done in the context of Howe's theory of
reductive dual pairs. Three problems are involved in the project: (i)
characterize a special class of very singular representations of these groups,
(ii) calculate the correspondence of wavefront sets induced in Howe's
correspondence of representations, and (iii) investigate the resulting system of
differential and microdifferential equations. This research is in the theory of
group representations. Group theory is basically the theory of symmetry. To take
a simple example, when the system in question is invariant under a change in the
position of the origin of space, the group of translations naturally arises.
While groups are abstract objects, particular situations demand concrete
realizations or "representations" of the symmetry group.
