The IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT) is the annual
conference of the information theory society, and has been held continuously
since 1954. It covers a variety of topics related to the studies on information
theory, including coding, communications and communication networks, complexity
and cryptography, detection and estimation, learning, Shannon Theory, stochastic
processes, and emerging applications of information theory. It is considered one
of the premier IEEE conferences. ISIT has also traditionally attracted a large
number of students, comprising around 40 percent of the participant population.
ISIT is an excellent learning opportunity for students as well as a means to
establish useful research collaborations for the future. Providing some support
for student in the US to travel to ISIT, especially given the long distance they
need to travel to ISIT 2015, will be crucial to ensuring a vibrant student
participation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project therefore provides student
travel support for the 2015 ISIT meeting.
