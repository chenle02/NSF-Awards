The Bigelow Laboratory for Oceanographic Sciences will acquire and operate a
modern six-channel, continuous flow nutrient analyzer as a shared use facility.
These instruments provide rapid and accurate measurements of chemical
constituents and nutrients in seawater samples. Such measurements are critical
to many modern oceanographic and marine biological investigations. The equipment
will be used by a number of NSF-sponsored researchers associated with the 1992
and 1993 JGOFS field programs in the Pacific. Following the support of these
programs, the instrument will be housed and maintained at Bigelow Laboratory for
shared use by a variety of investigators there and in the region. At Bigelow, it
will benefit NSF-sponsored research projects by increasing the capabilities of
the institution to support research and educational activities.
