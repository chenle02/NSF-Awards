This project addresses four major challenges facing technician education:
recruitment, under-prepared students, retention, and on-time degree completion.
The primary goal of the project is to meet industry's current and future needs
for engineering technicians by stepping up efforts to prepare high school
students for college ET programs, reducing the number of credit hours required
for associate degrees in ET, and specifically addressing the learning and
financial needs of minority, female, and working students. Improved student
learning of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) is realized
by (1) an expanded and continued use of an integrated, problem-based curricula
developed by a previous ATE project, and (2) a new focus on relevant, smart,
teaching that extends best practices to second-year ET students and reduces
overall credit hours required for graduation. An image and marketing campaign is
enhancing the status of ET careers and publicizing corporate sponsorship of ATE
ET students. The project is also demonstrating academic value to the students
and economic value to the employers of paid internships as early as the freshman
and sophomore years. The outcomes of this project, supported by detailed
evaluation research, are being widely disseminated through workshops,
publications, presentations, and a web site in collaboration with the National
Center for Engineering Technology Education.
