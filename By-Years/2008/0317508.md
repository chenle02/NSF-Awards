The goal of this investigation is to explain the fascinating solar wind
observations that reveal the existence of sunward-propagating Alfven
fluctuations and rotational/directional discontinuities in the solar wind
plasma. Combined numerical and analytical methods will be used to describe the
nonlinear interactions of Alfven wave packets traveling in opposite directions
along an ambient magnetic field. The model will incorporate, (i) parametric
interaction of harmonics propagating in the same direction, that is responsible
for steepening and the cascade of wave energy, (ii) sunward-bound waves of
finite amplitude. A self-consistent treatment including the nonlinear dynamics
of resonant particles will be carried out, in order to account for the creation
of collisionless dissipative structures through the strong proton Landau damping
of ion-acoustic quasi-modes.
