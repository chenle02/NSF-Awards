This ATE Project project addresses three issues in computing technology
education in community colleges: (1) the need to reduce first-year attrition
rates in computer science and information technology programs, (2) the need to
adapt innovative approaches for teaching introductory programming to community
college students, and (3) the need to provide effective community college
faculty development materials for training in using innovative approaches. In
our previous ATE project, JABRWOC (#0302542), they studied the effects of
teaching fundamental programming concepts with visualization in pre-CS1 courses
in community colleges. In this project, the innovative approach tested in
JABRWOC will be extended to include a transition from Alice to Java in CS1
courses in community colleges, using the new, more powerful version of the
software. In addition, this project proposes to develop a peer mentoring model
and workshop materials designed to support community college faculty as they
learn to teach with this innovative approach. Through our evaluation efforts, we
will study the effectiveness of this approach for retaining students in pre-CS1
and CS1 courses and the effectiveness of the peer mentoring model and workshop
materials for community college instructors.
