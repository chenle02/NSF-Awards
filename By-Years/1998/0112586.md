The PIs propose to use paleobotanical and paleogeochemical data with a model
developed for understanding modern controls on vegetation distribution to
explore the fundamental mechanisms behind complex advance, retreat, and further
advance of a boreal-tundra ecotone along the Brooks Range in Alaska. The
paleobotanical evidence will be used to examine several different approaches to
discern movements of the ecotone with a species-level resolution with the
changes in climate variables (temperature, precipitation amount, and seasonality
of precipitation). The analysis will provide independent climate and vegetation
datasets. The climate dataset will be used to drive an ecosystem model to
simulate changing vegetation under changing climate. The results of the study
will provide a useful predictive capability for separating climate-induced
changes from those caused by feedbacks in the climate-vegetation system when
attempting predictions of boreal forest ecosystem responses to future climate
change.
