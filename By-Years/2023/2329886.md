The University of California Santa Cruz will organize and host the Cal-Bridge
Summer Institute Alumni Conference, July 16-23, 2023. Participants will be
doctoral students who are alumni of Cal-Bridge, a partnership between the
University of California (UC) and the California State University (CSU) systems.
Cal-Bridge was designed to provide pathways into research and the professorate
for historically underrepresented students. During this summer program the
learning community will focus on how people learn and on evidence-based teaching
practices. The group will continue with regular virtual meetings throughout the
academic year to promote the exchange of ideas and best practices. This award
will cover the workshop costs for former Cal-Bridge students who are doctoral
students at non-UC campuses.

The Cal-Bridge Summer Institute, a series of professional development workshops,
will have two major thrusts: 1) developing effective pedagogues, and 2)
developing effective research leaders. In addition to these, the conference will
include a variety of shorter professional development mentorship sessions, and
community and cohort building activities. This conference aims to address two
systemic points of loss along the professorial and professional researcher
pathway for Cal-Bridge alumni currently in PhD programs outside of the
University of California system: completion of the PhD, and entrance into the
workforce. Specifically, the award will: 1) Broaden the impact of the
professional development being offered to a larger group of doctoral scholars
from diverse backgrounds, and 2) Provide space for Cal-Bridge Doctoral students
to hold discussions and activities to build up their professional network and
community.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
