Two important challenges in the control of quantum devices will be addressed in
this project. The first involves the cooling and control of nano-mechanical
resonators. A method will be developed that exploits quantum error-correction to
increase the accuracy of control via superconducting circuits. The second
challenge is designing fast and efficient implementations for complex quantum
circuits for control and computation. Various approaches aimed at reducing the
computing power needed to optimize such circuits will be investigated.

As part of the project, graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in
high-performance computing. Student access to parallel computing will be
supported and strengthened at Williams College and the University of
Massachusetts at Boston (UMB). The project will further develop a research and
mentoring collaboration between Williams College, an outstanding undergraduate
institution, and UMB, a public urban graduate institution.
