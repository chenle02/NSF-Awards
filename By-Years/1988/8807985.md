This proposal requests funds to permit Dr. So-Young Pi, Department of Physics,
Boston University to pursue with Dr. Kwang Sup Soh, Department of Physics, Seoul
National University, for a period of 24 months, a program of cooperative
research on equilibrium and non-equilibrium quantum field theory in curved
space-time in the Schrodinger picture. Quantum field theory will be studied in
curved space-times, such as Schwarzschild and Kerr black hole manifolds,
Einstein and de Sitter universes, and other anisotropic models which are
relevant to the very early universe. This project is particularly relevant to
many cosmological models where symmetry breaking and phase transitions induced
by temperature change are important. The U. S. and Korean PI's are highly
respected scientists who, for several years, have been engaged in complimentary
approaches to the solution of problems in the field of this proposal. This
project is relevant to the objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science
Program which seeks to increase the level of cooperation between U.S. and Korean
scientists and engineers through the exchange of scientific information, ideas,
skills, and techniques and through collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.
