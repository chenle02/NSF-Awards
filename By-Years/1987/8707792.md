Most civil engineering systems consist of a heavy primary structure supporting
a light secondary system. Examples include piping containment vessels in nuclear
reactors, and equipment such as computers in buildings. This research project
considers those structural systems in which both the primary and the secondary
systems behave in a nonlinear manner. It considers special characteristics of
secondary systems such as: tuning; time-varying nonlinear effects including a
decrease in stiffness of the structure; and the influence on the assessment of
the reliability of the system due to uncertainty in the system parameters. The
analysis of parameter uncertainty will be performed using methods of structural
reliability theory. The results of this research can be used to assist and
interpret the results obtained from experimental and time-history methods. In
addition, the research can be developed further in the analysis of secondary
systems, such as in developing damage criteria and system identification
techniques and investigating more general and complex nonlinearities. Finally,
the research can be extended in other areas including the analysis of structures
subjected to narrow-band earthquakes - e.g. the September, 1985 Mexico
earthquake.
