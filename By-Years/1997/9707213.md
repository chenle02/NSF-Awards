Proposal Number: ECS-9707213 Principal Investigator: Maria Tamargo Title:
Improved materials for wide bandgap II-VI visible emitters and devices Analysis:
In this research, the optimization of a class of II-VI materials for the design
of visible emitters grown on III-V substrates will be investigated. The II-VI
materials system under investigation is MgZnCdSe and the III-V substrate is InP.
A strong advantage of the proposed system is the good lattice match between the
film and the substrate which should result increased device lifetime and
reliability. The new research will include investigations into (1) an interface
termination or "capping" scheme for reduction of defects at the interface, (2)
Te incorporation for high p-type doping and (3) Be incorporation for lattice
hardening. Important applications of such systems include blue-green light
emitting diodes, and laser diodes.
