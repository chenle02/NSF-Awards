The objective of this proposal is to start the process of enhancing the
quantitative components of many undergraduate life science courses by focusing
on the general biology sequence taken by science students. The proposed efforts
will illustrate to students the importance of a diversity of quantitative tools
to analyze life science problems, emphasize the utility of quantitative methods
across the spectrum of life sciences, serve to reduce the perception by students
that math is only needed for math courses, and enhance students appreciation for
the importance of theory in the scientific process. The objectives will be met
through development of appropriate quantitative examples, based upon data and
illustrating key biological concepts, for entry-level biology courses.
Dissemination of results will proceed through publication of a Primer of
Quantitative Biology and a variety of web-based products. The project will also
develop assessment tools to aid faculty in determining the level of quantitative
competency of life science students, particularly in topic areas critical to the
life sciences.
