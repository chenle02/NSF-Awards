This project concerns the modelling of fluid motion as motivated by applications
of dielectric fluids in microfluidic devices, the combustion and motion of flame
fronts, and waves in water. The emphasis is in understanding for how long the
mathematical models used to study such phenomena remain valid and predictive, in
various physical regimes. For dielectric fluids, the focus is on situations
where the density of electrical charge changes rapidly over small regions. For
combustion and flame fronts, the aim is to study a hierarchy of mathematical
models and determine how well the simpler models serve to approximate behavior
in the more complicated models. While for water waves, the goal is to consider
how wavetrains with different frequencies interact, or how wavetrains interact
with certain kinds of bottom topography. The project provides research training
opportunities for graduate students. The project will analyze the Melcher-Taylor
leaky dielectric model, with the goal of establishing local well-posedness
theory, study a mechanism for shock formation via analytical and numerical
approaches, and consider global existence for the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation
in more than one spatial dimension. Validation theorems relating the Kuramoto-
Sivashinsky equation, coordinate-free models of flame fronts, and hydrodynamic
flame models will be also investigated. Furthermore, the investigator will
establish local well-posedness for water waves with spatially quasiperiodic
initial data, and analyze related models, such as the Benjamin-Ono equation or
the Euler equations for interfacial flows, in the spatially quasiperiodic
setting.
