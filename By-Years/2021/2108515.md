Galaxy formation is regulated by feedback in the form of large-scale outflows of
gas. The details of this process are poorly understood as it is difficult to
observe the faint emission from the gas. Principal Investigator (PI) Jones has
identified a sample of gravitationally lensed galaxies, where a foreground
galaxy bends the light from the distant galaxy and magnifies its weak emission.
The PI will observe these lensed galaxies using the Keck Cosmic Web Imager
(KCWI) instrument at the W. M. Keck Observatory to study how galactic outflows
shaped their formation ten billion years ago. As part of this program the PI
will teach scientific research methods to high school students in the California
State Summer School for Mathematics and Science (COSMOS), with lectures on
galaxies and cosmology, and an introduction to observational astronomy
techniques using a rooftop telescope facility at the University of California -
Davis campus. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will support the analysis of
data already in hand and additional observations of a larger sample. Integral
field spectroscopy with the KCWI instrument will map the spatial extent and
kinematics of outflowing gas using fluorescent emission lines, which will
improve estimates of the mass loss rates. The same data also enable maps of the
outflowing gas in absorption, which probes outflow energetics and launching
sites as well as the chemical composition. The non-refractory element sulfur
provides a measurement of total alpha-element metallicity relative to neutral
hydrogen, while other elements such as silicon and nickel are sensitive to dust
content and abundance patterns. Collectively these results will address the
physical properties of galactic outflows and their role in regulating galaxy
assembly at redshifts z=2-3.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
