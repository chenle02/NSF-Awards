The Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division is
supporting a project directed by Dr. Scheiner to investigate excited state
proton transfer reactions. Ab initio quantum mechanical methods are being used
to determine the potential functions of the excited states of some model systems
and then a system containing an intra- molecular hydrogen bond. Reaction rates
and deuterium isotope effects are being computed. %%% Proton transfer reactions
involved in many enzyme-catalyzed biological processes have been extensively
investigated by both theoretical and experimental methods, but little is yet
known regarding the nature of similar reactions between excited molecular
states. The potential energy surface of such excited states may differ radically
from that of the ground state and quite different kinetic behavior may follow.
Such systems are being investigated in the current project.
