The Japanese Speech Style Shift Symposium will bring together approximately 20
leading scholars from linguistics, sociology, and anthropology who are doing
groundbreaking work on in style 'shifting' in naturally occurring interactions
in Japanese. The participants, who come from a variety of leading institutions
in the United States and abroad, are a combination of prominent researchers in
this area and younger scholars who are likely to have a major impact on this
rapidly-growing field in the near future. The participants will present papers
which have been pre-circulated. This will allow for a relatively lengthy and
detailed discussion of each paper. There will also be a workshop devoted to
examining and discussing a pre-circulated set of data. Specific goals for the
symposium are 1) to determine what varieties of language tend to be used for
style shifting and how pervasive the phenomenon of style shifting is, 2) to
identify reasons for speech style shifts, 3) to improve our awareness of what
the various disciplines represented at the symposium have to offer the study of
style shifting, 4) to explore the implications speech style shifts have for our
understanding of the nature of grammar, interaction, and social organization,
and 5) to seek the implications our resulting understanding of style shifting
has for the learning and teaching of the Japanese language. The results of the
symposium will be published as an edited volume.
