This proposal requests support for a "Program on electronic structure" recently
started at Cornell. The purpose of the Program is to make major improvements in
algorithms used in electronic structure computations, reducing their
computational requirements for large systems and building increased
understanding of the chemical bond along with the algorithmic advances. The
three standard techniques-Local Density functional methods, Green's Function
Monte Carlo methods and quantum chemistry approaches - will be studied together
with the aim of combining the best features of each. Some specific early
projects of the program are as follows. Extensive careful tests of the local
density functional method are planned using new, very fast algorithms. Major
sequences of molecules will be studied with no pseudopotentials and no ad-hoc
basis set limitations. A formal and accurate framework defining pseudopotentials
for very heavy atoms is being pursued based on renormalization group ideas.
Variational wave functions used in the Green's Function Monte Carlo method are
being made more general in hopes of increasing its accuracy. Extensive use of
vector and parallel supercomputers already at Cornell will help achieve fully
converged computations.
