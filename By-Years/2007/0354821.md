Interferometric gravitational wave observatories in the United States, Europe
and Japan are already collecting data and, thus, are on the verge of making
discoveries that will create new opportunities and challenges in physics and
astronomy. One of these challenges is the dual role that numerical simulations
have in this large-scale observational effort. Initially, simulations of sources
of&lt;br/&gt;gravitational radiation will assist in the detection of waves. Once
discoveries become routine, they will provide extremely valuable information
that will aid in discerning the particular features of the&lt;br/&gt;sources.
The essence of the work in this award is the determination, via controlled
numerical experiments, of the generic and characteristic features of
gravitational radiation produced by&lt;br/&gt;black-hole sources. This work
applies to both roles of numerical simulations by providing information about
sources that will aid initially in discovery and later in discerning specific
features of the sources.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this award
is to enhance and accelerate the connection between numerical relativity and
data analysis, a connection that is currently weaker than needed by the
gravitational&lt;br/&gt;physics community. The work is also an ideal ground for
the interdisciplinary training of students and postdoctoral scholars across
areas within gravitational physics and astrophysics; students&lt;br/&gt;who will
one day be taking the lead in research involving the new discoveries that will
be made by the gravitational wave observatories. The research outlined in this
award will benefit from and contribute to the wide spectrum of research already
taking place at the Center for Gravitational Wave Physics and the Institute for
Gravitational Physics and Geometry at Penn State.
