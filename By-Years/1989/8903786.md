The objective of this proposal is to elucidate the organization and expression
of tRNA genes from Bacillus subtilis. B. subtilis is chosen for study because it
exhibits interesting differences from Escherichia coli, the current prototype
for bacterial systems. Of special interest is the transcriptional regulation
during development within the two rRNA-tRNA operons of B. subtilis, which
contain large clusters of tRNA genes. Their function as promoter elements will
be validated using the promoter probe plasmid system pDT. Promoter elements will
be synthesized or amplified with the polymerase chain technique. The activity of
these promoters will then be tested during development in B subtilis. Promoter
activity will be evaluated by measuring levels of lacZ mRNA. If these promoters
show temporal regulation, the protein factors affecting transcriptional
regulation and flanking regions to which they bind will be investigated. These
studies will greatly aid our understanding of tRNA gene expression, one of the
key steps in the regulation of the growth of bacteria and other cells.
