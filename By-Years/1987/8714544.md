This project contains two related activities. First, we propose to continue our
research in database foundations and logic programming that we have been
conducting under the present RUI grant. Specifically, we wish to implement a
semantic query optimizer that was developed under the present RUI grant. We will
also study incremental semantic compilation, structured deductive databases,
integrity constraint checking, and cooperative answer generation. Second, we
wish to continue our research program in the Department of Computer and
Information Sciences at Towson State University, an undergraduate institution.
We will continue the seminar in database research for outstanding students,
thereby encouraging them to study for advanced degrees in computer science.
