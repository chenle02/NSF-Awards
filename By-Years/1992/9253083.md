This proposal seeks to improve the quality of science instruction in the
elementary classroom. The project will focus on the development of activities
that will improve the science content knowledge and pedagogical skills in ten
school districts in the state of Arkansas. To determine where enhancement in
science is most needed, an assessment will be conducted during the planning
period utilizing the teachers, science supervisors, principals, superintendents
and other key personnel in the assessment process. Organizations that impact
science education will be contacted so that a coordinated effort will be made
for the development of a science program that will have a tremendous impact on
science teachers in the state of Arkansas. The PI has identified some critical
elements of the planning activity that will require support, as this is an
attempt to coordinate a large scale reform of teacher enhancement in elementary
science education. The project will result in a restructuring of science
activities for the teachers through a full proposal which will be submitted
later for funding.
