NSF Award Abstract - DMS-0206679 Mathematical Sciences: Statistical modeling and
predictability of nonlinear dispersive waves

Abstract

The central theme of this research is the statistical predictability and the
development of effective dynamics for spatially extended, multi-scale nonlinear
systems in general, and nonlinear dispersive waves in particular. Modeling
complex behavior exhibited by multi-scale nonlinear dynamics often entails an
effective description of large scale, coarse-grained dynamics. Their resolution
requires a precise mathematical characterization of all spatial and temporal
excitations present in systems. The issue of quantification of statistical
properties of long-time, large-scale dynamics of spatiotemporal chaos will be
addressed in a near-integrable setting and in a system in which the separation
of scales, as well as instability, can be precisely tuned and controlled. Once a
good statistical characterization is obtained, it can provide not only guidance
in modeling coarse-grained dynamics but also statistical calibrations of these
effective models against the original full dynamics. With these statistical
insights, the research further focuses on the study of coarse-grained dynamics
and invariant measures for two possible situations --- namely, dynamics with and
without separation of scales. The projects also address important aspects of
dispersive wave turbulence: clarification of the derivation of kinetic equations
and their validation; and detailed characterization of resonance conditions,
flux dynamics, and spatially localized, coherent structures.

A multitude of spatiotemporal scales may arise in modeling problems in modern
science, ranging from molecular dynamics simulation of protein folding to short
term climate prediction for coupled atmosphere-ocean dynamics --- the study of
which has great impact on our daily world. This project investigates
mathematical methods that can be used to understand and predict the complicated
behavior of systems of this type.
