Microprocessors use devices called branch predictors to predict the near-term
behavior of a program so that work on future instructions may begin early,
reducing the amount of time the program takes to run. Branch predictors must be
highly accurate, and a small improvement in accuracy can give a large benefit
for performance. This project is a principled approach to continuing the study
of branch prediction. Several new ways to understand and improve branch
prediction will be explored:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Exploring the limits of the
potential of branch prediction to improve performance by developing a model of
an idealistic branch predictor given reasonable
assumptions;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) Improving technologies for running computer
programs on real computer systems so that these programs will have better branch
prediction accuracy;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3) Discovering ways of improving the
communication between computer programs and computer systems such that
information available to a computer program can be used to improve the accuracy
of branch prediction in a computer system; and&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4) Working
on new branch predictor designs for future computer systems, incorporating
techniques from other disciplines such as machine learning, i.e., the study of
how computer systems can learn by observing data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In each
of these areas, technological constraints on branch prediction will be taken
into account. In particular, a branch predictor must act very quickly to deliver
its prediction in time to improve performance, and it should do so in an energy-
efficient way. This research will be brought to the classroom with a special
seminar class on the interaction of research into computer systems and research
on machine learning.&lt;br/&gt;
