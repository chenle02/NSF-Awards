The project is developing, implementing, and assessing an advanced interactive
landform simulator that engages undergraduate students in game-like guided
inquiry of the interactions between river and hillslope processes and landscape
formation. It is building on the prior successful WILSIM project at Northern
Illinois University, with major upgrades including 1) a shift from cellular
automata to a physically based model, 2) design-based and pedagogical
improvements to the GUI and output formats, and 3) a shift from hypothetical to
"real-world" landscapes, specifically the evolution of the Grand Canyon over the
past 10 million years. Curriculum development and testing are targeting
introductory students at four-year institutions and at community colleges, and
are being performed in collaboration with the College of Lake County
(IL).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The landform simulator is enhancing student learning
about both landform processes and approaches to numerical modeling in the
geosciences. The web-based nature of the simulator allows ready adoption of the
approach across institutions, and curricular materials are being actively
disseminated through web portals, conferences and professional organizations.
The project is also incorporating active plans for engagement of students from
groups underrepresented in geoscience courses and careers.
