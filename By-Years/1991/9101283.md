This research concentrates on algebraic aspects of dimension theory. The
crucial part of the project is to decide whether cell- like images of euclidean
4-space are finite-dimensional. Proving (or disproving) results in cohomological
dimension theory which are analogous to results in covering dimension theory is
another goal of the project. The answers are known to the analogues of the key
question for Euclidean spaces of dimensions other than 4. This is another case
where the difficulty of a topological question does not increase with dimension.
It is distressing to find that the greatest mysteries concern the space of three
dimensions in which we live or the space of four dimensions, which may be viewed
as space-time.
