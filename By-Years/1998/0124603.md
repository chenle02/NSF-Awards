Duennebier&lt;br/&gt;OCE-0124603&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Funds are requested for
the design, construction and testing of a small experiment module (SEM) for use
in ocean bottom observatories. The purpose of this module is to reduce the
effort necessary to conduct relatively simple observatory experiments at the
ocean floor. Ocean bottom observatories will soon be providing opportunities for
investigators to conduct scientific investigations using power from the
observatory and transmitting data to shore through the observatory. The
interface between the observatory and the scientist's sensors is intimidating
for many investigators, requiring consideration of sampling, filtering,
digitizing, timing, power, and data formatting, as well as construction of
sophisticated electronics, pressure vessels, buoyancy devices, and related
hardware. The proposed module will greatly simplify this task, allowing
investigators to concentrate on their science, rather than on engineering. While
those investigators with engineering expertise available will not necessarily
need such an interface, the installation of relatively simple experiments
coupled to a SEM will be far less complicated, making it easier and more cost
effective for many to participate in observatory science. We envision a package
similar to the SEM available at nearly every science node of major ocean bottom
observatories. The prototype proposed here should point out any shortcomings in
our conceptual design for such a device, and establish its usefulness to the
community.&lt;br/&gt; The prototype of this package will include ports for
connection of up to twelve sensors, including an absolute pressure sensor for
tsunami detection. It is proposed that the first SEM at the Hawaii-2 Observatory
will be installed during the next visit to the site in 2002 or 2003. Future
versions of the SEM can be modified to the needs of a particular
observatory.&lt;br/&gt;
