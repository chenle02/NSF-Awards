The proposed research concerns the development of a new concept for the
catalytic activation of organic molecules. Based on the unprecedented idea of
reversible fulvene formation, this work promises to facilitate the development
of a broad range of heretofore unknown synthetic transformations and to provide
an exceptionally versatile yet simple new paradigm for the synthesis of
enantiopure chiral molecules.

With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting
the research of Professor Tristan Lambert of the Department of Chemistry at
Columbia University. Professor Lambert's research involves the investigation of
new concepts in reaction catalysis. These efforts offer the potential to open
new areas of reaction design and to develop more rapid, economic, and
environmentally benign chemical processes. Successful development of the
proposed research will have widespread impact on synthesis in the
pharmaceutical, agricultural, and materials-based industries.
