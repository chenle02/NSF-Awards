This grant is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the
subfield of nuclear magnetic resonance studies of catalytic surface chemistry.
Professor James M. Haw will develop and utilize nuclear magnetic resonance
methods for the study of heterogeneous catalysts used in petroleum and chemical
processing. In particular, methods to examine the chemical reactions in-situ
will be utilized to follow both the products of reactions and intermediate
species formed during ongoing reactions. Catalytic reactivity and deactivation
will be studied with in-situ high field solid state magic angle spinning nuclear
magnetic resonance methods. Both zeolite catalysts and supported metal catalysts
will be examined following the reactions of hydrocarbons and methanol and the
effects of coking on the structure of species formed during and after reaction.
