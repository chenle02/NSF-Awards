In pursuit of improving our understanding of the universe by studying the
constituents of dark matter, the research objective of this award is to increase
the current detection sensitivity of dark matter-nucleon scattering by a factor
of about 100 in order to measure the cross-section between Weakly Interacting
Massive Particles (WIMPs) and nucleons or to severely restrict theoretically
favorable parameter space. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to achieve this
objective, the SuperCDMS experiment must maintain a background environment of
less than one event. This group will advance analysis techniques to discriminate
electromagnetic backgrounds from dark matter signals using the new interleaved
Z-sensitive Ionization and Phonon (iZIP) detectors which are scheduled to be
deployed at Soudan. In addition, they are performing calculations and developing
simulations to estimate the irreducible internal background from alpha-n and
fission interactions in materials immediately surrounding the SuperCDMS
detectors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The award will also fund an
outreach program that will increase the public's appreciation for science. In
pursuit of this goal, the educational objective is to use SuperCDMS to support
secondary teachers through the QuarkNet program and create research
opportunities for undergraduates at SMU. Students and postdoctoral scholars
working on this project will receive strong scientific and educational
preparation in the techniques of low temperature physics, high energy physics
and astrophysics and the analysis of data.
