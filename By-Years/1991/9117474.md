Since 1979, the resurgent dome of Long Valley caldera, California has risen
more than 50 cm apparently due to the injection of 0.2 km3 of magma at depths.
Several earthquakes (&gt;6.0) accompanied the initial uplift; the USGS has
warned of possible eruptive activity. Floodplain evidence from the Owens River
suggests that the current uplift is part of a long term inflation that may total
15- 35 meters. Most of the lower river displays two recent parallel meander
belts (200-300m apart), similar in meander wavelength and amplitude, but unequal
in age. The older, invariably closer to the dome and 30-60 cm higher in
elevation, now carries an underfit stream and is being abandoned. The new lower
channel formed by avulsion, apparently triggered by uplift. As many as four
older, separate meander belts exist and suggest that two cycles of uplift and
subsidence may have preceded the current inflation. The proposed research would
involve the following investigations. (1) We will make a series of detailed
leveling surveys perpendicular to the valley axis to define the pitch of the
interfluvial surface as an estimate of domal uplift, (2) We will determine ages
for oxbow sediments from the several meander belts using a combination of
tephrochronology and 14C (forest fire charcoal and possible peat) to define the
length of time that the river occupied each of these meander belts. These ages
will help define both the times of uplift and subsidence as well as the possible
correlation between river channel migrations and eruptive activity in the Inyo
and Mono Crater fields. (3) We will compare historic and modern photographs of
the river to determine recent rates of channel migration and compare them with
the local degree of floodplain tilting determined in the leveling surveys. An
understanding of the recent history of the resurgent dome is of central concern
to residents of Mammoth Lakes, CA. The proposed investigation offers
undergraduate students an excellent opportunity to study both in the field and
in the laboratory an important example of silicic volcanism, as well as an
interesting phenomenon in fluvial geomorphology.
