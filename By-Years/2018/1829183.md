NSF support is provided for a workshop on "The Art of Measuring Physical
Parameters in Galaxies" to be held during April 10-13th 2018 at the Palm Desert
conference center of the University of California, Riverside. This workshop
builds upon and extends the successful Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep
Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS) project. The award will help support
attendance of 20 younger astronomers and members of the minority groups.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is now an extensive photometric and spectroscopic
dataset available for CANDELS galaxies, driving a need to measure their
associated physical parameters. The aim of the workshop is to bring together
leaders in the field to discuss and identify the optimum ways to measure these
parameters using the combined data from X-ray to radio wavelengths, to discuss
the state-of-the-art science, and to identify the outstanding and fundamental
projects that are only possible by exploiting such
data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
