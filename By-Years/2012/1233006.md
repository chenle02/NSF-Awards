The primary objective of this study is to determine how alterations in hydrology
impact the carbon dynamics of Everglade fresh water marshes. Eddy covariance
flux measurements will quantify carbon exchange (CO2 and CH4) from both short
and long hydroperiod (the duration of inundation) marshes in the southern
Florida Everglades. The expected results of these studies will lead to an
improved understanding of how changes in wetland hydrology and vegetation
structure influence the balance between the uptake and release of CO2 and
CH4.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Everglade watershed provides an excellent
opportunity to study the effects of hydroperiod on wetland carbon balance,
especially since water management practices are likely to change substantially
in the near future due to the implementation of the Comprehensive Everglades
Restoration Plan. This watershed is also important due to its peat-forming
wetlands that contain vulnerable stocks of soil carbon. Because wetland
ecosystems are of great significance globally in sequestering carbon dioxide and
releasing methane, and many are threatened by changes in land use and climate,
research is needed to provide better estimates of their role in providing an
overall carbon balance on regional and global scales.
