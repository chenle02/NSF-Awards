Funds are provided to purchase hardware and software to enhance the
capabilities of the UNIDATA system at Millersville University of Pennsylvania.
The UNIDATA program is a national program to help universities use computing and
communication technologies to access, display and analyze scientific data. The
suite of software developed by UNIDATA is capable of running on, and across,
multiply hardware platforms. Millersville has been an active and creative
participant in the UNIDATA program for several years. To further enhance their
capabilities Millersville will acquire a workstation and local area network
(LAN) hardware and software. The LAN will allow the existing PC- McIDAS systems
(a PC-based program in the UNIDATA suite of software) to interface with another
UNIDATA software system, the Scientific Data Management/Local Data Management
software. The acquisition of this equipment is part of the Department of Earth
Sciences' strategic plan to continue and strengthen its participation in the
UNIDATA Program; to greatly expand the use of PC-McIDAS with real-time data in
the classroom; and to support and develop research opportunities. The equipment
will operate as both an additional workstation and an ingester/manager and file
server for the present OS/2-based PC-McIDAS systems.
