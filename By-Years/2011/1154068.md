Montana Minds, a scholarship program of Montana Tech, is awarding renewable
scholarships to 20 academically prepared but financially challenged students so
that they will obtain degrees in the STEM degree disciplines of biology,
chemistry, mathematics, computer science, or software engineering. Montana Tech,
working with TRiO and GEAR UP staff, will target recruiting at 24 of Montana's
impoverished high schools, including all 13 tribal high schools, and 7 tribal
colleges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strategies being used to support scholarship
recipients include: &lt;br/&gt; - enrolling Montana Minds' scholars in Learning
Communities that will ensure that students take several classes together and
interact academically and socially to develop as a cohesive self-sustaining
group;&lt;br/&gt; - enrolling Montana Minds' scholars, during their first years
on campus, in a College Success course designed to instill and sharpen the
skills needed to succeed in college;&lt;br/&gt; - advising within a discipline
by a single STEM faculty member who will mentor each student's progress and
catalyze relationships with other STEM faculty;&lt;br/&gt; - assigning carefully
selected upper division undergraduate mentor/tutors to assist the Montana Minds'
scholars with their studies and help build community among these
scholars;&lt;br/&gt; - assisting Montana Minds' scholars in pursuing faculty
mentored undergraduate research.&lt;br/&gt; - visiting, during the Montana
Minds' scholars freshman and sophomore years, national science and engineering
laboratories to witness science and engineering done on a grand
scale;&lt;br/&gt; - providing the financial support for each of the scholars to
attend a national meeting during their junior year to broaden their acquaintance
with the scope of their discipline; and &lt;br/&gt; - encouraging the Montana
Minds' scholars to become involved with student clubs in their
discipline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beyond these special features that enable the
scholars' success, Montana Minds includes outreach activities to ensure broad
impacts on a statewide level in both the secondary and post secondary
educational systems. Ultimately, this program aims to improve opportunities for
students, increase graduation rates, create a more student-focused culture at
Montana Tech, and educate faculty on the challenges facing financially
disadvantaged students.
