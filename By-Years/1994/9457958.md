Technical abstract: It is proposed to investigate the quantum interaction of a
single-electron device with the local electromagnetic environment. It is also
planned to carry out a detailed study of the even-odd electron number physics in
mesoscopic superconductors. An additional project is the development of an
ultrasensitive electrometer based on single-electron tunneling. Non-technical
abstract: It is now technologically feasible to fabricate ultrasmall materials
systems that exhibit a fascinating variety of phenomena known as mesoscopic
quantum physics. Perhaps the most exciting recent advance is our ability to make
devices in which the flow of electrical charge can be controlled at the most
fundamental level possible: one electron at a time. The objective of the current
research program is the advancement of single-electron device physics as an
impending technology and the utilization of single-electron techniques to probe
the physics of condensed matter systems on an atomic scale.
