9511632 Weinberg String theory is an attempt to move beyond the quantum
mechanical description of elementary particles as point like particles to a
formulation of them as excitations of a microscopic string-like objects. These
excitations would include not only quarks, gluons, leptons ,etc., but also the
graviton, the quantum excitation of gravity so that one would have a truly
unified theory of all interactions. One aim of this research is a better and
deeper understanding of space-time and a quantum theory of gravity. A second aim
is to explore the links of such a theory to conventional particle physics as
described by the standard model and its implications for astrophysical and
cosmological measurements. ***
