This project is a Research Planning Grant in the Research Opportunities for
Women program at the National Science Foundation. The relatively small amount of
funds will allow a researcher from Rice University to do a pilot project in a
Basque province of Spain. The research will study how members of a cooperative
community, which seeks a fully industrialized life style intermediate between
socialist and capitalism, interpret new developments in the technology affecting
pregnancy and birth. The biomedical technologies are usually based on a model of
gender relations with male physicians dominant over female patients, yet the
ideology of the cooperative is that of egalitarianism. The planning grant will
allow the PI to visit the field site, establish contacts, and do preliminary
interviewing and participant observation to allow her to prepare a full-scale
research proposal next year. This research is important because such small pilot
projects allow female researchers to prepare more competitive proposals and gain
valuable research experience.
