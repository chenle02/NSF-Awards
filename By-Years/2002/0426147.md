Achieving High-Performance Reconfigurable Computing in Commodity
Devices&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FPGAs are chips that can be
programmed and reprogrammed to implement complex digital logic. They combine the
performance of hardware with the flexibility of software. Potential applications
range from hardware accelerators for high-performance computers, as well as in
everyday electronic devices. Thus, improving their performance is of significant
interest.&lt;br/&gt;Although FPGAs can provide high performance for a wide range
of applications, their achieved clock cycles are typically 5x-10x slower than
other circuits. This is due to the programmable nature of the underlying
hardware, as well as the limitations in the input circuits.&lt;br/&gt;FPGAs can
support much higher theoretical clock rates than currently can be achieved in
practice. This research will develop architectural features and tools needed to
realize this potential. This approach will combine established techniques with
new algorithms for generating and mapping highly pipelined circuits. The key is
to allow for very significant levels of circuit pipelining in situations that
demand it, while trading area for performance.&lt;br/&gt;We will also optimize
the FPGA architectures to support pipelining, while not adversely affecting
general-purpose designs. This will include optimized logic blocks that can
support aggressive pipelining, as well as routing designed for interconnect
pipelining.&lt;br/&gt;This proposal contains new approaches to radically
increase the speed of FPGAs, a major building block in today's electronics
systems. By providing faster hardware, we can provide greater flexibility,
capabilities, and speed in many different systems. This may include high-end
computers with reconfigurable hardware units, and versatile electronics like
multi-network, multi-service cell phones and enhanced multi-media capable
PDAs.&lt;br/&gt;
