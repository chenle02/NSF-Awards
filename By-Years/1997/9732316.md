9732316 Cuhel The Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site at the
University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee's Center For Great Lakes Studies (CGLS)
provides environmental aquatic science research training for 10 students per
year in a cohesive, multidisciplinary environment. Students interested in
chemistry, geology, and biology of lake and ocean settings are paired with
mentors supervising active research laboratories. Together they will develop a
program of study compatible with the advisor's interests and capabilities within
one of the interdisciplinary research programs active at CGLS. After an
introduction to CGLS and a day of open Lake Michigan sampling experience aboard
the research vessel R/V NEESKAY, they will begin a combined field, laboratory,
and library investigation with increasing student self-reliance. Teams of
students working within an umbrella project will learn the essential nature of
collaborative effort and the reward of applying their individual skills to
accomplish collective goals. Regularly scheduled student and faculty
interactions at both formal and informal levels will be available. Workshops on
instrumentation, graduate school and career opportunities, writing and public
presentation of results, and related topics will be offered. At the close of the
10-week session, each of the students will present a poster, a5 minute oral talk
describing their work to a public audience, and a short but detailed paper in
the format of a typical journal article.
