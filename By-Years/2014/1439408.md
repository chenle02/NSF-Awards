This award will support a new Astronomy in Chile Educator Ambassadors Program
(ACEAP), with the goal of increasing awareness of U.S. observatory facilities in
Chile among the general public. The project will recruit Ambassadors from
community college personnel, amateur astronomers, and planetaria, and provide
them with training in science communication and public outreach. The Ambassadors
will subsequently have hands-on, in-depth experiences at three major U.S.
observatories: the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), the
Gemini Observatory, and the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO).
Finally, the Ambassadors will disseminate their newfound knowledge to the
public, providing a pathway to connect the American public to U.S. scientific
investments overseas.
