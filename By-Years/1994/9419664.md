The Orientation System of a Night-migrating Songbird Kenneth P. Able, Principal
Investigator Non-technical Summary The orientation and navigation performed by
birds that migrate long distances are among the most complex behaviors performed
by animals. Their reliance on several interacting compass systems provides the
migrants with flexible orientation behavior that enables them to cope with the
variety of environmental conditions and navigation problems that may be
encountered enroute. The compasses used by migratory birds (magnetic, star, sun
and polarized compasses) interact during the development of orientation
abilities in young birds and also in mature, experienced migrants. These
interactions take the form of calibration of one system by another. This project
will use two approaches to determine the nature of these interactions. First,
birds will be hand-raised under conditions in which their experience with
relevant orientation cues can be controlled and manipulated. In this way, the
interactions and calibrations that occur during the development of compass
orientation abilities in the young animal can be explored. Experiments with
adult birds will reveal the extent and nature of plasticity that persists
throughout the life of a migratory bird. Migratory orientation provides some of
the most elegant examples of the interplay of genetically-based learning
predispositions with experience in the development and control of behavior.
