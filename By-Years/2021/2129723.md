This travel grant supports five volunteers to attend the 2021
Supercomputing&lt;br/&gt;Conference (SC21) scheduled November 15 - 21, 2021 in
St. Louis, Missouri, as part of&lt;br/&gt;the Womening in IT Networking at SC
(WINS) program who will participate in building&lt;br/&gt;and operating SCinet,
the advanced computer networks which supports the annual&lt;br/&gt;conference.
The WINS program, started in 2015, enables talented early to mid-
career&lt;br/&gt;women from diverse backgrounds and regions of the U.S. research
and education IT&lt;br/&gt;community to volunteer to participate in SCinet and
experience the hands-on&lt;br/&gt;development and construction of the conference
network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit associated with the project
is to continue the expansion and&lt;br/&gt;broadening of knowledge and training
for women network engineers and information&lt;br/&gt;technology professionals
who desire to build expertise and continue their education and&lt;br/&gt;careers
in network and computer systems. The broader impact associated with
the&lt;br/&gt;program is through the diverse representation of organizations and
applicant&lt;br/&gt;backgrounds representing Minority Serving Institutions,
Established Program to&lt;br/&gt;Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) states,
and historically underrepresented&lt;br/&gt;minority groups. Through the
participation in SC and SCinet, the travel funds provide&lt;br/&gt;training,
professional development, and career opportunities for women in a
workforce&lt;br/&gt;that has been historically male and non-minority-
dominated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
