ACM MobiSys conference is the leading international conference on mobile
computing systems and wireless networking platforms. It invites research
contributions addressing the challenges in the area of mobile computing and
wireless networks, from the perspective of wireless and mobile systems,
platforms and applications. The conference features a high-quality technical
program, with an acceptance rate of around 10% out of around 250 submissions. It
has a single-track session, which offers significant opportunities for
individual and small groups that foster technical and social interactions among
a diverse set of participants. MobiSys is also an international conference that
stimulates exchanges between various international research communities.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will help increase the representation and
participation of United States-based students at the conference by providing 25
or more travel grants limited to a maximum of $750 each. By creating new
opportunities for graduate students, especially those from under-represented
groups, to attend a high-quality conference, this award will benefit the
students by giving them an opportunity to interact with world-class researchers,
inspire them to try new research directions, providing mentoring opportunities,
as well as the chance to seek out internships and post-doctoral positions which
will help the students advance in their research career.
