Matrix and polynomial computations are fundamental for modern science and
technology. The design and analysis of algorithms for such computations is an
active area of research with impact on the theory and practice of computing.
Research in this area has intensified due to the advent of parallel computers.
The proposed research will focus on the design and analysis of efficient
sequential and parallel algorithms for polynomial and matrix computation and on
estimating their complexity.
