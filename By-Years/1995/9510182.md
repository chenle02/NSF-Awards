9510182 Page Theoretical research will be conducted on the nonlinear dynamics of
solids and molecules. Three projects will be undertaken: (1) a new class of
localized vibrational excitations which occur in nonlinear periodic lattices,
Ointrinsic localized modes,O will be studied. These modes are generated by
optical pumping in the infrared. The properties of these new modes and their
occurrence in real three-dimensional crystals will be studied. Multistable
vibrational energy transmission across interfaces between optically pumped
organic crystals having a resonant anharmonic interlayer coupling will also be
studied. (2) a related study of the anomalous infrared properties of the defect
system potassium iodide with singly charged silver will be done. (3) finally,
infrared and Raman spectroscopy of large amplitude anharmonic dynamics in
biomolecules and fullerenes will be studied using first-principles quantum
molecular dynamics. %%% This theoretical research program investigates the
nonlinear properties of solids and molecules. These nonlinear vibrations are
often optically active and hence the research will reveal new insights into the
optical properties of molecules and solids. ***
