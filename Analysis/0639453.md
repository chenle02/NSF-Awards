The proposal is to support the attendance of invited speakers, junior faculty,
postdocs, and graduate students at the "International Conference in Complex
Analysis and Dynamics" that will be held at the University of Michigan in Ann
Arbor, Michigan, on March 2-4, 2007.

The conference, the latest in the "Midwest Several Complex Variables" and
"Midwest Complex Dynamics" series of conferences, will feature eleven one-hour
invited talks and ten half-hour talks. Some of the former and most of the latter
will be delivered by young researchers or graduate students. The conference will
highlight recent developments on a variety of topics, including the following:
complex dynamics; complex, symplectic, and CR geometry; partial differential
equations on complex spaces; kernel functions; holomorphic embeddings and
extensions. Past meetings in the series have exerted considerable influence on
the field, a trend that the Ann Arbor meeting is expected to continue.
