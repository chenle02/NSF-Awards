This proposal describes plans for the Twelfth Meeting of New Researchers in
Statistics and Probability, a conference series sponsored by the Institute of
Mathematical Statistics, to be organized by and held for junior researchers. The
primary objective is to provide a much needed venue for interaction among new
researchers. In contrast with large meetings, this conference will be restricted
in size, with a target of 85 participants. Sessions will be followed by panel
discussions and breaks to
facilitate&lt;br/&gt;interactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed conference
will take place July 28 -- July 31, 2009 at the Johns Hopkins University,
Baltimore, and the National Cancer Institute, to immediately precede the annual
Joint Statistical Meetings in Washington DC. Housing, meals, and conference
facilities will be provided on campus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participants will be
statisticians and probabilists that have received their Ph.D. within the past
five years or are expecting to receive their degree within the next year. Each
participant will present their research. Topics will range across a variety of
areas in statistics from theory and methods to applications. Senior speakers
will discuss topics of particular interest to new researchers. Panel discussions
during the conference will cover the topics of journal publications, funding,
career development, and mentoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit
of this proposal is based on its human resources development. The professional
development of new researchers is stimulated by promoting their interaction and
creating networks of colleagues. Participants present their work in a smaller,
more controlled conference environment, maximizing their intellectual
interaction and growth. Women,&lt;br/&gt;minorities, and the disabled are
explicitly encouraged to attend, and we have an established track record of
attracting participants from these categories.&lt;br/&gt;
