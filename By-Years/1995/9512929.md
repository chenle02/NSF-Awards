This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in biophysics
between Stephen Slatin, Einstein College of Medicine and Daniel Baty at the
Laboratory of Engineering and Dynamics of Membrane Systems, French National
Center for Scientific Research, Marseille. The objective of their research is to
study at the molecular level, the mechanisms by which ion channels are gated by
voltage, and the mechanisms that govern protein/lipid interactions. These
processes are crucial to the functioning of most cells. The investigators will
study the colicin crystal structure. The project will benefit from complementary
U.S. and French expertise and by combining the different techniques and protein
studies of the two groups.
