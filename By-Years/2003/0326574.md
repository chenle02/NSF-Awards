ABSTRACT

OCE-0326574 OCE-0326575

Records of oceanic Ge:Si preserved in diatoms show temporal variations that
reflect changes in the marine Si cycle through time. The variations may be
influenced by changes in the ratio of weathering to hydrothermal inputs, changes
in the relative rates of Ge removal in opal versus non-opal phases or by changes
in the internal cycling of Si in the ocean and the fractionation of Ge:Si by
diatoms. A scientist from Oregon State University and one from the University of
Southern California will investigate the utility of germanium isotopes as a
geochemical tracer to provide a constraint to distinguish amongst the influences
of the above mentioned factors. To attain this goal, the PIs plan to analyze
samples from rivers, geothermal fluids, sediment pore waters and diatoms to
assess whether there is Ge isotope fractionation during low-temperature
weathering, in high-temperature geothermal systems, during diagenesis and during
diatom uptake, respectively. It is anticipated that results from this study will
show that Ge isotopes can be used to distinguish the relative rates of
weathering and hydrothermal fluid flow.
