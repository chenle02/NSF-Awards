This Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) project is in the general area
of analytical and surface chemistry and in the subfield of electrosynthesis of
materials. During the tenure of this three-year continuing grant, Professor
Norton and his undergraduate research students will investigate chemical and
structural limitations of superconducting bismuthate materials. An
electrochemical growth method will be employed to produce superconducting
crystals with various compositions and the structures of these crystals will be
mapped using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), x-ray diffraction, and related
structural probes. Additionally, these materials will be characterized
chemically and magnetically. Optimum crystals will be selected and utilized in a
number of physical studies directed toward a basic understanding of oxide
superconductor behavior. %%% This project will contribute to an enhanced
understanding of the fundamental structure-property relationships of these
technologically important materials. Additionally, the research experience
gained by participating undergraduate students will contribute substantively to
the development of the infrastructure of this interdisciplinary area of the
chemical sciences.
