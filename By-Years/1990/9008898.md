This project will compare the genomes of wheat and barley. It is already known
that many of the expressed genes are similar and even in the same linkage
groups. The non-expressed genome is much more variable between the two, however.
In this proposal low copy number and highly repeated sequences will be compared
using both Southern hybridizations and in situ hybridizations. The results will
reveal information about the evolutionary divergence of wheat and barley. It
will also provide information helpful in generating mapping strategies for these
important cereal crops.
