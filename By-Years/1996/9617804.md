Cornillon 9617804 The objectives of this effort are: to populate a client server
based Distributed Oceanographic Data System (DODS) with a number of additional
data sets of broad interest to the oceanographic community, to provide user
support for the system and enhance the system to facilitate its use. The
population effort consists of three parts; (1) the writing of servers for data
sets, (2) the addition of new DODS supported application program interfaces, and
(3) the development of tools to help scientists write data servers. Systems
enhancements will include writing Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) for some of
the most commonly used analysis packages, a Web browser designed to read and
display data accessible via DODS- compliant servers and a uniform, user
selectable, representation for time and space.
