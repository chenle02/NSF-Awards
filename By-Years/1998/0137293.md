Lithospheric bending may give a fundamentally different window into the
processes of fault initiation and development than does lithospheric stretching
. The investigators will take advantage of this window by a systematic analysis
of bathymetric data and sidescan sonar images for all trenches where data is
available. Trenches offer a unique way to relate falut characteristics to the
amount of strain required to develop a system of faults. Two-dimensional
numerical models will be used to relate lithospheric properties to the observed
spacing of faults and the amplitude of their offset.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
