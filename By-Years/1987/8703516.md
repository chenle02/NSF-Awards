During the last ten years, electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) has been
combined with transmission electron microscopy to yield a method of chemical
microanalysis which is capable of very high spatial resolution. Such methods are
needed in the development of improved catalysts, the characterization of small
particles in steel, and in studies ofthe distribution of calcium and other light
elements in biological tissue. A simple and convenient quantitation procedure
has been developed for EELS, but this procedure can give misleading results from
some specimens, particularly if the regions analysed are crystalline. Purpose of
this research is to develop an improved analysis routine and more accurate
models for ionization cross sections. To achieve this aim, energy-loss
spectroscopy on test samples of known thickness and composition will be carried
out. As a result of these efforts, it is expected that EELS will come closer to
fulfilling its potential as a microanalysis technique. EELS will also be used to
investigate the radiation-induced loss of light elements from electron-
irradiated areas; in particular, its dependence on specimen temperature and
surface coating. With greater use being made on high-brightness electron sources
and higher accelerating voltages, this mass-loss process is of increasing
importance to any electron-beam microanalysis technique, including x-ray
emission spectroscopy.
