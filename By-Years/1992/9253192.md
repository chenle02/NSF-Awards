This three-year project will be conducted through tribally-owned Little Big
Horn College and on-site at the Crow and Northern Cheyenne Reservations in
Montana. It is designed to provide quality training for elementary teachers in
the content areas of science and in the discovery method of teaching science.
Project staff will work directly with the elementary teachers in the classrooms
to implement the discovery approach. Summer institutes will be held for
residential training in field-based science, providing opportunities to
incorporate the traditional relationship of the peple to the land. This proposal
is appropriate for teacher enhancement because it targets teachers of Native
Americans in Reservation schools, and is designed to enhance the science
knowledge and teaching and to develop leadership skills of these teachers. Non-
NSF cost-sharing is approximately 18% of the amount requested from NSF.
