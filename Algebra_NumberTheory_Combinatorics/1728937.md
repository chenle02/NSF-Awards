This grant provides support for speakers and participants in the Mid-Atlantic
Algebra, Geometry, and Combinatorics (MAAGC) workshop, the next of which will
take place at Drexel University on May 5-6, 2017. MAAGC is an annual conference
series held in Philadelphia which brings together senior researchers and junior
mathematicians to promote collaborations and regional interactions, while
highlighting recent significant developments in algebra, geometry, and
combinatorics. Each MAAGC workshop has brought four outstanding mathematicians
from across North America to give talks about new advances in algebraic
combinatorics, algebraic geometry, representation theory, and other related
fields. In addition to these invited lectures, there is a poster session for
junior participants, a panel discussion featuring concrete and timely
professional advice for mathematicians at varying stages in their careers, and
plenty of unstructured time for forging mathematical collaborations.

MAAGC workshops are designed to strengthen and connect the scientific
communities in algebra, geometry, and combinatorics by facilitating positive
interactions among students, postdocs, and faculty at research universities as
well as small colleges in the Mid-Atlantic. We aim to include even more graduate
student and postdoctoral participants throughout the region, providing early
career researchers the opportunity to learn about recent trends in the field,
disseminate their own work, build professional connections, and advance new
mathematical results. The majority of the budget is thus dedicated toward
funding students and young researchers without other means of financial support,
prioritizing participants who also present posters. This grant will support the
MAAGC conference series for three years (2017, 2018, 2019).
