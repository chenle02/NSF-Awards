techniques will be used to study flows and diffusion characteristics of both
pure supercritical fluids (C2F6 and CO2) and a two-phase mixture of brine and
supercritical CO2 in capillaries and in porous media. The study will proceed
from relatively simple flows in capillaries to more complex ones, involving
fingering instability and buoyancy-driven flows of brine-supercritical CO2
mixtures in porous media. Results will be used to determine behavior near
critical points in these systems and to establish the validity of a theory.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Storage of CO2 in a supercritical state in earth
formations (porous media) is currently being proposed as means to reduce CO2 in
the atmosphere. Carbon sequestration requires the storage of CO2 in its
supercritical state in contact with subsurface brines. Supercritical fluids are
also used as green solvents in industrial processes such as decaffeination and
enhanced oil recovery. The results of the present study will be useful in
assessing the risks and in designing safer carbon sequestration and industrial
processes that use supercritical fluids.
