9730693 Tarter This is a collaboration of the SETI Institute and three other
scientific organizations (the California Academy of Sciences, the Astronomical
Society of the Pacific and NASA Ames Research Center) to develop six modules
(4-6 weeks each) to form a year-long high school integrated science curriculum
on cosmic evolution, planetary evolution, origin of life, diversification of
life, Hominid evolution and evolution of technology. In doing so, the course
treats a variety of topics traditionally covered in separate courses on
astronomy, biology, chemistry, geology and physics. The materials follow the
BSCS - 5E learning model design. The lesson plans and teachers manual are
delivered on CD-ROM; other curricular materials include soft-cover student
readers, databases and software on CD-ROM, and inter-school telecommunications
projects. These products are to be published as a complete set for use as a
year-long science course and are to be available as individual modules for use
in discipline-based courses.
