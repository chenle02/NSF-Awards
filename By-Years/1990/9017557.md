One of the most challenging problems in electronic materials processing is the
creation of a thin (1um) single crystal silicon film on an insulating film
(SiO2). The resulting product is a silicon-on-insulator system (SOI) and can be
used as the building block for many advanced applications. Through well
established techniques such as chemical vapor deposition, a polycrystalline
silicon film can be easily created. The challenge is to recrystallize it in the
form of a single crystal. %%% The proposed research plans to: (1) verify if the
difficulties of creating a single crystal are primarily driven by heat transfer;
and (2) try to establish heat transfer techniques to successfully recrystallize
thin silicon films in the form of single crystals. If successful, these
techniques will improve the quality of SOI films used in the microelectronic
industry.
