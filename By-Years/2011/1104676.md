This project is jointly funded by the Electronic and Photonic Materials (EPM)
Program in the Division of Materials Research (DMR) and the Electronics,
Photonics, and Magnetic Devices (EPMD) Program in the Division of Electrical,
Communications and Cyber Systems (ECCS).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical: This
research project is on electromagnetic metamaterials and transformation optics,
and aims at achieving broadband, high-performance metamaterials-based devices in
the visible spectrum. The research is designed to use the conventional
photolithography techniques to fabricate broadband, transformation optical
devices at relatively low costs. The project studies the ultimate resolution
limit of Maxwell fisheye and Eaton microlenses and investigates how the
resolution limit relates to device magnification. In addition, the project
explores recently developed broadband "trapped rainbow" geometry in novel
multichannel sensing for possible "spectroscopy on a chip"
architecture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical: The project addresses basic
and applied research issues in an interdisciplinary area that combines materials
science and device engineering, with high technological relevance. The research
may open new ways of direct high-resolution visualization of small objects such
as viruses and biomolecules using "regular" optical microscopes. This project
also advances education and training of undergraduate and graduate students. It
provides students opportunities to participate in a newly developed Professional
Science Masters Program in Applied Physics at Towson University and to learn
unique technological skills in the areas of electromagnetic metamaterials and
transformation optics.
