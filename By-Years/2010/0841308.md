Ice core records have led to many important discoveries and have revolutionized
climate science. Members of the U.S. ice coring community have led the efforts
to retrieve and study ice cores yet continued U.S. scientific productivity in
this area, including both knowledge generation and creation of the next
generation of scientists, critically depends upon a mechanism for ensuring
continuity and international cooperation in ice coring efforts, along with
availability of appropriate drills, drilling expertise, and innovations in
drilling technology. This award provides support for a Scientific Drilling
Support Office (SDSO) that will work closely and cooperatively with an Ice
Drilling Design and Operations Group (IDDOG). The intellectual merit of this
project is embodied in the five closely linked goals of this project. These are
to: 1) Provide community leadership in ice core science and drilling research
planning in response to community input, 2) Provide scientific oversight of
projects directed to the IDDOG, 3) Identify new technology needs and seek
funding for their development, 4) Enhance communication and information exchange
related to ice core science and ice core drilling technology as a service to the
community, and 5) Coordinate information exchange between U.S. ice core research
and drilling technology communities and international groups. The broader
impacts of this project include organization and dissemination of results of
science planning, and the retrieval, transformation to digital media, and
dissemination of existing knowledge on aspects of ice drilling technology that
have not previously been widely available, along with dissemination of knowledge
of current issues and solutions for drilling technology. The SDSO will work in
support of the U.S. cryospheric sciences and drilling communities to facilitate
planning efforts and to be proactive in the planning and coordination that is
necessary to form and execute continuously evolving ice core programs. The
formation of an ongoing, continuous program will nurture the inclusion of
students of all ages, races, and genders, and will help to launch graduate
students into promising careers in climate science, and the resulting
discoveries will help all citizens. Achieving the goals of this project will
enable the U.S. ice coring research community to realize implementation of their
internationally-coordinated ice coring goals, lead the world in ice coring
science discoveries, nurture the education and development of the next
generation of scientists and engineers, and help to communicate the importance
of their discoveries to all.
