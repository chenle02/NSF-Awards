This project addresses the lessons learned from the 17 October 1989 Northern
California (Loma Prieta) earthquake. It is a continuation of the work that was
funded through the Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) program: the
objective of that award was to collect perishable data on the liquefaction sand
boils and the superficial ground displacements in the Marina District of San
Francisco resulting from the Loma Prieta earthquake. The objectives of this
continuation research project are: to supplement the data collected with
existing data on the Marina District; to complement the field observations with
in- situ and laboratory tests; to compile and document a complete data set for
case study analysis of liquefaction and site amplification; to evaluate, using
this data set, the one-dimensional methods of site amplification and
liquefaction; and to develop a nonlinear finite element model to analyze the
site amplification and liquefaction of the Marina District during the Loma
Prieta earthquake. The resulting improved understanding of the present methods
of liquefaction analysis will have application to other areas at risk from
earthquake-induced liquefaction, such as the Los Angeles coast, whose geological
conditions possess relevant similarities to those of the Marina District.
