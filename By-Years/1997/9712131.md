The award will support a program of research on problems of coordination in
networks. A network is a group of people or processors with links between
certain pairs. Some of the problems to be studied take a network as a given and
consider how to manage it efficiently. In other cases, the problem is how to
design a network, as well as how to design the procedures to be followed by the
agents at its nodes. In some of the design problems the agent at a node is
assumed, in effect, to be a robot who behaves as the designer wishes, while in
others the agent is autonomous and has independent goals that the designer has
to take into account. Networks serve different purposes: transforming inputs
into outputs, sending messages from one node to another, transporting
commodities, coordinating mobile units, or dividing up computational tasks among
processors. Part of this research considers differences between those purposes
as well as their common properties. Other parts of the research pursue general
themes in the design of efficient human organizations and the adaptation of
market mechanisms to novel tasks of resource allocation.
