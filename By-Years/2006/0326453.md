Human administration of storage systems (including capacity
planning,&lt;br/&gt;back-up, load balancing, etc.) is a large and growing issue
in modern&lt;br/&gt;IT infrastructures; reported ratios of 1 sysadmin per 1-10TB
of storage&lt;br/&gt;are scary with multi-petabyte data centers on the
horizon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research program defines and explores a new
storage architecture&lt;br/&gt;that integrates automated management functions
and simplifies the human&lt;br/&gt;administrative task. We refer to conforming
systems as self-* storage&lt;br/&gt;systems in an attempt to capture many recent
buzzwords in a single&lt;br/&gt;meta-buzzword; self-* systems should be self-
configuring, self-organizing,&lt;br/&gt;self-tuning, self-healing, self-
managing, etc. Human administrators&lt;br/&gt;provide only muscle for component
addition and guidance on acceptable&lt;br/&gt;risk levels and current levels of
satisfaction. Borrowing organizational&lt;br/&gt;ideas from corporate structure
and technologies from AI and control&lt;br/&gt;systems, self-* storage should
simplify storage administration, increase&lt;br/&gt;system robustness, and
simplify system construction.&lt;br/&gt;
