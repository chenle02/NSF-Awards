0137756&lt;br/&gt;Maschner&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hot Springs Village site,
located on the Alaska Peninsula, was excavated in the 1970s and 1980s by
Professors Hiroaki and Atsuko Okada. The Okadas produced preliminary reports of
the excavations, but were unable to complete the final analysis. Now
contemporary archaeologists will assist the Okadas with the final analysis and
transport the artifacts and other materials back to Alaska for curation at the
Museum of the Aleutians.
