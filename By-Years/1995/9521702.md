on structural dynamics and structural control and to disseminate results of
research in the areas. The symposium aims to bring together researchers from a
board spectrum of engineering areas, such as aerospace, civil, electrical and
mechanical engineering, as well as engineering mechanics. The scope of the
symposium has changed and expanded over the years so as to reflect the interests
and needs of the technical community. The symposium covers theoretical,
numerical and experimental developments.
