This project studies how caches affect the performance of algorithms. There are
two component problems to study: (i) the problem of how to analyze the cache
performance of algorithms, and (ii) the problem of how to design algorithms with
good cache performance and good overall performance. In order to analyze cache
performance, an algorithm is modeled by its pattern of memory accesses. Models
that approximate patterns of memory accesses will be investigated and analyzed
to approximate the number of cache misses. The validity of the approximation is
determined empirically using trace-driven cache simulation. With a better
understanding of the cache performance of algorithms, algorithms that are
optimized to improve cache performance, will be designed, implemented and
evaluated.
