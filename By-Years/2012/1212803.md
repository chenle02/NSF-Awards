The Center for Advancement of Informal Science Education (CAISE), a cooperative
agreement with NSF, is a partnership of the Association of Science-Technology
Centers with faculty and professionals from the University of Pittsburgh Center
for Learning in Out-of-School Environments, Oregon State University, Science
Museum of Minnesota, Visitor Studies Association, KQED Public Media, Advisors
and other collaborators. CAISE is working to support ongoing improvement of, and
NSF investments in, the national infrastructure for informal Science Technology
Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CAISE is
building capacity and supporting continued professionalization for the field,
fostering a community of practice that bridges the many varied forms in which
informal STEM experiences are developed and delivered for learners of all ages.
To that end, CAISE activities are also: creating field-driven evidence databases
about the impacts of informal STEM education; facilitating federated searches of
databases; stimulating discussions about important learning research agendas for
the field; furthering knowledge transfer between learning research and practice;
working to improve evaluation knowledge and processes; and helping STEM
researchers improve their efforts in informal STEM education and communication.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For Principal Investigators (PIs) and potential PIs, CAISE
provides resources that help them as they develop evidence-based ideas and
proposals. It also catalyzes and strengthens networks through PI meetings,
communications, and other methods that encourage sharing of deliverables,
practices, and findings across projects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the ISE
Program at NSF, CAISE is assisting Program Officers in understanding the
portfolio of awards, identifying the portfolio's impacts in key areas, and
integrating the program's investments in education infrastructure.
