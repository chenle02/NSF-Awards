9725047 Yund Fine-grained samples consisting of forsterite and plagioclase
saturated with impurities such as Rb, Sr and Ba will be hot-pressed. These
polycrystalline samples will be annealed at T and P (and quenched) in order to
establish equilibrium between grain boundary region and the bulk crystal.
Compositional differences between the grain boundary region and adjacent regions
of the bulk crystal will be determined using SEM. Differences in concentrations
of solutes equivalent to a tenth of a monolayer on a grain boundary can be
determined. Grain boundary diffusion experiments will be made on the above
aggregates. Stable isotope traces will be used at a variety of T and P and
concentration profiles will be determined via ion probe.
