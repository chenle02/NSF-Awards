Our study of mathematics is carried out by means of rigorous deduction from
axioms, i.e., proofs. It is well-known that the results of this study are
incomplete, and may lead to statements which cannot be decided from the
fundamental principles of mathematics (the ZFC axioms). Set theory is a field of
mathematical logic which provides tools to analyze the consistency of
mathematical statements. The systematic approach by which consistency results
are obtained comes through the construction of alternative mathematical
universes in which the consistency of various statements can be examined and
validated. This project deals with several such construction methods. It aims to
develop new methods to address several important problems in infinitary
combinatorics, and to study existing methods and their limitations.

The main objects of study are (i) algebras in set theory; (ii) diamond
sequences, (iii) the Mitchell order; and (iv) inner models of hereditarily
ordinal definable sets (HOD). In connection with (i), the project aims to study
different notions of singular stationary, which were introduced by Foreman and
Magidor, and make advancements in answering questions regarding Jonsson
algebras. In connection with (ii), the project addresses diamond type principles
and their interaction with compactness principles and cardinal arithmetic
assumptions. In connection with (iii), the project aims to study the connection
between forcing theory and inner model theory by studying problems concerning
the consistency strength of various Mitchell order structures. In connection
with (iv), the project aims to study the extent to which HOD is close to the
set-theoretic universe V, and address the HOD-conjecture.
