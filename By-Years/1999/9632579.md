ABSTRACT Proposal Number: CTS-9632579 Principal Investigator: Marcus The goal of
this work is the destabilization of trailing tip vortices from commercial
aircraft. This is a persistent problem that was identified more than thirty
years ago. The strength of these vortices is so large that even another
commercial jet can be upset if encountering a vortex structure at too close a
range. A rash of crashes in the 60's and 70's required the FAA to set stringent
spacing standards for landing aircraft that has had a severe impact on the
capacity of our airports. Over the years there has been an intense effort
directed at finding methods for breaking up these very coherent vortex
structures, mainly through modifications to to the wing and its control
surfaces. None of this work has lead to anything of practical use. In this
study, wake vortices are weakly modified by injecting small amount of fluid at
the wing tips in a precisely controlled manner. A novel semi-analytical method
utilizing degenerate perturbation theory will be used to explore a broad range
of combinations of angle, location, spatial structure and temporal rate of the
injected fluid that leads to fast-growing short wave length instabilities. One
effect of the fast-growing short wave length instabilities is to increase the
core size quickly, which reduces the intensity of the swirl velocity. A
secondary, and perhaps more important effect of increase core size is enhanced
role that the Crow instability mechanism can play in the final decay of the
trailing vortex system.
