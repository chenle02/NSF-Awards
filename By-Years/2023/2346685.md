Two major goals of probability theory are to address the question of how large
complex systems work and to identify the geometry of their evolution.
Probabilistic models are widespread in fields like biology, statistical physics,
quantum mechanics, and machine learning. Examples include models of cancer
growth, spread of disease in population, governing principles of subatomic
particles, black holes, neural networks, etc. The purpose of this project is to
understand the geometry and intrinsic properties of a string of models that are
representatives of these examples. The project aims to resolve open questions in
those fields based on tools that the investigator has developed.

Domino tilings, random matrices, and stochastic six vertex models are areas of
intense interest in the field of statistical physics, while Liouville conformal
field theory (LCFT) and theory of optimal transport have gained immense
attention in the fields of quantum mechanics and machine learning. This project
revolves around questions in those areas and aims to acquire new insights about
their geometry and integrability. In particular, this project plans to: (1) find
laws of iterated logarithms and fractal dimension of models in the Kardar-
Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class including the KPZ fixed point, edge
spectrum of random matrices, and domino tilings; (2) build a unified framework
for studying the moment formulas of interacting particle systems and vertex
models including the stochastic six vertex model; (3) rigorously prove modular
transformation properties of conformal blocks of LCFT and partition functions
from gauge theory; and (4) study the convergence of entropically regularized
optimal transport to optimal transport when the regularization vanishes. By
intermingling ideas from various fields including geometry of polymers,
representation theory, Riemann-Hilbert techniques, quantum groups, and convex
geometry, the investigator aims to resolve questions that were hard to tackle
with other methods.
