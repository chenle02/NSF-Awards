This research project is a collaboration between Donald Janssen of the
University of Washington and Jochen Stark of the University of Weimar. The
purpose of the research is to study the response of aggregate concretes to
freeze-thaw cycles in order to understand why they fail and to identify
aggregates that are susceptible to damage. The collaboration draws on the
complementary expertise of the foreign and domestic research groups, and the
different testing methods make comparison testing possible. The German group has
considerable experience in testing concrete for resistance to salt scaling and
the microstructural evaluation. The U.S. group has 10 years of experience
investigating D-cracking mechanisms and susceptibility. Results of the
collaboration are expected to include development of improved identification of
frost-susceptible aggregates, improved understanding of the frost damage
mechanism in aggregates, and the development of U.S. experience in the use of
alternate testing procedures.
