9709394 Reed The Pacific Northwest has been subjected to a series of crippling
storms in late 1996 and early 1997. A combination of wind, ice, rain and snow
have contributed to the shutdown of the region's lifelines in transportation,
communications and electric power. Flooding and mudslides associated with the
storm's aftermath are still underway. This series of events presents a unique
opportunity to gather data for investigation of lifeline systems failures. The
primary objective of this work is to analyze the chain of events involving power
and other systems failures, through detailed investigations of the following:
meteorological conditions and chronology; local utility data from Puget Power,
Seattle City Light and others; collection of data in the field by the principal
investigator, graduate research assistant and others; and reports of the news
media. It is also planned to establish a website asking for data from the
greater community as well. Another objective is to develop recommendations for
damage mitigation and increased system robustness with the goal of reducing
losses. ***
