9312246 Heskett This three-year award supports U.S.-Sweden cooperative research
in surface science between David R. Heskett, University of Rhode Island, and
Jesper Andersen, University of Lund, Sweden. The objective of their research is
to investigate alkali atoms that are adsorbed on metal. They will use high
resolution core level photoemission spectroscopy. The U.S. investigator brings
to this collaboration expertise in the properties of the adsorbate atom. The
project takes advantage of complementary expertise of the Swedish investigator
and provides access to a synchrotron radiation source not available in the
United States currently. Alkalis are widely used in the chemical industry as
promoters for catalysts. They are also used in many devices and processes which
require the emission of electrons either thermally, chemically or by
photoemission. This research could provide a basis for new and improved uses of
alkalis adsorbed metals in industry. ***
