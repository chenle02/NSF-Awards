This award will support a 7 day workshop held at the University of Utah in
June, 1991. This workshop would bring together mathematicians actively involved
in the study of homological properties of finite dimensional algebras, aiming
toward amalgamations of the new techniques which have recently led to progress
on several longstanding problems. The main focus of the workshop would be the
Finitistic Dimension Conjecture and its ramifications, including the Nakayama
Conjecture. It is anticipated that the ideas developed during this meeting will
benefit the area of finite dimensional algebra as a whole. The workshop would be
attended by about 30 participants, including 2- 3 graduate students. Invited
speakers would include D. Anick, M. Auslander, K. Fuller, K. Igusa, E. Kirkman,
J. Kuzmanovich, I. Reiten and D. Zacharia, as well as the organizers, E. Green
and B. Zimmermann-Huisgen.
