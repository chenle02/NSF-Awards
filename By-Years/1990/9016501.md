This U.S.-Italy award will support a long-term visit by Professor Peter Dorato
of the University of New Mexico to the Politecnico di Torino to collaborate with
Professor Roberto Tempo and others of that institution. The main focus of the
research will be on the extension of the U.S. principal investigator's theory of
U-parameter design for robust feed back systems to multi-variable systems and
multi-objective design problems. The principal investigator's theory of U-
parameter design is based on the parameterization of all robustly stabilizing
compensators by an arbitrary bounded- real function, or matrix is the
multivariable, when the plant perturbations are assumed to be unstructured
perturbations, specified in the frequency domain. This fee parameter- function
has been exploited to optimize system performance for the nominal plant, in the
case of single-input-output systems. A major thrust of the proposed sabbatical
research will be to extend these results to multivariable systems. A final area
of proposed research will be the study of robust control for systems with both
unstructured frequency-domain uncertainty and parameter uncertainty. The
principal investigator has focused his research in the former area and the
Italian investigator has focused his research in the latter area. It is expected
that this research will provide further insight into the design of robust
multivariable systems. This should provide design tools for the accurate control
of complex systems in the presence of significant uncertainties in plant
dynamics.
