Professor Robert Hamers of the University of Wisconsin-Madison is supported by
the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry to
investigate the use of molecular layers as electronic interfaces to oriented
single crystals of TiO2 in the anatase and rutile forms, and extending to other
oxides including SrTiO3. Studies will focus primarily on single crystals but
will also use nanocrystalline materials as appropriate. The studies are aimed at
achieving a fundamental understanding of how differences in surface structure
impact the resulting molecular layers and the electronic properties of the
interfaces. The structural and electronic properties of these grafted layers on
well-defined single crystals of oxide semiconductors will be evaluated using a
variety of chemical, structural, electronic, and spectroelectrochemical probes.
Oxide semiconductors are the basis for several new and emerging types of dye-
sensitized solar cells, quantum dot solar cells, and photocatalysis devices. The
ability to integrate these materials with molecular and nanostructured
sensitizers could lead to the development of inexpensive solar cells made by
simple wet-chemical methods. The educational activities include mentoring of 8th
grade students on science projects in renewable energy, summer internships for
high school students, and year-round research opportunities for undergraduates
and graduate students.
