The Synthetic Organic Program will support the research of Dr. Gilbert Stork of
the Department of Chemistry at Columbia University. Dr. Stork will continue his
highly innovative studies on the development of new synthetic strategies. The
research is centered around the development of highly regio- and stereoselective
methods for the construction of organic structures from the relatively simple to
the relatively complex. Dr. Stork will focus on several areas including the
control of regio- and stereochemistry via radical cyclization processes and
their application to total synthesis; the control of regio- and stereochemistry
by enforcing intramolecularity on normal intermolecular reactions via a
temporary, removable silicon (or metal) connector linking the two normally
separated reactive fragments; and on the use of guanidine systems embedded in
suitable frameworks for probing molecular recognition.
