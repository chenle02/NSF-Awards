This Nanotechnology in Undergraduate Education (NUE) award to Professor Thomas
J. Manning of Valdosta State University is jointly supported by the Chemistry
Education Program and the Division of Earth Sciences. It supports twelve areas
of hands-on nanotechnology experiences in undergraduate education. Among these
are: measuring colligative properties of solutions containing nanostructures,
aqueous phase chemistry of functionalized fullerenes and nanotubes, comparisons
of nanotubes to DNA, nanoparticles in the environment and computer simulations
of nanostructures and their reactions. The project emphasizes the practical
aspects needed for large-scale implementation in the first two years of an
undergraduate science curriculum including economic factors involving chemicals
and instrumentation, safety issues, correlation to topics covered in
undergraduate courses, and clearly defined procedures for exploratory hands on
experiences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal for this award was received in
response to the Nanoscale Science and Engineering program announcement, NSF
02-148, category NUE. The project involves a program and organizational
structure to develop and disseminate 12 hands-on laboratory experiences and
educational materials for undergraduates. &lt;br/&gt;
