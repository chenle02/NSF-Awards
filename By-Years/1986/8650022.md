The program is designed as an eight-week session for 40 middle/junior high
school (5th-9th grade) teachers. The basic purposes for the summer program are:
1.To develop curricular materials: Inquiry Role Approach laboratory activities
and schoolyard science activities. 2.To improve the academic background of the
teachers in three areas: life science, earth science, and physical science. The
style of instruction will involve laboratory activities, discussions, lectures,
and schoolyard field trips. The Inquiry Role Approach, a successful teaching
strategy utilizing three-member laboratory teams, will be the major teaching
strategy used for the physical and earth science areas. In the life sciences,
emphasis will be placed on schoolyard field trips and the individualization of
laboratory activities. Follow-up activities will include: a fall and spring
meeting following the workshop to discuss results of training; in-service
training events conducted by participants for science teachers in local schools.
The college staff will visit each school to continue communications with middle
school teachers.
