The research literature contains few documented reports on the strategies and
tactics used by teachers in one-to-one tutoring situations and the learning
effects related to same. This paucity of information exist even as vast amounts
of educational research is being focused on effective classroom teaching. The
goal of the research proposed here is to develop a cognitive skills- model of
one-to-one tutoring in algebra. The Model will explicate specific tutoring
strategies and tactics at a more precise level of detail than is currently
available. This problem will be approached from an "expert systems" point of
view where the target expert is a master high school algebra tutor. This teacher
will be videotaped and the tapes analyzed to determine the cognitive skills
involved in the teacher-student interaction. The cognitive skills discovered
will be represented as formal knowledge structures, and then, as far as
possible, implemented in the pedagogical module of an intelligent tutor for
algebra. The development plan involves the initial observation of the expert
teacher, viewing of the videotapes and both debriefing and followup interviews
with the expert teacher, model validation by both the expert tutoring system
with students in school settings. Input from mathematicians, mathematics
educators, and teacher educators will help guide the development of the expert
tutoring system. The proposed research is challenging and has the potential of
expanding the frontiers of mathematics education. It has been carefully designed
to move beyond routine "symbol manipulation" tutors. The Principal Investigator
is highly respected and the list of associated staff and consultants are the top
scholars in their respective academic fields. The reviewers were enthusiastic
about the project and recommended funding. The project is planned for a period
of twenty-four (24) months.
