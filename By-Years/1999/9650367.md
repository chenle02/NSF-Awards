In 1992, this college committed itself to expanding its program in
Environmental Science. In order to respond to the growing importance of the
hydrological sciences, the department is now taking steps to strengthen its
laboratory and field program in this area. The department has recently upgraded
its capability to perform water quality measurements by obtaining equipment for
sample collection, for field measurements of mainly physical parameters, and for
physical models of hydrological systems for laboratory use. Specifically, the
new equipment enables the Department of Environmental Science to add a lab to
its current Hydrology course which will involve experiments with physical models
in the laboratory and hydrological measurements in the field; introduce a
stronger field component in the Introduction to Environmental Science lab;
collect samples with state-of-the-art techniques for the Environmental
Measurements course; and provide basic equipment for field-oriented studies
leading to the senior thesis and other projects. Field studies using the new
equipment may focus on local environments in the New York City metropolitan
area, ranging from heavily polluted to relatively undisturbed sites (Manhattan,
Long Island, Bergen County, Hackensack Meadowlands, and Hudson Highlands, in
particular the Black Rock Forest Preserve). Syllabi, laboratory material, and
data generated may have an immediate impact on education and research at other
institutions and will be made available over the Internet.
