This project is using the computational and graphic power of microcomputers and
workstations to allow students in the chemistry curriculum to investigate
molecular structure and dynamics. This activity is part of laboratory courses,
and interactive software allows students to conduct their investigations as
experiments. Beginning a coherent three-year program, the first year stresses
learning how to think at the molecular level and becoming familiar with
different representations of molecules. The second year, organic and inorganic
laboratories focus on the development of sound knowledge of force-field models
and energy minimization. Molecular orbital models are being introduced and used
to investigate spectral properties. The third-year physical chemistry laboratory
is introducing ab initio MO methods and integrating and comparison of the
different models available. Learning about the limitations of the models and
where and why they fail helps students appreciate the approximate nature of
scientific models.
