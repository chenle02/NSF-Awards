Prof. Paul Burrow and Prof. Ken Jordan (Univ. of Pittsburgh) are supported by a
grant from The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to study the scattering
of electrons off of negatively charged ions. Applications resulting from this
research include the possible development of new gas lasers, atmospheric studies
related to the ozone loss problem and the development of high voltage insulating
materials. Burrow and Jordan will study temporary anion formation in hydrocarbon
molecules in the gas phase. In the past they have used electron transmission
spectroscopy to locate these states and determine the associated electron
affinities. More recently they have been monitoring vibrational mode populations
by examining the angular distribution of the ejected electrons. The new work
focuses on the following issues: (1) The degree of distortion that an ion
undergoes during its lifetime, (2) What are the selection rules for exciting
various vibrational modes via a resonance? (3) Does the angular dependence of
the resonant scattering process reflect the overall molecular symmetry or the
local symmetry of the moiety to which the electron is temporarily attached? and
(4) Can dissociative attachment be used as a probe of coupling between remote
functional groups?
