9622779 Wright This award provides funding to create Agent-Based Manufacturing
Systems. The key feature is that manufacturing software "agents" will be created
to enhance precision and production speed. Today, a vast number of software
packages for engineering design, analysis, planning and fabrication are
available on the Internet. However, they exist in a heterogeneous distributed
system, usually with no well-characterized link to an individual designer. For
example, such remote services might be configured for one commercial CAD system
while the individual designer is working on another. Or, the service might be a
specialized manufacturing facility, that the designer would like to "query and
get information about". The first research task will create a standard "wrapper"
for such services, employing common languages, representations and
interconnections. The second task will create a collaborative environment so
that all points-of-view are brought into the design. The third task will create
methods to satisfy trade-offs and resolve conflicts. If successful, this
research will enable US manufacturers to produce at low cost while addressing
the stringent constraints on dimension, form, surface finish and part integrity.
As one example, previous research at Berkeley created an integrated CAD/CAM
system for the production of injection molds used in the consumer electronics
industry. With "agent-based manufacturing", one agent will advise on how to
obtain the best surface finish inside the injection molds, and another agent
will compensate for tooling deflections, thus creating more accurate components.
Agents will extract the knowledge that is now distributed on the Internet and
incorporate it into design and planning. This will avoid ambiguities and
mistakes during manufacturing, thus improving production.
