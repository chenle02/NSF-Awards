9357756 Subrahmanian Reasoning agents functioning in a dynamically changing
world often need to reason simultaneously in many different ways. These ways may
include: reasoning about time, reasoning in the presence of uncertainty,
reasoning in the presence of non-monotonicity, and reasoning about diverse data
structures. In this proposal, we plan to develop a uniform scheme for reasoning
with hybrid representations of data and knowledge. We will develop prototype
implementations of this scheme as well as study application of this scheme to
diverse domains.
