In recent years, genetic evidence has revealed that extra- pair mating is more
widespread in apparently monogamous bird species than previously thought. The
costs and benefits of extra-pair mating are poorly understood for males and
females because of a paucity of data and because, until recently, the genetic
techniques available were inadequate for determining paternity in natural
populations. In this study, parentage of young in nests of western bluebird
(Sialia mexicana) pairs in central coastal California will be determined, and
behavioral, demographic and genetic data will be used to address the functional
consequences of extra-pair mating. Parentage of young in nests where more than
one male cares for young will be determined, as well as whether supernumerary
males are nonbreeding helpers or actually father offspring in the nests at which
they feed. This study will clarify the mating system of the western bluebired
and will help to shed light on the extent and success of extra-pair mating as a
reproductive alternative to strict monogamy.
