The University of Southern California will acquire several items of
oceanographic instrumentation to be placed in a pool of shared use equipment.
This equipment is maintained for use on or in association with the R/V VICKERS,
a research vessel owned and operated by the University. A part of the ship's
operating schedule during 1991 is in support of NSF- sponsored research
projects. The instrumentation will also increase the capabilities of the ship
and of the University to support research and engineering activities. The
instrumentation includes: -Seagoing computer, disk drive system and other
peripheral equipment for a shipboard data management system that is essential
for real-time acquisition and display of large data sets, -CTD system for
obtaining detailed profiles of seawater conductivity and temperature as a
function of depth, and a -Rosette sampler with Niskin bottles for collecting
discrete seawater samples at various depths in the water column. The
instrumentation described above will increase the capability of the University
to support NSF-sponsored research and engineering projects.
