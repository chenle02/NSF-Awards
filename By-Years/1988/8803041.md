Professor Sarnak's research will be in the spectral theory of automorphic forms
with applications to number theory, combinatorics and mathematical physics. Two
of the unsolved problems in this area which he plans to work on are (1) The
existence of Maass cusp forms for nonuniform lattices and (2) The "hearing the
shape of a drum" problem, i.e. what can be said about an isospectral set of
manifolds. Professor Osgood will work on several problems in geometric function
theory, some in joint work with Sarnak. This work will concern the isospectral
problem for surfaces with a generalization of the classical Schwarzian
derivative to higher dimensions. This research will involve a combination of
geometry and analysis with applications to other areas of mathematics. It turns
out that the theory of automorphic forms, a subject arising originally from
number theory often as generating functions for arithmetic functions, has many
applications to other areas. This theory is one of the main focuses of this
research.
