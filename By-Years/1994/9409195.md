9409195 Fiebig Research in theoretical particle physics will involve the use of
numerical simulations of lattice field theory to study aspects of the strong
nuclear force between nuclei and mesons. Two models are examined in detail. The
first is a formulation of quantum electrodynamics (the theory that describes the
interaction between electrons and light) in three dimensional space-time. The
second utilizes the results of the study of the first in formulating a similar
analysis of quantum chromodynamics (the theory of the strong nuclear force) in
four dimensional space-time. The results of the research will enhance our
understanding of the forces among the constituents of atomic nuclei. ***
