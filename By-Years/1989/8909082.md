To systematically investigate the existence of strain gradients in pseudomorphic
InGaAs grown on GaAs using molecular beam epitaxy (MB). It is possible to
simultaneously lattice-match InA1As with InGaAs and energy-match InA1As with
A1GaAs. This permits a test structure where the bandgap discontinuity is
independent of the strained interface. In the first experiment, several
InGaAs/InA1As/GaAs single quantum well structures will be grown using MBE. The
location of the quantum well within the strained region will be varied such that
the quantum well serves as a probe to measure the strain. Several sets of
samples will be grown with different thicknesses of the strained layer. The
second experiment duplicates the first except the strained region will be kept
substantially below the minimum critical thickness. This permits all of the test
structures to be grown in the same sample for comparison purposes. After growth,
the strain will be measured by using photoluminescence to detect strain-induced
band shifts. If the hypothesis of strain gradients in pseudomorphic InGaAs
material is confirmed, then this project will have significant impact on the
design and fabrication of pseudomorphic MODFET (HEMT) devices.
