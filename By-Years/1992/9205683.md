The Department of Mathematics at the University of Michigan will purchase 20
Sparc workstations, two printers and needed networking which will be dedicated
to support of research in the mathematical sciences. The equipment will be used
for several research projects in algebra, combinatorics, scientific computation,
analysis and computational geometry/topology. Primarily the equipment being
purchased will be used by graduate students and junior faculty working in these
areas in collaboration with senior faculty and additionally by three senior
faculty.
