Description: Under this project support is provided for participation of four
U.S. scientists in the Indo- U.S. Symposium on Neuroceptor Transduction
Mechanisms, planned for January 23 to 28, 1991 at the All India Institute of
Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in New Delhi, India. The main topic of the symposium
will be the receptor-mediated signal transductions which are one of the
important events in nervous system function. New advances which were recently
made regarding the structure, function and regulation of G-proteins in nervous
system will be examined. The meeting is planned to integrate specific
presentations, by means of discussions and workshops, so that a synthesis of
recent advances can be made. The chairman of the Indian organizing committee is
Dr.A. Sharma. Scope: This symposium is the 4th in the Indo-U.S. neuroscience
series. These bilateral meetings are oriented to exchanges of information and
presentations of data relavent to recent advances in fundamental mechanistic
neurobiology. The proposed meeting will help nurture the growth of neurosciences
in India and identify emerging areas where useful collaborative research can be
started. The area of the meeting is of major current interest in the U.S. and
the meeting is likely to help the field in the U.S. as well as in India.
