Software plays an increasingly significant role in the infrastructure supporting
transportation, manufacturing, entertainment, agriculture, and government. The
safety and security of this infrastructure depends critically on the level of
rigor with which software-based systems are designed and verified. Formal
modeling and verification technology has made significant advances in the last
two decades. Techniques like model checking and theorem proving are now used in
both the hardware and software industries. Formal techniques are also
increasingly being used in scientific modeling, for example in systems biology
and in the engineering of complex cyber-physical systems. The biggest challenge
facing this technology is the lack of trained users and developers of this
technology. The annual Summer School in Formal Techniques addresses this
training gap by exposing students to cutting-edge research and technology. The
project's novelties are in backing the lectures with hands-on laboratories where
the students gain first-hand experience with the technology. To gauge the
project's impact, the program will collect valuable feedback from the students
on the impact of the summer school lectures on their education and research. The
data has shown a strong indication that the lectures cover material that is new
and deeply useful to the students, and the laboratory work builds confidence in
the use of specific formal techniques. The school also helps to build a social
network among the students from which they can draw motivation and support.

The lectures in these schools cover the spectrum of formal techniques; e.g.,
static analysis, dynamic analysis, model checking, theorem proving, invariant
generation, program synthesis, software specification, program verification, and
compositional verification, as well as applications in computer security,
systems biology, and cyber-physical systems. The lectures at the summer school
span a variety of advanced verification techniques, problem domains, and state-
of-the-art tools from both academia and industry. The first-hand use of these
tools in interactive laboratory sessions is helping the students integrate these
technologies into their own research. It is also helping seed a community around
these individual tools.
