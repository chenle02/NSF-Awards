****Nontechnical abstract****&lt;br/&gt;Innovations in materials are central to
enabling new technology and enhancing human well-being in a changing world.
Discovery of new materials and the novel phenomena they engender lies at the
heart of many of these innovations. The emerging materials and their associated
phenomena are increasingly complex, so success at this endeavor requires the
coordinated effort of a team of scientists and technologists that bring a range
of talents to bear. The Ohio State University Center for Emergent Materials
(CEM) realizes innovative science and complex materials discovery by engaging
researchers from diverse backgrounds and disciplines in an enabling and
collaborative environment. The Center is creating novel materials that build on,
and control, opposing, but delicately balanced tendencies and internal pressures
within carefully constructed materials to create new phases of matter and
produce novel magnetism. Features of single-atom-thick materials created by
Center researchers are tuned by adding selected atoms to their surfaces in
controlled patterns that produce remarkable one-dimensional interfaces whose
properties are under exploration. The Center is a leader in using the magnetic
properties of electrons to transmit magnetic information using innovative
methods based on flow of heat and coherent motions of arrays of magnetic
electrons. The Center is using innovative approaches to ensure that its
scientific endeavors benefit from the contributions of women and
underrepresented groups. The training and education of young scientists is
integrated into the Center's scientific research improving its ability to
recruit, retain and teach diverse undergraduates, graduates, and postdoctoral
researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****Technical abstract****&lt;br/&gt;The
Center is creating novel materials that tune the delicate interplay between
interactions arising from electronic charge and interactions between an
electron's spin and its motion to enable topological phases, quantum phase
transitions and novel magnetism. This tuning will be achieved by using heavier
elements where spin interacts strongly with electronic motion and will exploit
modification of the material's chemistry, structure and internal pressures
imposed by a neighboring material. The Center is also creating new, single-atom
thick 2D materials composed of heavier atoms that allow tuning of electronic
properties by covalently attaching atoms on the layer's surface to enable novel
electronic phases and spin physics. Delicately controlled spatial patterning of
these sheets creates the exciting possibility of novel 1D interfaces. The Center
will open a new frontier in transmission of spin by pushing into the nonlinear
regime in which the characteristic properties depend on how hard spins are
driven by studying the behavior of these currents passing through materials
whose magnetism is spatially modulated. This nonlinear response could allow spin
transport science to move beyond diffusive spin currents to enable novel
approaches to spin manipulation and control for next generation spintronics.
Undergrad labs created by Center faculty that are based on their research topics
help prepare the next scientific generation. Center faculty are participants in
the newly established and externally funded Masters-to-Ph.D. minority Bridge
Program that increases the pool of qualified faculty candidates.
