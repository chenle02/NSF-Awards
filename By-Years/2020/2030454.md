Early pathogen detection and disease diagnosis is key to preventing the
exponential spread of infectious diseases such as COVID-19. If not detected and
contained early, the pathogen not only affects local communities but can cross
national and international borders to become a global pandemic. Existing
approaches for early pathogen detection can delay diagnosis during a pandemic.
These identify regions of interest specific to a pathogen type/sub-type and
amplify these regions in target specimens (if present), making them inapplicable
to unknown pathogens. Another limitation is the dependence on the design of
primer chemistry, which is a complex, error-prone, and time-consuming process
that can delay pathogen detection in the early stages of a pandemic. Further, it
is also important to track the accumulation of novel mutations to identify
disease hotspots, monitor virus evolution, guide immunization efforts, and
inform public healthcare plans. It has been estimated that RNA coronaviruses
such as&lt;br/&gt;SARS-CoV-2 can accumulate 30 substitutions/year. The proposed
approach will enable design for fast and accurate whole-genome sequencing (WGS)
analysis pipelines for strain typing and phylogenetic classification. The
proposed real-time diagnosis pipeline can potentially serve as a "digital
sniffer" and be used to detect potential outbreaks
early.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers propose to build real-time diagnosis
pipelines for early pathogen detection using the portable Oxford Nanopore
Sequencer MinION. The read-until functionality of the sequencer can be used to
adaptively target sequencing towards genome regions with low-coverage and
accelerate whole-genome sequencing of unknown pathogens. The ultimate goal of
this project is to develop point-of-care mobile rapid pathogen diagnosis and
analysis. This will be realized by developing novel hardware-acceleration
techniques and algorithms for quick classification of viral/bacterial pathogens,
followed by strain detection and epidemiology analysis. The proposed techniques
include hardware-software co-design for squiggle-space classification
algorithms, refined indexes, exploiting real-time feedback feature of MinION
sequencing devices (read-until and run-until), and variant calling to achieve
rapid analysis. The project will also explore direct RNA sequencing without
reserve transcriptase step to reduce library-preparation
time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
