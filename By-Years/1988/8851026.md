Local industry, government, and college personnel will work with the Haywood
County Schools to develop curriculum materials and activities which will
integrate local waste control and environmental issues into science and
mathematics classes for grades 4-12. Teachers will be trained to use the
materials through inservice programs, visits to industrial and municipal sites,
and interaction with industry and governmental scientists and engineers. When
the materials are put into use in the classes, students will also be involved in
site visits, external activities, and research projects in addition to in-class
use. The dual objectives are to teach the students about these real problems and
to show them how mathematics and science knowledge are important in dealing with
community and societal concerns. Cost sharing by the partners will total 28% of
the NSF funding.
