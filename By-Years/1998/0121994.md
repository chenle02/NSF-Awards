ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Earthquakes and Tectonics of the Pacific
Northwest:&lt;br/&gt;An Educational Outreach for Teachers, Students and
Communities&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project supports development of an online
geological exhibit and a visiting geologist program as part of an educational
outreach initiative for students, teachers and the public by The Burke Museum of
Natural History and Culture of the University of Washington. The initiative
consists of three integrated and complementary programs: 1) A traveling exhibit
entitled in Earthquakes and Tectonics of the Pacific Northwest, 2) a visiting
geologist program to interact personally with local schools and citizen groups,
and 3) a new generation Internet exhibit entitled, Northwest Origins: Geologic
Evolution of the Pacific Northwest that explores the initiative topics and
promotes engaging visualization of the large-scale tectonic processes that have
created the Pacific Northwest over geologic time. The initiative is in response
to the recent major earthquake that broadly affected
residents&lt;br/&gt;throughout western Washington and Oregon. Personal
experience with a major seismic event has greatly heightened public interest in
tectonic processes active in the Pacific Northwest. The goals of the project are
to better educate citizens and students about the geologic events
that&lt;br/&gt;create earthquakes, the different tectonic settings in which
earthquakes occur, the role these tectonic processes have played in creating the
lands of the Pacific Northwest over geologic time, and the significance of
ongoing research programs. &lt;br/&gt;
