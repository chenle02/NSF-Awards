This research is part of a large effort in the Hall A experimental research area
at Jefferson Laboratory. Our scientific interest is to help constrain the so-
called "equation of state" of nuclear matter, a critical ingredient to
understanding the makeup of dense stars. We do this by scattering a beam of
polarized electrons from the nuclei of lead atoms, where the dependence of the
scattering probability on polarization direction tells us the average
distribution of neutrons in this large, spherical nucleus. The contribution
funded here is for a precision apparatus that would tell us the degree of
polarization of the electron beam. Such an apparatus is also critical for a
large number of different experiments in Hall A, and is consequently a service
to the nuclear physics community. The scientific impact on the nuclear physics
and nuclear astrophysics communities is very large, and the work is carried out
with a number of students in various disciplines, at different levels.
Consequently, students gain training not only in nuclear physics, but in
magnetic transport applications and precision engineering, both as
undergraduates and graduate students.
