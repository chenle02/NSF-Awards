The Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the Nevis Laboratories
of Columbia University provides ten undergraduate students each summer the
opportunity to participate in research on topics in experimental high energy
physics and particle astrophysics. Two of the students will spend the summer
conducting research at the European Organization for Nuclear Research in
Switzerland. In addition to participating in research with an mentor, the REU
students will gain knowledge of and practice technical communications, research
collaboration and networking, and responsible conduct of research. By the end of
the program, every student will have presented the results of the work in a
final talk and a research paper.

This REU site will have a number of broader impacts with its focus on providing
research opportunities to undergraduates to help prepare them for future
science, technology, engineering, and mathematics careers. The site has a strong
plan to recruit undergraduate students from groups underrepresented in physics
and from non-research institutions. The project is informed by an on-going
evaluation.
