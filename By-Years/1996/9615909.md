Artificial neural networks based upon probabilistic models have been recognized
as an important approach to learning, information processing, and problem
solving. This research seeks to develop a new neural model with an internal
probabilistic learning framework. A number of improvements over pervious
probabilistic neural networks are devised. First, prior rules can be built into
the neural network and used in conjunction with the data for posterior
probability density estimation. Second, lateral inhibition following subsumption
relationship between patterns is introduced for improving probability estimates.
Third, the backpropagation learning heuristic is applied to optimize the
interconnection weights and the system parameters. Forth, a minimal description
length criterion is added to penalize complex structures for maximizing
generalization. Finally, a weight Euclidean distance function is used so that if
the distance function involves multiple attributes then each will carry a
different weight reflecting the degree of importance that can then be optimized.
