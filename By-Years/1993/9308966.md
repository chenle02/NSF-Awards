This research explores three aspects of algorithmic techniques, partitioning
schemes and fault-tolerance schemes of parallel algorithms by designing and
implementing several classes of algorithms on the CM-5 parallel machine. The
motivation for this project is in developing a methodology for the design and
implementation of fast, efficient, and robust parallel algorithms for scalable
multicomputers. In the context of algorithmic techniques, the results of the
research enable the designer to choose between synchronous and asynchronous
algorithms, and allow the designer to use different techniques, such as
iterative and divide-and-conquer, at different levels of a parallel algorithm.
The research also identifies the tradeoffs among various partitioning schemes
for a given application. In the context of fault-tolerance techniques, the
research shows how to exploit the fault-tolerance inherent in iterative
algorithms, and devise suitable fault-tolerance schemes for applications such as
solving partial differential equations. Preliminary results, obtained from
implementations on the CM-5 machine, indicate that asynchronous iterative
algorithms achieve speedups over their synchronous counterparts, and that
several divide-and-conquer algorithms can be implemented efficiently on the CM-5
parallel machine. As part of this project, many subproblems that are specific to
the CM-5 system are formulated and solved.
