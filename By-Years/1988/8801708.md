This research seeks to exploit the multiple magnetic resonance properties of
materials to produce selective projection images. Unlike existing cross-
sectional images, these projections will include the entire volume of interest
in a single image, making them ideal for screening. They will selectively
visualize the material of interest, such as a specific organ or lesion, while
cancelling all others. The objectives of this research include: (1) analytic and
experimental studies to determine the optimum procedure, using magnetic
resonance imaging, for creating an isolated projection image of important
materials of interest, while cancelling all others; (2) determination of the
data acquisition and data processing parameters that maximize the signal to
noise ratio of the resultant selective image; and (3) verification of the
analyses using test phantoms. This project will advance substantially the art of
magnetic resonance imaging for medical and other purposes.
