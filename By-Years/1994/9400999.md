9400999 Hinkkanen This award supports mathematical research on problems arising
in the study of complex dynamical systems, Mobius groups and their topological
counterparts. The work focuses on complex functions of a complex variables and
the domains on which these functions are defined. The first set of problems
concerns sets of rational functions and the semigroups they determine via
composition. These semigroups are natural extensions dynamical systems derived
from iterations of a single function. The theory leads to a great many
dynamical, combinatorial and algebraic questions and exhibits a rich structure
involving properties and dynamical behavior of the set of normality and the
Julia set. another reason for studying these semigroups is that certain
polynomial semigroups are closely connected to moduli spaces of discrete Mobius
groups. The dynamical systems point of view offers a new tool for studying and
understanding such moduli spaces. A second line of investigation involves the
question of characterizing a convergence group on the circle in terms of fixed
points, as well as with the problem of determining under what circumstances a
convergence group in the plane is topologically conjugate to a Mobius group. In
dimensions two and higher, there are a considerable number of convergence
groups, not all of which are conjugate to Mobius groups. It is important that
efforts be made to determine the constraints necessary to guarantee that a group
have the same topological properties as a Mobius group. Classical function
theory has introduced geometric techniques which have proved to have far wider
applicability than first imagined. The subject exploits the interplay between
geometric interpretation with powerful analytic techniques to yield some of the
most complete mathematical results in the field of analysis. In this project,
variational techniques and geometric reasoning are expected to lead to results
of valuable physical significance. ***
