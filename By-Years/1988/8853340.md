This project supports a hands-on experience for students in this institution's
program in Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM). Using the equipment in the
CIM lab, students learn how to apply existing state-of-the-art technology to a
real life manufacturing environment. The project builds on an already existing
automated manufacturing cell. Two computers and several work stations are linked
to the cell. Students experiment with all processes in the manufacturing cycle -
production forecasting through design, manufacturing and shipping. The unique
aspect of this facility is that students interact with a common data base to
coordinate all production processes using real machine tools. This award is
being matched by an greater than equal sum from the grantee.
