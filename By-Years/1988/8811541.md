Within the field of ergonomics this research project is concerned with job
related physical performance tests (JRPPT). The overall objective is to review
the existing JRPPT in use, evaluate their acceptability using established
criteria, and develop a set of improved JRPPT for important applications. The
research includes the identification of a representative sample of current JRPPT
used in the workplace, observe and examine current JRPPT, data collection based
upon a six point criteria, analyzing the data using task analysis, medical and
physical evaluation. Such testing is urgently needed because of the increasing
number of older workers who must have jobs suited to their capabilities and
physical limitations, equal employment opportunities must be made available to
women and minorities for jobs formerly filled primarily by males, and
rehabilitation of workers who have experienced medical and health problems such
as cardiac impairment.
