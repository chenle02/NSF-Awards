This proposal is to defray room and board costs for participants attending the
West Coast Regional Developmental Biology Conference in 1988. The conference is
to be held at Asilomar, California, on March 6- 9. The meeting will include 24
invited speakers and a formal poster session in which all attendees will be
invited to present their results and ideas. The invited speakers include
professors, postdoctoral fellows and graduate students; three additional
graduate student speakers will be chosen at the meeting based on their poster
presentations. The general topic of the meeting is specification of cell type
and pattern; this will be subdivided into five sessions: 1. Specification of
cell type and pattern by intracellular factors. 2. Specification of cell type
and pattern by cell-cell contact or proximity. 3. Specification of cell type and
pattern by diffusible factors. 4. Genetic approaches to cell type and pattern
specification. 5.Cell type-specific gene regulation. These meetings have
provided important opportunities for developmental biologists at all levels to
meet with their colleagues within the region.
