This is a joint effort between two universities for rapid prototyping of mobile
computers. The projects involve teams of students who over the course of a
semester design the hardware, software, and packaging of mobile computer
systems, and fabricate prototypes by combining standard electronic parts with
custom fabricated cases and interconnect harnesses. This project focusses
primarily on mobile computing for the diagnosis of telecommunications networks.
Mobile computer systems that include stationary and mobile computers, interface
devices, and software, are being designed and fabricated for these applications.
The project goal is to systematize the prototyping process in several ways: by
providing an integrated design tool that can simultaneously represent
electronic, thermal, and mechanical constraints; by providing modular template
architectures for mobile computers; and by reporting on experience in the co-
design of software, mobile hardware, and stationary hardware in a mobile
computing system.
