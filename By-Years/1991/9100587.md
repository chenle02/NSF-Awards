This workshop is a two-day forum designed to bring together leading researchers
from industry and academia to identify the crucial research needs in electronics
manufacturing. The results of the workshop can be used by other members of the
research community to focus their efforts in areas of greatest potential benefit
and by sponsors to encourage research in areas of highest priority. Workshop
results will be disseminated through a final report summarizing the workshop
presentations and recommendations. In addition, articles summarizing
recommendations will be submitted for publication to organizations such as the
Institution of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE), the Institution of
Industrial Engineers (IIE), American Society of Engineering Education (ASEE),
and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).
