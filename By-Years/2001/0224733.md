The objective of this project is to improve recombinant expression systems. The
major goals are to discover and characterize pathways that facilitate protein
folding and subunit assembly in hyperthermophiles. The components of these
pathways will be inserted into recombinant host cells to preempt induction of
stress responses during recombinant expression, and to enhance the stabilization
and solubilization of recombinant protein. Building on the approach and findings
of the investigators previous research, the specific objectives are: (1) to
determine the functions of interacting proteins encoded by the 23 genes in the
heat shock regulon of the hyperthermophile, Pyrococcus furiosus, (2) to identify
functional complexes of thermostable heat shock proteins and express them in E.
coli, yeast and mammalian cells to enhance the durability of these cells, and
(3) to determine the effects of combinations of chaperonins on high level
recombinant expression of proteins in intact cells as well as cell-free
transcription-translation systems.
