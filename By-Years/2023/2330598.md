This conference will discuss the general topic of monodromy. Monodromy occurs
when a mathematical object varies smoothly over a space, appearing identical at
a point and each nearby point, but traveling around a loop in the space causes
the object to twist around. Monodromy occurs throughout mathematics and
specifically can be seen in the M¨obius strip: each small piece is an ordinary
piece of paper, but traveling around the circle causes the paper to flip around
to the opposite side. This conference will provide a historical perspective,
recount current results, and look forwad to future developments in monodromy.

The main theme of the conference will be the key role of monodromy in all its
incarnations: classical and l-adic, local and global, arithmetic and geometric,
applications of it in number theory and algebraic geometry, and its connections
to group theory and representation theory. In recent years there have been a
number of exciting developments in this area. These include the complete
classification of the finite (almost quasi) simple groups that occur as
monodromy groups of hypergeometric sheaves by Katz, Rojas-Le´on and Tiep, the
proof of many cases of the Putman-Wieland conjecture by Landesmann and Litt, the
calculation of Tannakian monodromy groups in new settings by many mathematicians
and their applications to generalizations of Shafarevich’s conjecture by
Lawrence and Sawin, the proof of a relative analogue of Grothendieck’s period
conjecture for a family of varieties by Bakker and Tsimerman, and the proof of
the unbounded denominators conjecture by Calegari, Dimitrov, and Tang. The
conference will discuss developments related to these and other manifestations
of monondromy in mathematics. Conference website
