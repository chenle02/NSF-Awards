The main objective of this project is to develop a "point design" for an
advanced MIMD computer system capable of achieving at least 100 TeraOPS
performance with technology that will definitely become feasible in less than a
decade. This design will take advantage of free-space optical technologies to
produce a one-dimensional building block (BB) that implements efficiently a
large, almost fully-connected system of processors. In addition to having a
scaleable architecture, our BB is also technology scaleable, and therefore the
number of contained processors in the BB could increase dramatically with
expected improvements in optical technologies. A simple two-dimensional
structure is proposed for the complete system, where the aforementioned one-
dimensional BB is extended into two dimensions. With readily available
technology, the word-wide optical interconnection network can be viewed as a
mesh of relatively short plastic bars to which interfaces to processor cards are
attached. Each processor card contains eight processors interconnected locally
with an electronic crossbar. Taking advantage of higher-speed optical
technologies, all eight processors share the same optical interface to the two-
dimensional system. Its high-level architecture is also scaleable, because it
can be extended straight forwardly for any number of dimensions larger than two.
