Building on the American Indian Higher Education Consortium (AIHEC) Virtual
Library Project (http://www.communitytechnology.org/aihec_vl/), this project is
organizing and convening two task force meetings and a larger national
conference that will result in a plan of action for coordinating and leveraging
the research, development, and training activities involving digital libraries
and advanced technologies within AIHEC and the related activities evolving in
the community of grantees of NSF's National Science, Mathematics, Engineering,
and Technology Education Digital Library (NSDL) program. Participants in the
conferences will include faculty and administrators from tribal colleges,
librarians, technology experts, experts in Native American culture and learning,
and leaders of selected NSDL projects.

Goals of the project include:

-- determining and implementing strategies for making the NSDL more accessible,
meaningful, and useful to American Indians; -- providing opportunities for
tribal colleges to participate in and inform the NSDL during its early
development and into the future; and -- creating and extending metadata and
classification schemes that incorporate the cultures and views of various
American Indians and Alaska Natives.

AIHEC is conducting the project in collaboration with the Alliance for Community
Technology at the University of Michigan's School of Information, which has
supported the development of the AIHEC Virtual Library with funding from the
W.K. Kellogg Foundation.
