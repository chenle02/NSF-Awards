9354104 Sowder This is a four-year project at $751,309 at San Diego State
University to produce mathematics content course modules for use in teacher
preparation and teacher enhancement for elementary and middle school teachers of
mathematics. The project will develop modules, including the use of CD-ROM
technology, that focus on providing a deep understanding of the mathematics the
participants ar expected to teach. Modules address: number sense with whole and
rational numbers, proportional reasoning, measuring, spatial sense and geometry,
exploring data, chance, patterns and functions, and mathematical change. The
materials will be developed to provide course instructors the opportunity to
model the types of instructional delivery expected of teachers in grades K-8,
both in their classroom and through the inclusion of video of student interviews
and classroom episodes from grade K-8 situations. The project will be done in
southern California, and modules will be available nationwide upon completion.
the modules will be in software and CD-ROM format allowing instructor capability
to modify to special needs. Cost sharing by SDSU, school districts, and other
local projects is approximately 25% of the total project cost.
