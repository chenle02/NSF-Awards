Scattering theory is motivated physically by a desire to understand and control
the propagation of waves such as sound or light waves. Moreover, measurements of
waves can be used in the identification of objects or perturbations. The latter
use inspires inverse scattering theory. The project will study several such
inverse problems--one is the problem of determining a set with analytic boundary
in Euclidean space from information about the scattering matrix in a very
limited number of directions, and another is the problem of determining a radial
potential from its resonances. Resonances are poles of certain meromorphic
functions and are, in some sense, analogous to eigenvalues. Another problem
involves further understanding the distribution of resonances in Euclidean
scattering. Other projects involve manifolds with infinite cylindrical ends. In
particular, a goal is to improve our understanding of how the geometric
structure of such manifolds is reflected in analytic objects such as the
scattering matrix or the set of resonances.

Radar, sonar, and medical imaging provide examples of inverse scattering theory
in practical use. Resonances are of interest to physicists and chemists, for
whom a resonance corresponds to a metastable state, containing information about
both the frequency and the rate of decay. The class of manifolds with infinite
cylindrical ends include waveguides, which are variously used in modeling
semiconductors and the ocean. Thus advances in the mathematical understanding of
these problems may lead to advances in other disciplines.
