This work will develop and validate simple techniques for the performance-based
seismic design and rehabilitation of multistory buildings. Design techniques
will utilize a variant of the Capacity Spectrum Method known as Yield Point
Spectra. Simple graphical techniques for determining combinations of strength
and stiffness to achieve arbitrary performance objectives will be validated.
Various strategies for addressing higher modes in design will be investigated to
determine those for which response amplitudes are predicted well using a single
mode analogy. Advanced multivariate statistical techniques will be applied to
identify mode shapes in the results obtained from nonlinear dynamic analyses.
Improved techniques for estimating peak interstory drifts will be
evaluated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A laboratory module will be developed for use by
the 22 undergraduate institutions nationwide that are acquiring benchtop shaking
tables through the NSF CCLI program. Groups of students will design, build,
instrument, and test small multistory frames. Data acquired will be post-
processed to identify fundamental response characteristics. The performance of
the system as well as the utility of the design methodology will be
assessed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
