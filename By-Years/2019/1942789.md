The ability to collect and analyze datasets has tremendous benefits to society.
However, such benefits must not come at the price of privacy. This calls for
secure and efficient methods for computing on private data that can resolve the
conflict between the benefits of computation and the risk of privacy loss.The
powerful paradigm of secure multiparty computation (MPC) can enable computation
over datasets of mutually distrusting individuals and organizations while still
preserving their privacy. Significant research advances in recent years have
brought MPC closer than ever to practice. Nevertheless, many existing and
emerging applications demand new efficiency and resiliency properties that are
outside the reach of known solutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To meet these
demands, this project initiates two new lines of research in the study of MPC.
First, to answer calls for MPC-as-a-service and MPC deployments in volunteer-
based networks, this project develops new methods to enable large-scale
computations. Second, to improve the resilience of MPC in strongly adversarial
environments, this project develops new models and techniques to prevent data
exfiltration even in the face of tampering attacks over protocol communication
and computation. The project has outreach activities to raise awareness about
security and cryptography in the greater Baltimore
area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
