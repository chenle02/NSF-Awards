Howard University and Santa Clara University will host the First International
Conference on Amorphous and Crystalline Silicon Carbide and Related Materials.
The primary sponsors are the National Science Foundation and IEEE Washington
Section.Electron Device Group. This conference will bring together distinguished
American and foreign researchers in the growth, characterization, and
fabrication of crystalline and amorphous SiC devices and related materials.
These workers will present their current research and exchange new ideas on
various approaches to current problems in the realization of wide bandgap
devices and circuits.
