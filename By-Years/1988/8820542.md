As radiant energy diffuses from a star's interior through its surface layers, it
interacts with the constituent gases --atoms, ions, and molecules -- in those
surface layers and produces a host of absorption and emission lines. These lines
constitute a signature that is accessible to terrestrial observation and
analysis, telling us a great deal about the temperature, density, and
composition structure of stellar atmospheres. This is a particularly rich field
of study in the case of cool giant stars, for their light is characterized by an
abundance of spectral lines. The Principal Investigator (PI) proposes to use
millisecond time resolution spectrophotometry in the observation of cool, bright
giant stars during lunar occultations. The goal is to measure the mean depths of
the formation of spectral features in the extended atmospheres of these stars
and in the inner layers of the dust shells surrounding some of them.
Furthermore, the PI will measure the angular diameters of these stars and derive
the dependence of angular diameter on absorption features and the stars' colors.
