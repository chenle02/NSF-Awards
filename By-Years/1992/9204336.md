The principal investigator will study evolution equations in differential
geometry. In particular he will study the Ricci flow and Yamabe flow.
Singularities in the solutions of the flow problems will be one of the main
focal points of the research. The principal investigator will try to use blow up
methods to study these singularities. This award will support research in the
general area of differential geometry and global analysis. Differential geometry
is the study of the relationship between the geometry of a space and analytic
concepts defined on the space. Global analysis is the study of the overall
geometric and topological properties of a space by piecing together local
information. Applications of these areas of mathematics in other sciences
include the structure of complicated molecules, liquid-gas boundaries, and the
large scale structure of the universe.
