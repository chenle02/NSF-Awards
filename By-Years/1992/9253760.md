This is a 1992 Presidential Faculty Fellow Award (PFF). The optical and
electronic properties of compound semiconductors and their respective
heterostructure systems are crucial for future high speed electronic
optoelectronic, light-emitting display, and solar energy conversation
applications. In order to exploit these properties fully, the five year research
effort will be concentrated in two general areas of interest, namely, epitaxial
crystal growth and basic materials properties of ternary alloys and
heterostructures that contain combinations of the Column III elements Al, Ga,
and In, and a single Column V element P, As, or Sb, and the device physics of
vertical cavity quantum well lasers, modulators, switches, and optical
interconnects.
