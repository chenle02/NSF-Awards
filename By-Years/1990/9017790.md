The principal investigator will attempt to determine the solution
characteristics of highly charged cations in peralkaline, peraluminous, and
metaluminous granitic to syenitic melts. The objectives are to establish a
hierarchy of interactions of highly charged cations and network-forming
modifying cations. To be determined are the magic angle spinning nuclear
magnetic resonance and vibrational spectra of various glasses, the saturation
surfaces of unary oxides containing one or more highly charges cations (as a
function of alkali/alumina ratio), and the role of various fluid components in
affecting stability and coordination states of highly charged cations. Overall
this work will increase geologist' understanding of the complex interactions
that exist within certain kinds of magmas.
