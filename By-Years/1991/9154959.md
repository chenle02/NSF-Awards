The University of Texas @ San Antonio will initiate an eight-week, commuter
Young Scholars project in Mathematics which will offer enrichment activities for
2,400 precollege students entering grades 7-12. The first-year component will
include Logic and Its Application to Mathematics, Problem Solving, Engineering,
and Computer Science. The second-year component will include Algebraic
Structures, Problem Solving, and Physics. The third-year component will include
Probability and Statistics, Problem Solving, and Technical Writing. Scholars are
divided into groups of 20, determined mainly by school grade level. Each group
follows its own class and laboratory schedule.
