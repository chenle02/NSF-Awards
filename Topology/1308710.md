There are three sections to the proposal, each the continuation of a long
standing collaboration. Lee Mosher and the PI have short, medium and long term
goals regarding the outer automorphism group Out(F) of the finite rank free
group F. These include proving that subgroups of Out(F) are either virtually
abelian or have infinite dimensional second bounded cohomology and developing an
analog for Out(F) of the Masur-Minsky summation formula that applies to mapping
class groups. Mark Feighn and the PI have been focusing on the conjugacy problem
for Out(F) in the case that the elements in question have polynomial growth. The
intent is to complete this important special case and then to the solve the full
conjugacy problem by merging the techniques from the polynomially growing case
with those already developed to solve the exponentially growing case. John
Franks and the PI use relative mapping class group methods to study the dynamics
of diffeomorphisms of surfaces. One goal is to to extend their work on zero
entropy area preserving diffeomorphisms of the sphere to surfaces of higher
genus.

This project concerns the properties of, and the relationships between, three
important groups: the outer automorphism group of a free group, the mapping
class group of a surface, and the diffeomorphism group of a surface. Topological
and geometric methods are used to study dynamical systems and in return, ideas
from dynamics are used to formulate and prove fundamental topological and
geometric properties of outer automorphisms and mapping classes. There is
currently a great deal of interest in the large scale geometry of the group of
outer automorphisms of the free group and this proposal is well situated to make
substantial progress on this front.
