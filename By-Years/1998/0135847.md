&lt;br/&gt;Better known as laughing gas, nitrous oxide (N2O) is also an
extremely important greenhouse gas, contributing to global warming. Soil
nitrogen transformations that lead to production of N2O are extremely dynamic
after wildfire in forest ecosystems. This project will examine these dynamics
using a recent wildfire near Flagstaff, Arizona. Two distinct groups of bacteria
produce N2O in soils. Because these bacteria are sensitive to different
environmental conditions, understanding their relative contributions to N2O
production is important in predicting future N2O fluxes. Stable isotopes of
nitrogen and oxygen in N2O have been proposed as signatures of the particular
microbial processes responsible for N2O production, but this idea has never been
explicitly tested in the field. This work will involve undergraduate students in
research using the natural dynamics of N2O production after fire to test to what
extent these isotopic 'fingerprints' reliably indicate the bacterial groups
producing N2O evolved from soil.
