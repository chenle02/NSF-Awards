This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I research project will explore
the possibilities for an affordable and fully accessible network that provides
clear specification interpretation tools and the means to document key design
characteristics. The effort has the potential to provide advancements that will
completely transform century-old practices. This will, in turn, transform the
Extended Enterprise-and specifically Production Systems-because the root of
successful attainment of quality, product reliability and integrity, production
planning, and scheduling is the assurance that all components fully meet the
design intent. The ability to achieve such innovations as efficient flow lines,
just-in-time inventory practices, and a fully integrated supply chain are
dependent on material and components that are near-perfect from the beginning
and remain that way over the life of the product. Achievement of the
Collaborative Product Definition Management research vision will enable
realization of these essential objectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful
this solution will reduce the time and effort to generate product
specifications. By meeting design intent products will go to market after a
shorter development time and at a lower cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
