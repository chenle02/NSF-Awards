This funding supports the development of an advanced Robotics and Microcomputer
Control Laboratory for the improvement of the undergraduate curriculum in
mechanical engineering. This laboratory supports courses which familiarize the
students with microcomputer interfacing with scientific instruments and their
control applications. The equipment purchase included three RHINO robots and ten
experimental stations, each equipped with microcomputers, analog/digital boards,
oscilloscopes and other auxiliary equipment. This award is being matched by an
equal amount from the principal investigator's institution.
