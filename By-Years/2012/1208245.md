Recent advances in robot platforms have outpaced our ability to effectively
program robots to accomplish useful tasks, often in complex environments that
they share with humans. In order for flexible, general purpose robots to become
widespread e.g., in teaching skills to children, assisting the elderly, there
must be a way of interacting with them beyond programming. Teaching by
demonstration offers a potentially powerful and practical approach to realizing
the promise of large scale personal robotics in a wide range of applications. In
teaching by demonstration, the expert (human), demonstrates the task on
different hardware than what the apprentice or student (robot) uses.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project aims to develop visual feature-based methods
that allow robots to teach humans and learn from them by unifying apprenticeship
learning, learning by demonstration (or by imitation) and teaching humans,
taking into account the differences between experts and apprentices. The
resulting system will be evaluated on a PR2 robot (mostly on grasping and
manipulation tasks). The scientific advances resulting from the project in
learning from demonstration and imitation learning, both general techniques with
broad applicability, will greatly simplify the programming of robots which would
make it easier for non-expert users to perform this important task which
currently requires considerable expertise in robotics as well as computer
science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the research include
development of new robotics curricula, enhanced opportunities for research-based
interdisciplinary training at the intersection of computer vision, machine
learning, and robotics, outreach activities (including participation in a public
school robotics instruction program). All of the results of the research,
including publications, open-source software and datasets, will be made freely
available to the larger scientific and academic community.
