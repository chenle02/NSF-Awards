This award provides support for a team of U.S. investigators under the
direction of Dr. George Hendrey of the Brookhaven National Laboratory to travel
to New Zealand over a two year period to work with researchers under the
leadership of Dr. Bruce Campbell and Dr. Paul Newton at government facilities in
Palmerston North, New Zealand. Government and university investigators in New
Zealand have proposed establishing a free- air carbon dioxide enrichment (FACE)
experiment to investigate the effects of CO2 enrichment of the atmosphere on a
grassland. Increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is expected to result in
changes in terrestrial plant production and carbon storage that may exert
feedback regulation on the rate of increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide. The
team under Dr. Hendrey has collaborated in the conception of this experiment and
will design the FACE apparatus, build electronic control assemblies, erect the
apparatus in New Zealand, and provide technical support and training to insure
the success of the operation. The U.S. group has developed the technological
means for maintaining close control over carbon dioxide concentrations in an
open field setting without any form of containment. Support for this project in
New Zealand comes from the Public Good Science Fund under the direction of the
Ministry of Research, Science and Technology (MORST).
