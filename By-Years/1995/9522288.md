This is a project to develop and use a dynamical model for studying the growth
and decay of the stormtime ring current. The ring current is a complex region of
the magnetosphere in which particle transport and loss, magnetic and electric
fields, and plasma wave effects are critical processes. The investigators have
developed a guiding center simulation model and a transport model of ring
current ions the test the understanding of fundamental mechanisms involved in
the formation of the stormtime ring current. The models are able to
quantitatively account for the increase in energy content associated with
magnetic storms. This study will build upon the existing model to gain a better
understanding of the unresolved physical processes responsible for growth and
decay of the ring current. The modeling efforts will determine the role of
electrons, assess the stability of the ring current against ion cyclotron wave
growth, investigate the role of the waves in ring current decay, and quantify
the relative importance of ionospheric and solar wind plasmas in the ring
current. The simulation results will be applied to observations obtained by the
Combined Release and Radiation Effects Satellite.
