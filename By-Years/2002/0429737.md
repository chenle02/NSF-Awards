Research: New Directions for Advanced VLSI Manufacturability
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;As VLSI technology advances into ever
shrinking design regimes and growing complexity, it is increasingly difficult to
maintain adequate verification, process windows, and manufacturing yields. This
project will investigate several newly critical issues at the interface between
layout design and manufacturability, including automatic&lt;br/&gt;layout flows
for phase-shifting masks, area fill synthesis for yield improvement, gate-length
biasing for leakage variability control, and principled methodologies for
exploring restricted design rules. The Intellectual merit of our proposed
research stems from its broad conceptualization of a future integrated design-
to-manufacturing flow, coupled with its selective focus on several key design
technology goals. This work will help alleviate some of the challenges that now
threaten Moore's Law and the Semiconductor Technology Roadmap.&lt;br/&gt;
