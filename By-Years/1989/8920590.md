Several related research tasks are undertaken to improve knowledge of the
effects of volcanic eruptions on climate. These effects are important to
understand in their own right, and are also crucial in estimating the amount of
past climate change that was due to greenhouse gases in order to predict the
future impact of these gases. The PI will analyze the past climatic and volcanic
record in order to detect the effects of past volcanic eruptions. This will
involve the creation of an improved volcanic index appropriate for climatic
impact. The surface temperature changes of the past 140 years will be analyzed
to determine the seasonal and latitudinal signal of volcanic eruptions. In
addition, the output from a recent general circulation model (GCM) experiment
will be analyzed to determine the impact of the simulated volcanic eruptions. An
aerosol data set for the 1980's will be created for future use in GCM
simulations to investigate the relative effects of ENSO and the EL Chichon
eruption of 1982 for the climate change of the 1980's.
