This infrastructure award is for the development of an Imaging Laboratory that
supports research in both dynamic imaging and in the processing of imaging data.
Specific research projects supported by this laboratory include studies of human
visual perception, video compression, three dimensional motion analysis, image
reconstruction, adaptive filtering, and stereo vision. The award provides four
years support for both equipment and maintenence.
