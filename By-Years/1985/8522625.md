Lehigh University will establish an Engineering Research Center on Advanced
Technology for Large Structural Systems. The goal of the Center is to advance
the fundamental engineering knowledge base for new technologies in the
structure-related industries. Multidisciplinary research thrusts will be in: (1)
new and better design concepts integrated with fabrication and operation; (2)
powerful, new computer-based tools developed and utilized in design,
fabrication, and life-cycle monitoring; (3) higher strength, higher value-added
materials; (4) robotics and automation integrated in the fabrication and
construction; and (5) new sensors, coatings, and protective systems. Engineering
education in large structural systems will be emphasized at both the
undergraduate and graduate levels. New multi-disciplinary graduate courses to be
developed will be team taught and will be required of all graduate students
associated with the Center. Other institutions expected to participate are
Bucknell University, Lafayette College, and Villanova University.
