This project is developing a curriculum in Instrumentation and Control
Engineering Technology (ICET) within the existing ABET accredited Electronics
and Computer Engineering Technology (ECET) program. This effort engages Savannah
Technical College (STC) and Savannah State University (SSU), a Historically
Black University, in an articulated partnership, which provides new and
prospective student pathways either to associate degrees or four year programs.
The partnership also includes industry representatives who provide critical
input to promote improvement in the education of engineering technicians. The
project develops and implements an ICET curriculum that ensures and sustains the
enrollment and graduation of underrepresented students knowledgeable in
instrumentation and control engineering technology for rapidly emerging
industrial applications in the Savannah coastal region and beyond. The ICET
curriculum consists of formal course work, laboratory work, and internships in
industry. The project's recruitment activities with underrepresented population
contributes to increased enrollment and graduation rates of engineering
technicians to meet workforce demands by improving technician skills and meeting
student needs by improving their STEM preparation. The curriculum meets the
national standards as affirmed by ABET accreditation. The project also has broad
range impact on the regional and national economy and disseminates the ICET
curriculum and other activities through web based materials.
