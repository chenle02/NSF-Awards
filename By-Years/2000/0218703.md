Structural reliability/redundancy has become a serious concern in the building
industry after the poor performance of some buildings in recent earthquakes.
This research project carries out a systematic investigation of structural
redundancy and application to design practice. Within the framework of
structural dynamic and reliability analyses, the effects of major redundancy-
contributing factors are systematically examined, with emphasis on structural
configuration, member ductility capacity, over-strength, interaction of
structural components, and torsional motions. Recent SAC Steel Project
analytical and experimental results of structural member and system behavior are
used. A risk-consistent redundancy factor is then developed for calculating the
design forces such that structures of different configurations and designs can
meet reliability-based performance requirements. The impact of the proposed
research will be a timely contribution to fundamental understanding of
structural redundancy and the development of a rational basis for a performance-
based redundancy design factor in codes and standards.
