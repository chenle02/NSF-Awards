How can you tell whether a knot is really knotted or whether it is possible to
find a formula for the solutions of certain equations or how to make sense of
the nature of the elementary particles of physics or why there are only 17
really different wall paper patterns? These and many other such questions depend
on an algebraic structure called a group. Groups arise in many parts of
mathematics and in science. They provide, in particular, the means to understand
and exploit symmetry. This makes it possible for them to help in our
understanding of the nature of the space we live in, the structure of crystals
and various molecules and in the design of new cryptographic protocols. Indeed
the security of information transmitted electronically over the internet depends
crucially on a particular kind of group called a finite group. This group
provides a way to encode messages using the product of two very large prime
numbers. The encoding is the easy part of the process. The hard part is the
decoding and this is where group theory is used. The present proposal deals with
the current state of knowledge of certain groups, called finitely presented
groups. These finitely presented groups hold in many instances the keys to
solving important problems in mathematics and science and the primary objective
of this conference is for a number of very prominent mathematicians to map out
future directions of study.
