The School of Engineering at Howard University in conjunction with the Materials
Science Research Center of Excellence, and the Department of Electrical
Engineering and Mechanical Engineering is establishing an "Engineering Doctoral
Enhancement Effort (EDEE)" program. The purpose of the program is to recruit and
educate underrepresented graduate students with the terminal degree in
engineering. The program will support seven additional graduate students
pursuing the doctoral degree in engineering. To qualify for the fellowship
support the candidates must be U.S. citizens or permanent residents, and desire
to pursue a career in teaching and research, as exhibited by their past
educational and professional experiences.
