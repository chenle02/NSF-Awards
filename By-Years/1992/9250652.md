The Department of Geography at the University of Connecticut is developing a
geographic information science lab for improving the quality of instruction in
the undergraduate program. This project will integrate geographic information
science and technology into each level of the undergraduate curriculum. The
educational goal is an evolution of skill development so that students receive a
thorough understanding of concepts and models in geography that are enhanced and
extended by the new technologies of geographic information systems. By first
introducing students to these topics in pre-major courses, it is hoped that they
can be intellectually stimulated and attracted to geography as a social and
physical science; by incorporating further instruction in the core requirements
of the major, it is hoped that all students graduating from the program will
have a minimum proficiency in the new technologies; and, by having further
reinforcement in advanced level courses it is expected that students could use
the new technology easily in their chosen areas of topical expertise.
