This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will improve
dramatically the adaptability, maintainability, and robustness of software
systems that operate in complex, ever- changing environments. current practice
requires the end users of many software applications to customize those
applications to their own requirements and environments. Such customization is
particularly problematic when those requirements are dynamic and difficult to
predict. This project will demonstrate the utility and feasibility of employing
run-time monitors that detect failures to fulfill requirements and violations of
assumption about the operating environment upon which current choice of system
configuration is based. Users describe requirements and assumptions in a
language to be designed for this specific purpose. From expressions of
requirements in this notation, a run-time monitor is automatically generated,
and installed to run alongside the monitored system. in its normal operating
context. Run-time monitors of this kind alert users about mismatches between
expected and actual operating conditions, thereby providing vital data necessary
for either human users or a piece of software to reconfigure the system
appropriately. Automated monitoring for reconfiguration has tremendous
commercial potential in existing software products such as: databases,
spreadsheets, graphical user interface kits, system administration tool suites,
etc. Commercial products from this research could be a) Valuable additional
`monitoring` modules packaged into existing products by their vendors; b) Stand-
alone tools to monitor the requirements of systems from the outside environment.
Both kinds of products have great commercial value.
