This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).

This major research instrumentation (MRI) award funds the purchase of a confocal
system to support the research programs of 11 Biological Sciences faculty at
Marquette University and their students. The confocal system integrated with an
inverted microscope will be used to support basic research, and undergraduate
and graduate training programs. The system will allow high resolution of various
biological tissues and high speed recording of processes within cells such as
calcium flux in muscle and nerve cells. Important scientific questions in both
animal and plant systems will be studied including mechanisms of excitation in
smooth and skeletal muscle, neuroscience research into the role of inhibitory
synapses and motor control, molecular localization and mechanism of cilia
beating, developmental regulation, and the revealing of complicated cellular
structures, such as muscle and yeast mitochondria, and the epithelium of kidney
tubules. This research is expected to lead to important advances in the
understanding of structure-function relationships.

Besides its use in basic research, the confocal system will be used to bring
advanced imaging techniques to undergraduate and graduate students. Cell biology
and two physiology lab courses will be enhanced by the incorporation of confocal
microscopy. The independent research of our advanced undergraduates will be
expanded to include imaging technology. Confocal microscopy will also become a
part of our summer laboratory program for Equal Opportunity Program students
(10th-12th high school students and entering college freshman) and McNair
scholars (minorities and/or low income/first generation college students), and
an NSF sponsored summer research program which historically has emphasized the
recruitment of underrepresented minorities and students from institutions where
research opportunities in the biological sciences are limited. Outcomes will be
published in multiple journals over the lifetime of the instrument.
