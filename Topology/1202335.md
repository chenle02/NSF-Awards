Homotopy Quantum Field Theory (HQFT) is a branch of Topological Quantum Field
Theory dealing with manifolds and cobordisms endowed with maps to a given target
space. The aim of the project is to establish foundations of 3-dimensional HQFT
in the case where the target space is the Eilenberg-MacLane space of type K(G,1)
where G is a discrete group (finite or infinite). This should generalize the
known results of the PI with N. Reshetikhin, O. Viro, and A. Virelizier. The
project will specifically address the following problems:(1) produce a state sum
construction of 3-dimensional HQFTs from spherical G-fusion G-categories; (2)
introduce an appropriate notion of a G-modular G-category and give a surgery
construction of a 3-dimensional HQFT from such a category. Solutions to these
problems will include definitions of the required classes of G-categories and of
the corresponding HQFTs. Finally, the PI will establish a fundamental relation
between the constructions (1) and (2) via a G-version of the Drinfeld-Joyal-
Street center of categories: the HQFT obtained by construction (1) from a
spherical G-fusion G-category C is equivalent to the HQFT obtained by
construction (2) from the appropriately defined G-center of C.



The project develops new techniques in geometry arising from ideas of quantum
physics. Specifically, the project will focus on the notion of Topological Field
Theory introduced by the Fields medalist Edward Witten in the 1980's.
Topological Field Theory allows topologists to analyze the shape of geometric
objects from the microscopic viewpoint decomposing them into small elementary
pieces. Mathematical formulation of Topological Field Theory given by the PI and
co-authors has successfully led to creating bridges between previously unrelated
areas of pure mathematics like the geometric theory of knotted strings in space
on one hand, and the algebraic theory of representations and categories on the
other hand. The project considerably enlarges the class of geometric objects
which can be analyzed using Topological Field Theory. We include in
consideration not only the objects themselves but also relations between them
known in mathematics as maps or mappings. The principal aim of the project is to
analyze the maps from the above mentioned microscopic viewpoint and to derive
corresponding notions in algebra and theory of categories. The project will
introduce and develop two different solutions to this problem and establish a
subtle theorem relating these two solutions. This project will lead to a better
understanding of geometric objects and their maps. It will also produce new
powerful algebraic notions and techniques. Potential areas of applications
outside of pure mathematics include theoretical physics and quantum
computations.
