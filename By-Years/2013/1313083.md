The goal of this proposal is to investigate the magnetocentrifugal mechanism for
producing jets and outflows in the star formation process. The proposal will
attack this problem, first, by strengthening the observational foundation of the
magnetocentfiugal outflow theory by quantifying the Doppler gradient expected in
realistic outflows from young stellar objects (YSOs) using 3-D magnetohydronamic
(MHD) simulations. The second part of the proposal aims to strengthen the
theoretical foundation of these YSO outflows by treating non-ideal MHD effects
by using newly-developed Zeus-based MHD code.

This project will advance our understanding of the jets and outflows associated
with young stellar objects through state-of-the-art numerical simulations and
will make valuable predictions regarding jet rotation that will be testable by
the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). The project outlines 5 areas in which
it will make a broader impact including: animated movies of jet formation,
training a PhD student, public outreach through the University of Virginia?s
observatories, developing a mobile planetarium for use in science education in
rural Virginia counties, and release of the non-ideal MHD code that is
developed.
