Abstract: Conference on Partial Differential Equations and Applications

University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, November 11th-13th, 2005.

The award will support US graduate students and researchers to attend a
Conference on Partial Differential Equations and Applications, to be held at the
University of Florida in November 2005. This conference is part of a special
year in analysis and probability theory.

This is a three-day conference that will focus on topics in partial
differential equations that are closely related to issues in imaging science.
