Dr. Staubli is analyzing memory in the olfactory system, encompassing studies
ranging from basic physiology to the more global cognitive operations of
learning and forgetting. Her previous studies have demonstrated that brief
bursts of electrical stimulation to the pathway which connects the nose to the
brain, when given at the frequency at which rats sniff air, are treated by the
animals as if they perceived real odors. In standard learning situations animals
will quickly acquire a discrimination between these "electrical odors." As a
result, the connections between the stimulated axons and the target neurons in
the olfactory cortex show long-lasting physiological changes (potentiation).
Importantly, the synaptic connections of naive, non-learning animals show no
such changes. This suggests that the observed physiological changes might
reflect the formation of memories of the "electrical odors." Dr. Staubli has
also demonstrated that long-term potentiation (LTP) in another brain region
involved in learning (the hippocampus) can be reversed by long trains of low
frequency stimulation. She is now examining LTP in the lateral olfactory tract,
testing whether it can be reversed. If so, then the behavioral effects of the
manipulation will be measured; that is, does reversal of LTP in the olfactory
system eliminate the memory of the "electrical odors." These experiments should
provide evidence regarding the possibility that memory decay is due to an
active, rather than a passive process.
