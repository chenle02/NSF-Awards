The University of Pennsylvania proposes to develop and deploy a new CS service-
learning course at the college level which will be integrated with the cascading
mentoring of high and middle school students. The course - called College
Service Learning Course to Promote and Increase COMPutational Thinking and
ACTion (Penn COMP-ACT) - will train college students to teach K-12 computational
activities. Penn COMP-ACT undergraduates will learn about computational
thinking, and then they will teach and mentor high school and middle students in
coordinated summer workshops and afterschool programs. The high school students
will be engaged to work with the middle school students as well. This "learning-
by-teaching" approach will improve all of the student's understanding of
computational thinking and purposes by exposure to a variety of hands-on
software design activities and materials. The Penn COMP-ACT course leverages
several prior successful efforts including a pilot service-learning course set
up in the CS course program, and the existing partnerships and programs within
CS and Penn to recruit girls and minorities from the local community. It will be
lead by an interdisciplinary team of computer scientists, computer science and
K-12 educators.
