This is funding to subsidize the expenses of graduate students participating in
the doctoral consortium immediately preceding the Fourth International
Conference on Cognitive Modeling (ICCM'2001), to be held July 26-28, 2001 in
Fairfax, VA. Computational modeling has emerged as a central, but complex and
sometimes fractionated, theme in research on cognition. The ICCM conferences
provide a unique worldwide forum where researchers from diverse backgrounds come
together to compare cognitive models, to evaluate models using human data, and
to further the development, accumulation and integration of cognitive theory.
ICCM-2001 will be the first of these important events to take place outside of
Europe. Attending the conference and participating in the doctoral consortium
which precedes it will enable the students to present their work to and receive
feedback from the scientific community, will help them develop a supportive
community, and will foster interaction with and mentoring by senior researchers.
The students will be selected by a committee, with special consideration to be
given to students from under-represented groups and from institutions where
cognitive modeling is not a strength.&lt;br/&gt;
