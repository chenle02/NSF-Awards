The NSF (MCB) CAREER program supports early career faculty involved in
fundamental molecular and cellular biosciences research, investing in their
development as leading scholar-educators in their fields. Building on the
success of the 2019 MCB CAREER Awardee Conference, the 2020 meeting will bring
together awardees from MCB and NSF programs in other disciplines, including
mathematical and physical sciences and engineering, to foster a cross-
disciplinary research community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the
conference are to share knowledge and seed collaborations among early-career
faculty spanning a broad range of research interests and expertise, and to
provide feedback to the NSF on new research frontiers, especially at the
interfaces of disciplines within and outside of
biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
