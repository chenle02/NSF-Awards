This project will develop a set of teaching materials to accompany the
multimedia, videodisc package: Physics: Cinema Classics. Classroom teachers
recognized as leaders within their profession will write and test the materials.
The three two-sided videodiscs are organized by themes and fully indexed with
bar codes for ease of use. The teaching materials will provide an overview of
the videodisc text, the physics concepts being covered, teaching ideas, and
laboratory exercises. A student assessment instrument will be developed and
tested by project personnel to evaluate the students' conceptual knowledge.
Field testing will also occur at sites with inexperienced teachers and high
levels of minorities to determine the usefulness of the materials for a wide
range of teacher skill and training. Distribution will occur through a
commercial publisher being selected by the American Association of Physics
Teachers (AAPT). Project personnel will provide training on the use of the
complete set of the materials at a series of regional and national AAPT
conferences.
