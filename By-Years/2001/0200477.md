In this project, the investigator investigates two kinds of &lt;br/&gt;moduli
spaces in algebraic geometry, one is the moduli of &lt;br/&gt;stable morphisms
and the other is the moduli of stable sheaves. &lt;br/&gt;Both moduli spaces are
closely related to the research in Super-&lt;br/&gt;String theories.
Specifically, the investigator works on four &lt;br/&gt;research directions. The
first is on the effective construction &lt;br/&gt;of virtual moduli cycles. The
second is to continue working on &lt;br/&gt;degeneration of the moduli spaces,
including the moduli of stable &lt;br/&gt;sheaves and stable morphisms. The
third is to study open string &lt;br/&gt;theory in Calabi-Yau manifolds and the
last to study some new &lt;br/&gt;conjectures on the moduli of stable
sheaves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is a research in algebraic geometry,
a branch of&lt;br/&gt;mathematical science. The investigator studies
the&lt;br/&gt;properties of certain spaces (called moduli space in
mathematics)&lt;br/&gt;that consist of objects that can be characterized by
algebraic&lt;br/&gt;properties. (An example is the roots of
polynomials).&lt;br/&gt;These spaces are important because they are part of the
building &lt;br/&gt;blocks of the Super-String theory in high energy physics, a
&lt;br/&gt;theory devoted to unify quantum mechanic and gravity. In the last
&lt;br/&gt;decade, research in Super-String theory raised many challenging
&lt;br/&gt;questions about these spaces, some remains open. This research
&lt;br/&gt;project will address some of these challenge.
