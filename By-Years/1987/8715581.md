This project in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program is directed
at the development and application of new methods for describing state resolved
unimolecular and bimolecular reactions in the gas phase. Quantum reactive
scattering methods will be employed to treat reactions with nonlinear reaction
paths, deep wells, or special mass combinations. Semiclassical trajectory
methods will be used to simulate processes involving Van der Waals clusters
and/or highly excited molecules. By clarifying the fundamental dynamics of
chemical reaction mechanisms, these studies will contribute to the eventual goal
of being able to apply theoretical considerations to control the course of
desired chemical processes.
