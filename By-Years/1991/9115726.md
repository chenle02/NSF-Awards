The project explores the feasibility of using hollow fiber glass membranes for
waste reduction through process improvement. One application is separation of
H2S and H2 at high stream temperatures (400 - 600>F), to provide a more
concentrated H2S - stream as a byproduct and to make the process more energy
efficient. A second application is the separation of NH3 from H2S in a sour
water treatment process. By allowing the separation to take place at a higher
temperature, the process for sulfur recovery will be important because of the
removal of NH3. Furthermore, the recovery of NH3 in high purity through the
novel membrane separation process would reduce both pollution and the process
costs. The project involves measurements of membranes selectivity and evaluation
of process parameters. The project is an SGER grant in the emerging NSF program
on studies of Environmentally Benign Manufacturing. This NSF program is a
forerunner to a planned NSF-CCR (Council of Chemical Research) joint venture.
