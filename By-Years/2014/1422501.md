Big data analytics can revolutionize innovation and productivity across diverse
domains. However, this requires sharing or joint analysis of data, which is
often inhibited due to privacy and security concerns. While techniques have been
developed to enable the safe use of data for analysis, none of these work for
the critical task of outlier detection. Outlier detection is one of the most
fundamental data analysis tasks, useful in applications as far ranging as
homeland security, to medical informatics, to financial fraud. However, when the
data is fragmented and cannot be collected together, it is impossible even to
appropriately identify outliers, much less explain them. This project aims to
fill this gap, and enable the secure identification and explanation of outliers
without breaching the privacy of the data owners, the data custodians, or the
data subjects. The potential to advance science through the discovery and
analysis of exceptions can have unparalleled impact and significantly help in
widening co-operation, thus preventing loss through data
isolation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project develops strong definitions for
private outlier detection encompassing both process privacy and result privacy.
A suite of privacy-preserving tools and techniques are then developed to enable
outlier detection across different data ownership models, over a variety of
multi-modal datasets, while supporting differing tradeoffs of privacy,
efficiency, and utility. The research improves our scientific understanding of
secure computation, data outsourcing and distributed data analysis. The project
also cultivates the integration of research and education, by providing
opportunities for research by undergraduates at an early stage.
