ABSTRACT This project is designed to produce detailed descriptions of the
syntax and semantics of the ergative construction in four morphologically
ergative languages, Basque, Greenlandic Eskimo, Hindi, and Warlpiri, each of
which has an ergative case system. The objective is to develop, in the context
of a single theoretical framework, an explanatory account of certain syntactic
and semantic phenomena characteristic of this important linguistic type. The
theoretical framework of the project is a combination of the Government and
Binding theory and a version of model-theoretic semantics. The research on the
four languages systematically examines the ergative construction in relation to
each of the principal levels of syntactic representation--Logical Form,
S-structure, and D-structure--and in relation to the phenomenon of free word
order, characteristic of the languages of the project. While the four language
are reasonably representative of their type, the sample is restricted, and the
project seeks to off-set this by incorporating three ancillary activities: a
survey of the literature on Mayan ergativity (represented in agreement
morphology only, rather than case), a semester-long seminar on ergativity, and a
colloquium series on ergativity. A book on the theoretical position of
morphologically ergative languages is included as an integral part of the
project.
