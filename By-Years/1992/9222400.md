This workshop is intended to bring together Arctic social scientists working on
several ongoing US/Russian projects and native leaders to help map future
directions of international collaboration. One goal is to establish better links
with Native leaders in analyzing and building management regimes for Arctic
living resources. A common theme running through the work of these various
projects is, above all, the need to develop innovative institutional
arrangements capable of accommodating regional and international perspectives
associated with whole ecosystems, and the concerns of local, largely indigenous,
groups.
