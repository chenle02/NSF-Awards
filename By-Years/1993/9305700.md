The Department of Statistics at William Marsh Rice University will purchase a
multi-processor computational server which will be dedicated to the support of
research in the mathematical sciences. The equipment will be used for several
research projects, including in particular: (1) Statistical Methods for Tuning
Complex Computer Codes to Data; (2) Estimation for Stochastic Processes by
Simulation; (3) Computer Modeling of Amplified Genes and Other Repetitive DNA
Sequences; (4) Problems in Multivariate Testing and Estimation; and (5) Problems
in Adaptive Estimation, Cross-Validation, and Mode Testing.
