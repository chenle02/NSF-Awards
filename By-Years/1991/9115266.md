K. C. Weathers is the Manager of Laboratory Facilities at the Institute of
Ecosystems Studies, which is a part of the New York Botanical Garden. She
requests support for acquisition of an inorganic ion (ammonia, chloride,
nitrate, and phosphorous) analyzer that would: 1) increase the number of samples
analyzed, 2) decrease the amount of toxic waste generated, 3) produce results in
digital rather than strip-chart form, and 4) be easier to maintain and service
than the equipment currently in use. The instrument would be used in a variety
of research projects run by resident and visiting scientists, especially those
investigating nutrient cycling through food webs and processes of decomposition
in forests. Adding this ion analyzer to the facilities at the Institute for
Ecosystem Studies would have a significant impact on many important scientific
investigations.
