This project is funded under the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry
program. The work involves questions of fundamental theory of how the energy of
a molecular system changes when the positions of the nuclei are varied. The
consequences of these changes can be quite subtle but still detectable
experimentally, and properties of small clusters of alkali metal atoms are
expected to be explained by the theoretical developments to be undertaken. In
more detail, earlier work on the implications of conical intersections between
Born-Oppenheimer potential energy surfaces is to be extended in several
directions. Such intersections produce anomalous sign changes in electronic wave
functions when the nuclear coordinates traverse a closed path around the
intersection. The past results on the effect of permutation symmetry for three
and four identical nuclei are extended to the general case. Professor Mead will
study the generalization to phase changes and unitary transformations
experienced by electronic wave functions representing Kramers doublets when the
nuclear coordinates traverse closed paths, and the analogy with gauge field
theories of elementary particles. He will also obtain general functional forms
for potential energy surfaces and derivative couplings for various systems. The
nonremovable derivative coupling, which cannot be transformed away by going to a
diabatic basis, will be further studied, and the question of whether there are
specific effects which can be attributed to it will be explored.
