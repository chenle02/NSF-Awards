In the Internet today, packet losses are typically recovered using
retransmission, as for example in TCP. The mechanism employed in TCP works well
in the unicast environment. In multicast environment, however, such as the
MBone, the TCP approach does not work well, especially when the multicast groups
are very large. Difficulties arise because of two main problems: implosion and
exposure. Implosion occurs when following a packet loss, many receivers
multicast the same request; implosion also occurs when in response to a request,
many receivers multicast the lost packet. Exposure occurs when requests and
retransmissions reach members that have not experienced loss. Both implosion and
exposure cause unecessary overhead. Existing solutions are not general because
of the trade-offs they offer for reducing implosion and exposure. SRM for
example, trades latency for reducing implosion, and uses a crude method for
reducing exposure. RMTP, TMTP and LBRRM reduce both implosion and exposure by
arranging members in a tree. The tree, however, is hard to construct and
maintain in the face of dynamically changing groups without any access to
topology information. We propose a new scheme to perform reliable multicast
which overcomes the limitations of existing solutions. Our scheme is based on a
dynamic tree hierarchy, but pushes the task of costructing and maintaining the
tree to the network, where it can be done very efficiently. To achieve this, we
enhance the IP Multicast service model by adding new forwarding services to the
routers. The scheme combines three ideas to achieve near optimal performance:
(a) electing a replier link at each router to eliminate implosion, (b) defining
the concept of a "turning point" to discover the subtree where loss occurred,
and (c) using "directed multicast" to limit replies to the loss subtree. These
ideas minimize recovery latency and allow group members to be completely
isolated from the details of group topology, thus allowing fast adaptation to
dynamic membership changes.
