9302757 Starmer This project will investigate the genetic basis of female egg
laying behavior in conjunction with the performance of her offspring in a well
studied species of Drosophila (D. buzzatii). Females of this species are known
to display different preferences for laying their eggs on different
microorganisms (yeasts) in the laboratory and in the field. These preferences
are at least partly under genetic influence. Understanding the benefits of the
mother's preferences to the offspring could explain several important aspects of
evolutionary ecology such as 1) the maintenance of genetic diversity, 2) the
evolution of host-specialization and 3) the origin of species.%%% Experiments
will compare female egg laying behavior to the performance of her larvae with
attention to both environmental and genetic aspects. Four distinct strains of D.
buzzatii representing independent genetically determined egg laying responses to
yeast species that grow in the natural habitat will be used. The experiments are
designed to approximate the biological situation as we know it from extensive
field studies. Interpretations about genetically based behavior should be useful
to basic biology, evolutionary ecology, applied aspects of conservation biology
and biological control of insect pests. ***
