The learning environment for minority students in statistics and related courses
is being improved by using appropriate multimedia classroom technology. Students
are more actively involved through increased emphasis on analyzing and solving
problems with an ability to interact directly with the instructor in the
learning process. Students are encouraged to pool their resources around the
computer, working in teams or cooperative learning groups to solve difficult but
meaningful problems. Two introductory statistics courses are involved.This
project represents the coordinated efforts of the Statistics faculties in the
Departments of Information Systems and Decision Sciences and Economics to
improve the performance levels of students in Statistics. The objectives of the
project are to: utilize advances in technology and results of research to change
the teaching method and improve the learning of statistics; facilitate and
promote the use of problem solving to learn statistics (including related
courses like Operations Research and Econometrics); and encourage and enhance
the study of statistics by minorities through identification and reduction of
barriers to success.
