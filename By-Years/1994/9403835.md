9403835 Boyce The American Astronomical Society (AAS) will produce an on-line
version of its refereed research publication, The Astrophysical Journal Letters
(ApJL), and will develop innovative procedures and new tools to enhance the
users' capability to make full and effective use of research results. When this
pioneering project, the first to use a major journal, is completed there will be
an electronic version of ApJL, complete with on-screen representation of
mathematics and figures. It will incorporate tools to search for relevant
articles, to cross-link to the abstracts of other referenced articles, and to
provide direct access to the underlying data in forms which can be used for
future research when possible.
