This continuing grant for three years is on mechanisms of visual response in
the eye. The retina of the eye is the sensory tissue containing the
photoreceptor cells connected to several kinds of nerve cells. The simplest
subunit of human visual processing is the response from a uniform patch of
retina illuminated when it is stimulated by light. This response to light is not
simple, but subject to a sequence of events which can be modelled mathematically
as linear and non-linear processes. Over the past century, a set of
psychophysical "laws" have been established to relate dynamic visual responses
to stimulus changes over time. But some of these laws imply simple linear
addition of stimulus effects, and some imply that the effects cannot be added
linearly. This project will try to clarify what kinds of processing in the
retina could satisfy all of these laws under non-extreme conditions. The
question of linearity of the response at each level of the visual system, and
conditions under which the linearity fails have complementary significance un
unravelling the sequence of visual processing. The general approach is to use
the nonlinear stages as markers to determine the response dynamics before and
after each such marker. Human observers will be tested by measuring their
perception of the intensity of flickering lights, while varying the intensity
and duration of the stimulus. The first set of experiments will examine the
linearity of the mechanism of phototransduction, in which the light signal is
first converted to a neural response signal. intensity levels high enough to
saturate the system will be used to explore the time course of photochemical
reactions preceding the saturation. The second experiments will test how non-
linearity applies to the change in threshold for perception of a test pulse when
there is a large abrupt "step" change in light intensity. Analysis of the data
will include mathematical modelling of the functions describing the stimulus-
response relationships. This integrated approach is a novel and very
sophisticated one, with a strong theoretical component. The results should have
impact on visual research in many areas, and on models of information processing
in other systems.
