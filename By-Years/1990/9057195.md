The goal of this research is to understand the role of molecular and
microstructural dynamics in determing the macroscopic material properties of
polymers. In the case of polymeric liquids, they are combining experimental and
theoretical approaches in order to advance our ability to predict their
rheological properties. Due to the complex nature of these fluids, and in order
to obtain appropriate information to test theory, it is necessary to observe the
dynamics of individual components in multicomponent systems and to follow
specific modes of relaxation in response to macroscopic deformation. To access
this level of information, this research will be developing combined
spectroscopic and rheometric methods to study the order-disorder transition in
block copolymers, the rheology of miscible polymer melts, and the orientational
order of rigid-rod polymer liquid crystals under flow. Molecular motions play an
important role in solid polymers as well, and one aspect is the onset of
mobility that is responsible for the broad glass transition characteristic of
miscible polymer blends. Therefore, will be used solid-state deuterium nuclear
magnetic resonance to observe the rate of molecular motion in each component of
the blend individually as a function of temperature through the glass
transition. These observations will give new insight into the factors that
determine the temperature and breadth of the glass transition.
