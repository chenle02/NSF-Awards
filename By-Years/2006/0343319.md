Under this planning grant, California State University - San Bernardino, will
develop a Computer Engineering BS program which will serve as a prototype for
existing and emerging programs by directly addressing challenges connected with
two-year college transfer students and minority students. The new approach will
integrate a rigorous ABET accredit able curriculum with project teams. The team
members will be drawn from local two-year colleges (TYC) as well as CSUSB,
including faculty and students from both sectors. The project design teams will
involve twelve students supervised by two CSUSB faculty mentors, a corporate
partner liaison, a TYC faculty liaison, and a senior level student executive.
The team will work collaboratively on continuing research and design problems
relevant to the needs of the corporate partner and the research interests of the
faculty. It will be staffed by students distributed throughout the CE program.
This approach will reinforce an integrated design philosophy throughout the
curriculum and facilitate both faculty and peer mentoring.
