The goal of the four-year project is to revitalize and retain grades 3-8
teachers of the physical and space sciences, and in so doing improve the
instructional quality and increase the overall quantity of these sciences for
students. The collaborative effort, to further teacher retention and renewal
nationwide, is managed by the Science Education Department (SED) at Harvard
College Observatory and the McAuliffe/Challenger Center Learning Center (MCLC)
at Framingham State College (FSC). The aim is to build on the pilot SEDNet
project, which was an exploratory effort designed to revitalize and retain
grades 3-8 teachers of the physical and space sciences, and in so doing improve
the instructional quality and increase the overall quantity of these sciences
for students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three person teams from16 Challenger
Learning Centers (CLC's) attend two, two-week SEDNet summer institutes in
alternate years for in-depth professional development on inquiry science
embedded in the physical science concepts that form the basis of the ARIES
modules. These team leaders then provide (at their own locale) fee-based
implementation workshops, which support teachers using ARIES modules with
elementary and middle school students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Built in sustained
support for teachers will include CLC-based focus meetings, distance learning
opportunities and Web-site support. Over time the SEDNet programming will be
self-sustaining. &lt;br/&gt;Evaluation includes summative pre/post test measures
to assess changes in science content knowledge of both team leaders and second-
tier teachers and some comparison testing of students in schools.
