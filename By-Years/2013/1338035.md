This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) grant supports the acquisition of a
real-time motion analysis system to strengthen the research and research
training capabilities for faculty and students in the Departments of
Kinesiology, Mechanical Engineering, and Physical Therapy at California State
University Northridge (CSUN). The new state-of-the-art real-time system will
allow data to be captured with high fidelity and to be immediately analyzed and
processed, advancing research and education on biomechanics, neuromuscular
control of human movements, and biomedical engineering. Data from the motion
analysis system will be analyzed with biomechanical models to better understand
human movement and how equipment and environmental design affects neuromuscular
control. The motion analysis system can be integrated with other
instrumentation, such as the electromyograph or force plates, to analyze complex
movements in three dimensions and to better understand how humans interact with
their environments under different conditions.

The motion analysis system will promote collaborative research among the faculty
and the cross-training of students in the three disciplines. This research
enables the development of enhanced control strategies and design for a broad
range of activities. Understanding of human movement can lead to improved
designs for daily living that prevent injuries and promote peak performance and
to the creation of new adaptive devices, ranging from wheelchairs to improved
orthotics and prosthetics. The newly developed motion analysis laboratory will
promote research training in engineering and rehabilitation for CSUN students
and will attract underrepresented students to STEM research areas.
