This award provides partial funding for the 2014 meeting of the Working Group in
African Political Economy. This meeting brings together an interdisciplinary
group of social and behavioral scientists who are actively engaged in cutting
edge research on the political economy of African development. The meeting
includes many graduate students and junior scholars as full participants and it
serves as a training ground and a crucial research network for these
participants.

WGAPE attendees publish in leading scientific journals. The research results are
widely disseminated to policymakers, including sessions at the World Bank,
presentations to African policymakers, and books and articles for non-technical
audiences. Africa's rapid growth and political liberalization over the past
decade has led to increasing business interest in Africa as a trade and
investment destination. Therefore, insightful research on African development
patterns is increasingly important for US businesses and US policymakers.
