This award funds research on dynamic auction markets. Auctions are used to buy
and sell many important goods and services; these market environments include
electricty markets, financial markets, public procurement, and a wide range of
e-commerce applications. The firms and customers participating in these markets
usually make many purchases and sales; this means that dynamic behavior is an
important feature of these markets. Understanding these dynamics both in and out
of market equilibrium is an important and open
challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI seeks first to develop new mathematical
models of these markets and will then use data from actual auction markets to
formally test the models. The hope is that by iterating between theory and data
he will create a new category of tools that are well-tested and can be employed
by other researchers interested in studying markets with these features. The
empirical analysis includes data from two different kinds of markets: ecommerce
auctions for cameras sold through eBay and electricity markets in Great
Britain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has important broader impacts. The
results will be useful for competition authorities who seek to understand the
dynamic concerns facing buyers and sellers in auction markets. The methods
developed here may also be useful for analyzing dynamic behavior in non-auction
markets. For example, the third project is about how firms adjust their behavior
after a policy change, and the results will be valuable to electricity
regulators who need to consider how US firms will adjust to proposed 'smart
grid' policies and technologies.
