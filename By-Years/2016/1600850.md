The project's focus is on algebraic methods in combinatorics and finite
geometry. Combinatorics is a fast-growing area of mathematics. It has a wealth
of computational, scientific, and engineering applications, ranging from
algorithm analysis to human genome sequencing to cellular phone technology. In
combinatorics one considers discrete (as opposed to continuous) structures such
as graphs, hypergraphs, designs, matroids, and finite geometries. One central
task of this research project is to prove existential, enumerative, and
constructive results concerning these structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
research project is centered on algebraic invariants of various matrices arising
in combinatorics and finite geometry. Typical matrices considered are incidence
matrices of designs and finite geometries, higher inclusion matrices of set
systems, and adjacency or Laplacian matrices of graphs. The invariants under
investigation include modular ranks, spectrum, and Smith normal forms. The
investigator intends to pursue several research directions. One direction is to
apply these invariants to solve existential problems in design theory, extremal
combinatorics, and finite geometry. Another direction is to use algebraic
invariants for the purpose of distinguishing non-isomorphic combinatorial
structures with the same parameters.
