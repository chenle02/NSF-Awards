This research is on synthesis and verification of digital systems. The
computational basis for the work is the binary decision diagram (BDD) data
structure and extensions. In low power circuit design, new ideas in BDD
technology are being used for synthesis algorithms, and to estimate power
consumption via probablistic behavior of circuits. Decomposition concepts, such
as tearing, to assess properties of very large circuits are being investigated.
In verification, approximate exploration ideas are being examined for use in
checking equivalence of very large circuits. Hierarchical verification
capabilities, where parts of the circuit are modeled at the bit level and other
parts at the word level, are being examined. To provide a sound connection
between high level synthesis and high level verification, as well as to validate
high level VHDL descriptions, refined comparisons of non-deterministic systems,
such as bi-simulation equivalence and testing equivalence and pre-orders are
being explored.
