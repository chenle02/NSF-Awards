This research develops an innovative method (non-destructive technique) for
estimating residual stresses in a solid body. The new method considers residual
stress as constitutive information, the values of which are derived from an
appropriate combination of theory and experiment and by selecting the upper and
lower bounds from measured parameters. The research will investigate conditions
where the displacement or stress field is free from residual stresses and will
examine the elastodynamics of residually stressed bodies. Determining the
residual stress is the key to assessing the integrity and serviceability of
mechanical components and structural systems. Available destructive and non-
destructive methods are not fully adequate to measure residual stress
distributions in a solid body. The research will have a fundamental impact on
the prediction of the integrity and performance of structural and mechanical
components which use materials with varying degrees of ductility.
