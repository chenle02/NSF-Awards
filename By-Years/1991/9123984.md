This award will enable a team of United States (US) academic researchers in the
area of Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM) to visit sites in Europe where
such research effort is being conducted under the sponsorship of the European
Strategic Programme for Research and Development in Information Technology
(ESPRIT). Up to nine members will spend 8-10 days visiting the selected sites
and compiling a report that describes the activities and recommends potential
for US/ESPRIT collaboration. Such activity in CIM, which is the future of all
manufacturing, will expose US researchers to the successful efforts of their
European counterparts and define avenues for future collaboration. This will
have a significant impact on the domestic research in CIM with potential
benefits to the nation's industry.
