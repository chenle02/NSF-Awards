This conference will encompass a wide range of topics relating to the behavior
of atoms and molecules in optical (laser) fields intense enough so that the
normal absorption processes involve more than one photon, and a variety of new
phenomena arise. Emphasis will be given to important new developments. NSF
funding will be used to ensure the participation of younger contributing
scientists, some senior graduate students and postdoctoral research associates
and key senior scientist without alternative travel resources.
