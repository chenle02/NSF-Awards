EVERYDAY WEATHER PROJECT: Increasing Weather Awareness Through the Classroom
Use of The Public Media will develop and pilot test an innovative method for
teaching weather in upper elementary/middle school classrooms and establish a
permanent weather education implementation and communications network. The State
University of New York College at Brockport, in partnership with the U. S.
National Weather Service, and cable television's The Weather Channel, and in
cooperation with the national newspaper USA Today, the National Earth Science
Teacher's Association and the Commonwealth of Virginia Department of Education
will help develop three teacher education modules and a group of master
precollege teachers and supervisors of science to present the modules to groups
of upper elementary and middle school teachers. The new teaching method is based
on the study of weather from the perspective of the kinds of weather information
available to the public by newspaper, television, and radio. An extensive pilot
study will be conducted in an attempt to determine the efficacy of the teacher
materials and strategies in teacher enhancement activities. A permanent weather
education implementation and communications network will be established within
the National Earth Science Teachers Association.
