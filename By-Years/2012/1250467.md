The Emory Department of Mathematics and Computer Science REU is a research
experience for undergraduates interested in arithmetic geometry, combinatorics,
and number theory. Organized by Ken Ono (with assistance from rotating
colleagues), the program plans to train ten undergraduates annually in the
summers of 2013, 2014, and 2015. Research problems will be accessible and
cutting edge, and they will be related to analytic number theory, elliptic
curves, Galois representations, modular forms, partitions, and quantum modular
forms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The participants will be chosen from a nationwide
search. At least half will be chosen from underrepresented groups, and at least
half will be chosen from institutions which do not offer many similar STEM
research activities for undergraduates. The REU program will enable
undergraduate students to enjoy an enhanced learning experience, including
research projects and seminars. The overall goal of the Emory REU in Number
Theory is to attract talented undergraduate students to careers in the
mathematical sciences.
