The molecular events leading to photosynthetic water oxidation are still
largely unknown, particularly the proteins involved and the specific residues
that form ligands to manganese, an essential cofactor for oxygen evolution.
Current models suggest the participation of the reaction center D1D2 complex and
an extrinsic 33kD protein, called the maganese stabilizing protein. This
research will combine the techniques of site-directed mutagenesis, using the
readily transformable cyanobacterium Synechocystis 6803, to modify selected
amino acid residues comprising the so-called manganese stabilizing polypeptide,
together with EPR and ENDOR spectroscopic methods which enable a direct
assessment of these changes on the structure and kinetic properties of the
manganese site and other endogenous electron donors coupled to the reaction
center, such as Cytb559 and Tyr- 160.%%% Photosynthesis is the most pervasive
biological reaction on the face of the earth. It produces nearly all of the
oxygen in the air which is essential for oxidative metabolism in all aerobic
organisms and for combustion in fossil fuel powered engines. Thus,
photosynthetic O2 evolution powers most biological and commercial machines.
Presently there are no man-made catalysts capable of carrying out the efficient
evolution of O2 from water and an energy source with a commercially useful
yield. Nature, on the other hand, has developed a unique system, found in all
O2-evolving plants and algae, optimized for catalyzing this process. This
research will contribute to the understanding of the molecular basis by the
molecular basis by which green plants are capable of harnessing nature's most
power oxidant, the splitting of the biological process we hope to gain insight
that will lead to a new blueprint for the design of synthetic water oxidizing
catalysts.***//
