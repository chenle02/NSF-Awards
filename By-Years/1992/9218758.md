This grant is to help support a conference/workshop on photonic packaging. It is
a follow-on to a wrokshop from a similar one supported by NSF one year ago. It
was clear that packaging is a much more important subject than previously
thought and the first workshop only scratched the surface. This year the topic
areas to be discussed are: hybrid multi-chip integration and waveguide
interconnects.
