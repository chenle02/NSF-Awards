This grant permits Dr. Cant and his colleagues to study five species of
non.human primates on the island of Sumatra. These include two species of
gibbon, the oranutan and two monkey species. These animals are of varying body
size, have different diets and move through the environemnt differently. The
goal of this research is to study different positional behaviors and determine
the factors which lead to varying methods of locomotion. To accomplish this the
team will follow individual animals, photograph them with video and 35 mm
cameras and record activities. They will note the part of the canopy used, the
method of locomotion, the posture of the animal and the range of foods utilized.
Prior work has made it clear that a number of factors influence positional
behavior. These include the body size of an animal, the part of the canopy
through which it most often moves and the kind of foods it eats. To separate out
these variables however is extremely difficult. However the study of five
species which occupy the same tropical rainforest allows different comparisons
between species pairs. Specific variables can then be varied while others are
held constant. Since in several species males and females differ in body size,
within species comparison is also possible. This research is important for
several reasons. Physical anthropologists are interested in the relationship
between body form and body function. This study should provide relevant
information. Secondly the research will show how different species partition a
tropical environment and help to explain how the richness of the tropics has
developed and is maintained. Finally, Dr. Cant's work will aid in wildlife
management and assist in developing plans to preserve species which are facing
extinction.
