This research is a collaborative effort to recalibrate and extend the widely
used MELTS computational thermodynamics software package in order to simulate
magmatic processes such as mantle melting, crystal fractionation, and melt-rock
reaction to pressures of ~25 GPa. This extension of MELTS will utilize an
associated solution approach to the thermodynamics of the liquid phase and will
depend on improvements to the scope and the quality of the experimental
calibration database. This new database is being constructed from literature
data and from new experiments designed (1) to provide calibration ground-truth
for critical portions of temperature-pressure-composition space and (2) to
resolve conflicts identified in the existing database. The revised MELTS
software package and new experimental database will be distributed to the Earth
Sciences community at http://melts.uchicago.edu.
