With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor Lee of the University
of Houston will investigate new and versatile approaches to the preparation of
artificial enzymes. The research will focus on the use of alkanethio units to
bind a monolayer of cyclodextrin moieties to a gold surface. Further, within the
cyclodextrin cavity, additional alkanethio units shall be bonded to the gold
surface and used to position the reactants for enhanced catalytic activity. For
the education portion of the investigation, the principal investigator will
facilitate student understanding of the industrial environment by inviting
several lecturers from the local industries to talk in a new course on `Process
Chemistry and Environmental Aspects of Petrochemistry`. In addition, a second
course will be added on the subject `Chemistry in Context`. Control of reaction
topology to facilitate a desired reaction is the main goal of many scientists.
This award from the Organic Dynamics Program addresses this theme by tethering
artificial catalytic units to gold surfaces and using alkanethio units to tune
the inner catalytic environment. The education portion of the award will focus
on preparing undergraduate and graduate students for their post-graduate careers
by introducing two new courses. The first course will teach them how chemistry
is involved in the everyday life and is titled, `Chemistry in Context`. For the
second course, industrial scientists will be invited to give several lectures
and perspectives of industrial careers.
