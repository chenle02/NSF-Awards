The Northeast Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (NELSAMP) has
chosen the University of Connecticut (UConn) as the site for the 2014-2016
Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) Activity. The UConn BD Activity will demonstrate
that a proactive, intensive, results-oriented campaign to recruit, prepare,
mentor, train, and support doctoral candidates from traditionally
underrepresented populations in the STEM disciplines will contribute to
resolving social, economic, and technological challenges that currently face the
United States. For the U.S. to remain competitive globally, it must provide
exceptional educational preparedness in STEM areas that underpin the knowledge-
based economy. Students from underrepresented groups in STEM are a critical
piece in solving the ongoing puzzle of how to reinvigorate the nation's global
technological primacy.

UConn will recruit and support 12 doctoral students from African American,
Hispanic and/or Native American populations who are graduates of LSAMP Alliance
institutions with BD Fellowships for the first two years of their graduate
studies in STEM disciplines at UConn. Structured activities for the BD Fellows
include developing focused plans of study and detailed roadmaps of academic
milestones; participating in professional skills development workshops; having
opportunities for mentorship/volunteering; and receiving career preparation. In
addition, UConn will refine and expand its Husky Bridge to the Doctorate STEM
Program website. Through innovative STEM research projects in cutting-edge areas
such as biomedical engineering, environmental and human sustainability, and
nanotechnology, UConn will train outstanding scientists and engineers. The
diversity of perspectives, backgrounds, and experiences of the BD Fellows will
contribute toward breakthroughs in meeting society's grand challenges.
