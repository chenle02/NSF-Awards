Plasma (a gas that is hot enough for its constituent atoms to be ionized) is the
most abundant state of matter in our solar system and the universe.
Understanding how plasma interacts with neutral elements in the atmospheres
around the Sun and Earth is important for space weather modeling and prediction.
For instance, predicting satellite drag requires knowledge of the density of
Earth's thermosphere, which is modified by solar radiation and ions from solar
wind. Yet, space weather models sometimes ignore the effects of plasma-neutral
interactions or rely on dated models developed using simple experiments. This
project will undertake a pioneering laboratory investigation of collisions in
plasmas, develop new models for plasma-neutral interaction, and fold them into
state-of-the-art space weather models. The team will also create science kits
with hands-on activities and instructional materials and distribute them to
every elementary school in 21 counties in West Virginia. The project is a
collaborative effort between West Virginia University, University of Texas at
Arlington, Bay Area Environmental Research Institute, Electric Power Research
Institute and Spark! Imagination and Science Center in West
Virginia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding ion-neutral interactions is
important for modeling magnetosphere/ionosphere/thermosphere coupling and the
dynamics of the solar chromosphere, which influence space weather. Ion-neutral
collision frequency plays a critical role for both Joule heating and ionospheric
and chromospheric (ambipolar) conductivity. The project team will conduct a
multi-fluid, multi-species laboratory study of ion-neutral coupling, develop a
new model for collision frequency for the terrestrial ionosphere, and
incorporate ion-neutral coupling in a chromosphere simulation model. The newly
developed collision frequency model will be incorporated into the Global
Ionosphere Thermosphere Model and the Space Weather Modeling Framework and
validated using space-based observations. Wider scientific community
participation in this work will be encouraged through two workshops. The
research and educational activities will involve postdoctoral researchers,
graduate and undergraduate students. ANSWERS projects advance the nationâ€™s STEM
expertise and societal resilience to space weather hazards by filling key
knowledge gaps regarding the coupled Sun-Earth system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
