Joseph DMI-9622482 Advanced polymeric composite has been used widely for
aircraft manufacturing by the defense industry. In order to utilize these
materials in the civil sector, manufacturing costs need to be reduced
dramatically. This research project will develop a modular, layered hybrid
system framework capable of producing consistently high-quality, low-cost
composite parts using a variety of composite processes. The research project has
a balance between theory and experiment, and will provide valuable findings for
the composite manufacturing industry. Results of this research project could
provide valuable findings in the optimization of existing processing equipment
for low-cost composite manufacturing. This research project is in close
collaboration with industry.
