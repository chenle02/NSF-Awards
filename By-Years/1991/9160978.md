Computed tomography (CT) has become increasingly important in nondestructive
evaluation (NDE). Industrial applications often require very high spatial
resolution. However, the finite width of x-ray sampling limits the spatial
resolution. Research to be carried out here will investigate an efficient
computational method to deconvolve the beam width from the projection data
without increasing the noise in the reconstructed image. Previously, long
computation times and/or high noise have made deconvolution techniques of little
value in CT. A matched filtering deconvolution method will increase resolution
without increasing noise and will be computationally quick and easy to
implement.
