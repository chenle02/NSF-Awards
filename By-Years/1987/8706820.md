Dr. Jenkins' research has documented previously unknown aspects of bird flight.
For example, the wishbone in starlings appears to act as a spring, bending
laterally during downstroke and recoiling to assist shoulder retraction during
upstroke. In fact, the entire avian shoulder (i.e., clavicles, scapulae,
coracoids, and the associated sternum) undergoes a rather dramatic excursion
during each wingbeat. In addition, by monitoring the activity patterns of flight
muscles the researchers are beginning to understand the contribution of
individual muscles to specific phases of the wingbeat cycle. The present
research proposal is designed to extend and quantify the researchers' original
observations and undertake comparable studies on other bird species to explore
the variability of flight mechanics.
