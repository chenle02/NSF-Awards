title: Host-microbe signal exchange during development

Project Abstract:

Most, if not all, animals host beneficial microbes. When these associations are
established, both partners undergo significant developmental changes as they
accommodate to the symbiotic state. Microbial symbionts often induce alterations
both in the host cells they directly contact, as well as in more remote cells
and tissues. Often these changes involve toxic oxygen species such as nitric
oxide (NO) that the host produces in response to bacteria. Similarly, motile
bacteria often lose locomotory structures (flagella) upon host colonization. The
squid Euprymna scolopes forms its light organ in response to colonization by the
luminescent bacterium Vibrio fischeri. This project will focus on the roles of
symbiont flagellation and host NO production. as both developmental phenotypes,
and potential signaling molecules between the partners in this process. Two
questions are addressed: 1) Does the environment of the developing light organ
regulate synthesis of the flagellar apparatus? In turn, are flagellins, the
principal proteins of the flagella, involved in the induction of the organ? 2)
How do the bacteria reduce the host's defensive NO production and how does NO-
binding by the symbionts give them a competitive advantage in the symbiosis? The
proposed research will develop and apply a variety of techniques using molecular
biology, molecular genetics and microscopy. This research promises to reveal
some of the very basic "language" underlying the interactions of host cells with
their bacterial partners. As all animals are now believed to have persistent
interactions with essential microbes, the work should provide insight into very
basic mechanisms of the biology of animals.

Broader Impacts: As researchers in the frontier field of beneficial animal-
microbe interactions, the PIs view it as their responsibility to educate both
the public and the community of biologists about this critical area of the
biological world. To accomplish this goal, the PIs participate in educational-
outreach efforts through U Wisconsin that facilitate training of students from
high school through postdoctoral, as well as educating the public. These efforts
include UW's Wisconsin Alliance for Minority Participation, a principal goal of
which is to recruit underrepresented minorities into graduate labs at UW. In
addition, the PIs' labs participate in the UW Outreach Club and PLATO (learning
opportunities for seniors). The PI's and their labs disseminate information
about the impact of symbiotic associations on animal biology both through
interviews with the media and in the creation and maintenance of 5 public
websites.
