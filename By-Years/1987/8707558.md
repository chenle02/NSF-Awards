The overall goal of Dr. Marshak's project is to understand the molecular
mechanisms controlling the formation of neurites during the growth factor,
neurites during growth and differentiation of stimulation of neurite extension
by the polypeptide growth factor, neurite extension factor (NEF), and on the
molecular events that result in the establishment of neuriteic connections. NEF
is an acidic protein of mass 21,010, whose complete primary structure has been
elucidated. NEF stimulates neurite outgrowth from central neurons and
neuroblastoma cells, but not from peripheral neurons. Thus, NEF is the first
well-characterized, soluble, polypeptide differentiation factor for the central
nervous system. NEF appears to be secreted from astrocyutes, and to act on post-
mitotic neurons. A receptor for NEF on cerebral cortical neuronal cell membrane
fractions has been demonstrated, and appears to be specific and of high
affinity. The specific objectives of the project are: 1) to further characterize
the receptor for NEF; 2) To identify the mechanism of signal transduction for
NEF; expression of proteins involved in neurite formation, including
cytoskeletal proteins. As models of the central nervous system, these
experiments will employ primary chick embryo cerebral cortical neurons and mouse
neuroblastoma. The proposed project is a multi-disciplinary one involving
protein biochemistry and cellular neurobiology, as they relate to cellular
development and the interactions between cells. This research is anticipated to
yield information of value to studies of disorders in cellular growth and
differentiation.
