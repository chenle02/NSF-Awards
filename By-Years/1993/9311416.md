9311416 Gary The grant supplies major funding for the analysis of radio data
from the Owens Valley Solar Array, a solar-dedicated array capable of two-
dimensional mapping of solar flares and active regions at a wide range of
microwave frequencies. The array has recently been upgraded to 5 antennas,
giving 10 baselines at each observing frequency. By combining UV coverage in
closely spaced frequencies, we obtain snapshot maps at a number of frequency
bands, or for steady emission the project obtains rotational synthesis maps at
up to 45 frequencies. The combination of spectral and imaging capabilities makes
the array a unique, powerful instrument for studying the physical conditions in
active regions, and the spatial and temporal development of mildly relativistic
electrons accelerated in flares. During the period covered by this proposal,
observations made jointly with currently operating spacecraft (Yohkoh and CGRO)
will be of added importance. Early results prove that the instrument fulfills
its design goals. ***
