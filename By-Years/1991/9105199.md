Strike-slip faulting has played a major role in the tectonic evolution of the
northern Cordillera, however the timing, location and mechanisms of much of the
strike-slip motion is not well established. Prior work has identified major
dextral slip of Cretaceous age along the Border Ranges Fault, Alaska.
Preliminary evidence indicates that the present level of erosion exposes the
fault near the brittle-ductile transition at the time of motion. Recent models
have proposed major subhorizontal detachments in strike-slip systems at this
transition, in addition to the steep, strike-slip detachment normally
envisioned. Because of the deep level of exposed crust and exceptional outcrop
exposure this area affords the opportunity to test these models of the role of
subhorizontal detachments in strike-slip shear zones. Results are expected to be
applicable to many large-scale strike-slip zones.
