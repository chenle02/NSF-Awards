The structure, function and evolutionary relationship of various RNA and DNA
plant and animal viruses are to be studied by use of X-ray diffraction methods.
Recently, Dr. Rossmann solved the first structure of a single-stranded DNA virus
(canine parvovirus). He now wishes to exploit this structure to investigate such
functions as, for instance, the canyon-like depression on its surface (is it the
site of receptor attachment?), the spikes on the threefold axes (is this the
site where neutralizing antibodies attach?), the fivefold cylindrical structure
(is this required for transport of the virus to the cell nucleus) or the
structure of part of the ssDNA bound to the capsid proteins (does the viral coat
protein recognize a specific DNA sequence?) Dr. Rossmann is also studying the
ssDNA bacterial virus X174 and other structure such as those of the cauliflower
mosaic virus two dsRNA viruses (reo- and rotaviruses) and the core of Sindbis
virus. The primary techniques will depend on fast X-ray diffraction data
collection at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source, data processing on
Purdue's Cyber 205 supercomputer, phasing primarily by use of the
noncrystallographic symmetry and model building and analysis on interactive
compute graphics systems.
