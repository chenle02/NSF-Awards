Dubois A testbed for experimenting with memory hierarchies in multiprocessors is
being supported. A processor node in the testbed contains cache and memory
system controllers made from field-programmable gate arrays. To experiment with
a memory control mechanism or coherency technique, the investigators program the
gate arrays to implement the mechanism. For software support of experimental
techniques, the GNU-C compiler is being modified to generate appropriate code,
such as non-blocking prefetches, and the Mach microkernel is being ported to
provide thread scheduling.
