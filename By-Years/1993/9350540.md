9350540 Happ Title: Vermont EPSCoR State Systemic Improvement Plan. The Vermont
EPSCoR State Plan has been designed to produce lasting systemic change in the
capacity of the state for science and technology. It has four goals: 1) to build
research competitiveness in science and technology, 2) to create knowledge
transfer mechanisms that effectively link university expertise to the private
sector, 3) to recruit and train scientists, from high school to postdoctoral, in
research, and 4) to institutionalize science policy and planning for the state.
Activity will be centered at the University of Vermont, the only doctoral
institution in the state, and will involve other colleges across the state.
About 80% of the resources will be devoted to building competitiveness in four
subdisciplines: (1) The Evolutionary Ecology; (2) Computational Mathematics; (3)
Receptor-Mediated Signalling and Biotechnology; and (4) Advanced Materials
Science. All the clusters will interact in the EPSCoR Modeling Colloquium, an
interdisciplinary seminar series which will explore general techniques for
modeling complex systems and data sets. In addition, the EPSCoR project fosters
interactions between academic and industrial scientists by setting up a
technology transfer team, drawn from the university and the private sector and
by also offering a Small Business Innovation Research public seminar program and
a unique SBIR "Phase O" seed grant program to help increase the rate of SBIR
submissions to federal agencies. EPSCoR activities will be used to train
research students, from high school to postdoctoral. The lead laboratories will
be those of the cluster faculty. Working with the Vermont NSF-sponsored
Statewide Systemic Initiative program, EPSCoR will present a yearly Science-
Math-Technology Careers Day for high school science students and a research
program that joins highly motivated high school students and their teachers with
the faculty of regional colleges. In addition, EPSCoR will provide an
undergraduate research referral service, to place high school and college
students in faculty research laboratories for a semester or year. ***
