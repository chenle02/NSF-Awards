9500663 Phillips This project is on research to study hindered transport and
partitioning in systems with fibrous microstructures both theoretically and
experimentally. The theory will rigorously incorporate both transport and
equilibrium partition coefficients, two of the key components necessary to model
processes such as ultrafiltration, gel permeation chromatography and controlled-
release devices. In addition to this research activity, the investigator will
enhance education by developing courses related to the research, as well as a
course on technology, public policy and the energy industry. ***
