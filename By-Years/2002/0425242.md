Funds will allow an extensive, systematic radiogenic, U-series, and trace
element geochemistry study of arc volcanism on the Kurile arc. The objective is
to characterize various magmatic processes beneath a typical island arc setting
across the entire arc. Radiogenic isotope variations would be used to
characterize differences in long-lived crust/mantle sources across the arc, and
trace metal variations will trace more recent processes related to melting or
fluid interactions. Uranium-series disequilibria would also be used to trace
fluid involvement during melting (238U excess) and to place constraints on melt
transport times in the mantle (226Ra excess). Sediment inputs to the mantle
wedge would be obtained from measurements of radiogenic isotopes, cosmogenic
10Be, and major/trace elements in ODP drill cores. The work will test the
following hypotheses in the Kurile arc: 1) That the slab yields a fluid beneath
the volcanic front, deriving from both sediments and altered oceanic crust,
which changes to a sediment melt beneath the rear arc; 2) Indian mantle
asthenosphere extends into the Kuriles and Kamchatka; 3) Rear-arc lavas
represent lower degree melts of a mantle that is similar to that beneath the
volcanic front, with lesser fluid fluxes; and 4) Rear-arc lavas have little
effect on element fluxes, particularly on the parent-daughter pairs of the U-Th-
Pb, Rb-Sr, Sm-Nd, Lu-Hf isotope systematics. Graduate and undergraduate students
will be supported.
