Douglas will study the connection between problems in operator theory on one
hand and algebraic and analytic geometry in the presence of a hermitian metric.
The goal is to understand multi- variate phenomena and to provide techniques to
study more general cases. He will also investigate various invariants for
elliptic operators on manifolds. Starting from the case of elliptic operators on
compact, smooth manifolds without boundary which is now classical, one is
seeking to understand what happens when these hypothesis are relaxed. The
general area of mathematics of this project has its basis in the theory of
algebras of Hilbert space operators. Operators can be thought of as finite or
infinite matrices of complex numbers. Special types of operators are often put
together in an algebra, naturally called an operator algebra. These abstract
objects have a surprising variety of applications. For example, they play a key
role in knot theory, which in turn is currently being used to study the
structure of DNA, and they are of fundamental importance in noncommutative
geometry, which is becoming increasingly important in physics.
