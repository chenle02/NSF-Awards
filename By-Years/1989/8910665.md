Restarting is one way to reduce storage and orthogonalization costs of conjugate
gradient methods for large systems of nonsymmetric linear equations. However,
restarting slows down the convergence. In the Arnoldi and GMRES versions of the
conjugate gradient method, the associated eigenvalue problem can be solved. This
investigation uses the eigenvalue problem to retain some of the information lost
in the restart and thus improve the convergence of the linear equations solution
method. This is done by adding a few approximate eigenvectors to the subspace
that is used for the linear equations problem. Some preliminary experimentation
show that the method can be very effective. Testing and theoretical research are
needed to determine how well the method works with different types of matrices.
More research is also needed to determine the best implementation.
