This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial Biology for
FY2003. The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of
protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are
not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides
opportunities for recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in
microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of
established scientists, and to broaden their scientific horizons beyond the
research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These
fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their
research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves
of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign
locations.

The research and training plan is entitled "Characterization of the relationship
between antlions and their bacterial symbionts." A bacterial symbiont of the
Japanese antlion Myrmeleon bore produces an insecticidal homologue of GroEL.
This research is identifying symbionts of North American antlion species that
produce a GroEL homologue and microscopically identifying antlion symbiotic
tissues. Other studies will decipher the role of symbionts and their GroEL
homologues in the health and behavior of their insect hosts.
