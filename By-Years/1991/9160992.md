Extractive methods, in which a sealed sample of air is analyzed in a laboratory,
are expensive and are inapplicable to continuous, in situ monitoring of
concentrations. The PIs propose the development of an instrument called a laser
interferometric absorptometer (LIA) to fill this need. The basis of this
instrument is the interferometric measurement of the optical-path change that
occurs immediately after a pulsed laser beam is absorbed by trace species
present in one arm of the interferometer. The LIA will be sensitive to parts-
per-trillion trace-gas concentrations, 203 orders of magnitude better than
instruments based on other approaches to monitor trace species in the field.
