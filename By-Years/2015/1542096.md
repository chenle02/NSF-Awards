This award provides support for students to participate in the Fourteenth Summer
School on Exotic Beam Physics at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, August 2 - 8,
2015. The school is designed for graduate students, senior undergraduate
students who are actively involved in research and postdocs (within 2 years of
their degree). The school will consist of morning lectures and hands-on
activities in the afternoons. Students will also have an opportunity to present
their research. The aim of the summer school is to nurture future scientists so
that the community will have sufficient manpower to effectively use the Facility
for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) when it comes online. In years to come,
substantial progress in low-energy nuclear physics will have a broad impact on
society, ranging from our understanding of the origin of the elements to the
enhancement of national security.
