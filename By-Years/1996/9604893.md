The experimental physics group at John's Hopkins proposes to continue their
experimental program at the CDF detector at Fermilab. This collider experiment
has been highly successful, recently discovering the last of the currently
expected quarks, the top-quark. This experiment is at the energy frontier in
particle physics, and is now being upgraded to operate at higher beam
intensities. Hopkins is playing an important role in the experiment and the
upgrade. This upgrade will allow more stringent tests of the standard model and
gives the experiment enhanced discovery potential. The Hopkins group has begun
to orient themselves towards the proposed CMS experiment at CERN. Their
experience at Fermilab should make them a valuable contributor at the energy
frontier of the future. /?Á %/¥Á ?> ¥©Á ??¥?>À ¢Á??Á>?Á ¼©?¢ ?Á¢Á/??© ?Á?Á%??¢ /
