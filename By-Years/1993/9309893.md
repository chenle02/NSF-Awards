There is evidence that malnutrition during childhood causes systematic dental
hypoplasias or deformities of particular kinds. This is still controversial,
because some scientists argue that such hypoplasias are, or can be, the result
of heredity, and are "naturally" occurring in different populations. This study
will establish the rates of dental hypoplasias in a large series of living
individuals who were children during one of the worst and most widespread
famines of human memory - in China from 1959-1961. In an examination of over
2,000 individuals in a rural and urban community, it will establish what the
changing rates of hypoplasias were before, during, and after the famine, what
the distinctions between urban and rural populations were, and whether sex
differences in effects are apparent. As the graduate student involved in the
project was a "barefoot doctor" in both these areas, access to the populations
is assured. This study will be very important in establishing baseline data for
bioarchaeological reconstructions of human nutrition in past populations, and
for nutritional surveys in underdeveloped countries with poor records.
