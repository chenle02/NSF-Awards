The purpose of this proposal is to develop and implement an experiment-based
hands-on program which will introduce girls in the 4th, 5th and 6th grades to
the physical sciences. The project is a collaborative effort between the
principal investigator who is a professor of Physics at the University of
Missouri and the Science Coordinator of the Columbia Public School System.
Several topics such as Optics, Sound, Electricity, Magnetism and Mechanics have
been selected to introduce girls to simple concepts in Physics through the
development of games, experiments, toys, art projects and laboratory
experiments. The project expects to motivate the girls by conveying that science
is fun, but more importantly, by familiarizing them with scientific equipment
and concepts. The program is an extra-curricular activity in its initial phase.
It is expected that the material developed will be integrated into the regular
curriculum in the future.
