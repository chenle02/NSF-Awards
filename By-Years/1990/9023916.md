The recipient of this FAW Award is a leader in interdisciplinary research on
benthic boundary flows, optics and particle concentrations. During this five
year award she participate in the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE), a
program to describe and understand the global ocean circulation, its decadal
changes and its influence on climate. Her specific interest is studying the
sources and sinks of particles in the ocean and the transformation and transport
process from production or introduction into the ocean to final incorporation
into the sediments. WOCE will provide and opportunity to measure the variability
of particulate matter concentration (PMC) throughout all oceans during the next
decade. She plans to plot the data in real time from transmissometers, which
respond to changes in particles in the water column and CTDs, which measure
Conductivity, Temperature and Depth, for selected WOCE cruises. The near term
emphasis will be on the Pacific Ocean.
