This project starts the development process leading to an articulation
arrangement between high schools, 2-year colleges, and the University of
Missouri-Columbia to provide multiple pathways for students to enhance their
technical education. The fields covered include: industrial automation, sensor
and identification technologies, programmable logic control, data logging and
acquisition, database development and data mining, computer and controller
internetworking. Other fields are also being explored as part of this planning
grant. The project is using the College of Engineering teaching laboratories at
the University of Missouri-Columbia during the "off hours," such as the evenings
and the summer, when the high schools and two-year associate programs can access
the technical facilities without incurring major capital expenditures. The
planning grant sets into motion the mechanisms by which the articulation
partnership can be realized, including the consultation of potential partners
from all sectors, the definition of programmatic entry points, curriculum
ramifications, and facility scheduling and utilization. As part of this pilot
program the laboratory facilities of the University of Missouri College of
Engineering are being used for the teaching and training curricula of the
Columbia Public Schools Career Center and State Fair Community College.
