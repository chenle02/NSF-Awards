This proposal aims to characterize the constitutive isoform of nitrate reductase
that is present in soybeans and uses either NADH or NADPH as reductant.
Monoclonal antibodies will be generated and used to study epitopes of this
isoform and also used to purify large quantities of this isoform by
immunoaffinity chromatography. The protein will then be characterized
biochemically, and a cDNA clone will be prepared by screening a lambda gt11
library. Nitrogen is the mineral nutrient that most often limits the growth of
agricultural crops. In well aerated soils, fertilizer nitrogen is mostly present
in the form of nitrate, which the plants must internally convert to ammonia
before the nitrogen can be used to produce the compounds that make up plant
proteins. The enzyme nitrate reductase initiates this conversion, and in soybean
there are three different forms of the enzyme present. The new work to be
carried out in Dr. John Smarrelli's laboratory provides fundamental information
about the properties of one specific form of this enzyme. Successful completion
of this approach can be expected to provide insights that will ultimately assist
in increasing the efficiency of the process of nitrate utiliztion by plants.
