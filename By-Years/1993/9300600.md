This award provides funds to the Biology Department of Furman University to
continue a successful Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site. The program
will provide a stimulating biological research experience for 12 students this
coming summer. Talented students will be recruited from Furman University and
smaller, less research-oriented colleges in South Carolina. The program is
especially aimed at women, minority students, and persons with disabilities, and
such individuals will make up the majority of the participants. Half the
students will be rising seniors and half will be rising sophomores. Six research
groups will be formed, each consisting of a senior, a sophomore, and a faculty
research director. Students many choose to work on research projects in areas
ranging from ecology to molecular biology. The goal of this program is to
support productive, publishable research involving undergraduates, with a
special focus on promising younger students. The program builds on a strong
tradition of undergraduate research in a liberal arts environment at Furman, and
a successful NSF-REU program over the past two summers.
