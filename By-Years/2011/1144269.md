Up to 30 students will receive travel grants to attend the 2011 Wireless
Innovation Forum Conference on Communications Technologies and Software Defined
Radio, to be held in Washington DC, November 29th - December 2nd. The grants
will provide partial support for travel, housing, and conference attendance.
Software-defined radio technology will become increasingly important as the
foundation of wireless communications, and attendance at the conference will
expose students to many technical and practical aspects of the technology.
