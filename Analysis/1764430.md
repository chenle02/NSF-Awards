This award provides funding for US participation in the conference "Research
Term on Real Harmonic Analysis and its Applications to Partial Differential
Equations and Geometric Measure Theory" that will be held May 7-June 8, 2018 at
the 2018, at Instituto de Ciencias Matematicas in Madrid, Spain.

The conference focuses on recent developments in Analysis, especially in the
fields of Harmonic Analysis, Geometric Measure Theory, and Partial Differential
Equations. A number of distinguished mathematicians have agreed to attend and
speak at this conference. This award gives early career researchers, members of
underrepresented groups, researchers not funded by NSF and the like an
opportunity to attend and participate in this conference. The organizing
committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to target groups
through a number of different activities. More information will be made
available at:
