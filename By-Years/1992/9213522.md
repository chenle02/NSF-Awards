It is proposed to analyze the non-linear response of the Earth's magnetospheric
system as driven by the solar wind. The newly developed technique of non-linear
input/output analysis will determine the non-linear behavior of the
magnetosphere. Previous linear analyses have been incapable of exploring the
non-linear dynamics; previous non-linear analyses have treated the magnetosphere
as an autonomous system, which clearly neglects the major effects of the solar
wind. Under the assumption that the electrojet indices are valid diagnostics of
the state and dynamics of the magnetosphere, the time series of the electrojet
indices will be analyzed as a function of the solar wind parameters for the
years 1978 and 1979. The identification of low dimensional non- linear dynamics
in the magnetospheric system will lead to much better short term predictions of
the solar wind and magnetosphere. conversely, a definite demonstration of the
absence of such deterministic behavior will help to guide future efforts aimed
at modelling the magnetosphere.
