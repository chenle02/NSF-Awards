Due to the dynamics of plate interactions, deformation and fabrics resulting
from deformation are expected to form sequentially and diachronously across an
orogen. However, it has been difficult to directly date deformation fabrics
sufficiently accurately to detect the propagation of deformation. This project
will utilize an area in the western Alps where temperature during deformation
remained low so that the fabric-forming common white mica should have refrained
radiogenic argon. The work will attempt to date deformation in four basement-
cored nappes of the Grand Saint-Bernard Nappe complex. Results should
distinguish between cooling ages and deformation ages, thus providing the basis
for a very detailed tectonic interpretation of the progress of fabric
development during orogenesis.
