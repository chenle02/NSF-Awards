This SBIR Phase I project will use a proprietary on-site chlorine/mixed oxidant
generator (MIOX) for UV-assisted chemical oxidation of ammonia and natural
organic matter (NOM). If chlorine-UV is a feasible advanced oxidation process,
then the range of uses for the MIOX process may be greatly extended. The project
will address oxidation of organics, including NOM, and the potential reduced
formation of disinfection by-products when an Advanced Oxidation Process is
used. Disinfection byproducts formation with NOM and its model compounds is an
important issue. The project will also address the potential use of sunlight as
a UV source, and the effectiveness of short and long wavelength UV.

The broader/commercial impacts of the proposed project will be a proof of
feasibility for applications of the MIOX technology to food and beverage
processors. If successful, the interest in MIOX technology indicates that
broadened applications should be readily accepted by the commercial market.
