*** 9731604 The Physics Department at Rensselaer will continue a REU Site
program for weeks to be held in each summer from 1998 to 2000. The program will
involve 10 undergraduate students, at least six from other institutions, to
participate in frontier physics research by pairing up with senior graduate
students under the supervision of experienced faculty members. The available
projects cover a variety of topics including Astrophysics, Condensed Matter
Physics, Optical Physics, Particle and Nuclear Physics, and Innovative
Undergraduate Physics Education. Our philosophy of the undergraduate research
project is to let the students experience the challenge, the excitement, and
sometimes frustrations in research outside the lecture room. The final goal is
to attract and encourage talented students into careers in science and
engineering. ***
