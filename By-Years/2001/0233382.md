This project will address the need for improved evaluations of STEM projects by
(1) establishing collaborations that develop and test more sophisticated
evaluation models (working through evaluation associations to obtain input from
a wide array of evaluation experts), and (2) working with directors and other
stakeholders of STEM projects to implement and iteratively refine these models.
Using evaluation and content experts to assist a sample of STEM projects from
three EHR programs (including MSP), the project will develop state-of-the-art
evaluation models that are context-sensitive. The project will support the
development of professional communities of teachers, researchers, evaluators,
cognitive scientists, and social scientists, and others who depend on evaluation
for continued improvement and to generate new knowledge.
