This award will support a three-year effort in the Caltech shock wave laboratory
to measure properties of rocky and metallic liquids under conditions matching
those in the deepest parts of the Earth. This information is critical to
interpreting geophysical observations of the lower mantle and core in terms of
composition, temperature, heat flow, and evolution over time. It also allows
speculative ideas about an early molten earth to be developed into detailed
theories. Shock compression is the only experimental method that can
simultaneously measure density, pressure, temperature, energy, and sound speed
of liquids at such extreme conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The experimental and
science agenda in this proposal is driven by key technical advances. Development
of an encapsulation technique allowing us to pre-heat silicate glasses well
above their melting point without formation of bubbles and in sealed behind a
transparent window allows us to observe thermal radiation from the shocked
liquid. Measurement of temperatures and sound speeds in shocked magmas will
complete our ability to describe their properties at any desired pressure and
temperature. Likewise, the development of graded density impactors for
customized shock-and-ramp loading paths, together with our pre-heating
capability and development of advanced window materials enabled measurement of
the sound speeds and densities of liquid iron alloys along actual outer core
temperature profiles. This novel experimental measurement will make the well-
defined observed gradient in sound speed with depth in the outer core a new and
critical constraint on outer core composition.
