This research project is a renewal of EAR8318909, differing by its focus on
regional source areas, distribution of loess, and properties of paleosols in the
wind-blown loess deposits on the Columbia Plateau, Washington. Thirty loess
exposures will be mapped, described and sampled. Key volcanic marker layers will
be studied, thermoluminescent dating and analysis of loess and examination of
chemical properties of paleosols will be undertaken. Outcomes of this research
include identification of loess source regions, knowledge variations in
paleosols in response to paleoclimatic regimes, and identification of episodes
of cataclysmic flooding in association with activities of the Cordilleran Ice
Sheet. The Palouse loess sequences of Washington contain the most complete
record of Quaternary paleoclimatic history in the U.S. Also of practical
importance, the region is under consideration for a nuclear waste repository.
and a detailed stratigraphy of the area is of vital importance to the nation.
