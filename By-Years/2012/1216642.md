Algorithms based on spectral techniques tend to be fast and to have a simple and
elegant structure; their analysis helps explain the empirically good performance
of related heuristics that are adopted in practice; and their analysis often
uncovers useful mathematical relationships between algebraic and combinatorial
graph invariants, which can have useful applications outside of algorithm
design. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research supported by this grant explores new
algorithms for cut and clustering problems, rigorous justifications for popular
spectral clustering heuristics, and various relationships between the spectral
profile of a graph and its combinatorial properties. The PI and his
collaborators will study the use of multiple eigenvectors of the Laplacian
matrix of a graph in the design of clustering algorithms, they will provide
rigorous analyses of clustering heuristics based on multiple eigenvectors, and
will explore combinatorial characterizations of eigenvalue near-multiplicities.
New approaches to the use of random walks and other probabilistic processes will
be explored in the design of graph partitioning
algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI is working on a monograph on the three
related themes of sparsest cut approximation algorithms, constructions of
expander graphs, and analysis of random walks in graphs. The three topics are
closely related mathematically, but they are pursued by largely distinct
community; the monograph will emphasize the connection and encourage researchers
in each of the three areas to pursue research in the others.
