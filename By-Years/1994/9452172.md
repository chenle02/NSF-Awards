Western Carolina University is seeking to improve its existing Electron
Microscope Facility through the purchase of specimen preparation equipment
including a micro tome, diamond knife, and resin oven as well as a critical-
point dryer, sputter coater, and energy dispersive x-ray detection system. The
equipment will be used primarily in undergraduate education and research in the
Department of Biology, although other disciplines will also be affected. A new
course, "Techniques in Electron Microscopy" has been implemented in order to
instruct students in the theory and use of the requested equipment.
