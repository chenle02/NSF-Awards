This project studies the formation of policies that affect international trade
and the global environment. While the trade literature has devoted much
attention to identifying policies that maximize aggregate welfare, relatively
little effort has been made to understand what policies will emerge from a
realistic political process in which policy makers must respond to the demands
of both special interests and the general electorate. A political economy model
has been developed in which elected officials respond to political incentives.
This model will be extended and applied to consider such problems as the
equilibrium structure of protection, the government's choice of trade policy
instrument, the interaction between trade and environmental policies (and
between the interest groups that support these two types of interventions), and
the interaction between governments of different countries in both cooperative
and noncooperative settings. The ultimate aim of the research is to evaluate
alternative institutional "rules of the game" for the world trading system. It
is hoped that rules will be identified that will facilitate a liberal trading
regime with greatest mutual benefits from trade and with efficient cooperation
on international environmental matters. In order to accomplish this, the
theoretical framework must first be developed and refined so that emerging
policy outcomes can be predicted under different possible institutional
constraints.
