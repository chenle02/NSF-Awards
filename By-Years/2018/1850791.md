This research project will combine several large data sets and use up-do-date
economic methods to investigate whether investment in health by parents is
transmitted to future generations and if so, the mechanisms through which this
occur. Economists and policy makers know a lot about the effects of the adoption
of Medicaid and Medicare on the beneficiaries of these programs but know very
little about whether these effects are transmitted to the recipients' off-
springs and how this transmission takes place. Understanding if and how the
benefits of investment in health is passed on to future generations is important
for discussions of health policy, such as expansion of Medicare and Medicaid
under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The results of this research may suggest
that the benefits of current period investment in health should be expanded to
include benefits that may accrue to future
generations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will merge several administrative
data sets with Medicaid coverage and Vital Statistics data to investigate the
intergenerational effects of childhood Medicaid coverage on the health of
children in the next generation. Two issues are investigated in this research
project: (i) how does Medicaid affect the size and composition of the next
generation and (ii) how does Medicaid affect infant health in the next
generation. The project also investigates the mechanisms through which these
effects might occur. The empirical approach uses a quasi-experimental design
that relies on wide historical variation in state- and cohort-level exposure to
health insurance due to the original introduction of Medicaid in the 1960s. The
results of this research project will substantially add to our knowledge of the
inter-generational effects of Medicaid and health investment generally and
contribute to health policy in the US and around the
world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
