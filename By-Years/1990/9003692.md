This application proposes an international cooperation among three American and
three Soviet laboratories. The scientific objective is to define the relative
movements between myosin subfragment 1 (S-1) and actin (in complex) under the
influence of ATP hydrolysis going on in S-1. These movements, underlying muscle
contraction and some cell motility, are thought to accomplish energy
transduction (free energy of ATP hydrolysis to mechanical (force x distance)
work). Optically-detected molecular probes are to be used in pairs, either to
detect correlated re-orientation or to detect change in scalar distances, the
purpose being to decide whether the movements in transduction are a global
rotation of S-1 caused by very small internal displacements (present "standard
model") or whether internal movements encompass most of S-1 (as in interdomain
movement). Efforts will be made---using differential scanning calorimetry
circular dichroism---to obtain indications of domain structure, and also to
examine the effect of crosslinks on the putative movements of these domains.
Attempts also will be made to develop both physical (S-1 on oriented pure
F-actin) and molecular graphic models in order to simplify the foregoing
studies. Besides the six senior investigators, several students and young
associates would participate in this work. The principal significance of this
proposal is basic. Since no biological energy transducer has yet been explained,
the possibility of discovering design features also may be of practical
interest.
