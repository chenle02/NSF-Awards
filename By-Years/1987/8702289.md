This research project involves an international collaboration between Professors
J. Natowitz and R. Schmitt of Texas A&M University (TAMU), and Professors M.E.
Brendan and A. Menchacha Rocha of the Physics Institute of the Universidad
Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM). The collaborators intend to study properties
of nuclei having very high excitation energies within temperatures approaching
the average binding energy per nucleon. To the research they will bring to bear
the latest experimental facilities such as: i) a new K500 superconducting
cyclotron located at TAMU that will greatly increase the energy and mass of
particles useful for nuclear experiments; ii) an advanced neutron ball
multiplicity detector, which acts as a very powerful filter in studying both
nuclear reaction mechanisms and the properties of highly excited nuclei; and
iii) discrete phostron detectors, to be designed and constructed by the UNAM
group, which will greatly enhance the utility of the neutron ball detector. The
investigators will focus on important aspects of intermediate energy heavy ion
collision using sophisticated techniques and equipment. The U.S. investigators
have made valuable contributions to the present understanding of reaction and
particle emission mechanisms, and the Mexican investigators also possess
expertise in experimental heavy ion science at low and intermediate energies.
The degree of interaction between the two experienced groups of researchers
increases the likelihood that the project will be one of mutual benefit, thus
fulfilling a prime objective of the U.S.-Mexico Program. Given the researchers
past records, the potential for significant advance is very high.
