Affect control theory is a mathematical model that describes how social roles,
behaviors, and emotions are related to one another. This project uses five
studies to test predictions from the theory. The first study tests the theory in
natural settings by sampling people's emotions at random times throughout their
normal waking activities. It will be one of the first studies to get a
representative sample of the emotions that people actually experience. The
theory argues that people's emotions should change in specific ways when they
change from one role to another. The second study will use subjects' reactions
to descriptions of unusual events (presented to them under controlled laboratory
conditions) to test ideas about how these atypical situations may influence
emotional responses. The third and fourth studies test predictions about how
other peoples' emotional reactions influence what we think about them. The fifth
study pursues some practical implications of this idea for the criminal justice
system. If the theory is true, the sentences handed down to convicted criminals
are influenced in counterintuitive ways by their emotional displays.
