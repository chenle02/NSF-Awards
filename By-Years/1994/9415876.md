This two-year award will support U.S.-France cooperative research in
theoretical nuclear physics. The American and French investigators are Stuart
Pittel of the Bartol Research Institute at the University of Delaware and
Jonathan Engel of the University of North Carolina and Piet van Isacker of GANIL
(Grand Accelerateur National d' Ions Lourds) in Caen, France. The objective of
their research is the application of nuclear structure techniques to
astrophysical nucleosynthesis. They will study beta decay from neutron rich
`waiting point` nuclei which play an important role in the r-process.
Subsequently, they will develop techniques for studying p-process beta decay.
The U.S. investigators bring to this collaboration their expertise in
calculations as applied to nuclear astrophysics. This is complemented by the
French experimental studies in nuclei far from stability. The project takes
advantage of combined expertise in nuclear structure calculations and of access
to excellent facilities and equipment at GANIL.
