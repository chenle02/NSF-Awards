This two-year project describes a model for a General Chemistry Laboratory for
science and engineering majors that enables students to learn how to function as
practicing scientists and engineers. They will work in teams on
interdisciplinary, open-ended, inquiry-based projects reflecting current
technical challenges in the disciplines representing their career goals. Faculty
from biochemistry, chemistry, and various engineering disciplines helped develop
the projects and will work with students as instructors and consultants.
Students will communicate results via scientific papers peer-reviewed by other
students and via oral poster presentations. A Web Journal of General Chemistry
will be created in which students can report their findings to a national
audience. As they work with students, collaborating faculty will be challenged
to explore student-centered pedagogy through which students formulate the
investigative questions themselves. Assessment of student learning will be based
in part on the written scientific papers and oral poster sessions. An Advisory
Committee, consisting of faculty members from chemistry and engineering at other
academic institutions, high-school teachers, and industrial scientists, will
meet biannually to help evaluate student and faculty progress. Formative and
summative evaluations will be performed by a faculty member in the education
department using pre- and post-test of science process skills and understanding
of science, and interviews with students and faculty about their learning
experiences. Students will be surveyed periodically for up-to five years after
completing the course. Dissemination routes include the student Web Journal,
beta-test sites at St. Anselm and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, national
meeting presentations, commercial publication of the companion/manual and
publication in prominent journals.
