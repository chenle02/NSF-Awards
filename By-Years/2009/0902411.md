The Albuquerque region is home to large government laboratories, large technical
industries and many small high technology companies. The Southwest Center for
Microsystem Education (SCME), a collaboration of the University of New Mexico,
Central New Mexico Community College (CNM) , and the Southwest Indian
Polytechnic Institute (SIPI), increases the educational capacity of the region
to produce technicians skilled in supporting microelectromechanical system
(MEMS) research, design, and commercialization. The regional center builds on
its previous work to establish workforce needs and standards to engage academia,
industry and government in identifying microsystem technician competencies,
while also increasing awareness of career opportunities in MEMS by community
college and high school students. Based on a needs assessment and building on
prior experience, learning modules and kits are developed to enhance
microsystem-focused programs and curricula in high schools and community
colleges. Thirty more shared-content object (SCO) suites are created to support
new topics in MEMS fabrication, characterization, instrumentation and career
exploration. Hands-on kits that bring elements of the cleanroom fabrication
experience into the classroom are developed and disseminated. The Center
continues to provide professional development workshops for high school,
community college and four-year college faculty. Each year four one-day
introductory awareness workshops and four five-day cleanroom short courses are
offered - one workshop is offered to tribal colleges. The Center increases
interest in MEMS in high-school age populations by working in high schools that
have large numbers of students from underrepresented groups and with their
teachers. The effectiveness of the materials and professional development is
evaluated.
