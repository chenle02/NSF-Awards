The acoustic microscope is a recently invented device for observing the
mechanical properties of material. It has been observed that these observations
are enhanced by the use of non-specular reflections and by high acoustic
intensities. This research continues a research program to apply confocal but
non-aligned beams to improve the edge contrast, detail, and resolution in
acoustic microscopy. Variations in the geometry of the instrument and
combinations of transducers determine the usefulness of the new configuration.
This research has application in non-destructive testing, microbiology, and
other areas.
