The failure of many forms of vegetation to regenerate results both from human-
induced environmental change processes and natural processes. Moreover, both
types of impacts may be constrained within the normal dynamics of certain
species. In the case of long-lived species that are capable of cyclic
regeneration patterns, it is necessary to conduct historical biogeographical
studies in order to interpret their regeneration status. Absence of seedlings
and saplings in California oak woodlands indicates that the present rate of oak
regeneration is insufficient to maintain existing stands. Evidence suggests that
the failure to regenerate is a result of human-induced environmental change
associated with European settlement. This doctoral dissertation project will
reconstruct the history of oak woodlands in California over the last 500 years.
Fossil pollen analyses and an automated image analysis system to quantify
changes in charcoal abundance will be used to assess the impact of European
settlement on oak regeneration and fire frequency. This project will provide a
history of vegetation change essential to understanding changes in regeneration
over time and to evaluating the extent to which the current failure of
California oaks to regenerate is caused by human-induced change. This project
also will provide an excellent opportunity for a promising young scholar to
continue to develop independent research skills.
