Given the importance of dogs to northern culture and their intertwined
relationship to humans, this research project is designed to address questions
related to the timing and spread of dogs from Asia to Alaska and
Canada/Greenland and the development of local breeds. Using modern genetic
methods to extract DNA from tooth and bone remains from well dated
archaeological contexts in combination with radiocarbon-dating and analysis of
recent samples, the PIs propose to (1) Provide a detailed temporal-spatial
analysis of dog remains across the North American Arctic, (2) analyze the
genetic history of prehistoric, contact period, and modern Arctic dogs using
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and the Y chromosome, and (3) contribute to
anthropological and archaeological discussions concerning the movements and
cultural interactions of indigenous peoples across the north.
