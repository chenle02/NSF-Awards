Some attempts to understand surfactant adsorption on the molecular level have
recently been reported although the effect of electrostatic interactions between
the adsorbing surface and the surfactant are still poorly understood. As a
result, most current descriptions of surfactant adsorption remain empirical and
thus are not predictive. This investigation uses a modification of the most
recent theoretical models to predict the adsorption of singly charged
surfactants as well as experimental adsorption measurements to test the results
of the modeling. This project is unique in the use of the observation that
surfactant adsorption can increase with increasing surface charge density of the
same sign. This result may be due to changes in the configuration of the
adsorbed materials brought on by electrostatic repulsions between their ionic
end groups and the adsorbing surface. The changes in adsorption behavior that
have been observed are quite large indicating significant changes at the
molecular level. By experimenting in a region where surfactant adsorption is
very sensitive to surface charge density, the greatest amount of information
about electrostatic interactions is obtained in this work. Surface active
materials are used in many processes today and are likely to find even wider
application in the future. The impact of a better understanding of the
adsorption process for surface active agents is manyfold. Current trends in
chemical processing are towards micro-engineering, control of processes at the
molecular level. Surfactants are one of the major means of obtaining this
control. The results of this investigation could find immediate application in
such fields as flotation, dispersion, separations and ceramic processing-- with
future applications in microelectronics.
