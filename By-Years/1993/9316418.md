9316418 Baldwin New Caledonia occurs as a mainly continental fragment on the
Norfolk Ridge System in the southwest Pacific, and records deformation between
ocean crust of the Pacific plate and continental crust of the Indian plate
subsequent to the break-up of the eastern margin of Gondwana. The high-pressure
metamorphic belt of New Caledonia is one of the youngest blueschist and eclogite
belts on earth. This study is part of a large international project on New
Caledonia, and involves an age dating program on these rocks. Results will
provide age constraints on various events in the tectonic evolution of New
Caledonia and its relationship to New Zealand and Australia along the eastern
margin of Gondwana. ***
