The two most important problems that allow for the efficient use of parallel
processing power can be identified as detection of parallelism in computer
programs and scheduling of the resulting parallel tasks on a target machine.
This work is concerned with both of these problems. It is only recently that
some researchers are concentrating on the detection of parallelism in ordinary
(non-scientific) application programs. The research to be developed subsequent
to the completion of the planning period will concentrate on detection of
parallelism and determination of optimal task granularity in ordinary computer
programs and processor scheduling and synchronization in multiprocessor
environments. The research planning period mainly consists of plans for spending
certain periods of time in residence in leading research sites around the
country in order to get involved in the ongoing research in these sites and
broaden the proposer's basis for doing independent research.
