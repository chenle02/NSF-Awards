9511804 Steven Bressler The aim of this research project is to understand how
different parts of the brain work together to allow us to move based on what we
see. These scientists are designing sophisticated computer analysis techniques
to measure properties of brain signals that occur when the brain must interpret
visual patterns and use the information to make a movement. In previous research
by these investigators, brain waves from the visual and motor parts of the
cerebral cortex were found to briefly become aligned when the brain was deciding
how to respond to a visual pattern, suggesting that the alignment od wavelike
signals in the cortex is important for brain function. The objectives of this
project are: (1) to observe how the normal brain processes visual input signals
and transforms them into motor command signals, and (2) to advance our general
understanding of similar large-scale integration problems which arise in many
engineering applications.
