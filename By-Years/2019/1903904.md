This travel grant supports students and early career researchers to participate
in an interdisciplinary workshop. The meeting will stimulate discussion between
the geophysics and mechanics/engineering communities. They will identify
outstanding problems and advance the state-of-the-art in mechanical models for
geophysical problems. Scientific areas for collaboration include rock mechanics,
seismology, physical volcanology and fracture mechanics. Dealing with big data
and more realistic models will be a focus of the effort. The meeting will take
place at the University of California, San Diego.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
