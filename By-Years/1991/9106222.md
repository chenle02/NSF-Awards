This project is concerned with the construction of the quantum analogs of
enveloping algebras, their representation theory, and solutions to the quantum
Yang-Baxter equation on representation spaces. The principal investigator will
use a module theoretic approach to the quantum Yang-Baxter equation. Particular
emphasis will be given to classifying solutions in the 2-dimensional case. The
class of finite dimensional quasitriangular Hopf algebras will also be studied
with attention given to categorical constructions. Quantum groups are a new area
of research for both mathematicians and physicists. On the mathematical side, it
combines three of the oldest areas of "pure" mathematics, algebra, analysis and
geometry, yet it is of great interest to physicists working in conformal quantum
field theory.
