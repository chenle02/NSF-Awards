In this project a team of 3 US P.I.'s will collaborate with collaborators from
several other countries to deploy an array of surface drifters in the equatorial
Pacific in support of the TOGA (Tropical Ocean and Global Atmosphere) Programme.
The drifters will provide data on surface and subsurface temperature and surface
currents. Scientific goals are to map Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and
currents, understand processes responsible for annual and interannual
variability in SST, and improve operational Pacific Ocean models.
