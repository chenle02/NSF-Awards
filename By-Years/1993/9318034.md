9318034 Arp This proposal is requesting support for a symposium on the
strategies and adaptations of organisms that live in environments containing
hydrogen sulfide. The objective of the symposium is to bring together scientists
from different disciplines (e.g. physiology, microbiology, ecology, molecular
biology) to present a current overview of the state of knowledge. The discussion
will be on a variety of organisms in different habitats. The speakers are also
from different geographic areas, and include many women and young investigators.
It is hoped that this meeting will provide both a synthesis of what has been
learned as well as new directions for the field. ***
