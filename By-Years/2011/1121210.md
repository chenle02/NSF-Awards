Intellectual merit: Genes consist of DNA. In order for the genetic information
to be expressed, the DNA must be transcribed into an RNA message. This RNA in
turn directs synthesis of the proteins through which the cell carries out its
various functions. In the cell, genes are tightly packaged by proteins within
chromosomes. It is now clear that control of gene expression is exerted not only
by direct influence on the machinery which transcribes the DNA into the RNA
message, but also by other events which regulate chromosomal unfolding. However,
it is not understood how genes are selectively revealed to the molecular
machinery that transcribes the genetic information into RNA messages. The
studies which will be carried out in this project are intended to provide a
mechanistic understanding of the processes through which genes are transcribed
in the chromosomal context. Thus, the results from this research should be
broadly applicable in elucidating the pathways through which all genes are
controlled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: The work carried out in this
project should have an important educational impact in several ways. First, it
is expected that a significant fraction of this research will be performed by
undergraduates. Students majoring in the life sciences may be attracted to
careers in research; however, classroom instruction and the typical
undergraduate lab exercises do not introduce them to either the excitement or
the complexities of an actual hypothesis-driven research project. Because of
long-standing relationships between the host institution and local undergraduate
colleges it is likely that students will be able to participate in this project
not only full-time during the summer but on a part-time basis during the
academic year as well. There will also be an impact of the proposed work in the
classroom. The cutting-edge research approaches to be employed in this work can
be directly applied by the principal investigator for advanced instruction in
the areas of gene expression and gene regulation.
