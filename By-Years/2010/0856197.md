Brown&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator will continue studying approximation
properties of operator algebras, concentrating on fundamental questions arising
in C*- and W*-algebra theory. For example, Elliott's classification program took
a dramatic turn when counterexamples were constructed by Rordam and Toms.
However, recent work of Winter strongly suggests that the classification of
algebras which are "finite dimensional" (in a suitable noncommutative
topological sense) should be classifiable. We will investigate the
classification problem for these algebras, but utilizing a different invariant
-- one that turns out to be functorially equivalent to the classical Elliott
invariant, but formally carries much more information. In a W*-direction, we
will continue our study of topological spaces associated to II_1 factors which
admit microstates (in the sense of Voiculescu). These topological invariants
haven't yet been systematically investigated, so it's quite natural to explore
them. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One very successful idea in mathematics is that we
can learn about complicated objects by approximating with simpler objects, then
passing to a limit. For example, in calculus we compute the area under a curve
using rectangular approximations, then refining the approximations over and
over. Operator algebras are (usually) infinite dimensional objects which provide
the natural framework for quantum mechanics, for example. Moreover, deep and
unexpected connections with other areas of mathematics such as geometry,
topology and probability were discovered over the years. As such, a solid
understanding of the structure of operator algebras is important. The general
philosophy of using approximations by simpler objects becomes especially
relevant here since the objects of interest are infinite dimensional. The
investigator will continue an established tradition of trying to use finite
dimensional approximations to better understand some fundamental infinite
dimensional objects.
