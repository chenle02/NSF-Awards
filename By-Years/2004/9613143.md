ABSTRACT Proposal Number: CTS-9613143 Principal Investigator: Spall, Utah State
The objectives of this investigation, involving two universities, are: (i) To
carry out complementary experimental and numerical research in order to explore
the structure and dynamics of vortex breakdown in turbulent swirling flows; (ii)
To elucidate the physics of the phenomena and provide archival-quality
experimental data for the assessment and validation of CFD codes with
anisotropic turbulence models and for current as well as future scientific and
technological developments; (iii) To carefully assess existing phenomenological
models; (iv) To develop an understanding of the consequences of turbulence on
vortex breakdown for its intellectual challenge and technological applications
in aerodynamics, in combustion, and in general, in the development of effective
flow control strategies in devices employing swirl dynamics. It is intended that
this study would lead to reliable computer codes which might be used for
industrial research and design. This grant is for the numerical component. A
matching grant was made to the Naval Postgraduate School for the experimental
phase (CTS-9612528).
