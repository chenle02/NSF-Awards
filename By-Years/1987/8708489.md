Fourier transform mass spectrometry (FTMS) has excellent inherent capabilities
of very high mass resolution, sensitivity and speed in data collection that give
it enormous potential in geochronology and other isotope geochemistry
applications. A team of geoscientists at the State University of New York-
Albany has recently installed a FTMS system purchased with NSF and SUNY funds on
a 50-50 cost-sharing basis. This proposal requests funds to support a
postdoctoral research associate for two years to aid in the development of FTMS
applications for the geosciences. The research associate will focus during this
period on optimizing the precision of isotope ratio measurements, including RF
excitation sweep and mass fractionation effects, and on measurements of Pb/U
ratios in zircons. The immediate goal of this project is to determine the
applicability of the FTMS method for samples encountered in earth science
research.
