This project seeks to examine what it is about mathematics that elementary
teachers need to know and appreciate, and where and how in teaching such
understandings and appreciation are used. Two enduring questions are at the
heart of contemporary efforts to improve mathematics
instruction:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;o What mathematical knowledge is entailed by
the work of teaching mathematics? &lt;br/&gt;o Where and how is mathematical
knowledge entailed, and how would it be useful and used, within the work of
teaching mathematics? How is mathematical knowledge intertwined with other
knowledge and sensibilities in the course of that
work?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within the term "knowledge" the project includes
content (e.g., topics, theorems, definitions, algorithms) as well as practices
and sensibilities. What it might mean, and what it would take, for elementary
teachers to teach in ways that are respectful of both students and the
mathematics. What could it mean to have "mathematical integrity" as an
elementary teacher? The project will also seek to locate the mathematical
aspects of elementary teaching -- the tasks, moments, and challenges -- where
what a teacher can hear, see, do, and say depends on mathematical
knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rather than asking these questions by examining
curriculum frameworks or standards of what teachers are supposed to teach, the
project works in and from practice. Our investigations take us first into
investigations of the practices of teaching and learning mathematics, as well as
into the practices of mathematics itself. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Central to this
work is a large longitudinal NSF-funded database, documenting an entire year of
Ball's third grade public school teaching during 1989-90. By analyzing these
detailed records of practice, we seek to develop theory of mathematical
knowledge as it is entailed by and used in teaching, to consider instruction
over time, examining the work of teachers in developing mathematics and their
students across the school year. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Products of this project
will include detailed analyses of the mathematics entailed in elementary school
teaching, as well as grounded theory about the nature and uses of mathematical
content, practice, and sensibilities in the day-to-day work of teaching. Written
products will target different audiences with interests in this work.
