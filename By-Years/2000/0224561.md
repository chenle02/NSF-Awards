0224561 Alvarez Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are ubiquitous
pollutants that can bioaccumulate and can be acutely toxic. Some plants can
enhance the degradation of PAHs by stimulating microbiological activity in the
root zone (rhizosphere) of plants.&lt;br/&gt;This phytoremediation is an
attractive process where climatic conditions are favorable as in the tropics.
Root exudates from tropical plants will be screened for their ability to enhance
PAH degradation and the mechanism of enhancement studied. The humification and
sequestration of PAHs into soil will be examined as an acceptable low-cost
treatment.&lt;br/&gt;
