Dr. Rand and graduate student Sharon Meidt will apply a new method to measure
how fast the spiral and bar patterns of disk galaxies rotate about the galaxy
center. These patterns are found in most disk galaxies, including our own Milky
Way. Classical theories of spiral structure posit that an unstable disk of stars
develops a set of growing modes, each with a fixed pattern speed. Structures
with multiple pattern speeds, interpreted as coupled modes, have been seen in
gravitational N-body simulations of galaxy disks; generally, the faster pattern
dominates closer to the center. Dr Rand and collaborator Michael Merrifield have
developed the 'modified Tremaine-Weinberg' method to test whether observed
spiral galaxies also have multiple pattern speeds. This method will be applied
to seven nearby spiral galaxies for which the velocity field has been well
mapped in CO and neutral hydrogen gas. This method will directly measure of the
pattern speed to test theoretical models for the formation of spiral structure,
and to determine whether the spirals are winding up over time.

The University of New Mexico is both a research university and a Hispanic-
serving institution. The work will form the PhD thesis of a woman graduate
student.
