Education Development Center, Inc. (EDC) and partners serve as the resource
center for the ITEST program and community. This new iteration of the Learning
Resource Center is re-named the STEM Learning and Research Center (STELAR) to
represent the growing need to broaden the existing Community of Practice and
share lessons learned with an increasingly diverse field of stakeholders. Among
various other accomplishments in its nine-year tenure leading the LRC, EDC has
provided leadership in building a thriving and highly engaged community of ITEST
PIs, project staff and evaluators, developed a well-regarded model of technical
support and programmatic resource center infrastructure, raised the national
visibility of the ITEST program and the collective impact of its grantees, and
helped disseminate key project findings to the field through data briefs, public
webinars, and working group activities. The STELAR team brings their collective
expertise in capacity building, broadening participation, and career development
to this new work. That team is enriched through a new partnership with the EdLab
Group, an educational equity non-profit organization, who brings considerable
expertise to this work, in particular through the National Girls Collaborative
Project. EdLab Group is involved in the implementation of key dissemination and
outreach activities leveraging their experience developing national networks and
collaborative dissemination models, and their extensive connections to
broadening participation communities. In addition, EdLab Group has primary
responsibility for the social media work of STELAR as it supports and deepens
the technical support, dissemination and outreach work.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This partnership builds upon past EDC successes, leverages
wider networks and connects with audiences who are not currently aware of ITEST.
Together, EDC and EdLab Group capitalize on the vibrant ITEST Community of
Practice already developed and the existing knowledge base of the ITEST program
to expand efforts in new directions that build on what has been learned, develop
new relationships, and broaden outreach to targeted stakeholders. STELAR focuses
on three primary areas of work, namely: 1) Facilitating projects' success
through timely, high quality technical support and monitoring of projects
throughout their implementation lifecycle; 2) Informing and influencing the
field of STEM/ICT education practitioners and researchers, industry and policy
stakeholders by disseminating project findings nationally; and 3) Deepening the
impact and reach of the ITEST program by broadening participation to areas and
institutions not currently represented in the ITEST portfolio.
