This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To date, E. coli serves as the only
cellular system for which a complete replication fork can be reconstituted from
purified proteins. In this project, a highly divergent bacterium, Baccilus
subtilis, will be explored to learn what principles established from the E. coli
model are general and what variations can be employed for the rapid, processive,
coordinated replication of a chromosome. B. subtilis is an attractive system in
that regard. Through genetic, molecular and cell biology work it is known that
two distinct replicases are required, unlike the E. coli system where the DNA
polymerase III holoenzyme alone suffices. The two-replicase system is
reminiscent of eukaryotic systems. It is also known that two proteins are
required to load the helicase, unlike E. coli, but perhaps similar to the
suspected Orc6/Cdt1 requirement in eukaryotes. B. subtilis also employs two
novel proteins, DnaD and DnaB, that have no homologs in E. coli. Thirteen
proteins, predicted from genetics, have been expressed and purified and have
been used to reconstitute a robust, rolling circle replicative reaction that
recapitulates the general features of B. subtilis chromosomal replication in
vivo. A rigorous study will be conducted to elucidate the cooperative
interactions of replication proteins that participate in the helicase assembly
process. The function of the two replicases, DnaE and PolC, will be perturbed to
gain fundamental information regarding their
function.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Completion of the program will lead to an
important mechanistic understanding of DNA replication in a diverse model
organism. Fundamental knowledge will also serve as a prototype for comparative
studies in less tractable eukaryotic systems. The program will increase training
opportunities for undergraduate and graduate researchers, including groups
underrepresented in science.
