9633784 YOUNG Most deep-sea animals are capable of continuous reproduction, but
a few have annual reproductive cycles. This is a paradox, since the
environmental cues used by shallow-water marine animals for synchronizing their
reproductive cycles (e.g., changing daylength, lunar period, or increasing
temperature) are generally absent from the deep sea. In many parts of the world
ocean, however, there is a seasonally variable cycle of detrital rain. For
example, in much of the North Atlantic, a seasonal pulse of phytoplankton
arrives at the sea floor several weeks after the surface phytoplankton bloom. It
has been proposed that deep-sea animals use this pulse either to entrain their
reproductive cycles, or to provide the energy needed for a reproductive event.
To date, however, there is no experimental evidence in support of this
hypothesis. In this project, laboratory experiments will be used to determine if
several species of large bathyal invertebrates can shift their reproductive
seasons or increase their reproductive output in response to phytodetrital
pulses. For comparative purposes, both seasonal and aseasonal breeders will be
used, and also species with fast and slow mechanisms of egg production. ***
