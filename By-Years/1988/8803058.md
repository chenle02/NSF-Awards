This research project is concerned with collecting perishable data from the
October 1 and 4 Whittier Narrows earthquakes from masonry buildings in selected
regions and from individual buildings of particular interest in the greater Los
Angeles area. This includes both unreinforced and reinforced masonry building
data for damaged and undamaged buildings in each region selected. Regions with
recorded strong motion data will be studied. These data will form a knowledge
base for further studies on lessons learned from the Whittier Narrows
Earthquake.
