Since 1997, the National Science Foundation (NSF) has required that all
proposals submitted for funding explicitly address two review criteria:
intellectual merit and broader impacts. Advances in both intellectual merit and
broader impacts are essential if NSF is to achieve its mission "to advance the
national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and
for other purposes." The two criteria are often considered separately in
developing and reviewing projects. A conceptual framework for understanding the
various dimensions of the two criteria and their potential synergy may lead to
projects with greater societal value.

This workshop brings together thought-leaders from the Civil, Mechanical, and
Industrial Engineering academic research communities to define a roadmap for
broader Impact innovations. Participants are academic researcher leaders who
have demonstrated innovation in broader impact activities -- creating measurable
economic, human capital, and societal value through their research. A publicly
available workshop report will define innovative approaches to enhancing the
broader impact from NSF-funded research. Subsequent presentations and
publications by workshop participants will make these ideas widely available to
the community.
