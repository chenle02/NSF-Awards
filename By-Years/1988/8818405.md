The genome (the total of all genes in an organism) is much more variable than
was thought a decade or two ago. This variability has led to the testing of gene
loci to determine those which demonstrate a large number of alleles, none of
which occur at high frequency. Such loci are used as "fingerprints" to
distinguish individuals from each other and, because of their heritability, they
are exceptionally useful in determining paternity. Thus, DNA fingerprinting is a
relatively new and innovative technique that allows for identifications of
parentage with an unprecedented degree of statistical confidence. Using DNS
fingerprinting the investigators will determine paternity within captive
populations of several species of nonhuman primates, and from a zone of
hybridization of two species of baboons. The data generated in this study will
allow for more efficient management of primate colonies by avoiding inbreeding,
and will provide a tool for the investigation of a variety of questions relating
kinship and selection, kin selection, dominance and reproductive success. The
ability to identify parentage, especially paternity, is important in the
management of primate colonies, and in field research on nonhuman primates.
