Methanogens are fastidious anaerobic archaebacteria whose metabolism centers
around the reduction of CO2 to CH4. Their environments are often extreme and
they have evolved to handle these stresses differently from other bacteria. One
critical aspect of methanogen metabolism which has received little is
osmoregulation. Dr. Roberts plans to explore molecular biological approaches to
study osmoregulation in methanogens at the DNA/mRNA as well as protein levels.
This proposal fulfills the FAW objectives which are 1) to recognize outstanding
and promising women scientists and engineers in academic careers of research and
teaching and 2) to facilitate the further development of their careers.
