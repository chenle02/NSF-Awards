This award will support a series of three workshops to be held in conjunction
with the annual meetings of the Society for the Study of Evolution (19 June
2020, Cleveland, OH), the Botanical Society of American (18 July 2020,
Anchorage, AK) and the Ecological Society of America (9 August 2020, Salt Lake
City, UT). The purpose of the workshops is to educate the research community
about the Project Baseline seed bank resource which was designed specifically to
facilitate investigations into the evolutionary and ecological consequences of
climate and other ecosystem changes by collecting from multiple geographically
diverse locations per species and maintaining seeds by maternal line. Without an
active effort to disseminate information about Project Baseline, it may not be
used to its full potential. These three workshops will include a description of
the available resources; examples of recent resurrection studies; the
development of guidelines for using seeds; and opportunities for collaborative
small-group discussion. The workshops will emphasize participation by early-
career scientists, who are well situated to use and add to the seed bank over
the coming decades, and to eventually oversee its stewardship. Products from the
proposed workshops will include: best practices for using and maintaining
Project Baseline; literature demonstrating the uses of Project Baseline seeds; a
database of potential funding sources for research and future collections; a
Project Baseline presentation; and an opportunity to develop a network of
research collaborators.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
