In this award from the Special Projects Program, the Division of Chemistry will
provide partial support for a Presidential Commission on Graduate Education in
the Chemical Sciences, which was convened recently by the American Chemical
Society (ACS). This Commission is examining issues that affect the recruitment,
retention, and development of high-quality graduate students. Its goal is to
consider innovative models in graduate education in the chemical sciences and
make actionable recommendations for enhancing the quality of graduate research
and education. The Commission will solicit input to inform its work through
listening sessions at ACS National and Regional Meetings, along with targeted
feedback from graduate students, postdoctoral scholars, early career faculty,
underrepresented groups, industrial representatives, and other stakeholders. The
report of the ACS Presidential Commission on Graduate Education in the Chemical
Sciences will be distributed in hard copy to chemistry departments and will be
freely available online through the ACS website.
