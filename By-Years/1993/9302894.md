9302894 Cederberg This RUI proposal concerns the measurement of hyperfine
structure in sequences of vibrational and rotational states in small molecules
using a high-resolution molecular beam electric resonance spectrometer. These
spectra will provide improved values for hyperfine interaction constants and
will be used to determine the variation with internuclear distance of electric
field gradients at each nuclear site. The field gradients will be compared with
those obtained from theoretical calculations of electron wave functions.
