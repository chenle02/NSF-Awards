Learning-augmented algorithms is a rapidly growing field that has proved to be
an effective tool for designing efficient algorithms. The Workshop on Learning-
augmented Algorithms, to be held in December 2022 in Chennai, India, aims to set
the agenda for the area by identifying important topics, questions, and
directions for focused effort. This meeting will prepare students and
postdoctoral researchers to contribute to this important emerging area of
research and will promote collaboration among senior researchers interested in
this area. The program will feature tutorials and talks by invited speakers.
Students of underrepresented minority groups are especially encouraged to
participate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
