This Doctoral Enhancement Program will provide support for a PhD graduate
student in condensed matter/materials physics. The program will fund a series of
collaborative scientific experiments with two Italian scientists at the
NANOSPECTROSCOPY Beamline of the ELETTRA synchrotron facility in Trieste, Italy.
The experiments will involve spectromicroscopy measurements on exfoliated mono-
and multilayer graphene, with the goal of understanding the nature of the
graphene surface morphology, including its intrinsic thermodynamic stability and
extrinsically induced surface corrugation. The experiments will examine the
temperature dependence of the surface corrugation as well as its behavior under
bias, and changes in other extrinsic variables. From the point of view of
education, this Doctoral Dissertation Enhancement Program (DDEP) has the
specific goal of broadening the scientific research horizons of a PhD student.
The proposed experiments at ELETTRA are particularly useful in this regard as
they 1) involve a research experience at a state-of-the-art third generation
synchrotron with unique beamlines and 2) involve interactions with multiple
international scientists and fellow students from Italy and other European
countries.&lt;br/&gt;
