This award provides three years of funding to help defray the expenses of
participants in the "Virginia Operator Theory and Complex Analysis Meeting," a
conference series in which the 2014 event will take place on November 8, 2014,
on the campus of Washington and Lee University.

The Virginia Operator Theory and Complex Analysis Meeting (VOTCAM) is an annual
regional conference that has taken place since 1992. It brings together a
diverse group of mathematicians whose primary research interest is in function
theoretic operator theory and related areas. A sampling of the topical foci of
the 2014 event is given by the following: operator theory and complex analysis,
operator theory and mathematical physics, operator algebras. The conference
program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other
young scientists to present their work.
