Prof. George Christou, of the University of Florida Department of Chemistry, is
supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
for his research that focuses on the synthesis and study of single molecule
magnets (SMMs), individual molecules that can function as nanoscale magnetic
particles. The aim of this research is to develop a detailed understanding of
the single-molecule magnetism phenomenon, especially those properties directly
impacting on their potential application in magnetic devices, as well as the
raising of the operating temperatures by modifying known SMMs and new ones that
are discovered. An improved understanding of both the chemistry and physics of
these molecular nanomagnets will include the recently identified new phenomena
of exchange-biased quantum tunneling and quantum coherence. New synthetic
procedures will be developed to high nuclearity metal complexes, particularly of
manganese to increase magnetoanisotropy and spin (S) values over currently
available SMMs.

This study concentrated on magnetism and magnetic materials, and focused on
single molecule magnets will extend the synthesis and characterization of these
new potentially technologically important materials. Magnetic nanostructures are
widely used in technology, with the most advanced applications found in
information processing. This research will provide the underlying knowledge
needed for potential new advanced applications, including as quantum bits
(qubits) for quantum computations, taking advantage of the quantum tunneling
properties of SMMs. Graduate students, undergraduate students and postdoctoral
associates will receive excellent training in synthetic materials methodology
and the characterization of new single molecule magnets in an interdisciplinary
inorganic chemistry program.
