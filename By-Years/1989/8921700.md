This study continues Dr. Knapp's creative and respected studies of the
intersterllar medium. Recent improvements in observationalsensitivity, leading
to the detection of small amounts of cold gas and dust in elliptical galaxies,
offer the opprotunity to study the interstellar medium in situations quite
different from that in the galactic disk. These observations will be followed up
by infrared dust studies, investigations of the fueling of nuclear activity, and
studies of the vertical structure of atomic and molecular gas in the disk of our
own galaxy.
