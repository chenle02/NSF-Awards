This award supports a conference entitled: "Convergence in Erogdic Theory and
Probability". The conference will be held from 23 to 26 June 1993, at Ohio State
University. The conference will be concerned with the behavior of averages along
subsequences and weighted averages in general, which have been studied using
techniques from harmonic analysis, number theory, and measure theory.. The
objectives of the conference are: 1. Improve communication among researchers of
these interrelated fields; 2. Stimulate additional connections the lines of
investigation involved in these studies.
