This project studies problems in spectral theory, the mathematical theory that
describes physical notions such as energy levels of quantum systems and
vibration frequencies of mechanical systems. The mathematical models considered
are in regimes where there are competing influences from a disorder in the
interaction and some long-range order, such as spatially slowly decaying
interactions and quasi-periodic interactions. One focus is on applications of
spectral theory to explain conservation laws in certain nonlinear systems and
find otherwise hidden predictability in their behavior, described through the
mathematical notion of integrability. The project focuses on Schrodinger
operators, central to quantum mechanics, and the mathematical methods developed
have the potential to illuminate other mathematical models and physical
applications, such as electron conductivity in disordered materials and signal
transmission using solitons.

One main focus of this project is the spectral theory of almost periodic
Schrodinger operators and integrability of the Korteweg-de Vries equation with
almost periodic initial data. While a Lax pair representation formally rewrites
the equation as an isospectral flow, rigorous characterizations of
integrability, such as construction of an inverse scattering transform, are
highly dependent on the phase space under consideration and require and motivate
deep new results in direct and inverse spectral theory. Other topics considered
in this project include estimates for the size and continuity of the solution in
terms of spectral data, Schrodinger operators with slowly decaying potentials,
higher-order Szego theorems, and transport properties of Schrodinger operators
and quantum spin systems.
