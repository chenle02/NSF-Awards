The electron microscopy laboratory at ASU has both a scanning and a transmission
electron microscope. A course in EM, focusing on the pursuit of a research
project, has been offered for many years. The research experience that students
receive is being significantly improved by offering a second course in
Applications of Optical Instrumentation to Student Research. This course allows
selected students to continue a project defined and initiated during the earlier
course. The purchase of an ultramicrotome, a vacuum evaporator and a research
grade light microscope allows the EM laboratory to acquire items that any EM
laboratory should have for routine work and to respond to emerging technologies.
