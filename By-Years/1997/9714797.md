ABSTRACT EEC-9714797 MATHUR This two year project is a collaborative"TIE" study
involving two multi-university Industry/University Cooperative Research Centers
(I/UCRC). The Purdue University research site of the I/UCRC for Software
Engineering and the Duke University research site of the I/UCRC for Advanced
Computing and Communication will collaborate on the project "Architecture-Based
Estimation of Software Reliability." The Purdue research site will: 1.) assess
the value of both simulation and execution based approaches to software
reliability, 2.) investigate the accuracy of reliability estimates and 3.)
investigate the use of interface mutation for the estimation of interface
reliability. The Duke University research site will: 1.) investigate the
combined coverage and time-based approach for the estimation of component and
application reliability and also 2.) investigate dependency modeling for inter-
and intra- component dependencies. Both research sites will work together with
the same large commercial system in the second year of the project.
