The conference proposed will bring together most of the world's leading experts
on the locus coereleus to summarize and disseminate the major research
accomplishments in this area of research. The conference is important and it is
the first time that such a comprehensive conference on this topic has been put
together. It may become a landmark in the field of motor systems and central
noradrenergic innervation research.
