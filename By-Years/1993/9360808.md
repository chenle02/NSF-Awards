9360808 Buchan Due to its unique properties and its ability t be processed
analogously to silicon, silicon carbide (SiC) will be an important high
temperature, high power and high frequency electronic material. The barrier to
this developing technology was the availability of 6H0SiC substrates. However,
these substrates are now produced in ever-increasing quantities, and the new
barrier is the quality of these substrates. In Phase I, the defects in grown SiC
will be characterized. Synchrotron White Beam X-ray topography (SWBXT), an
innovative and non-destructive technique in which local differences in
diffracting power gives rise to image contrast, is uniquely suited for defect
characterization in SiC. The comprehensive and non-destructive nature of this
technique makes it an optimal tool for research as well as for quality control
in a production environment. In Phase II, we will extend use of this technique
from characterization of the grown bulk SiC to that of the wafer fabrication
process, which will allow for the production of high quality SiC wafers in Phase
III. ***
