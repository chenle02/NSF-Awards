Professor Shapiro's group will analyze the data from a 1987 very-long-baseline
interferometry (VLBI) experiment to achieve a tenfold improvement in the
accuracy of a classical test of general relativity: the deflection of light by
the Sun. The interferometric data successfully recorded on 2-14 October 1987
consist primarily of observations of two radio sources: 3C279 and 3C273B, the
former occulted by the Sun on October and the latter serving as a reference
object. Signals were recorded in three widely-separated radio-frequency bands:
2, 8, and 23 GHz. Such frequency coverage will allow them to use the known
dispersion relation for radio waves in the coronal and ionospheric plasmas to
remove most of their effects from the observations. Auxiliary data will be used
to account for the effects of the variations in Earth orientation, the
brightness distributions of the two sources, and the Earth's neutral atmosphere.
They expect to determine the deflection with a standard error of one part in 103
(i.e., to determine the parameter of the parameterized-post-Newtonian formalism
to two parts in 103).
