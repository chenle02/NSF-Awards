This project will support the 1990 AMS-SIAM Summer Seminar on Vortex Dynamics
and Vortex Methods to be held during a two week period in June 1990. The first
week of the seminar will involve tutorial and survey talks, with introductions
to the major kinds of numerical methods which can be used to study vortex
dominated flows, some of the mathematical analyses which have been applied to
such problems, and the basic features of some of the principal flows which
follow from experiments. Talks in the second week will be more technical and
less elementary than in the first week. The understanding of vortex dynamics is
crucial to the understanding of fluid motion. The subject is studied from a
variety of different viewpoints - experimental, numerical, and analytical. The
goal of the seminar is to bring together researchers to facilitate the critical
evaluation of different approaches with an emphasis on the usefulness and
validity of numerical computations.
