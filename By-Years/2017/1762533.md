The SALG instrument [Student Assessment of their Learning Gains] is a web-based
software system that allows faculty instructors to register their courses and
require or request their students to log into the system to answer questions
about the course, specifically the learning components of the course such as
course technology, textbook, lectures, labs, discussions, and group projects. It
can be used for formative assessment about the design of the course as well as
an end of the semester course evaluation. It can be used repeatedly during a
semester for both formative and summative assessment of the course. The SALG
site was designed and put into operation through an earlier NSF award. The site
provides a very easy to use service to its users. It summarizes student survey
responses and emails the results back to instructor. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
current project is a salvage operation, designed to move the current platform
from one programming language to a more current language (PERL to JAVA). Except
for this change, the maintenance of the SALG web site continues to be at the
expense of the PI and his team. There is an installed base of 10,000 instructor
users who depend on this tool and new users are added every semester.
