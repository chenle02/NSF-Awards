0106772&lt;br/&gt;Klemperer&lt;br/&gt;The Dabie belt of east - central China
exposes extensive areas of ultra high pressure rocks, and considerable resources
have been expended in understanding how these rocks representing metamorphism
that occurred at depths of 100 km or more, reached the surface. This project
seeks to add particularly to the subsurface data concerning these rocks by
reprocessing a seismic line that was collected by the Chinese Geological Survey
across the Dabie belt. Results should improve the knowledge of the subsurface
geometry of these rocks and aid in understanding their ascent.&lt;br/&gt;
