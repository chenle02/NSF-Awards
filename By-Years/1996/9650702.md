This project produces scientifically literate, environmentally aware citizens
among non-science majors, and competitively educated, critically thinking
environmental biology majors. The focus is a watershed-stream complex integral
to the campus. The scientific method is experienced by students through hands-on
data acquisition, analyses and interpretations in assigned class-cooperative
research projects. To educate students in policy processes, multiple classes
coordinate data to produce an environmental impact assessment, at least once a
year. The project also emphasizes the importance of data quality objectives,
sampling protocols, precision in the field, documentation, and adequate
databases from which the students can draw conclusions. Underrepresented groups
in science are addressed, and a strong component involves field practicum
experiences for individuals pursuing a teaching career with an emphasis in
environmental studies.
