This award provides support to Skidmore College for a summer program for
undergraduates to provide them with research experiences in cognitive and
developmental psychology. Ten students will be selected for the six-week
program. Projects serving as the focus of the summer experience will include the
study of children's memory confusions, individual differences in imagery ability
and their relationship to memory, factors mediating face recognition under
conditions of incomplete visual information, and the effects on fact recognition
of identical experiences. Activities will include an orientation workshop,
courses on research methods and data analysis, and student presentations of the
results of their work. The goal will be to promote ways for students to secure
more sustained laboratory experiences culminating in independent research
projects. This award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to
attract talented students into careers in science through active undergraduate
research experiences.
