This S-STEM scholars program awards scholarships to students transferring from
seven different institutions, six of them community colleges, in the state of
Texas into four year degree programs in several disciplines of engineering and
computer science. The program targets academically talented, first generation
students from underrepresented groups. Students selected to be Engineering
Transfer Scholars participate in a focused learning community that includes
academic and social components. The program also exposes scholarship students to
undergraduate research opportunities and, through cooperation with an existing
Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation project, to graduate school.
Approximately 80 scholarships will be provided during the life of this project.
