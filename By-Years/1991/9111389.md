The Francis Bitter National Magnet Laboratory is a national facility which
provides high magnetic fields to scientists and engineers conducting research in
materials science and engineering, physics and condensed matter science,
biological science, and chemistry. This four-year award provides support for
operation of the user facility, and support for magnet technology development
which includes building a 40 tesla hybrid magnet.
