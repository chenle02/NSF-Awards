This research will examine patterns of coordinations between the arms as people
engage in simple (e.g., two arms moving at one tempo) and complex (e.g.,
juggling) rhythmic activities. Its objective is twofold, (1) to identify the
dynamical principles by which rhythmic coordinations between the limbs can be
both stable and adaptive and (2) to understand how these principles affect how
the person controls, perceives new aspects of, and learns these coordinations.
Some experiments will manipulate the phase relation between limbs, the
frequencies at which they move together, and the frequencies at which they move
alone. Others will involve skilled juggling under conditions which manipulate
variables of the juggled objects and the juggling pattern. The data will be
collected using three-dimensional motion analyzers and addressed using the
theory and methods of nonlinear dynamics. The results should provide useful
constraints on modeling coordination and contribute to the understanding of
rhythmic movement disorders.
