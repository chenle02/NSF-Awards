9707973 Aspray, William Computing Research Association Special Project: History
of the Academic Discipline of Computer Science/Engineering 1945-1980 This grant
provides support for work toward the development of a history of computer
science and engineering as an academic discipline in the United States in the
years 1945 to 1980. This period begins with the completion of the first computer
and ends at a time when most research universities had established a Ph.D.
program in computer science and many colleges and universities had opened
undergraduate programs. This project will result in drafts of some of the
chapters of the history, will include several oral history interviews and will
culminate in a proposal for completion of the overall effort.
