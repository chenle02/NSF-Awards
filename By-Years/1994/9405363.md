Abstract 9405363 The enzyme complexes of the mitochondrial electron transport
chain are unique. Each complex is composed of subunits encoded in two different
genomes, the mitochondrial and the nuclear genomes. Cytochrome c oxidase (COX),
the last enzyme complex in the chain provides an ideal model system in which to
analyze both coordinate and tissue-specific transcriptional regulation of these
essential respiratory genes. The long-term goal of this project is to understand
the genetic regulatory mechanisms controlling both tissue-specific expression
and developmental regulation of mammalian genes for the mitochondrial-encoded
COX subunits. We will (1) define skeletal muscle-specific enhancer elements in
the gene for COX subunit VIII-H by means of gene fusions with either the CAT or
lacZ reporter genes (2) map the sites of DNA-protein interactions between
nuclear proteins and tissue-specific enhancers in the COX8H gene by DNAse
hypersensitivity, DNAse footprinting and electrophoretic mobility shift assays
and determine the functional significance of these interactions by gene
transactivation studies (3) physically map the bovine genes for the tissue-
specific isoforms of COX subunit VIII and (4) nap the COX VIII isoform genes in
the mouse by inter-specific hybrid back-crosses. %%% These studies will
constitute the first comprehensive analysis of the transcriptional regulation of
a class of genes, the tissue- specific respiratory genes, essential for
respiratory function in contractile muscle. The results should provide insight
into the genetic regulation of tissue-specific subunits of an essential multi-
subunit enzyme complex involved in oxidative metabolism and provide tools to
enable us to address the function of these isoforms in future studies. ***
