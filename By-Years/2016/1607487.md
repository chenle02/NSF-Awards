This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the
conference "Analysis and Beyond" that will be held May 21-24, 2016, at the
Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
conference program will feature lectures delivered by a host of international
mathematical leaders and will highlight a wide range of disciplinary topics,
including the following: dynamical systems, ergodic theory, functional analysis,
harmonic analysis, mathematical physics, number theory, partial differential
equations, and theoretical computer science. A unifying theme of the event is
the contribution that Fields Medalist Jean Bourgain has made to each of these
areas.
