High performance, high productivity machines often show excessive vibration and
noise, low reliability and life, and poor precision. New analytical methods for
their design are required to improve their performance. This project deals with
the development of more complete, computationally practical, dynamic analysis
methods for the design of such machines. The research addresses machine spatial
dynamics, the dynamics effects of clearances in connections, the dynamics
effects of distributed mass and compliance of machine links, the dynamics
effects of supporting structures and enclosures, the effects of fastening
methods used in fabrication, and control systems and actuators. The analytical
models will be tested experimentally as they are developed.
