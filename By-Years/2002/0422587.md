EAR-0422587&lt;br/&gt;Cohen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support a
workshop in May 2004 to investigate the future high performance computational
needs of the Earth Sciences community in the US. Funds will be used to support
around 70 participants who span the fields of geophysics, geochemistry, and
hydrology. Five working groups have been established and populated prior to the
workshop, and a white paper will be presented to the Division of Earth Sciences
after the workshop.&lt;br/&gt;
