Understanding the growth and evolution of structure in the Universe is a key
component of developing an accurate model of the Universe as a whole. In order
to do this, large surveys of galaxies are needed. The goal of this research is
to develop new analysis/interpretation tools for current and future large-scale
cosmological galaxy surveys such as HETDEX (Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy
Experiment) and eBOSS (Extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey).
Broader impacts of the work include training of two graduate students and a
postdoc, and development of a new presentation focusing on the large-scale
structure of the Universe for the outreach program of the Department of
Astronomy & Astrophysics at Penn State.

The research will emphasize the galaxy bispectrum, the Fourier transform of the
galaxy three-point correlation function, to constrain primordial non-Gaussianity
and the non-linear physics of structure growth. Three projects are proposed,
including an investigation of the accuracy of theoretical predictions based on
many different forms of advanced perturbation theory compared to N-body
simulations, a detailed analysis of survey window functions, and analytic
approximations for covariance matrices.
