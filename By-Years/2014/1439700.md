The Grid-Connected Advanced Power Electronic Systems (GRAPES) IUCRC proposes
renewal as a two-site I/UCRC, comprising personnel and facilities at the
University of Arkansas (lead) and the University of South Carolina with a focus
on developing the new knowledge, tools, hardware, software, and personnel that
are required to pervasively insert power electronics into the 21st century power
grid in ways that will strengthen and modernize the grid. GRAPES makes use of an
already-developed facility for design, development, test, evaluation, and
standardization of distribution-level grid-connected power electronic equipment.
This enables validation of research findings, and accelerated insertion of new
solid-state equipment into the power grid at both source and load ends.

Power electronics in grid applications are essential to achieving efficient
power systems of high reliability and resiliency. The I/UCRC in Phase II will
train students and practicing engineers who will become qualified to develop and
manage the next generation of power systems, thereby helping to mitigate the
forecasted shortage of power engineers. GRAPES will establish new courses that
will integrate research with education to make our students highly competitive
in their ownership of unique skills and knowledge.
