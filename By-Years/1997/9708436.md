University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign The proposed research investigates the
settlement patterns of immigrants in the U.S. Three settlement patterns are
defined: intended destination, initial destination, and the established
destination. A first objective is to develop and validate a typology of the
immigrant settlement system and to show how the immigrant settlement pattern
evolves from the intended to the established pattern after arrival. A second
objective is to determine the factors (i.e. personal, cultural, and economic)
associated with settlement choice. The research is organized around a set of
theories that center on the proposed evolution of the immigrant population
system, focusing on empirical and theoretical links between immigration,
internal migration and settlement patterns. Both the 1980 and 1990 Public Use
Microdata Sample of the U.S. census, as well as, INS data will be utilized. Both
descriptive and inferential multivariate techniques, including the 'expansion
method', will be employed.
