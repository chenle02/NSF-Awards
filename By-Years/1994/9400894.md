9400894 Hrushovski The investigator would like to study the model theory of the
Frobenius automorphism. This work has already started, on two fronts. On the one
hand, he formulated a conjecture analogous to the Lang-Weil estimates, but more
general, that would determine the first order theory of the Frobenius. On the
other hand, together with several coworkers, he is in the process of carrying
out the fundamental model theoretic analysis of the theory of difference fields
in question, along the lines of Shelah and Zilber. Put together, these should
throw considerable light on the issue; there will be applications to finite
simple groups and perhaps to finite groups in general. The work described in the
above paragraph forms part of a general trend in the area of mathematical logic
known as model theory. For several decades, this subject developed autonomously.
The lack of external pressure allowed it to refine distinct points of view on
algebraic structures, and to reach a degree of technical maturity. However, this
was done as it were in laboratory conditions, under assumptions ("stability")
that are too restrictive in practical applications. The time seems ripe to test
the ideas developed in this period against more complex structures, in
particular, number theoretic and geometric ones. This requires identifying
structures appropriate for model theoretic analysis and performing an algebro-
geometric analysis needed to prepare for the model theoretic tools. It also
requires generalizing the model theoretic ideas beyond the "stable" context in
which they were conceived. Some success has been had with these methods,
including the investigation of finite structures with a high degree of symmetry,
and the proof of certain conjectures in number theory. One hopes that this is
only the beginning of the road. ***
