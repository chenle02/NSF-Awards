An automated X-ray powder diffraction system that will enable investigators at
the University of Missouri-Rolla (UMR) to pursue research in the areas of
materials science and X-ray powder diffraction techniques will be purchased. The
proposed equipment would allow for obtaining diffraction data from specimens
under a wide range of environmental conditions and the reduction of these data
with a variety of computational algorithms. The X-ray diffraction community
would also benefit from UMR obtaining this equipment as investigators at UMR are
involved in the development of line profile analysis algorithms, enhancement and
support of a community-developed Rietveld structure refinement code, and the
development of quantitative analysis techniques for multi- component mixtures
that do not require the preparation of standards. The new system will also
replace obsolete and worn out equipment. One of the principal investigators
(James) is an experienced and highly regarded scientist who had made several
important contributions with regard to the structure of amorphous magnetic
materials. His colleague, (Howard) is well regarded also.
