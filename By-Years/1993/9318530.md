This component of the Arctic System Science (ARCSS) Land/Atmosphere/Ice
Interactions (LAII) Flux Study research will (1) develop Geographic Information
System (GIS) databases at five scales (1:10, 1:500, 1:5000, 1:25,000, and
1:250,000) and at five sites; (2) develop an understanding of the relationship
between vegetation signals and key terrain parameters; and (3) develop a method
to use remotely-sensed images and GIS variables to distinguish key vegetation
parameters for spatial models of trace-gas fluxes. One task will be the
development of methane and CO2 flux maps at multiple scales of the Toolik Lake-
Imnavait Creek region, using; (1) an empirical approach based on field
measurements of trace-gas fluxes in a hierarchy of vegetation types, and (2) a
modeled approach using a variety of remotely sensed satellite data. Measurements
of vegetation, biomass, soil, site, and spectral reflectance characteristics
will be made at permanent study plots representing the majority of landscape
variation. Trace-gas measurements by other investigators at the same sites and
GIS databases will be used to extrapolate this information to landscape and
regional scales. Permanently marked 1 x 1 km grids at the five study areas will
be used as a sampling framework for much of this research (e.g. monitoring
trends in species composition and canopy structure in relation to landscape
variables and climate change) and other research within the project. Data from
GIS databases will also be used by other investigators in hydrology models,
terrain models of trace-gas fluxes, and algorithms to scale plot-level
measurements to regional scales.
