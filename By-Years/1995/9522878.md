9522878 Byrne Important controls on the behavior and the rare earth elements in
seawater include: Solution complexation, association with organic ligands on
particle surfaces, and incorporation in phosphate coprecipiates. An
understanding of these controls is important for a general understanding of
metal behavior in seawater, and also because of the closely related chemistries
of the rare earths and anthropogenic radioactive actinides. The behavior of Y,
are rare earths and actinides in complexation, coprecipitation and sorption
processes is highly dependent on ionic strength and pressure. There is
relatively little direct information allowing quantitative predictions of the
influence of ionic strength on rare earth equilibrium processes, and an extreme
paucity of data appropriate to descriptions of the influence of pressure on
trace metal equilibria in general. This study will quantitatively characterize
the influence of pressure and ionic strength on the comparative solution,
surface and solid-state chemistries of yttrium and fourteen rare earth elements.
