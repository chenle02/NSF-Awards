SBR-9508202 Stanley R. Herwitz, Principal Investigator (PI) Curtis D. Holder,
Co-PI Clark University Dissertation Improvement Research: Relationships Between
Stream Discharge and Fog Interception in a Guatemalan Tropical Cloud Forest This
dissertation improvement research will investigate the relationship between
stream discharge and fog interception in a selected Guatemalan cloud forest. The
study examines the extent to which streamflow yield changes after cutting,
determines the extent fog drip is a significant hydrological input to water
supply, and evaluates the relationships between stream discharge and fog
interception. The research will improve understanding of the effects of tree
cutting on the hydrological cycle in tropical cloud forests by building a long-
term hydrological database useful for forest and water resource management.
