The 4-H organization of Virginia is developing a Marine and Aquatic Education
Program with a strong field study component for youngsters ages five through
nine. They plan to reach these young people through local and community 4-H
clubs and in summer camps. One part of the program is aimed at the handicapped
and development of strategies to meet their special needs. Other components of
the program include volunteer training of high school students and adult leaders
and a series of publications with emphasis on "hands-on" activities. There is a
strong national dissemination plan and, through a national survey, the Virginia
4-H have determined that 27 state 4-H organizations are interested in adapting
program. The 4-H organization is the largest youth organization in the United
States with a membership of 4.3 million young people. They have a strong
network, both urban and rural, with minorities representing 22% of the
membership, 53% are female and 63% are under 11 years of age. The Virginia 4-H
mirrors the national picture but with a slightly more rural membership. This
project provides an opportunity to strengthen science learning outside of the
formal education system by supporting a test project in marine education. Over
the next three years the project will be tested with 38,500 youngsters and 500
adults. The program will then be expanded to all 115,467 Virginia members as
well as a strong outreach effort to the national membership. This project is
directed at two important goals for the Informal Science Education Program:
strengthening out-of-school science programs for young people and the
handicapped. The marine science area is one of high interest and significance
both locally and nationally. The staff are experienced and committed and the
program is cost effective at a little over $3.00 per person.
