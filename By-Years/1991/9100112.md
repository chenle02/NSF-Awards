The U.S.-Japan Panel on Wind and Seismic Effects was created in 1968. Annual
meetings alternate between Japan and the U.S. (odd numbered years in Japan; even
numbered years in the U.S.). The Panel develops technologies that advance
engineering design and construction practices for an improved quality-of-life.
The Panel is composed on 17 Federal agencies who participate in ten task
committees. The task committees focus on specific national issues, e.g.,
earthquake hazards reduction, buried pipelines, transportation and
telecommunication systems, repair and retrofit of structures. The results of the
task committee workshops and conferences are shared at the annual joint meeting
and usually published as proceedings.
