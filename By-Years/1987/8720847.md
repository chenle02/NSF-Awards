Lovell The purpose of this research project is to continue past joint work with
collaborators at the Central Economics and Mathematics Institute of the Soviet
Academy of Sciences in Moscow. The research involves three main directions of
analysis: (1) to assimilate the disparate strands of the (primarily Western)
efficiency literature into a status report on the measurement and analysis of
Soviet economic efficiency; (2) to assess the efficiency potential of the Soviet
economic system by extending existing theoretical and empirical analysis; and
(3) to evaluate the implications of Gorbachev's unfolding reforms from the
standpoint of the efficiency potential of the system. The methodology being
developed and applied in this project has broad applicability in economics. The
collaborative effort should provide a better formal picture of the emerging
Soviet economic arrangements, at the same time that it acquaints some
influential Soviet economists with state-of-the-art Western analysis.
