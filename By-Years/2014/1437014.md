1437014 &lt;br/&gt;Karagozian, Ann R.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of the
proposed research is to understand and control the behavior of jets in crossflow
(JICF). &lt;br/&gt;Since the presence of JICF is prevalent in a plethora of
engineering and technological applications related to energy production,
propulsion, and combustion, the work proposed here would have a significant
impact in engineering JICF systems with tailored behavior. In that case,
increasing fuel efficiency and reducing emissions would have an impact on the
national economy and the environment. In addition, the co-PIs will reach
students outside of their university with presentations and demonstrations for
students at Community Colleges in Southern California. Opportunities for local
high school students as well as CC students to gain laboratory experiences in
the summer will be provided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a proposal to study
the effects of instabilities on the behavior JICF. These instabilities may
develop at the jet?s upstream shear layer depending on the crossflow
characteristics (e.g., fluid density, fluid velocity). Experimental evidence
indicates that these instabilities can profoundly affect the JICF spreading,
trajectory, speed etc. This proposal is a fundamental approach to develop a
deeper mechanistic understanding of how the crossflow leads to the
instabilities, and what the effects are exactly. Experiments that employ state-
of-the-art imaging techniques (stereo-particle image velocimetry and planar
laser-induced fluoresence), in combination with theory and modeling of the
process are proposed, in order to develop predictive capabilities that allow
control of spreading and mixing of JICF.
