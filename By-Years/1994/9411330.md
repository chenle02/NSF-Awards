This project is concerned with the design, development, and evaluation of a
distributed digital library - the Alexandria Project - of spatially-indexed
information that includes collections of maps and images digital form. The goal
of the Alexandria Project is a distributed testbed that provides geographically
dispersed users with access to a geographically dispersed set of library
collections. Users will be able to access, browse and retrieve specific items
form the collections of the library by means of user-friendly interfaces that
integrate visually-based and text-based query languages. Librarians will be
provided with facilities that enable them to extend their collections of
appropriately formatted materials and to add meta- information to their
electronic catalogue.
