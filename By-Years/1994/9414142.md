9414142 Vohra This project studies the nature of binding agreements in strategic
situations. A model is considered in which binding agreements can, in principle,
be written among any group of agents. The project rigorously analyzes the
agreements that occur in an equilibrium of free and unrestricted negotiation. At
the most fundamental level, the investigators address the issue of how to
conceptualize the series of negotiations that ultimately lead to the signing of
an agreement. This will make an important contribution to bargaining theory
because the literature on bargaining over actions of games is nonexistent. The
principal focus of the research is on the question of efficiency in binding
agreements. This project challenges the consensus among economists that if
binding agreements can be written in the absence of informational asymmetries,
then the gains from cooperation will be fully exploited. The investigators will
generalize examples from their previous work of binding agreements in the
presence of external effects that do not correspond to an efficient or
cooperative outcome. These results arise only when there are three or more
agents. The emergence of inefficiency is closely related to the assignment of
property rights. This line of basic research is relevant to the Human Dimensions
of Global Change because it will provide new insights and better tools for
analyzing negotiations needed to reach binding environmental agreements. For
example, the famous Coase Theorem was used to show that competitive markets will
produce efficient agreements in the presence of pollution. The investigators'
research shows that there is a breakdown of efficiency when the right to pollute
is the assigned status quo.
