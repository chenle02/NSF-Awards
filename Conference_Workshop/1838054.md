This award provides funding for US participation for the conference "Texas
Analysis and Mathematical Physics Symposium (TexAMP)", which will be held at
Baylor University in Waco, TX on Octobert 26-28, 2018. This will be the 6th
annual TexAMP meeting, and will feature talks by eight prominent researchers in
the fields of mathematical physics, with specialties in spectral theory,
geometric analysis, harmonic analysis, integrable systems, random matrix theory,
asymptotic analysis, partial differential equations, geometric measure theory,
functional analysis, microlocal analysis, scattering theory, and semiclassical
methods.

The conference focuses on recent developments in Analysis, especially in the
field of mathematical physics. A number of distinguished mathematicians have
agreed to attend and speak at this conference series. This award gives early
career researchers, members of underrepresented groups, researchers not funded
by NSF and the like an opportunity to attend and participate in this conference.
The organizing committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to
target groups through a number of different activities. More information will be
made available at the conference webpage:
https://sites.google.com/site/texamp2018/home.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
