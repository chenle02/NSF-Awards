"The Marine Flora and Fauna of the Eastern U.S." is a series of identification
manuals written by a board of scientific contributors, and published by the
National Marine Fisheries Service. The editor of the series, Dr. M. L. Carriker,
has requested modest support for illustrator fees necessary to complete ten more
manuals. The manuals would provide identification keys and lists of species to
ecologists, students, systematists, and to applied scientists working on
environmental quality. They will help to generate research interest in the
regional biota, and will steer investigators to important systematic problems in
need of attention.
