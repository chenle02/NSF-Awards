A Calculus Laboratory course is being designed to supplement the traditional
calculus course with more interesting and challenging exercises. The laboratory
exercises are designed to improve understanding of important concepts and to
provide an introduction to mathematical modeling. The students meet once a week
for an extended period (up to three hours) to work on these exercises. This
allows them to work on problems in substantially more detail and depth than is
usually possible in a first year calculus course. Written reports on each
exercise emphasize clarity and style as well as content; teaching students to
write clearly about technical topics is a major goal of the laboratory course.
