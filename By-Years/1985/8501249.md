Despite the inherent increase in optical power density available with guided
waves, practical nonlinear guided wave devices have not been forthcoming due to
the lack of appropriate materials. The researchers are investigating a candidate
material of great promise, semiconductor doped glass, which has recently been
shown to have large nonlinearities from optically induced plasma creation, and
with potentially picosecond excitation and recovery times. The rise and fall
times of the nonlinearity are being investigated experimentally using degenerate
four-wave mixing with a sub-picosecond laser source. The commercially available
materials being investigated consist of small semiconductor crystallites in a
glass matrix. Deposition techniques are also being developed to fabricate
semiconductor composite films. The fabrication of thin-film composite
semiconductor-dielectric materials from a range of substances should broaden the
range of device possibilities achievable, and enhance understanding of the
mechanism responsible for the optical behavior of these materials in both the
linear and nonlinear regimes. Nonlinear channel devices are going to be
fabricated by using ion exchange in commercially available glasses by
lithographic techniques to form the required patterns in the deposited
semiconductor films.
