9704320 Getzler In this project the investigator is to clarify the algebraic
structures underlying certain recent discoveries in theoretical physics
including the two-dimensional topological sigma model, topological gravity, and
Gromov-Witten invariants. In particular, a structure theory for Gromov-Witten
invariants is to be derived, and Gromov-Witten invariants of higher genus are to
be computed. In mathematical terms, these invariants relate to various
enumerative questions in algebraic geometry. For example, Gromov-Witten
invariants of genus zero appear in the so called mirror symmetry phenomenon.
Gromov-Witten invariants originally arose in theoretical physics - they describe
a coupling of topological gravity with a model of conformal field theory. They
play an important role in the popular 10-dimensional string model of the
universe. The string theory model contains six hidden dimensions which form a
tightly curved space known as Calabi-Yau manifold; Gromov-Witten invariants can
be used to study various mathematical properties of Calabi-Yau manifolds.
