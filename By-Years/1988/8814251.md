One of the most striking aspects of quasi-stellar objects (quasars, or QSOs) is
their strong collective evolution with cosmic time, as is apparent from a
comparison of near and distant samples. The duration of the luminous phase of
quasars is likely to be short, less than 100 million years, because otherwise
the central masses would become unreasonably large. On the other hand, the
collective evolution evidently has a timescale that is much longer than 1
billion years. A basic question in understanding quasars is thus what governs
their individual births and deaths, and what controls the overall activity of
quasars over the age of the universe. If a clearer picture for the collective
evolution can be obtained, it is possible that the nature of quasars, and their
relation to the origin of galaxies, can be better understood. The research will
provide fundamental data on very faint quasars by expanding and elaborating on a
proven survey technique that has made it possible to achieve fainter limits and
a higher surface density of confirmed quasars than any other survey. The survey
technique involves high-precision, wide-field, multi-band photometry to identify
quasar candidates, followed by multi-object spectroscopy of these candidates to
obtain redshifts. The objective is to determine the evolutionary characteristics
of low-luminosity quasars up to very high redshifts. This information
complements that obtained for high-luminosity quasars by wide-field (Schmidt)
telescopes at brighter limits.
