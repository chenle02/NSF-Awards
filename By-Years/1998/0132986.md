The generation of cellular asymmetry is a key event in many developmental
processes. One important mechanism that cells use to achieve asymmetry is
subcellular localization of RNA. In the case of an mRNA, localization to a
specific site within a cell efficiently targets its protein product to that
site. In the Drosophila oocyte, localization of distinct mRNAs to the poles is
an essential step in generating the anterior-posterior pattern of the future
embryo. This research examines components of a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex
identified previously because of its role in RNA localization: these components
are the Exuperantia (Exu) and Ypsilon Schachtel (Yps) proteins, and oskar (osk)
mRNA. An important hypothesis of the project is that this RNP complex functions
to both transport mRNAs (including osk mRNA) in the cytoplasm to their sites of
localization in the oocyte, and to regulate the translation of these transported
mRNAs. This research also addresses the role played by the microtubule
cytoskeleton in transporting localized mRNAs. Yps is a member of the Y-Box
family of proteins; other Y-Box proteins are known to bind RNA and regulate
translation. Preliminary results indicate that the yps gene expresses more than
one transcript. These transcripts and any alternatively encoded protein isoforms
will be characterized, and their expression patterns determined. Genetic and
biochemical experiments will determine if Yps acts as a translational repressor
of osk mRNA. The Exu protein is a novel protein that plays an essential role in
RNA localization, and interacts directly with Yps. A domain analysis of the Exu
protein will address the roles played by this protein in mediating mRNA
localization, and the association of the complex with microtubules.
