This project trains advanced technicians in the areas of cyber security,
computer forensics, and data recovery and create curricula modules for
dissemination to community colleges. Del Mar College, Corpus Christi, Texas is
the 12th largest Hispanic serving community college in the nation, enrolling
over 25,000 students, 57% Hispanic, 60% female, and predominately first
generation in college. The past decade has seen an enormous increase in highly
sensitive data on computer systems and distributed networks that are vulnerable
to unauthorized access. There has been a corresponding rise in the
sophistication and number of attempts to breach system security. Currently,
there is a demand for technician training to ensure the cyber security of
emergency services and government operations and public and private
infrastructures, e.g., transportation, telecommunications, and energy. There has
not been a sufficient increase in cyber security/computer forensics technician
training at the associate degree level nor the dissemination of training modules
for adaptation into community college curriculums. Both are needed to produce
technicians competent in cyber security, computer forensics, evidence
collection, and data recovery, which are essential to meet industry workforce
needs. This initiative develops and disseminates a comprehensive new curriculum
framework and modules to train computer security technicians for an associate
degree and corresponding computer security certifications in cyber security,
including network security, computer forensics, data recovery, and related areas
of cyber crime, evidence collection, and technical and legal investigative
protocols.
