Computer-based laboratory control centers (each including a Macintosh
microcomputer, a high resolution pH meter, controlled-temperature water bath,
programmable stirrer/hot plate, spectrophotometer, compound microscope,
electronic balance, and centrifuge) are facilitating the development of
computer, analytical, statistical, and observational skills for students
enrolled in the introductory Principles of Biology course. Competencies are
being developed through a series of Biology projects requiring skill in
monitoring, data collection, statistical analysis, modeling, and report
generation. With this new academic thrust, even lower division students are
becoming better prepared to undertake undergraduate laboratory research, to
complete major field projects, and eventually to participate successfully in
graduate, medical, dental, and other professional programs.
