GameSec is a research conference focused on analytical models based on
information, communication, optimization, decision, control and game theories
that are applied to diverse security topics. At the same time, the connection
between theoretical models and real world security problems are emphasized to
establish the important feedback loop between theory and practice. The
conference helps to promote a "science of security" with a theoretical
foundation that helps us understand security risk in a principled
way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides travel support to allow more
students to attend GameSec 2013. Preferences for travel support are based on the
credentials of the students, with a focus on attracting women and
underrepresented minority students to support their participation in this event.
