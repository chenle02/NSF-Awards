A laboratory is being established for advanced cognitive modeling. In recent
years, large-scale computer models have revolutionized the techniques of theory
construction in cognitive science. The undergraduate who has been exposed only
to traditional qualitative conceptual models and tractable mathematical or
formal models can no longer be said to know how contemporary research in
cognitive science is done. Computer modeling has been greatly accelerated by the
introduction of powerful computer workstations and associated software. The new
laboratory has a network of four workstations that have enough computing power
and memory capacity to handle both large scale symbolic models, such as rule-
based problem solving models and natural language processing models, and large-
scale connectionist or neural network models for cognitive processes, such as
word recognition and low-level vision. The laboratory is stocked with a number
of running models and tools for model development, which are employed in two
advanced courses on cognitive modeling, and intermediate course in experimental
cognitive psychology, and in undergraduate thesis projects. The models are also
used for demonstrations throughout the cognitive science curriculum. The college
will contribute an amount equal to the award.
