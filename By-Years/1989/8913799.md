Virtually all elements heavier than hydrogen and helium were synthesized in the
interiors of stars, during supernova and nova explosions, during mass accretion
by compact stars (often accompanied by so-called X-ray bursts), and during
stellar collisions. The only exception are such elements as lithium, nitrogen,
carbon, oxygen, and slightly heavier elements, which may have been formed in
trace amounts during the big bang. The Principal Investigator (PI) proposes to
study nucleosynthetic processes in the range of astrophysical environments
listed above: in supernovae, novae, X-ray bursts, stellar collisions, and the
big bang. In addition, the work will focus on 3-dimensional (3-D) hydrodynamic
modelling of stellar explosions and how the mixing and clumping of matter during
such explosions affects nuclear processes, and how the latter affects the former
(e.g., by radioactive decay). Particular attention will be paid to neutron
capture cross sections for very neutron-rich light nuclei, electron captures on
nuclei beyond atomic mass 60, and inelastic neutrino scattering. The topics to
be covered are far-ranging. The PI intends to collaborate with Ken Nomoto of
Tokyo (supernovae), W. Benz of Harvard (3-D smooth particle code), J. Cowan of
the U. of Oklahoma and A.G.W. Cameron of Harvard (r-process scenarios), and J.
Applegate of Columbia Univ. (big bang nucleosynthesis). The work is a
continuation of research previously funded by NSF.
