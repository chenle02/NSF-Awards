Mathematical modeling and analysis can give insight and better understanding
into the dynamics of biological populations. The theory and application of
mathematical models have proved useful for the purpose of providing a logical
structure within which to synthesize knowledge, test assumptions, and make
predictions about the dynamics of biological populations with regard to
epidemiological problems. Models have provided the impetus and means for
researchers to study increasingly complex and important questions in these
disciplines. The Third International Conference on Mathematical Modeling and
Analysis of Populations in Biological Systems is being held in San Antonio,
Texas, in October 2011. This conference brings together expert researchers for
the purpose of enhancing interdisciplinary collaborations that will raise the
derivation and analysis of mathematical models in these biological disciplines
to a new level.

The main focus of this conference is on ecology and evolution, including
ecological and evolutionary problems in related fields, such as environmental
science, epidemiology, etc. Among the participants are researchers working on
model derivation and analysis, data testing, and model simulations in these
fields. Plenary speakers are encouraged to give surveys of the current state of
the research in their field of study and suggest new directions of research and
opportunities are provided for other participants to present their latest
findings and results of current projects.
