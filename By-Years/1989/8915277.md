The goals of this research are to develop material processes, lithographic
processes, and characterization techniques necessary for the fabrication of
microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). This research builds on previous research
to expand knowledge of CVD tungsten processing for MEMS. The focus of this
research will include: (1) the development of tungsten and silicon carbide
multilevel, thin film processes compatible with current silicon and polysilicon
technology; (2) the development of frame and truss structures to achieve high
strength-to-weight structures analogous to framed macroscopic structures; (3)
exploration of the fabrication of nanomechanical structures using electron beam
lithography and compatible processes; (4) the development of time- resolved,
high spatial resolution electron beam characterization techniques to probe
motion, voltage distributions, and surface and bulk chemistry in MEMS; and (5)
the development of integrated circuits, control algorithms and feedback systems
to control on-chip MEMS.
