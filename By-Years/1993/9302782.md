This project is directed toward computational solution of the linear particle
transport equation, which usually is termed simply the ``transport equation.''
This equation historically has provided a major challenge to the state-of-the-
art computer hardware available at any given time. More specifically, the
project is directed toward spatial approximations to this equation, because new
approaches and better basic understanding in this area seem essential to permit
the solution of the transport equation in the complex material arrangements
underlying some of the emerging applications of this equation (e.g.,
identification of underground waste locations for environmental restoration). A
certain abstract model (CLOF methods) of one-dimensional approximations in
particle transport is being extended and applied, as follows: a massively
parallel code is being developed for a general class of one-dimensional spatial
approximations; the model is being extended to multiple (two or more) spatial
dimensions; a that permits computational determination of the order of accuracy
of an arbitrary two-dimensional CLOF is being developed; the CLOF methods that
have the very desirable property of satisfying the diffusion limit are being
characterized. The corner-balance method, which is a novel spatial approximation
that seems to enjoy several properties that are highly desirable for
multidimensional calculations, is being extended to the three-dimensional
setting, initially for parallelepiped cells, and subsequently for meshes
composed of cells that are general (convex) polyhedra.
