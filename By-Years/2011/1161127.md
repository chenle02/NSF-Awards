SUNY College at Oswego is graduating more students with STEM degrees by
increasing the retention of matriculated students during their first two years
of study. Their self-study on which the interventions are based, identified key
reasons declared STEM majors were not retained between freshman and sophomore
years or between sophomore and junior years. The three principal reasons are
students switching to non-STEM majors, becoming academically disqualified, or
leaving the university while still in good academic standing. Refinement of
institutional data pinpointed problematic courses in Chemistry and Mathematics
as particular key choke points contributing to the retention
problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By implementing a five-point plan that draws on
their own institutional data and informed by effective practices reported in the
literature, SUNY Oswego is increasing their number of STEM graduates over a 5
year period by a net 20%. The first component being implemented is the expansion
of a successful, but small, summer bridge Math Camp for incoming STEM majors,
and adding Chemistry content to the camp. The second component is taking
advantage of under-utilized time in Chemistry and Physics classes to add "Math
in Context" problems and discussion. The third component is enhancing tutoring
services both for walk-in students and for targeted courses by utilizing
embedded tutors. The fourth component is systematizing peer mentoring by
upperclassmen for freshman and sophomore STEM majors. The final component is
providing undergraduate research experiences for students during their first
years on campus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aspects of the multi-pronged program are
capable of being implemented at other institutions of higher education since the
investigators are optimizing resources that are already in place such as course
laboratories and tutoring centers. The summer bridge Math and Chemistry Camp is
especially effective at enabling at-risk students to start their first semester
in a strong position to succeed. The Math in Context program is both mandatory
and reaching a large number of students since it is implemented within large-
enrollment courses taken by STEM majors that too-often are stumbling blocks to
possible STEM graduates. The small undergraduate research component is targeting
students that could most benefit from an early immersion experience in the
discipline. The investigators are sharing their effective practices by
organizing discussions and workshops for colleagues on campus and at nearby
colleges and universities.
