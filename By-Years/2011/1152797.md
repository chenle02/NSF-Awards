In this project, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms
Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Lawrence D. Ziegler of Boston
University will conduct a series of experiments that use ultrafast laser
spectroscopic methods to learn about the special properties that allow
supercritical fluids (SCFs) to be such effective solvents, as compared to normal
liquids. These studies are designed to reveal how motions on the time scale of
hundreds of femtoseconds to hundreds of picoseconds account for this
extraordinary solvation ability. A combined experimental and computational
approach will be carried out to accomplish these goals in collaboration with
several theorists at Boston University. Graduate and undergraduate students will
participate in this research, and will be trained in state-of the-art methods.
In addition, participants in PROSTARS, an NSF sponsored program to enhance
research opportunities for local community college students, and in the NSF RET
(Research Experience for Teachers) program, as well as students in the women's
college of Wellesley, will be encouraged to participate in these studies during
the summer months of this award. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A supercritical fluid is
so highly compressed that it is neither a gas nor a liquid. SCFs have unique and
useful combinations of gas and liquid properties. Many investigators are
exploring ways to use SCFs to replace traditional solvents, which can be toxic,
flammable or difficult to remove, because they because they dissolve mixtures
well as if they are liquids, but have easily changed densities and thus can be
more easily removed or processed. Prof. Ziegler's research will help scientists
understand what gives SCFs these unusual properties so that they can be used
more effectively and in a wider range of applications.
