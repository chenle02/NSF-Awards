This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposal describes the
next generation of security cameras. These cameras will provide two improvements
over current technology. First, the `Smart Camera` will provide much higher
resolution images of person's in its field of view than is possible with today's
security cameras. With today's security cameras, a suspect's image captured by a
security camera could easily have only a small number of pixels actually focused
on the person. This may not be enough for identification or for irrefutable
evidence in court. The `Smart Camera` will capture a much higher resolution
image. Based on initial computations, for typical situations, thousands of fixed
cameras with telephoto lenses would be required to reliably capture the same
resolution image of a suspect as would be captured by a single `Smart Camera.`
The second improvement over current security cameras is that this type of camera
captures images with high precision 3 dimensional information. If the camera
were mounted two meters from a person as the person entered a bank, Government
building, etc., the face data, including depth information across every feature
of the face, would be captured with an accuracy of approximately .4 mm.
Accurately measured three dimensional images of a person's face may prove to be
nearly as unique as a fingerprint. `Faceprints` could be captured visibly as a
subject walks into a building or even walks along a street. Since 3 dimensional
images contain literally an entirely new dimension of data, images should be
able to be compared more quickly and reliably. Images of people entering major
facilities such as train or bus stations could be automatically matched in real-
time against most wanted lists, or suspects in recent crimes. The bombing of the
Federal Building in Oklahoma City has focused attention on the need for
increased security. Potential criminals should be significantly deterred by
better security cameras, and by automatic means to identify and apprehend
criminals. For those that are not deterred, the system will provide a next
generation of tools for identification and apprehension.
