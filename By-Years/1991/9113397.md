With this grant in the Theoretical and Computational Program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor DeLeon will develop a reaction rate theory for molecular
isomerization, molecular dissociation and bimolecular reactions. The fundamental
idea governing this unified reaction rate theory is the concept of cylindrical
manifolds embedded in phase space. Based on this concept, Professor DeLeon will
develop a reaction rate theory with two principal features: (1) the theory
accurately predicts population decays and rate constants, (2) the theory yields
physical insights and quantitative data on the dynamics of a chemical reaction.
He will also implement the theory in a simple manner and thus have a
quantitative idea about the nature of any necessary approximations. %%% The
theories of nonlinear dynamics that Professor DeLeon will apply to the
investigation of chemical reaction rates will help the experimentalists to
better understand the fundamental molecular processes underlying many important
chemical reactions.
