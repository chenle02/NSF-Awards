This award is to provide support for student participation at the 9th
International Conference on Carbonaceous Particles in the Atmosphere (ICCPA), to
be held on August 12-14, 2008 at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory,
Berkeley, CA. ICCPA is dedicated to studying carbonaceous aerosols and provides
the forum to highlight new results and insights into the role that carbonaceous
aerosols play on climate as well as health. The 9th ICCPA is being held on the
30th anniversary of the first conference that was held in 1978 in Berkeley. The
award is primarily to provide for travel assistance for students, and in special
circumstances, young scientists with relevant presentations, who cannot
otherwise attend the conference.
