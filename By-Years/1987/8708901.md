Multibody systems consist of several interconnected bodies (linkages) whose
dynamics is in general described by a set of nonlinear, coupled differential and
algebraic equations. The incorporation of flexibility effects in such linkages
dramatically increases the complexity of the system of equations. However, the
newly emerging technology of multiprocessors and concurrent processing offers a
cost-effective means to increase computational speed by several orders of
magnitude for certain problems; multibody dynamics being a prime candidate.
There are several issues that must be resolved before multiprocessing systems
can be used as a practical alternative to existing synchronous systems. The goal
of this Engineering Initiation project will be to formulate the multibody
flexible system dynamics problem for efficient parallel execution on a
multiprocessor, i.e. to select as formulation with maximum degree of intrinsic
concurrency. Futhermore, a software package will be developed for execution on a
general multiprocessor. The institutional support is adequate and the P.I. is
well qualified to carry out the research. I strongly recommend support.
