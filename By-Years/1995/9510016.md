The Ohio Supercomputer Center (OSC), under the direction of the PI's, will
develop comprehensive documentation for MPI (Message- Passing Interface) cluster
software called LAM. LAM is currently supported on networks of workstations. The
documentation will enable other researchers in academia to utilize LAM for
building parallel processing applications quickly. The project will also port
the software to low-end UNIX platforms and high- end shared memory
multiprocessors systems supporting Symmetric Multiprocessing (SMP) UNIX. Small
business users will benefit from the availability of the software on low-end
workstations. The project is supported under the Software Capitalization Grants
program.
