Switching of signals at the surface of plant cells controls plant development,
hormone response, avoidance of self-pollination, and disease resistance.
Transmembrane signaling in plants is exemplified by the interactions of the
receptor-like kinase (RLK) CLAVATA1 with kinase-associated protein phosphatase
(KAPP). This pair interacts on the inner surface of the plasma membrane to guide
the development of the shoot and flower meristems of the model plant
Arabidopsis. The fundamental question of how the KAPP FHA domain interacts with
an RLK kinase domain will be investigated in this project. The FHA domain is a
newly described class of phosphoserine / phosphothreonine-binding domain which
is ubiquitous among eukaryotes in diverse protein-protein signaling contexts. No
three-dimensional atomic structures of KAPP or of an RLK have been reported. NMR
will be used to determine high quality structures of the distinctive FHA domain
of KAPP in two forms: free and bound to a phosphopeptide. Sequence determinants
of the specificity of phosphopeptide interactions with the KAPP FHA domain will
be explored using site-directed mutagenesis, screening of phosphoser/thr peptide
binding, and thermodynamics of the binding of phosphopeptides most avid for the
FHA domain. To further probe how KAPP interacts with CLAVATA1, the structure of
the serine kinase domain of this RLK will be modeled. The training of PhD
students will be enhanced by exposure to complementary plant genetics studies in
the lab of John Walker and to protein modeling in the lab of Jeff Skolnick. This
project will provide insights into how a class of plant signaling proteins
interacts specifically during the process of signal switching. It will also add
perspective to FHA-mediated protein-protein interactions in other
organisms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
