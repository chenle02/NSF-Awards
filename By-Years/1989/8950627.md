This project is designed to introduce the organic students at Lake City
Community College to some of the fundamentals of Gas Chromatography. The organic
students learn the fundamentals of the instrument and develop first-hand
understanding of the principles underlying organic reactions and separations. A
Winner Workstation Integrator has been purchased for storing and reporting of
data. This workstation includes an integrator and assorted computer hardware and
software. A second channel of this workstation is used to interface both gas
chromatographs. The results of the project include the improvement of the use of
instruments and computers to extend instructional capabilities and an
improvement of the education of the undergraduates in science. The institution
is providing funds in an amount equal to the award.
