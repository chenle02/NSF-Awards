This 36-month project will produce an assessment of the ethical issues posed by
the development and use of CRISPR for human germline genome editing in China,
and its impact on U.S. and global scientific peers, through the use of Delphi
survey method, individual and focus group interviews, and deliberative workshop
elicitation in Beijing, China, and Washington, DC. This project will provide
first hand data on Chinese ethical perspectives on human germline genome editing
that will be made publicly available, and data on how national differences are
characterized, defended, and negotiated by practitioners. The data from this
project are expected to produce several peer reviewed publications and feed into
a variety of deliberative bodies on the ethical implications of human genome
editing, such as the U.S. National Academy of Medicine, the U.S. National
Academies of Sciences, the UK Royal Society, the World Health Organization, and
the Chinese Academy of Sciences, as well as other local, national, and
transnational scientific and medical groups to inform policy and practice on the
ground. In doing so, this work contributes to the goal of creating social
science for informing public knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will
engage a broad range of scientists using CRISPR for human applications, in basic
and applied research, as well as ethicists and government officials, and will
provide opportunities for cross-country deliberations and comparative analyses
of ethical practices and regulations in different country contexts. This project
will: (1) examine how U.S. and Chinese scientists are developing CRISPR
technologies for human embryo research; (2) identify the conditions
(organizational, cultural, and social) and regulatory environment that allow the
fast paced application of CRISPR research in China; (3) evaluate U.S. and
Chinese government oversight of CRISPR research for human applications involving
different institutions, actors, and funding mechanisms; (4) assess U.S. and
Chinese scientists' understanding and knowledge about the ethical implications
of CRISPR for human germline genome editing; (5) use the gathered data to assess
the ethical implications of CRISPR in China and the United States; and (6) offer
short and long-term recommendations to help inform U.S. and international
policymaking regarding human germline genome editing
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
