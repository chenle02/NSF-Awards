The Organic Dynamics Program and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities of
the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate support Professor Richard H.
Smith, Jr., of the Department of Chemistry of Western Maryland College, for his
mechanistic investigations of the proteolysis of mono- and bis-triazenes. With
his Research in Undergraduate Institutions award, Professor Smith seeks to
develop a clearer understanding of the mechanism of proteolytic decomposition of
the major classes of triazenes, an important family of anti-cancer drugs. He
uses a kinetic method to measure the component constants that determine the
overall rate at which triazenes decompose to produce their active principle, an
alkyldiazonium ion. These data provide information about the basicities of all
the major classes of triazenes and will lead to the development of a
computational model of the key decomposition reaction, facilitating the future
design of new triazene-based anti-tumor drugs. Two new classes of triazenes,
bis-triazenes and bis-triazolines, are effective DNA crosslinking agents and may
form the basis of a new family of anti-cancer drugs. Professor Richard H. Smith,
Jr., of the Department of Chemistry of Western Maryland College, carries out
investigations of the synthesis and reaction chemistry of triazenes with the
support of a Research in Undergraduate Institutions award from the Organic
Dynamics Program and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities of the
Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate. Triazenes, a class of molecules
bearing in common the structural motif of three nitrogen atoms connected in a
row, form the basis of an important group of anti-cancer drugs. By studying the
influence of their detailed chemical structure on the reaction chemistry of
these compounds, Professor Smith sheds light on the fundamental mechanisms by
which they act. In addition, this information is leading to the development of a
computational model which is expected to facilitate the future design of new
triazene-based anti-tumor drugs.
