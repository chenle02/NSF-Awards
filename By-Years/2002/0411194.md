Chemistry (12)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the need for students
to develop the ability to understand and visualize the particulate nature of
matter. There is an increasingly important role for molecular modeling and
computational chemistry in both academia and industry. A computer laboratory
equipped with ChemOffice Ultra, Mathcad, Odyssey, and Spartan software packages
allows for integration of visualization and computation into the chemistry
curriculum. Activities that aid students in their ability to understand chemical
phenomena and develop better spatial and visualization skills are incorporated
into both lecture and laboratory. These activities also promote understanding of
how molecular structure influences properties by allowing students to use
modeling tools to make predictions and then compare them to experimental
results. Other activities use Mathcad for exploring mathematical descriptions of
chemical processes. In lower level courses the programs help students to better
visualize concepts. The same programs allow for more investigative analyses in
upper level courses as students become more competent with the software.
