This research is on complete fault coverage (at low cost) for synchronous
sequential circuits. A test generation strategy, which alleviates the
limitations of existing test generation procedures is being investigated. The
essence of the approach is in the multiple time observation assumption, which
removes the requirement that a fault be detected by observation of the circuit's
response at a single time unit. A fault model comprised of single and multiple
transition faults, which covers many gate level stuck at faults, is being
explored. Test generation procedures are aimed at medium sized and large
circuits, described as interconnections of submachines. Algorithms for
decomposition of such circuits are being investigated. A comprehensive set of
tools is being designed especially for the purpose of achieving complete fault
coverage. The tools include: test generation, simulation, extraction and
decomposition procedures.
