9315343 Graham This project will determine grain boundary diffusivities in
enstatite, olivine, and diopside polycrystals as a function of temperature,
oxygen fugacity (using CO/CO2 mixtures), and iron (and calcium in diopside)
content. The effects of water (and hydrogen) fugacity on grain boundary
diffusivity will be investigated by performing experiments using H2/H2O gas
mixtures to control the oxygen fugacity. The research will elucidate the role of
grain boundaries as conduits for ionic and electronic transport, which are
important phenomena in both geosciences and materials sciences.
