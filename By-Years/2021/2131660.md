The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to provide an
innovative ultra low-cost but high-performance organic light-emitting diode
(OLED)-based infrared sensor technology. The infrared detector market is
expected to grow significantly, driven by sensing applications for people and
motion, temperature measurement, and security and surveillance applications.
Current infrared sensor technology is limited due to high costs and limited
pixel resolution of about 1 million pixels. The OLED-based infrared sensor
technology can potentially achieve sensors with small and lightweight form
factors with high-resolution and ultra low-cost. Potential areas of integration
for these sensors can include drones, smartphones, smart glasses, and automobile
applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the
development of an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) based infrared sensor
technology. Traditional infrared sensor technologies are expensive because
infrared-sensitive semiconductors require an epitaxial growth process and the
infrared photodetector pixel arrays must be electrically connected to silicon-
based readout integrated circuits (ROIC) by a complicated chip bonding
processes. The proposed OLED-based infrared sensor structure does not require
these steps. The sensors are fabricated with an infrared-to-visible up-
conversion OLED coupled optically (not electronically) on an inexpensive
Commercial-Off-The-Shelf visible complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor image
sensor. These OLED-based infrared sensors can achieve both higher resolution and
significantly lower cost than traditional sensors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
