Our science and technology-driven society is immensely dependent on robust,
reliable and highly accurate simulations of various natural phenomena. The scope
of such natural phenomena is vast. In this proposal, the PIs take the task of
generating software that can robustly, reliably and with high accuracy simulate
phenomena that have to do with the propagation of wave-like motions. Such
computational codes are very useful in simulating problems in applied and
computational mathematics as well as computational astrophysics. The proposed
effort seeks to develop a common software substrate for both those communities.
The software is based on advanced computational algorithms and is intended to
work very efficiently on modern generations of supercomputers that have been
funded by the National Science Foundation.

To solve the common problem faced by both communities the PIs develop a toolkit
for higher order partial differential equation (PDE) methods. The proposed
computational toolkit mainly includes two components. The first one is a
multidimensional Riemann solver software that can work with some PDE systems.
The second one is Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) schemes for some involution-
constrained systems of hyperbolic PDEs such as Euler and magnetohydrodynamics
(MHD) flows.
