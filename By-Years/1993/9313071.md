9313071 Shen This research project deals with the analysis and the development
of an innovative damping treatment, called Intelligent Constrained Layer (ICL),
that integrates passive and active damping characteristics to enhance system
reliability and provides adjustable damping. A variety of design configurations
using the ICL is developed and compared in order to suppress bending and
torsional vibrations and optimize damping performance. The dynamics and
stability of ICL are investigated in the context of helicopter rotor blades, and
a precision boring process as an illustrative example of a manufacturing task.
The results of this research yield practical, innovative and fail- safe damping
treatments which enhance system reliability and damping adjustability. In
addition, they establish fundamental theories such as controllability and
stability of damped distributed systems under active vibration control, and
advance damping design methodology in structural dynamics and manufacturing. ***
