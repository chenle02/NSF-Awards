1he Department of Chemistry at the University of Colorado at Boulder will use
this award from the Chemical Research Instrumentation Program to help acquire a
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer. The areas of chemical research
that will be enhanced by the acquisition include the following: 1.
Identification of High Energy Intermediates in the Peroxyoxalate
Chemiluminescence Reaction. 2. IR-VIS-UV Spectroscopy as a Probe of Molecular
Structure and Organization. 3. Heterogeneous Photoreactivity of Photoreactive
Atmospheric Molecules. Fourier Transorm Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is a
technique that uses absorption of infrared energy to probe molecular structure.
When used in conjunction with a modern computer, FTIR studies on large numbers
of samples can be conveniently carried out and the resulting data readily
analyzed. The use of FTIR spectroscopy is essential to chemists who are carrying
out research in many important frontier areas.
