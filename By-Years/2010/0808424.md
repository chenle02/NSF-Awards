Interactions between species, such as hosts and their parasites, have long been
implicated as a means of generating biological diversity. However, evolution
acts primarily within and among populations, and the relationship of these
evolutionary forces to species diversity are not well understood. This research
tests whether specific evolutionary processes generate diversity of parasites.
The research focuses on the early stages of diversification, because the larger-
scale evolutionary patterns are well known (parasites are highly specialized on
host genotypes and populations), but little is known about the diversification
that underlies them. Molecular genetic markers will be used to identify host
lineages, and a lab experiment will test how adaptation of a parasite to one
host lineage affects its ability to adapt to other lineages and so may cause or
constrain diversification of parasites.

A major question in evolutionary biology is whether processes that generate
evolutionary change within species ultimately contribute to larger-scale
biological diversity. This proposal tests whether evolutionary processes
operating on parasite populations are associated with a parasite?s
specialization to its hosts. Evolutionary diversification of populations is the
first step in generating biological diversity at higher levels. The research
will provide insights into one of the main puzzles of evolution: how population-
level processes generate species-level biological diversity? This project also
provides opportunities for undergraduates to gain direct experience in
scientific research and includes several public outreach initiatives.
