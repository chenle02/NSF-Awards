This award will support a comprehensive theoretical investigation into core
collapse and the resulting supernovae explosions of massive stars. The project
will focus on full-star simulations in three dimensions of compact progenitors
of certain classes of supernovae and long gamma-ray bursts. The goals of the
project are (1) to explore the physical conditions and processes that
distinguish between various outcomes of the explosion and to understand which
situations produce gamma-ray bursts; (2) to track neutrino-driven and
magnetorotational explosions through compact progenitors and make predictions
about explosive yield of various nuclei, mixing of ejecta, and explosion
morphologies that can be compared with electromagnetic observations; and (3) to
provide predictions for the gravitational wave and neutrino signatures of
extreme core collapse supernovae and long gamma
bursts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gamma-ray bursts are probably the most energetic
events in the universe, and the physics involved is still not well understood.
The project is expected to release its codes and simulations to the astrophysics
community, and will also involve the training of graduate students in numerical
astrophysics.
