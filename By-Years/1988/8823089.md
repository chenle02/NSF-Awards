This project involves both experimental and theoretical components. Multiple-
wavelength diffraction data will be collected from a number of protein crystals
selected for both the biological interest in the protein structures and the
suitability for further developing the MAD phasing technique. This data will be
collected at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory. Structure
determination will proceed using MAD phase assignment and conventional
crystallographic techniques. Refinements and extensions to the currently
implemented MAD phasing algorithms will be developed in the course of the work.
Drs. Merritt and Adman will evaluate the existing and newly developed MAD
phasing algorithms by comparison of the resulting MAD phases and electron
density maps against the corresponding phases and maps of the refined crystal
structures. Multiple-Wavelength Anomalous Dispersion (MAD) phase assignment has
recently been used successfully to determine the structure of several small
proteins. An outstanding advantage of this novel technique is that structures
may be determined using diffraction measurements from a single crystal of native
protein. The method is based on measuring small changes in X-ray scattering
amplitude as a function of X-ray wavelength. The eventual range of structure
determinations for which it becomes the method of choice will depend on
improving both experimental technique and data analysis to overcome the
relatively small signal-to-noise ratio.***
