In this project, the P.I. will continue his pioneering studies of ocean
circulation and heat transport, concentrating on extending his North Pacific
analysis to include nutrient transport across 24 degrees N, analyzing a Fine
Resolution Antarctic Model output to determine effects of eddies on the
Antarctic Circumpolar Current, and using recent high-quality hydrographic
sections across 12 degrees S and 23 degrees S to begin some new studies of
meridional circulation and heat transport in the South Atlantic.
