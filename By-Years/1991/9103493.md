This grant is to support the travel of two U.S. graduate students to the
U.S.S.R., and the travel of two Soviet graduate students to the U.S. as a
supplement to a Soviet-American Senior Scientist exchange funded by the National
Academy of Sciences and the Akademia Nauk. The purpose of the exchange grant is
to compare state-of-the-art techniques in paleoseismology, a critical tool for
the evaluation of the seismic hazard of active faults. Fault trenching will be
done in Utah and in the Baikal rift zone of the U.S.S.R. This research is a
component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
