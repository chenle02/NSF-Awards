Abstract for NSF proposal DMS-0103355:

In this project, the principal investigator investigates the geometry of Calabi-
Yau manifolds and mirror symmetry. First the PI plans to describe the
degeneration of Kahler-Einstein metrics on Calabi-Yau manifolds near the large
complex structure limit. Second the principal investigator studies special
Lagrangian submanifolds and deformed Hermitian-Yang-Mills bundles on Calabi-Yau
manifolds. Third, using Fourier transformation, Legendre transformation and
their variations, the principal investigator explains the mirror duality of
complex geometry and symplectic geometry between mirror manifolds.

The geometry of Calabi-Yau manifolds is an important subject in Mathematics,
and also in Physics. Originated in String theory, mirror symmetry conjecture
gives a duality transformation of this geometry. This project is towards
uncovering this amazing symmetry principle.
