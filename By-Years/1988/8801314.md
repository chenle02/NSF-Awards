This research is in algebraic geometry. The plan is to characterize Alexander
Schemes, more specifically, to characterize geometrically schemes of finite type
over a field that have the properties of smooth schemes from the point of view
of intersection theory with rational coefficients. Also the plan is to construct
moduli spaces for stable principal bundles with reductive structure group on
smooth projective varieties.
