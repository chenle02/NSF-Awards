The National Urban League (NUL) will form a Preschool Science Collaborative
with Educational Equity Concepts, the Boston Children's Museum, American
Association for the Advancement of Science and Association of Science Technology
Centers to develop, field test, produce and disseminate physical science
activities for preschool children and to provide training for parents and
teachers of this age group. Materials that will be produced by the Collaborative
include a center- based science activities manual, activities booklet for use by
parents and play spaces or corners for science explorations. A promotional
videotape will be developed to highlight various parts of the training for
parents and teachers and to promote the use of materials in all preschool
centers. The materials will be field tested in twelve Urban League affliates
representing a broad cross section of participants. The preschool program is a
component of NUL's Education Initiative which is interested in improving science
education for preschool children from low income or single family households. It
will receive the benefits of all the support resources that are available
through NUL. The directors, staff and subcontractors are highly qualified to
conduct this project. With the increasing number of children involved in early
education, the project should be extremely valuable in increasing our
understanding of what is happening to young children in preschools,
particularly, minority children. This proposal clearly addresses the need for
science literacy among teachers, staff and parents of preschool children and
will refine, document and test a curriculum which consists of science eduction
activities. The program will help to build skills of both teachers and parents,
working cooperatively, to stimulate critical thinking in young children. The
project's goals are consistent with those of the Instructional materials
Development Program.
