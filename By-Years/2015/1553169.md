Four decades of research on database systems has mostly focused on improving
average raw performance. This competition for faster performance has,
understandably, neglected predictability of our database management systems.
However, as database systems have become more complex, their erratic and
unpredictable performance has become a major challenge facing database users and
administrators alike. With the increasing reliance of mission-critical business
applications on their databases, maintaining high levels of database performance
(i.e., service level guarantees) is now more important than ever. Cloud users
find it challenging to provision and tune their database instances, due to the
highly non-linear and unpredictable nature of today's databases. Even for
deployed databases, performance tuning has become somewhat of a black art,
rendering qualified database administrators a scare
resource.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, we restore the missing virtue of
predictability in the design of database systems. First, we quantify the major
sources of uncertainty in a database in a principled manner. Then, by rethinking
the traditional design of a database system, we architect a new generation of
databases that treat predictability as a first class-citizen in their various
stages of query processing, from physical design to memory management and query
scheduling. Moreover, to accommodate existing database systems (which are not
predictable by design), we provide effective tools and methodologies for
predicting their performance more accurately. Building a predictable database in
a bottom-up fashion and in a principled manner, offers great insight into
improving existing database products and can instigate a radical shift in the
way that future databases are designed and implemented. For more information on
