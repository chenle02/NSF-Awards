This EAGER project develops computational tools to enable lab-on-a-chip devices
that can be optically actuated using smartphones and tablets. Low-cost, portable
lab-on-a-chip systems can impact a wide variety of applications including
biomolecule production, point-of-care medical diagnostics, newborn screening,
and biochemical sensing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The developed algorithms and
software will coordinate the motions of droplets of chemicals on light-actuated
digital microfluidic (LADM) chips by using moving patterns of projected light to
optically actuate the droplets.
