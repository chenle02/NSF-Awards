This project explores a new approach to sequencing by hybridization (SBH),
which uses interaction to dramatically reduce the number of oligonucleotides for
de novo sequencing of large DNA fragments, while preserving the parallelism
which is the primary advantage of SBH. The goals of the project include: (1)
Development of efficient algorithms for the interactive design of sequencing
chips; and (2) Utilization of simulation results to establish that 64kb
fragments can be sequenced (obtained using approximately ten rounds of standard-
sized 64k oligonucleotide arrays). The project includes the following
theoretical and laboratory research in interactive SBH: (a) In a collaborative
effort with biochemists at Oxford University, England, algorithmic issues in the
design and manufacture SBH arrays, under a variety of fabrication technologies,
are examined; (b) Algorithmic issues inherent in reconstructing DNA sequences
from hybridization data, under complications such as non-classical chip designs
and hybridization errors, are studied; and (c) Algorithmic issues inherent in
other novel variations of SBH, particularly photolithography-based interactive
SBH and positional SBH, are investigated. This project is jointly funded with
the Computational Biological Activity.***
