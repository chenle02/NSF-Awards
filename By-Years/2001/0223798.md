This project seeks to better understand and quantify the physical processes
involved in the newly proposed concept of wet drainage flow in major river
valleys under sustained rainfall. The suggested mechanism behind this phenomenon
is air subsiding as a result of cooling from melting and evaporation of
precipitation particles. The subsiding air concentrates in river valleys, which
act as air drainage. The resulting down-valley flow can develop underneath an
opposite-directed flow of moist air that is lifted onto the topographic barrier
in which precipitation is formed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The analyses to be
carried out during this project are focused on (a) in-depth evaluation of
ground-based and airborne Doppler radar and thermodynamic data collected in
major river valleys on the south side of the European Alps during the Mesoscale
Alpine Program (MAP), and (b) numerical simulation of the wet drainage flow
phenomenon and numerical experimentation to delineate the conditions under which
this occurs and evaluate a potential feedback to orographic precipitation
formation mechanisms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is focused on the
effect of moist processes on the flow of air within valleys, complementing
substantial work performed on airflow in valleys under dry (clear sky)
conditions. The proposed analyses will help to better define the new concept of
wet drainage flow and assess the relevance of this flow phenomenon to dynamic
and microphysical processes ranging from the local (valley) scale to the
topographic barrier and larger scales. The research is tightly knitted to MAP,
which is focused on exploring the mesoscale effects of complex topography on
precipitation formation and flooding. MAP is conceived as an integrated program
of basic research with direct applications in the realm of numerical mesoscale
weather prediction. Orographic precipitation mechanisms in the Alpine region, as
well as many other major mountain ranges around the world, are an important
element of flooding, landslide and debris flow hazards.
