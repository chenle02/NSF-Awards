9803619 He Infinitesimal deformation of disk patterns in the plane can be
characterized by harmonic functions on an electric network that is obtained by a
simple geometric construction. Properties of the electrical network may be used
to derive rigidity properties of disk patterns. The technique may also be
applied to prove characterizations of three-dimensional convex hyperbolic
polyhedra, generalizing both Andreev's Theorem and a characterization theorem
due to Hodgson and Rivin. The investigator will explore relationships between
the deformation of disk patterns and that of three-dimensional hyperbolic cone-
manifolds, and study the applications of these results to other fields. He will
also continue the research on the Koebe uniformization conjecture. The study of
geometry and topology in two and three dimensions are intimately related. Many
three-dimensional geometric topology problems may be reduced to problems in two
dimensions, and geometric structures may be applied to solve topological
problems. This project's research on disk patterns, three-dimensional hyperbolic
polyhedra, circle domains and disk packings, three-dimensional geometric
structures and their applications, and on topological hydrodynamics, will
contribute to a better understanding of the geometry and physics of our real
world. It is also an interesting fact that geometric structures on manifolds can
be applied to yield information on their topology, and in turn the information
on their topology may be used in some problems in hydrodynamics. There is a
related study of Moebius energy of knots and links, where several most
elementary questions remain unsolved. This is a field where theory and
experiment meet well. ***
