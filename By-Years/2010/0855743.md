The proposal concerns two topics in the area of noncommutative algebra, namely,
noncommutative projective geometry and the theory of noncommutative Iwasawa
algebras. The principal investigator proposes to work on some central projects
in the field such as Artin's program on noncommutative projective surfaces and
the classification of quantum projective three-spaces (or the classification of
connected graded Artin-Schelter regular algebras of global dimension four). The
principal investigator proposes to study the module theory of noncommutative
Iwasawa algebras and to understand the connection between the algebraic side and
the number-theoretic side of the noncommutative Iwasawa theory. Another goal of
the proposal is to search for various ring-theoretic and homological invariants
that reflect and predict the structure of noncommutative
algebras.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Noncommutativity is a very common and
increasingly important phenomenon in Mathematics and other disciplines. The
subject of noncommutative algebra is the mathematical foundation for
characterizing and understanding noncommutativity. As more details of
noncommutativity are to be revealed, it is essential to examine the structure of
noncommutative algebras. Recent developments in noncommutative algebraic
geometry furnish new ideas and methods for the study of noncommutative algebras.
Part of the proposal emphasizes some classification problems of noncommutative
algebras using techniques from algebraic geometry. The project has applications
to other subjects such as algebraic geometry, number theory and mathematical
physics, and will enhance broader understanding of these subjects.&lt;br/&gt;
