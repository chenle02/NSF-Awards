9404039 Walker The PIs for this project will conduct exploratory research on
lithium isotopes (6Li-7Li) in several earth science systems. These isotopes have
the potential for use as conservative hydrologic tracers and also as tracers of
magmatic evolution. The research will utilize newly developed techniques for
thermal ionization mass spectrometric analysis to investigate (1) the effects of
high-temperature magmatic fractionation on Li isotopes in a well characterized
suite of Hawaiian basalts, (2) the variation of Li isotope compositions in a
suite of related granites from the Black Hills of South Dakota, and (3) Li
isotopic variations in a controlled hydrologic test area.
