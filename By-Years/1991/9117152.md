This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of spectrochemical analysis. During the tenure of this three year
continuing grant, Professor Marcus and his students will develop and evaluate
radio frequency glow discharge (rf-GD) devices as spectrochemical sources for
direct solids elemental analysis by atomic emission, atomic absorption, and mass
spectrometric methods. The rf-GD approach is particularly advantageous for the
analysis of non-conducting solids that do not yield to sputtering/atomization by
graphite furnace or other more conventional approaches. Four specific thrust
areas for investigation are (1) development of methods for quantification in rf-
GD mass and emission techniques, (2) characterization of excitation/ionization
processes in rf-GD, (3) exploration of pulsed and variable frequency plasma
operation, and (4) development of an rf-GD atomic absorption atomizer. %%% This
research addresses an area of spectrochemical analysis which is of major
technological importance. It builds upon results obtained under NSF grant
CHE-8901788 and should provide the basis for the rapid and reliable direct
elemental analysis of glass, ceramic, and other nonconducting solid materials.
