9704730 Healey We plan to carry out research in global nonlinear analysis of
partial differential equations of nonlinear elastostatics. A major thrust of the
proposed work will be focused on applications of a new general existence tool
developed recented by Simpson &amp; myself (from past partial NSF support),
viz., a generalization of the Leray-Schauder degree for global continuation and
bifurcation. In the context a concrete problems, we seek a-prior bounds,
symmetry/positivity properties, etc., all with a view toward obtaining
meaningful constitutive restrictions for entire classes of materials. Our study
will include both traditional (strongly elliptic) problems and those involving
phase change (loss of ellipticity). For the latter, a new approach based upon
higher-gradient regularization, global continuation and singular limits is being
proposed. The analysis of such models at a very general level is fundamental to
the understanding of traditional engineering materials/structures and
martensitic transformations and shape-memory effects, which are observed in many
advanced engineering alloys. The work has two major goals: (i) To obtain new
qualitative results and detect new phenomena - of both mathematical and physical
significance; (ii) To obtain new global-continuation (existence) results in
problems of 2 and 3-dimensional elasticity - including problems involving phase
transformations. Broadly speaking,the proposed work will provide important
mathematical underpinnings to difficult nonlinear problems arising in
traditional engineering fields like structural &amp; mechanical engineering and
also in more modern areas like materials science. The work has the potential to:
(i) deliver new mathematical tools for the analysis of difficult problems of
engineering practice,leading ultimately to safer and more optimal design of
structures; (ii) lead to a better understanding of the nonlinear material
behavior of certain engineering alloys, with potential application s to
manufacturing engineering and the design of non-passive or "smart" structures.
