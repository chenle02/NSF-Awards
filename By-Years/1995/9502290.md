The objective of this CAREER research program is to determine the effects of ion
beam bombardment on the magnetic and electrical properties of evaporated
Permalloy-nitrogen-iron thin films. The electrical, magnetoresistive and
magnetic properties of the films are measured as a function of ion species, flux
and energy, substrate temperature, and post-deposition annealing treatment. The
microstructure of the films is characterized and correlated to the electrical
and magnetic properties. This research is a collaborative project with IBM
Almaden Research Center. The educational objectives include course and
curriculum development in electronic, optical and magnetic materials, as well as
undergraduate and graduate research supervision, advising, and educational
outreach. The curriculum development efforts are focused on an interdisciplinary
course sequence for electrical and materials engineering students in electronic
materials processing in a team-based, open-ended design laboratory setting. %%%
Ion beam bombardment during electron beam evaporation of Permalloy films is used
to imp rove the magnetoresistive response of films used in magnetoresistive read
heads in magnetic disk drives. ;
