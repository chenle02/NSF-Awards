The San Diego Museum of Man has an outstanding collection of human osteological
materials consisting of over 3,000 specimens collected during the first half of
this century by Dr. Arthur W. Meyer of Stanford University. These collections,
along with the Hrdlicka paleopathology collection, form an important
anthropological resource that can be used to better understand human bone
pathologies in societies without antibiotics. The size, scope, and documentation
of the collection make it a unique and irreplaceable research and reference
collection. The museum successfully conserved and upgraded the Hrdlicka
collection several years ago, thereby establishing themselves with an excellent
record in collections management in physical anthropology. During this project
they will improve the documentation of the specimens in the Stanford.Meyer
collection and upgrade storage. While these collections have been the basis for
much scholarly research, this use itself has damaged the objects. The
improvements in collections management will make them safely accessible to an
even wider scholarly community.
