The research will concentrate on magnetic cataclysmic variables, which are
binary star systems in which a magnetic white dwarf accretes matter from a
companion star. Topics include the cyclotron emission from hot magnetized
plasmas, radio emission from them, and the process of accretion onto magnetic
stellar polar caps. Among the many violent cosmic phenomena, some occur because
two stars orbit about each other and gases begin to flow from one star to the
other until an explosion occurs on the receiving star. This award supports
theory and modelling of mass transfer onto a highly magnetic white dwarf, an
Earth-sized star. Observations of such objects have improved to the point where
one may expect new physical understanding of exceedingly hot and highly
magnetized plasmas, because these astronomical plasmas occur on a scale vastly
larger than the Earth's laboratories or even its magnetic surroundings.
