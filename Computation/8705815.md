The Department of Mathematics at Washington University in St. Louis will
purchase six SUN Microsystems workstations and a central server which will be
dedicated to support research in the mathematical sciences. The equipment will
be used for several research projects, including: 1. The porous medium equation
and families of nonlinear partial differential equations arising in harmonic
analysis. 2. Numerical implementation of the phi-transform, and related
operator-theoretic questions with applications to signal and image processing
and to electromagnetic scattering. 3. Complex differential invariants,
biholomorphic mappings and automorphims of domains, and eigenvalue asymptotics
for the coupled beam equations. 4. Biological modeling, epidemiological studies
and predicting AIDS population dynamics. 5. Magnetic resonance image processing
in mamography.
