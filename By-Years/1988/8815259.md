This is a three-year continuing grant to Steven Heppelmann, Pennsylvania State
University, to support work on an experiment at Brookhaven National Laboratory.
The experiment, of which Heppelmann is the Spokesperson, is a study of nuclear
"color transparency" in hard collisions of protons with nuclei. The experiment
will reveal some of the properties of quarks in nuclei. In particular, the
effective size of the region of space in which quarks interact and the energy
dependence of this size will be studied.
