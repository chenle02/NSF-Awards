The enumerative aspects of algebraic combinatorics with its strong connections
to representation theory and algebraic geometry has been a very active area of
research for decades. Other enumerative questions related to the number of faces
of polytopes, simplical complexes, triangulated and homology spheres, and
hyperplane and subspace arrangements had an explosive growth since the mid-70's.
We propose to organize a CBMS lecture series that will showcase the topological
and algebraic aspects of this development by ten lectures given by Anders
Bjorner who has been at the vanguard of this revolution from its early days. The
proposed conference will focus on topics where posets have played an important
role. Anders Bjorner is the leading expert on algebraic and topological
combinatorics that is relevant to partially ordered sets. His lectures will be a
comprehensive summary of the contemporary topological combinatorics related to
partially ordered sets. This will have a strong influence on the future research
of the participants and local combinatorics community.
