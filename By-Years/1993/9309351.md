Computing Research is a very young research area. In the past few years it has
become clear that computation is joining experimentation and mathematical
analysis, providing a basic new scientific paradigm for how science gets done.
In such a new and rapidly changing field, communication among researchers is
particularly important. However, the conference structure in computer science
and engineering is highly fragmented and works against such communication.
Important new research results are seldom presented at broad based national
meetings. Consequently, broad based meetings are seldom attended by active
researchers. The Federated Computing Research Conference will address this
problem. This conference will retain the advantages of smaller specialized
meetings while at the same time facilitating communication among researchers in
different subfields. Additional benefits of this meeting include: (1) economies
of scale, (2) providing an educational function for the public, (3) stimulating
new research.
