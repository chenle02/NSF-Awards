This work covers two main areas of research in high performance transaction
systems: structures for integrity and concurrency and models for analyzing and
simulating such systems. The first area is concerned with methods for
guaranteeing integrity, recoverability and high performance for transactions
having long duration and user interaction. A new level of concurrency control
has been introduced to provide a transaction-like session that would have these
properties, but that would not degrade performance and availability as much as a
true long duration transaction would. A language for defining and manipulating
this new level of concurrency is being developed. This language will be
implemented on an elaborate network emulation that has already been developed.
The second part of the proposed research concerns the problem of modelling the
performance of concurrency control and buffer management algorithms for database
systems. A new stochastic model of data access has been introduced. This model
reflects the observed behavior of real database systems better than the existing
models. Although access to data granules is highly nonuniform, this new model is
analytically tractable and easy to simulate. A prototype simulator has already
been developed, and various buffer and cache management algorithms are being
tested.
