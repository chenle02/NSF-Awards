A central focus in science, technology and society studies examines uses of
science and scientific tools in societal and organizational decision-making.
These are situations where values have important influence, particularly in
areas of scientific complexity and uncertainty. Global change represents a new
area of scientific study, directed at predicting the effects of natural
processes and human technology on the biosphere. The complexity and urgency
surrounding the development of this field and application of its findings makes
it an important area to study. This project will examine two global change/earth
system science cases: carbon dioxide and ozone. It will explore the nature and
implications of the developing scientific understanding of these phenomena, with
particular attention to the values and evidence that ground scientific
assumptions, methods, and findings. The study will proceed in six stages:
collection of pertinent literature and identification of key participants;
evaluation and analysis of key issues from key documents; isolation, evaluation
and analysis of issues with respect to carbon dioxide and ozone; development and
administration of questionnaires and interviews of key informants; analysis of
findings with respect to the two cases; and presentation and publication of
results. This project addresses a very important issue. The principal
investigator and consultant are very well qualified; institutional support is
very good; collaborative efforts are likely to continue beyond the period of
this award; results are likely to be appropriately disseminated and useful. An
award in the amount of $54,327 is therefore recommended.
