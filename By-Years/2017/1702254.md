The symmetries of a snowflake or a baseball are described by the notion of a
group. Groups also describe more abstract symmetries, including supersymmetry in
theoretical particle physics. Many important symmetries are described by
continuous groups known as Lie groups, after mathematician Sophus Lie; these
groups are generated by associated Lie algebras. Quantum groups, which are
deformations of such symmetries, also serve as a shadow of higher structures.
This research project aims to further develop a new approach, via so-called
i-quantum groups, to representations of Lie algebras and Lie superalgebras. This
new approach aims to uncover the underlying geometric and higher categorical
structures of i-quantum groups. Results are expected also to have applications
to knot theory.

Because of recently discovered connections to geometry of flag varieties,
canonical bases, and categorification, i-quantum groups, which are co-ideal
subalgebras of Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum groups, have been shown to play an
increasingly important role in the theory of quantum groups and representations
of Lie algebras and Lie superalgebras. In this project the investigator plans to
develop the theory of canonical bases and categorical actions of i-quantum
groups and their modules in the Kac-Moody setting. In particular, a
categorification of affine -quantum groups will be formulated and applied to
study the modular representation theory of quantum (super)groups of classical
type at roots of unity and classical algebraic groups in prime characteristic.
Character formulae in Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand category for exceptional Lie
superalgebras will also be formulated.
