Membrane diffusion is an inherently slow process. Consequently, membrane-based
separation processes can be only economically viable if extremely thin, defect-
free membranes are used. Thin-film composite membranes with a permselective
layer thickness down to about 0.5 >m can be made by presently available
techniques. The goal of this program is to develop the technology for making
industrial-scale composite membranes with a permselective layer thickness of 0.1
>m or below. The membranes will be made by solution coating an elastomeric
polymer material onto a microporous support. The upper surface of the coated
layer will then be converted to a glassy crosslinked zone by surface treatment
with a reactive organic species. The result will be a zone of thickness less
than 0.1 >m with greatly enhanced selectivity. Because the glassy layer is so
thin, the flux will also be very high compared with that of a standard composite
membrane with a glassy permselective layer.
