A tsunami laboratory facility -- a component of the George E. Brown, Jr. Network
for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) -- was funded recently at Oregon
State University. This action is to support a workshop to review the present
plan for this facility, to learn its physical constraints and limitations, to
discuss potential research to be conducted at this facility, and to make
recommendations for instrumentation needed to undertake this
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This tsunami facility will be utilized for a wide
variety of research topics in tsunami hazard mitigation, as well as other
research fields such as coastal engineering, nearshore oceanography, and
geotechnical engineering. This facility -- a large-scale, three-dimensional,
long-wave tank - will have essentially unique capabilities. This workshop will
be an important step in providing input from the potential users. Also, the NEES
program announcement contained the following statement, "The NEES collaboratory
will form an integrated network that facilitates interdisciplinary collaboration
among scientists and engineers, both within the U.S. and abroad." In this
regard, the advanced network technologies will permit enhanced international
collaborations through this tsunami facility. Therefore the workshop
participants will include both national and international key scientists and
engineers, not only tsunami researchers, but also researchers from other
relevant research communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prior to the workshop, the
PI will set up an electronic mailing list to start the discussion and to provide
relevant workshop information. Following the workshop, the organizing committee
will distribute the workshop report, including posting it on the workshop web
site, the Tsunami Bulletin Board (TBB) and the Coastal_List (CL). (TBB and CL
are e-mail bulletin boards for the tsunami and coastal-engineering research
communities, respectively.)&lt;br/&gt;
