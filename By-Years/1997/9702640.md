This project will focus on the development and evaluation of scheduling and run-
time optimization techniques for supporting the parallelization of irregular
scientific code with mixed granularity on distributed memory machines and
workstation clusters. The main research topics will be to develop general
space/time efficient scheduling techniques and integrate memory and
communication support for solving large-scale irregular problems. A software
tool will be developed for evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed
techniques and providing an infrastructure which can be used by other
researchers. Interoperability with other tools will also be investigated if time
and funds permit. The targeted applications will be mainly in irregular
scientific computing such as iterative methods for nonlinear equations and
sparse matrix based solvers. The educational activities will include course
development for undergraduate parallel computing, with an emphasis on parallel
programming and basic scientific algorithms on distributed and shared memory
machines. ***
