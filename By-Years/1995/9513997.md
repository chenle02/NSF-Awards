9513997 Cherry A group at Louisiana State has participated in an international
collaboration-the Japanese American Cooperative Emulsion Experiment (JACEE) - in
carrying out experiments from which they will obtain information on the
composition of cosmic-rays. This grant supports their continuing analysis of the
data recorded in emulsions carried to high altitudes on long-duration balloon
fights that circle the South Pole. ***
