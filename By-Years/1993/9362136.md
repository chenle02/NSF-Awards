9362136 Sherman An important kind of powders for producing advanced materials
are of a fine size (less than 30 microns, corresponding to Geldart class C
powders) cohesive and difficult to fluidize. Applications of coatings or surface
modifications of these powders by fluidization at elevated temperature may
produce undesirable hard agglomerates. Operating a fluidized bed above transport
limit (fast fluidization) or in the turbulent fluidization region may enable
class C powders, to be fluidized with high product yields. In this Phase I of
the project, Ultrament will demonstrate the feasibility of using a fast-
fluidized or turbulent fluidized bed for the application of coatings to fine
particles and whiskers. This will allow the production of improved starting
materials for powder metallurgy, ceramic, and composite materials, as well as
improved conductive fillers, reinforcements, and electronic materials. ***
