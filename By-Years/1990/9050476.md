This award provides funds to the departments of Chemistry and Biochemistry which
will help purchase equipment that will expose the undergraduate students taking
biochemistry to laboratory exercises which will include computer-aided
instruction of recombinant DNA techniques. A cohesive series of laboratory
experiments will be developed which will provide a student with practical
exposure to a) the fundamental techniques in recombinant DNA research, b) the
fundamental techniques of protein chemistry and c) the use of computers as an
integral part of biochemical experimentation through the in-depth exploration of
a single biological system. The grantee is matching this award with non- Federal
sources.
