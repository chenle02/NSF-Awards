This research is designed to establish the morphological character,
segmentation geometry, and structure of a significant length of the Mid-Atlantic
Ridge in the central North Atlantic, and to test hypotheses on crustal accretion
processes along a slowly spreading mid-ocean ridge. Questions to be addressed
are: (1) What is the effect of the Azores hotspot on the morphology,
segmentation geometry, and structure of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge? (2) Do major
fracture zones in the central North Atlantic separate portions of the Mid-
Atlantic Ridge with significantly different styles and wavelengths of
segmentation? (3) How are differences in the pattern of mantle Bouguer anomalies
at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge related to inter-segment morphotectonic variability?
(4) What is the relative abundance of conventional transform faults and non-
transform discontinuities along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge? (5) What controls the
formation, stability, and evolution of non-transform offsets on the Mid-Atlantic
Ridge? The principal investigators will participate in two cruises of the French
ship R/V l'Atalante.
