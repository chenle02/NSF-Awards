Research interests are in the development of optical tomographic imaging of
breast tissue for cancer detection, the evaluation of non-linear smoothing
operators in image restoration, and the application of electrical and thermal
modeling techniques to tumor hyperthermia and electrosurgery studies. In the
tomographic imaging area, a device has been designed and is being built to
collect projection data from a pulsed laser diode source to perform tomographic
reconstruction of the imaging cross-section without the use of X-rays. The major
application of this work in thermographic imaging is in the use of both the
visible and infrared spectra to determine tissue properties during relatively
long (2-second) laser pulses.
