Abstract.&lt;br/&gt;Title: Mechanical Properties of Arthropod Structures:
Engineering the Future.&lt;br/&gt;PI. : K. Loudon, University of Kansas Center
for Research Inc&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this proposal is to provide
supplemental funding for a symposium entitled: Mechanical Properties of
Arthropod Structures: Engineering the Future, which will take place at the
annual meeting of the Entomological Society of America. The symposium will bring
six speakers together to interact for the first time to showcase new techniques,
experiments, and discoveries in the area of biological materials and structures
of terrestrial arthropods (insects and spiders).&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this
symposium is to stimulate further interdisciplinary research and to bring this
area of science to the attention of a broad audience. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
