This award will provide approximately half the funds needed to acquire an
automated X-ray diffractometer. The additional funds necessary for this
acquisition have been committed by the University of Wyoming. This instrument
will be one of the central analytical instruments to enable ongoing research in
geochemistry,clay mineralogy, and clastic diagenesis within the Geology
Department. It will also be used by faculty and students engaged in studies of
mineral assemblages in igneous and metamorphic rocks. Researchers in soil and
environmental chemistry are also expected to be users. This new automated
instrument will replace old diffractometers which are no longer capable of
performing up to today's standards. This new diffractometer will also make it
possible to teach undergraduates and graduates in mineralogy and petrology
courses with state-of-the-art instrumentation. A full-time experienced staff
member will be responsible for instrument maintenance and will train and assist
users.
