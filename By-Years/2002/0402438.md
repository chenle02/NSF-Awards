The project impacts the preparation of technicians and engineers for the many
industries that develop alternatively powered products now and in the future.
The project impacts much of Ohio and provides a model that can be replicated
anywhere. A new emerging power technology (EPT) curriculum is developed and is
incorporated into College Tech Prep programs at the secondary level and advances
to an EPT option that complement engineering technology programs at four
community colleges. There is a natural progression to baccalaureate engineering
programs at five participating universities, which strengthens their curriculum
in fuel cell and other emerging power technologies on their own or through this
project and enhances their articulation arrangements with participating two-year
colleges. The goal infuses existing programs with content on emerging power
technologies, enabling education and businesses to maintain the
interdisciplinary nature of fuel cell research and applications. Business
involvement with curriculum development and teacher training, and student
experiences with fuel cell research labs and emerging power technology
companies, and close integration of education programs are cornerstones of the
project. Faculty training and ongoing professional development opportunities are
an essential project component to ensure the continued delivery of updated
content in the classroom.
