This award provides one-half the funding for the acquisition of an inductively-
coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OE) system that will be
operated and maintained in the Department of Geosciences at the University of
Houston. The University is committed to providing the remaining half of funds
necessary. Chemical analysis of rocks, minerals, and natural water samples is an
integral requirement of several research projects in the Department, and the
ICP-OE technique is one of the standard methods for obtaining accurate multi-
element analyses of chemically complex natural samples.
