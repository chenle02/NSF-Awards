9415327 Shaw Partial travel support is provided to 12 speakers at the "Joint
NSF-NIST Conference on Ultrafine Particle Engineering" to be held on May 26-27,
1994, at NSF. The purpose of the meeting is to bring together NSF and NIST
grantees, as well as researchers and managers from industry involved in
collaborative projects, to review the results of the NSF initiative worth the
same name, promote collaborations among academic, NIST and industrial
researchers, and review future research needs. The main topics of the meeting
will be production of nano-sized particles, their characterization, and
applications. The Conference will be organized into four parts: Synthesis of
Ultrafine Particles; Characterization of Nanometer-scale Particulate Materials;
Industrial Perspective; and Future Research tends and Opportunities for
Collaborative Projects. This is a timely meeting to evaluate the results of the
ENG/NSF initiative on Ultrafine Particle Engineering started in 1991, the
opportunities created at NIST by increased funding in this field is FY94, and
new NSF and NIST initiatives for collaboration with industry. The proceedings
will be published. ***
