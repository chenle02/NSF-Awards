This project will develop software tools for the automatic adaptive solution of
systems of partial differential equations on parallel and vector computers. The
adaptive techniques will be capable of solving a wide variety of partial
differential systems using finite element methods that contain combinations of
mesh moving, local refinement, and error estimation procedures. The adaptive
software will be developed using the equational language system MODEL. This
sophisticated system contains facilities for the convenient description of
complex mathematical systems and for the automatic detection of parallelism and
the scheduling of parallel processors. The research will necessitate (i)
improving the mesh moving, local refinement, and error estimation techniques;
(ii) dynamic scheduling algorithms for assigning processors as computational
cells are added to or deleted from a mesh; (iii) balancing the computational
load on the processors of the parallel system, and (iv) developing a multigrid
solution strategy for solving linear algebraic systems. The resulting software
will enable scientists and engineers to solve a wide variety of complex problems
on several computing environments.
