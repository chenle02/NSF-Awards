This project is in the area of the Materials Chemistry Initiative. The
investigators will use an x-ray standing wave in the study of electrochemical
interfaces. They will employ this technique in the study of ionic gradients at
the electrode/solution interface including potential dependence studies. In
addition, they will study the structure of electrodeposited layers; both
metallic and polymeric by combining the x-ray standing wave technique with
surface EXAFS spectroscopy.
