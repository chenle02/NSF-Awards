The current ASTM requirements for reinforcing bar geometry were established over
40 years ago and are now incorporated in four ASTM specifications covering
reinforcing bars. The proposed research will apply the latest in analysis and
testing techniques to evaluate currently used and potential new rib geometries,
and to develop recommendations aimed at obtaining optimum reinforcing bar
development characteristics. The program will include a basic study of the
interactions at the steel-concrete interface, apply nonlinear finite element
analyses to evaluate different rib geometries, test existing patterns and
prototype bars, design and produce reinforcing bars with new patterns, and
evaluate the bars in full-size structural members. Structural considerations
will include the effects of the interactions of closely spaced reinforcement,
the behavior of splices as well as straight development, cyclic loading, fatigue
and fracture, and high strength concrete. In addition the effects of epoxy
coating on bond strength and modifications to epoxy coatings, such as the
addition of grit, will be considered.
