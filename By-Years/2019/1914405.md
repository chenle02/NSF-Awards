The grant supports students to travel to the International Symposium on Software
Testing and Analysis (ISSTA 2019), which is the top conference on software
testing/analysis and one of the top conferences in the field of Software
Engineering. This year the event will take place in Beijing, China in mid-July.
The purpose is to facilitate technical exchange of information and research
conversations/collaborations, as well as advances in the field made possible by
these interactions. Mechanisms are specified to ensure participation of under-
represented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The benefits are the education,
training and mentoring received by the participants. The international nature of
this conference helps develop a globally-aware workforce of research and
educators within the US and helps build the community of researchers in the
field of Software Engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
