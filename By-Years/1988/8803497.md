This research is concerned with algebraic K-theory, particularly the structure
and computability of the K-theory of varieties with singularities. The principal
investigator plans to study the recently discovered chern characters, both
primary and secondary, which relate K-theory to cyclic homology, as well as, the
conjecture that the K-groups of a singular projective variety are built up from
the K-groups of rings. The K-theory of special rings will also be studied with
an eye toward structural results such as K-regularity and vanishing of negative
K-groups. The research supported is in algebraic K-theory and algebraic
geometry. In this project, the principal investigator applies K-theoretic
techniques to algebraic surfaces, studying the structural changes that occur in
K-groups when singularities are introduced.
