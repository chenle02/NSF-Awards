The research dramatically improves file system performance and reliability by
using Magnetic RAM as a permanent store for both file system indexes (metadata)
and data. Keeping metadata in MRAM increases the speed of metadata operations by
more than an order of magnitude while decreasing software complexity and
improving integrity. This research also investigates dynamic memory-based
algorithms for metadata management, reducing metadata size and complexity while
increasing metadata flexibility. The research explores the effects of varying
MRAM sizes and performance characteristics on file system performance and the
choice of file system algorithms.

The higher file system performance and higher reliability made possible by this
research has several far-reaching impacts. First, file system performance
improvements of an order of magnitude dramatically reduces file server costs,
making storage more affordable. Second, the reduced code complexity enabled by
the use of memory-based algorithms permits faster development of simpler file
servers. Third, the increased reliability from lower code complexity and
continuous integrity checking allows the production of much more reliable file
servers. The research is also applicable to systems built with other emerging
non-volatile memory technologies such as FeRAM and new types of Flash RAM.
