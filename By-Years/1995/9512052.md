This award from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at Indiana University at Gary acquire a Hewlett-Packard
Automated LC System with an autosampler, a quaternary pump and a variable
wavelength detector. The research activity to be supported includes:
Photocatalytic Degradation of Textile Dyes and Product Analysis by HPLC
Sonochemical Destruction of Organic Pollutants in Aqueous Solution. High
performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) is employed for the separation of
mixtures of diverse chemical composition, and the use of high pressure liquids
allows for the separation of more complicated materials.
