Radiation is the fundamental mechanism of energy exchange in many physical
processes and in the operations of devices for energy and medical applications.
In addition, radiation is used as an experimental tool to explore the basic
structure of materials. Improved mathematical algorithms and analysis of
radiation transport equations will enable important advances in these areas.
More generally, these equations serve as a mathematical prototype for a variety
of kinetic models that are used to describe dilute gases, plasmas, and
multiphase flows. They also demonstrate the fundamental multi-scale nature of
driven-dissipative systems. Historically, radiation transport equations have
been a driver for many fundamental developments in basic numerical methods
research. That trend will continue with this project. On the education side,
this project will support and train a student for a career in computational
mathematics. This includes support for travel to attend conferences and
workshops in order to share research and provide networking opportunities. This
grant will support 1 graduate student per year for 3 years.

This project seeks to address one of the fundamental challenges in the kinetic
description of radiation: the onset of ray effects in the discrete ordinates
approximation of the radiation transport equation. The approach proposed here is
based on the use of filters, which smooth the mathematical solution of these
equations in a specified manner, in order to improve the fidelity of numerical
solutions computed with under-resolved meshes. The project will advance
numerical methods for radiation transport equations and, more generally, for
kinetic equations and complex multi-physics systems. It will enable to the
development of spectral approximation techniques and the synthesis of such
techniques into the solution of large scale equations. It will introduce
analysis tools to better understand and improve the accuracy of numerical
approximation that are under-resolved, and it will establish connections with
other types of filtering and sub-scale modeling approaches that are currently
used in the simulation of fluids.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
