One relatively unexplored area of basic research of reinforced concrete is its
response under sub-zero temperatures. This topic has become more important in
recent years because of the emphasis given to cold regions resources exploration
and rebuilding of the decaying infrastructure in regions with cyclic freezing
conditions. The main objectives of the proposed research are: (1) To quantify
internal microstructural changes (2) To understand the local bond stress-slip
behavior (3) To formulate design guidelines
