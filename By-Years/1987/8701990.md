The proposed research is based on a unique system of trans-acting lectin
regulatory gene mutations in Dictyostelium. The goals of the proposal are to
study the role(s) of the lectins in morphogenesis and to examine some novel
aspects of developmental gene regulation. The disA and disB mutants fail to
express lectin. The drsA mutation supresses disB and renders lectin expression
constitutive. Cells carrying the disA mutation are defective in the
morphogenetic processes of streaming and chemotaxis. Using an in situ bioassay,
Dr. Alexander will determine the specific effects of the disA, disB, and drsA
lectin regulatory gene mutations on the capacity of the cells to form streams
during aggregation. The distribution of lectin in the cells of the migrating
slugs will be determined by immunofluorescent techniques. Dr. Alexander will
determine the effect of the drsA suppressor mutation on the pattern of
transcription of the lectin genes during growth and development. This will
clarify the nature of the phenotypic suppression. He will establish whether
strains carrying the mutation are sensistive to the effects of cAMP which is a
specific regulator of lectin gene transcription in wild type cells. Genetic
methods will be used throughout the study to provide properly constructed
experimental and control strains. Dr. Alexander is using the simple model system
of the cellular slime mold to study the general developmental problem of trans-
acting gene regulation and its relationship to the morphogenesis of
multicellular organisms.
