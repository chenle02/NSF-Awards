Northern Alabama is identified as a high technology area having a large number
of businesses, industries and government agencies that need technicians educated
at the two year college level with skills in visualization technology, virtual
reality programming and multimedia applications. In this study, government
agencies, businesses and industries are contacted to determine to identify the
common core of skills needed by visualization technicians and to determine
future national trends in the skill levels needed. Two year colleges are
contacted to determine what level of education is being offered and to share
curricula. Information is also gathered at various conferences on visualization
and related topics. A web page carries the information. The information is used
to establish skill standards and curricula for community colleges educating
technicians for these industries.
