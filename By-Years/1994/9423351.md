In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, Robert Sharp of
The University of Michigan at Ann Arbor will study nuclear and electron spin
relaxation phenomena of paramagnetic metal ions. Experimental and theoretical
work will be conducted to obtain a better understanding of zero field splitting
interactions and their effect on paramagnetic relaxation enhancements. A
theoretical description of spin motion and spin relaxation phenomena in cases of
very strong electron spin-lattice coupling will be developed, and experimental
and theoretical studies of the spin relaxation properties of Heisenberg
exchange-coupled polynuclear metal centers will be undertaken. These studies
will provide information relating to the design of contrasting agents for
Magnetic Resonance Imaging and structures of metallo-enzymes. Magnetic Resonance
Imaging is a widely used diagnostic technique. In order to obtain the maximum
resolution possible at low field strengths, an understanding of the contrast
mechanisms is necessary. This research will provide information which will
assist in the design of contrasting agents to enhance image quality and improve
sensitivity.
