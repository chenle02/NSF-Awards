This work is theoretical but motivated by practical considerations. Areas
studied are design aids for VLSI and VLSI algorithms. In the former the
principal investigator studies optimal algorithms, heuristics, and multiple
solutions for the rectilinear Steiner minimal tree problem. He is also pursue
new questions in his study of optimal parallel prefix circuits. These include:
extending the class over which he can optimize, finding new applications of the
parallel prefix method of computation and adapting the optimizer to an existing
design tool. In VLSI algorithms, he is continuing his investigation of finding
circuit algorithms that are worth being cast into silicon. This is an expansion
of his 1-selection algorithm work, and includes lower bound proofs of
algorithms.
