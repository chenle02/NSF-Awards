With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin in La Crosse will acquire
a three-laser heterodyne frequency measurement system. The measurement system
will allow the investigators to measure the wavelengths, frequencies and
characteristics (relative intensity, frequency offset and polarization) of newly
discovered laser emissions in the far infrared region. This equipment will then
be used in conjunction with an existing optically pumped molecular laser (OPML)
and Stark spectrometer. With this enhanced laser system, the principal
investigators will investigate molecules that are currently of interstellar and
atmospheric interest. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The addition of new laser emissions
greatly enhances the scope of optically pumped molecular lasers. By opening up
the short-wavelength portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, complete coverage
of the entire far infrared region is accomplished and a number of spectroscopic
techniques will benefit. These studies will involve the active participation of
undergraduates at the University of Wisconsin-LaCrosse. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
