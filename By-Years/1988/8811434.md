This proposal requests funds to purchase a high-quality, high- resolution
flourescence photomicroscope to be used by a group of staff members in the
divisions of basic research at the Institute for Cancer Research and Population
Oncology of the Fox Chase Cancer Center. The microscope will be used in research
projects in cell and molecular biology, developmental biology, tumor induction
and progression, and virology. Specific projects range from scanning of tissue
sections and cell cultures for specific viral antigens and gene products to
high-resolution, subcellular localization of proteins in individual cells. The
investigators are productive and have good track records. Support is
recommended.
