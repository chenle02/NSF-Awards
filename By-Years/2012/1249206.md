The Oklahoma Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (OK-LSAMP),
through a sub-contract with the University of Oklahoma (OU), proposes to support
twelve (12) LSAMP students who have completed baccalaureate degrees to pursue
and complete PhD programs in a STEM field. This proposal accords with NSF's goal
to increase the number of LSAMP students successfully completing terminal
degrees in STEM fields. It gives particular attention to the recruitment and
support of Native American, Hispanic, African American, and rural populations
from the region including women and first generation college students in
addition to a wide range of traditional under-represented groups. The long term
goal of this program is to increase the number of under-represented students who
complete doctoral degrees in STEM fields at OU. Collaboration between the Bridge
to the Doctorate (BD) program and other programs at OU will not only benefit the
BD Fellows but also the faculty engaged in research targeted toward promoting
diversity in STEM fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The BD program will support
students academically and professionally, ensuring they build the connections
and skills needed to excel and to ensure financial support for students in all
years of their doctoral programs. Program activities in support of these
objectives include, but are not limited to: (1) mentoring and networking
programs across STEM departments; (2) links to other NSF-funded programs; (3)
student development workshops and counseling; and (4) enhanced recruitment
strategies, newsletters, and community outreach. By addressing the
underrepresentation of minorities and women at the graduate level in STEM
fields, Oklahoma expects to increase recruitment and retention of these students
into faculty, business, and other STEM career areas.
