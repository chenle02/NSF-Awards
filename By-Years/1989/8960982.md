In this program, the feasibility and analysis of a novel Fabry- Perot resonator
which consists of a multiplexed volume hologram in the resonant cavity will be
investigated for applications in optical communications and optical signal
processing. The proposed Fabry-Perot resonator has two unique structures. First,
the mirrors of the Fabry-Perot resonators are holographically fabricated in a
coherently- coupled manner. Thus, the stringent alignment problems between the
two mirrors are eliminated. Long cavity lengths (> 1 cm) and large aperture size
(> 5 x 5 square inch) are also made possible by this coherently-coupled effect.
Second a multiplexed volume hologram (containing many superimposed phase
gratings) is placed in the cavity. Therefore, many multiplexed operations can be
performed at the same time (i.e. high parallelism). For example, a multiple-
channel narrow band wavelength division multiplexer is realizable in a single
Fabry-Perot resonator. In addition, the storage capacity of the volume hologram
in the resonator is dramatically increased due to the resonance effect. The
Bragg selectivity of the volume hologram in the resonator is also enhanced. The
proposed concept can be further extended to a number of potential devices, such
as reconfigurable optical interconnects, programmable optical limiters, and
multiple-channel optical logic elements.
