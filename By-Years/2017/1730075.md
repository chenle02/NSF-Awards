This proposal seeks funding for partial support (including participant travel
and subsistence) of the UN/US workshop on the International Space Weather
Initiative (ISWI). The ISWI program fosters international cooperation on space
weather research, education and applications. The workshop informs an
international community of scientists and students of the latest advances in
space weather research, and provides a forum data sharing and forging new
collaborations and educational initiatives. The outcome of the workshop will be
disseminated to the UN General Assembly as part of a report by the Committee on
the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space. This proposal will provide an opportunity to
foster international scientific collaboration and outreach on space weather
research and education.
