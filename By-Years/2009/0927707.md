The objective of this research is to (1) use a machine to enhance a manual
welding process that is currently operated and controlled by a human welder and
(2) establish the foundation for the resultant machine-human cooperative control
of the welding process with a welder in loop. The approach is to (1) take
advantage of human welder?s natural movement to facilitate automatic process
monitoring for the weld pool surface; (2) model how a human welder responds to
the welding process; (3) model how the welding process responds to human welder
actions; and (4) formulate a machine-human cooperative control scheme in which a
machine algorithm determines, based on model prediction of human and process
responses, adjustments to the human welder controlled process.

Welding is a critical capability that the United States must maintain through
either automation or stabilization of qualified labor force. The proposed
cooperative control provides an effective and innovative way to help stabilize,
improve, and enhance this labor force. It will also establish the foundation for
a next generation welding machine and potentially inspirit inventions in other
manufacturing/industrial sectors. The multi-disciplinary nature of the proposed
research and collaboration with industry will provide opportunities to train
next generation academic and manufacturing experts/researchers in a wide range
of areas.
