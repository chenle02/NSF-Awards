The probabilistic method is a powerful technique for using probability theory to
prove seemingly non-probabilistic facts in combinatorics. Together with the
probabilistic method, a second line of study that has grown rapidly is the study
of random structures, most famously random graphs. These two lines of research
are collectively known as probabilistic combinatorics. This project aims to
develop new ideas and techniques in probabilistic combinatorics by studying
concrete questions in the field. In addition to fundamental advances in
probability and combinatorics, previous work on probabilistic combinatorics has
led to development of tools that have had enormous impacts in computer science,
where they are used to design and study randomized algorithms and to understand
performance on random inputs and in noisy environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
investigator plans to focus on several topics. One topic concerns Ramsey graphs,
which are an important class of graphs that are “approximately extremal” for
Ramsey’s theorem. The investigator plans to build on some previous work
regarding edge statistics in Ramsey graphs, which also naturally leads to the
study of the so-called quadratic Littlewood-Offord problem. Another topic is the
subject of extremal theorems “relative to a random set.” For example, given a
typical outcome of a random hypergraph, what conditions on a spanning subgraph
ensure that it has a perfect matching? To approach questions of this type, the
investigator plans to apply some new insights for applying the so-called
absorption method non-constructively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
