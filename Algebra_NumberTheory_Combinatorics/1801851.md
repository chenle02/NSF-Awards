Algebraic Geometry is one of the oldest and most active areas of mathematics. It
plays an important role in many neighboring fields such as Commutative Algebra,
Number Theory, Differential Geometry, and String Theory to name a few. Algebraic
Geometry studies the solution sets of polynomial equations. These solution sets
define geometric objects and it is important to classify them and understand
their qualitative behavior. Birational Geometry aims to classify these geometric
objects (up to birational isomorphism). This is one of the principal areas of
Algebraic Geometry which in recent years has been at the center of spectacular
progress. Many important central questions remain. The PI hopes to capitalize on
these recent successes to make progress towards the remaining key open problems
and conjectures.

The principal investigator will conduct research in Algebraic Geometry and
especially in Higher Dimensional Birational Algebraic Geometry over
algebraically closed fields of characteristic 0 and characteristic p > 0. In
particular this project is focused on questions related to the minimal model
program for threefolds over an algebraically closed field of characteristic p =
2,3,5 including related questions on the inversion of adjunction, and to the
minimal model program and the singularities of threefolds over an algebraically
closed field of characteristic p > 0. The PI also plans to investigate generic
vanishing theorems and the birational geometry of varieties defined over an
algebraically closed field of characteristic p > 0 as well as questions related
to the birational geometry of generalized log canonical pairs and to the
termination of log-flips in dimension greater or equal than 4 (in characteristic
0).
