Despite the facts that automated image analysis has been and continues to be a
very active research area and this PI and others have demonstrated that
incorporation of knowledge into the process can significantly improve its
robustness and accuracy, there is only very limited knowledge applicable to the
general problem of designing knowledge-based image analysis systems. This
research begins with the hypotheses that (1) A general image analysis system can
be developed for families of similar image analysis applications; (2) Knowledge
can be automatically or semi-automatically derived from application-specific
training sets of manually analyzed example images; (3) General knowledge-based
image analysis systems trained on such training sets can offer performance
comparable to single-purpose knowledge-based systems specifically designed for
the particular task. Since the general problem is quite broad, the specific aims
are to (1) Develop a unifying approach to example-based acquisition and
representation of knowledge about image edges derived from example images in a
variety of border detection applications; (2) Develop a general approach to
automated border detection learning utilizing knowledge acquired from examples
in this fashion; (3) Assess the applicability of the developed approaches by
testing their robustness and accuracy in large data sets of complex images from
actual applications. This research, which will be carried out in the context of
medical image analysis, such as angiographic images, intravascular and
intracardiac ultrasound images, and multidimensional high resolution CT images,
will open new routes to automated and practically applicable machine learning
strategies in image analysis and image understanding applications.
