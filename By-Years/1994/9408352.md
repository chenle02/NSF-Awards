9408352 Muller Support is requested to assist academic personnel (particularly
younger researchers) who are engaged in sensor and actuator research by
providing either wholly or partially for travel and subsistence at the 1994
Sensor and Actuator Workshop which is to be held at Hilton Head, South Carolina
for June 13-16, 1994. The cost of attending this important Workshop is often not
included in the budgets of some, particularly younger, researchers. These are
precisely the persons whose presence is likely to produce long-range impact for
the engineering and scientific communities in the United States. ***
