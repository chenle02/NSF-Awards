This project will establish a consortium to promote incorporation of molecular
modeling into the undergraduate chemistry curriculum. The consortium will be
initiated by summer workshops in molecular modeling for college chemistry
faculty. The workshops will make use of computer hardware and software purchased
In 1995 with the help of funding from the National Science Foundation. College
faculty will sign up for a week of study in the theory and application of
molecular modeling as it applies to the entire chemistry curriculum. The
workshops will emphasize links between laboratory experimentation and modeling
on the computer as well as the use of modeling in various lecture courses. After
the workshops, participants will communicate through the Molecular Modeling
Consortium. The follow-up and dissemination of participant's results will be
conducted electronically by use of the Molecular Modeling Home Page
(www.molecules.edu) which is already in place. The project will be directed by
individuals having 10 years experience in molecular modeling and 20 years of
experience using computers in chemical education. Dissemination of modeling
experiments already developed is underway and will continue as other new
experiments are refined.
