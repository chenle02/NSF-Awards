Consumer Reports Television will produce a series of four half- hour TV
specials and companion outreach materials, called "YOU TEST IT|," for public
television broadcast and broad educational and home video distribution. Targeted
for children ages 7 to 13 -- particularly those from low-income, minority
families -- the project will draw on the resources of Consumers Union, the non-
profit, scientific, research and education organization that publishes Consumer
Reports magazine and ZILLIONS, the Consumer Reports for Kids. The "YOU TEST IT|
series, created by an experienced team of children's TV producers, focuses on
testing and evaluating popular products -- from observing the bubble-power of
bubble gum to measuring the efficiency of 10-speed bicycles. Using lively,
state-of-the-art techniques appealing to kids, "YOU TEST IT|" will encourage
children to use science and math skills to investigate and, ultimately, solve
real-world problems. Each of the 4 programs will cover a broad product theme
such as Foods/Snacks, Toys/Games, Sports/Recreation, and Electronic Gear.
Activity Guides, expanding on these topics, will delve more deeply into the
science content of each show, providing hands-on learning materials for
children. With repeated broadcasts of "YOU TEST IT|" over hundreds of PBS
stations, and reuse of tape and print materials, millions of children will gain
greater access to objective product information and greater awareness of science
and its importance in everyday life.
