This is an award to support for Phase II of a project initiated under NSF Grant
No. 88-60957 under conditions outlined in the Program Solicitation for Small
Business Innovation Research, NSF 88-8. The work under Phase I resulted in
demonstration of the feasibility of using electrochemically generated superoxide
for rapid and complete degradation of chlorinated organic pollutants of water
using specially designed electrodes that allowed for the efficient
dechlorination of the pollutant substrates. In Phase II, the investigators plan
a systematic examination of the reaction products and their rate of formation
and destruction as the basis for determining the efficiency of the process and
its economic feasibility. The contamination of ground and surface waters by
organic compounds that are the target of this research is a matter of great
National concern. It is imperative that technologies be developed that are more
efficiently responsive to removal of organic pollutants from water and
wastewater. Results of this project are expected to be useful in this respect.
