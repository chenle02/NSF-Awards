A major phenomena of Cenozoic tectonics in the southwestern United States
involves detachment faults and associated Continental extension. Recently, a
major early Miocene extensional belt has been recognized and described in the
Mojave Desert. This project will continue systematic analysis of this
extensional terrane by a combination of detailed field mapping, structural
analysis, stratigraphic and petrologic analysis, P-T path analysis,
paleomagnetic studies, geochronologic -- thermo- chronologic studies and thermal
modeling. This work will be integrated and focussed on the extension in the
Mojave Rift and its effects on the paleogeographic evolution of the region.
