The nation's water distribution systems are in a state of deterioration as a
result of aging, and therefore, are constantly in need of repair. The lack of an
adequate water distribution system either existing or new can hamper industrial
growth in a region. This project will develop methods for the evaluation of the
water supply system for rehabilitation of existing as well as the design for new
installations. This investigator will consider minimum costs, reliability, and
availability aspects for new and aging systems. The objective is to modernize
the process of designing, analyzing, and operating water distribution systems.
