This REU Site award provides funding for 10 students to participate in a 10-week
REU Site. The focus of the site is archaeobiology at Sylvester Manor, Shelter
Island, New York. The 250 acre site contains extensive and well-preserved
archaeological remains of a Late Woodland (pre-contact) Native American
settlement, and a 1652-1735 agricultural plantation established to ship
provisions to the Caribbean. The primary goals of the research are to understand
the patterns of cultural interaction and cultural change among the diverse
groups on the plantation, and to reconstruct land use and landscape change
through time. This research has promise to add an important new perspective to
our understanding of colonization and cultural transformation in Colonial
America.

The first week of this REU Site is spent in laboratory training, the next four
weeks are spent on archaeological excavation and sample collection at Sylvester
Manor, and the last five weeks are laboratory work and research write-up. At the
end of the 10 weeks, the students will engage in public presentation of their
research results.

This award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract
talented students into careers in science through active undergraduate research
experiences.
