Larrabee This research is based on an automatic test pattern generation (ATPG)
system (called Nemesis) that generates a test pattern for a given fault by first
constructing a formula representing all possible tests for the fault, and then
applying a Boolean satisfiability algorithm to the resulting formula. This
method separates the formula extraction from the formula satisfaction thus
providing flexibility and generality. A testing system, based on Nemesis, that
will generate tests detecting all realistic manufacturing defects in both
combinational and sequential ICs is being developed.
