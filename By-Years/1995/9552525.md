9552525 Grunewald The National Easter Seal Society is engaged in a project to
introduce young people with disabilities and their families to science, to
provide them with access to science, and to familiarize them with the wide range
of career options which depend on science and technology. Easter Seal affiliates
serve as project sites, and a sub-contract with the American Association for the
Advancement of Science led to development of a family-centered activity-based
science program. The three major project components are: Family Science events,
including hands-on activities, visits by "role models," take home activities,
and field trips; an Activity Manual containing twelve themes to be used as the
basis of Family Science workshops; Staff Training for Easter Seal staff. Target
audiences are elementary and middle school age youth with disabilities and their
families.
