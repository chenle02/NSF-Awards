The 2014 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM) will be held in
Toronto, Canada, April 27-May 2, 2014. This preeminent technical conference is
the primary venue for presenting new research results in the area of computer
communications, and is widely attended by researchers and practitioners in the
field. Attending conferences such as INFOCOM is very important for the career
development of graduate students. Participants have the opportunity to present
their work, attend panel and keynote sessions, and interact with hundreds of
others performing leading-edge research in the field. This proposal requests
funding to support approximately 20 graduate students in the United States to
attend this premier conference. Graduate students, in particular women and
underrepresented minority students, will be supported, since attending
conferences is an important part of their educational experience and they often
have limited travel funds.
