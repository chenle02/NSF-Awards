This dissertation project focuses on the interface between technology and the
human environment in the context of injuries wrought by technology. It explores
the critical balance between technology and the human environment in the
contested zone of the design and regulation of technical artifacts in products
liability law. The project will analyze the ways in which products liability law
adjudicates the concerns of businesses, designers, consumers, and policy makers
- all of which are crucial in constituting and governing the relationships
between technology and human bodies in contemporary United States. The project
hypothesizes that products liability law is a unique site at which to examine
the ways in which body/technology relationships are constructed and regulated.
The propositions are addressed through a close examination of two major alleged
product injuries that are currently undergoing massive litigation, namely
silicone breast implant injuries, and computer instigated repetitive strain
injuries. The project will also contribute to and interconnect the literature
and methods of culture studies, disability studies, women studies, and design
history.
