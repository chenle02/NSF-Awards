A novel high-frequency HF radar diagnostic system, originally developed and
proven using non-NSF support, is prepared for use by the basic research Aeronomy
community. It is expected that HF diagnostics featuring superior spatial and
temporal resolutions, polarization discrimination, waveform selectivity,
frequency agility and interplexing will remove many of the ambiguities
associated with the interpretation of ionospheric sounders. In so doing, large
amounts of aged and unused basic ionosonde data become available for
reinterpretation. The research plan applies the new diagnostics to the extant
ionosonde at the Arecibo Observatory, distributing four receivers at the site,
and retaining the current transmitter. A long list of derived ionospheric
parameters, including electron density altitude profiles, electron temperature
altitude profiles, maps of irregularity motion, are compared to those parameters
derived by the Arecibo incoherent scatter radar (ISR). The research product of
low-cost, high spatial coverage, highly accurate and verifiable ionosonde data
collection prepares for the global deployment of instrument arrays called for in
the Decadal Survey.
