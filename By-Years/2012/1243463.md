Solid-State Sensors and Actuators Workshop (Hilton Head
2012)&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will disseminate MEMS
research and technology breakthroughs. The workshop consists&lt;br/&gt;of 26
contributed oral papers, and 89 contributed posters. There will also be an open
poster&lt;br/&gt;session where recent work (and educational programs) can be
discussed.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will have broad
impact for the entire MEMS community. The knowledge gained
and&lt;br/&gt;experiences shared from the workshop will be captured
electronically and broadly disseminated&lt;br/&gt;via a website. By receiving
travel support, students will get the opportunity to present
their&lt;br/&gt;newest research results among their peers. The discussions which
result from such presentations&lt;br/&gt;are invaluable as an educational aid.
Benefiting from the recommendations and improved teaching&lt;br/&gt;and
training, students will be better prepared for both MEMS research and MEMS-
focused careers
