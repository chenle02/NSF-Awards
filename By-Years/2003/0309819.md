Many tropical plants have specialized structures in which ants establish
colonies, in return for which ants protect the plant from herbivores or
competition. Short term effects of forest fragmentation include the elimination
of ants from impacted landscapes, followed by defoliation of host-plants. This
research would investigate various mechanisms by which forest fragmentation
affect ant-plant mutualisms. Fieldwork would be conducted in The Biological
Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (Brazil), the only large-scale ,
experimental landscape designed to study the effects of framentation in a
tropical rainforest. Besides helping to advance the career of a minority
scientist, the research would contribute to our understanding of how landscape
alterations change inter-specific dynamics, a better understanding of which
would improve our ability to design refuges that conserve and protect species of
concern.
