This award will provide continuing support to the University of Minnesota for
the summer program of undergraduate research experiences in the behavioral
sciences established in 1987. The ten-week program will emphasize student
participation in the research activities of faculty affiliated with the Center
for Research in Learning, Perception, and Cognition in the College of Liberal
Arts. Eight undergraduates will participate, half from private liberal arts
colleges in the state of Minnesota and half from the University; they will be
expected to have completed their sophomore or junior years. Students will: (1)
assist with a faculty member's research including opportunities to work as a
member of a research team, (2) complete an independent research project, the
final products of which will be a written report and a presentation to peers and
participating faculty, and (3) participate in a multidisciplinary seminar.
Seminar activities include presentations by program faculty and faculty in
related areas campus wide, laboratory tours, and lectures on research tools and
design. The program will therefore include opportunities for the students to
learn specific research methods, to apply these methods in the context of their
own research, and to examine broad conceptual and methodological issues relating
to psychology and the cognitive sciences. Participation in social/cultural
events as well as common housing in a University dorm will help foster a strong
community of students.
