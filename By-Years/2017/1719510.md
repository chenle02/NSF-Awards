The Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Undergraduate Program
provides support for projects to design, implement, and assess strategies that
can lead to comprehensive institutional efforts to increase the number of
students receiving undergraduate degrees in science, technology, engineering and
mathematics (STEM) and enhance the quality of their preparation by strengthening
STEM education and research. The project at Morgan State University seeks to
address the roadblocks encountered by students during the freshmen year
experience in STEM disciplines with targeted interventions. The overall goal is
to significantly increase the retention rate of underrepresented minority
students at the University choosing career paths in STEM majors, graduate
programs, and workforce.

Activities that are part of this project are: a six-week pre-college transition
program to enhance retention and persistence of a number of incoming freshmen in
the School of Computer, Mathematical and Natural Sciences; development of an
interdisciplinary lab-based research course and core student research
laboratory; and integration of critical thinking activities and assessment into
freshmen STEM curricula. The activities and strategies are evidence-based and
what is learned through this project can serve as a model for other
institutions.
