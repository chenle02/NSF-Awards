9530837 Gardner The principal investigator will employ optical instruments from
shipboard to determine the types and size distribution of particles and particle
aggregates in the oceanic water column during the U.S. JGOFS Southern Process
Study. By making these measurement, the investigator and his colleagues expect
to be able to calculate rates of particle aggregation and disaggregation and to
clarify the role played by aggregation in determining the vertical flux of
particulate materials, especially carbon, during and between periods of algal
blooms.
