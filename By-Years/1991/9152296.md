A 200 MHz proton/carbon-l3 Fourier transform nuclear magnetic resonance
spectrometer will be incorporated in the chemistry curriculum from the first
through fourth year levels. Students will use the equipment to determine the
barriers of rotation around a chemical bond, to calculate the thermodynamic and
kinetic functions for various chemical reactions, and to analyze the magnetic
susceptibility of paramagnetic compounds. Students will determine structures of
complex molecules using multi-pulse sequence and two-dimensional techniques. The
instrument will greatly improve the quality of our courses and our undergraduate
research program. The grantee will match the NSf award from non-Federal sources.
