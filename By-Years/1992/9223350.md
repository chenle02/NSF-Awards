9223350 Karp Molecular biology databases will be of greater utility to
biomedical researchers when interconnected than in their current isolated state.
The primary impact of the meeting will be to stimulate interdisciplinary
research projects between computer scientists who work in the area of
integrating heterogeneous databases, and bioinformatics researchers who develop
and use molecular biology databases. Computer scientists at the workshop are
learning about the properties of existing databases and the requirements that
bioinformatics researchers will have for interconnection. Bioinformatics
researchers at the workshop are being exposed to strategies and technologies for
interconnection that have been developed by computer science researchers. A
second focus of the workshop is to conduct an experiment toward the development
of a global, multi-database schema for several existing molecular biology
databases. A global schema is a first step toward interconnecting these
databases, and is a valuable exercise for learning about and evaluating existing
tools for the management of database schemas. A final report will summarize the
results of the workshop presentations and multidatabase schema experiment, and
will be distributed to members of the database and bioinformatics communities.
