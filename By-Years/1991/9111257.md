Computer simulation of electronic and optical devices is facilitating the rapid
advancement of knowledge in science and engineering. The ability to model
devices beforehand permits better use of limited resources and increase the
assurance that devices which are fabricated will operate as desired. However,
not all important devices are easily simulated on existing device modelling
programs. Computer simulation programs for high speed InP/InGaAs p-i-n
photodetectors are meager in spite of the importance of these devices to optical
fiber communications and to other scientific applications. A simulation program
for high speed InP/InGaAs p-i-n photodetectors will be created using finite
element methods. The program will be designed to model the DC characteristics,
initially, of these devices in any of the three spatial dimensions and lay the
groundwork for an extension of the model to AC operation. The model will also
permit the use of nontraditional materials in photodetector design. The
importance of the work will be enhancement of the ability to perform fast yet
innovative research on these devices.
