AST-0420868 -- Reichart/UNC&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paramount-based Robotic Optical
Monitoring and Polarimetry Telescope (PROMPT) is an instrument acquisition
program that will enable the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to
probe the physics, environments, and diversity of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and
use GRBs to probe the early universe in new and powerful ways. At the same time,
PROMPT will be a shared resource between UNC-Chapel Hill and every undergraduate
institution in the state of North Carolina with an astronomer or with an
interest in astronomy, including historically African-American and Native-
American institutions. PROMPT will consist of four half-meter diameter
telescopes on rapidly slewing mounts that will automatically image GRB
afterglows within seconds of satellite notification. Since GRBs will require no
more than approximately 50% of PROMPT's time, robotic access to the telescopes
will be shared with all interested undergraduate institutions in the state of
North Carolina.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
