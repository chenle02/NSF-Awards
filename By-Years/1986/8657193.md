This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfields of electrochemistry and separation science. Three areas of
technological and fundamental importance are addressed by this research. In the
first area, extremely small microvoltammetric probes will be disigned and
characterized and their use for the dynamic in vivo quantification of
intracellular neurotransmitters will be evaluated. In a second area, capillary
zone electrophoretic and microcolumn open-tubular liquid chromatographic
protocols will be developed for the analysis of ultra-small-volume samples.
Coupled with newly developed electrochemical detectors, these methods should
permit the detection of sub-femtomolar concentrations of redox-active analytes
and provide a static quantitative method for neurotransmitter analysis to
complement the dynamic approach already described. Thirdly, the unique
electrochemical behavior of metallocene-derivatized phosphazenes and phosphazene
polymers will be investigated and their potential utility as charge storage
media evaluated. This five year continuing grant to The Pennsylvania State
University for the support of Professor Ewing as a Presidential Young
Investigator is designed to enable his rapid and effective initiation of this
broad and innovative research program in chemistry.
