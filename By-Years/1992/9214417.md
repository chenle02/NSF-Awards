Jordan Hall, the building currently housing the Department of Biology at
Indiana University, is in need of renovation in order to support modern
biological research. Jordan Hall consists of an original structure built in 1954
and a new addition completed in 1984. While the new portion of the building
currently provides researchers with excellent research facilities, many parts of
the original structure have never been renovated and are in need of upgrading.
The Department of Biology is vigorously committed to pursuing research and to
training graduate students and post-doctoral associates. External funding in
excess of $8 million/year in direct costs funds a wide array of research
projects and supports the majority of graduate students, postdoctorals, and even
many undergraduates. The department's established commitment to research,
research training, and to attracting minorities and women can be clearly
documented. It is imperative to complement this commitment to research with
attention to the physical support systems available to the researchers in the
department.
