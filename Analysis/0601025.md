Fefferman showed how to decide whether a given real-valued function on a compact
subset of R^n extends to a C^m function on all of R^n. This answers a classical
problem of Whitney. Together with Bo'az Klartag, Fefferman gave an effective
version of this work, thus providing an asymptotically efficient algorithm to
compute a C^m function with controlled C^m norm, approximating a given function
on a large finite set. Stein's research involves the relation and interplay
between algebras of pseudo-differential and singular integral operators arising
in the context of several complex variables and for sub-elliptic differential
operators. He also deals with the problem of extending to the discrete setting
the theory of singular Radon transforms.

Together with B. Klartag, Fefferman found an algorithm to compute a smooth
surface passing through (or near to) many given points in space, whenever such a
surface exists. Fefferman's work is related to practical problems of
computational geometry, arising in computer-aided manufacturing. Stein's
research advances Fourier analysis, which is a fundamental tool in many branches
of science and technology. It is used e.g. to study waves of all kinds, digital
and analog signals and medical imaging.
