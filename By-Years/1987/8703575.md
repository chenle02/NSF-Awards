Abstract Narrative The doctoral student conducting this research will make
detailed morphometric and seismographic measurements of drumlins (elongated
hills produced by glaciers) in the New York drumlin field located between
Rochester and Syracuse. The study is designed to provide additional information
on the origin of the New York drumlin field, and thereby on glacial mechanics,
by testing alternative hypotheses of drumlin field formation. This project is
innovative in that the investigators will focus their analysis on processes
thought to occur within advancing ice sheets, on surface conditions under ice
sheets, and on combinations of glacial mechanics and surface conditions.
