The objective of this research is to employ graphene transparent electrical
contacts atop mid-infrared semiconductor lasers to determine the fundamental
physical mechanisms that critically limit high-temperature operation. The
approach is to use antimonide-based semiconductor lasers as the platform to test
optical transparency, electrical conductivity, and the heat dissipation efficacy
of single and few-layer graphene. Both multi-domain and single-crystal graphene
monolayers will be compared as well as bilayers and trilayers with non-Bernal
and Bernal AB stacking.&lt;br/&gt;The capability graphene will provide to
simultaneously optically pump and electrically bias laser devices will enable
precise measurements of carrier concentrations above threshold in order to
elevate the characteristic temperature of these promising 3?5 Âµm devices above
100 K. In addition to the high optical transmission and excellent electrical
properties of graphene that could lead to lower thresholds, higher output
powers, and higher operating temperatures in mid-infrared emitters, graphene has
demonstrated excellent potential for heat dissipation, which will be studied and
related to its potential as a single-atom-thick heat dissipater in electronic
devices in general.&lt;br/&gt;Thin, transparent contacts with high mobility and
excellent heat dissipation may have extensive applications in optoelectronic
devices, including light emitting diodes, lasers, transistors, and other devices
that require good thermal management while minimizing the size of the heat
dissipating layer. Important applications of mid-infrared devices include
environmental monitoring, countermeasures, and free space communications.
&lt;br/&gt;The PIs will continue to involve women, high school students, and
undergraduates in the research and to reach out to K-12 students and teachers.
