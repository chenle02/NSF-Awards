Since 1988 the SMALL Undergraduate Research Project, with support from the NSF
REU program, from Williams College, and from other sources, has involved over
350 students in research advised by 20 faculty, resulting in over 70
publications. The proposed conference, to take place at Williams on June 8, will
further the research and its promulgation through talks, discussions,
networking, and planning for future work. In addition to a few invited speakers
and faculty, all participants are welcome to present short talks. The conference
will also afford an opportunity to take stock of the fruits of the program and
make better plans for the future. There will be a session in which participants
describe their accomplishments, help us evaluate the program, and suggest
improvements in our program and activities. A survey on the value of their SMALL
experience, the value of the conference, and their suggestions for SMALL and
related activities, will be distributed and
collected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
