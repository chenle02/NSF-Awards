Theoretical research in elementary particle physics will focus on
determinations of the "structure functions" of a nucleon, and on the study of
weak interaction processes predicted by the "standard model" of elementary
particle physics and by other models. Knowledge of the "structure functions" is
crucial to the prediction of even rates for various physical processes which
will be studied at high-energy facilities of the future. Thus, this knowledge is
centrally important to our future experimental program.
