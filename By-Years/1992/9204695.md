This award is made by the Office of Special Projects in the Chemistry Division
under the Materials Synthesis and Processing Initiative. This research will
optimize the photochemical generation of phenoxy free radicals with regard to
the type of substitution and the irradiation wavelength employed and apply the
methodology to study electron exchange-controlled magnetic interactions in both
molecular and polymeric systems. Solid state stable phenoxy polyradical systems
will also be prepared and magnetic interactions in the solid state will be
determined using spectroscopic and magnetic susceptibility techniques. %%% These
fundamental structural and mechanistic investigations are directed towards
developing rules to describe magnetic interactions both within and between
molecules which may permit the design of a new generation of bulk organic
ferromagnets.
