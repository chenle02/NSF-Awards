In recent years the stochastic point of view has achieved great prominence,
both as an active area of probability theory and as a powerful tool in problems
of analysis, geometry, and mathematical physics. For example, the classical Ito
theory of stochastic differential equations, which defines a finite- dimensional
diffusion process, already leads to many interesting connections with analysis
in Euclidean space and finite-dimensional differentiable manifolds. The same
stochastic differential equations can also be used to define a stochastic flow,
which is a diffusion process on the group of diffeomorphisms, an infinite-
dimensional space. This naturally leads to the study of other infinite-
dimensional processes, especially those defined by stochastic partial
differential equations. This project will support the 1993 AMS Summer Research
Institute on Stochastic Analysis to be held July 11-30, 1993 at Cornell
University in Ithaca, NY. This Institute is the 41st in a series designed with
the purpose of bringing together a group of mathematicians interested in a
particular field of mathematical research. Emphasis is placed on instruction at
a very high level with seminars and lectures by distinguished mathematicians in
related fields, in order to promote interaction between participants while
broadening their mathematical perspectives. The goal of the Institute will be to
highlight the main directions of the field through principal lectures by leaders
in the following general areas: stochastic (ordinary) differential equations,
applications to analysis, applications to geometry, stochastic flows, infinite
dimensional problems, and stochastic partial differential equations.
