9725899 Brown This is a continuation of the PI's work on the following: (1)
photoemission and x-ray standing wave studies of the interaction of water with
the (-Al2O3 (0001) and (1-102) surfaces, the (-SiO2 (0001) surface TiO2 (110)
surface, and the PbS (001) surface and (2) x-ray adsorption fine structure
(XAFS) spectroscopy study of the local coordination environment of Ni and Mo in
silicate glasses and melts as a function of temperature and composition. In
addition, the PI will initiate a new study of the structure of the electrical
double layer in aqueous solution adjacent to a metal oxide surface (a-Al2O3)
using long-period x-ray standing waves. The PI will also initiate a crystal
truncation rod study of the surfaces of (-Al2O3 (0001) and (1-102) at the
Advanced Photon Source on the GSECARS sector.
