The objectives of this project are the refinement of cognitive models of design
and the development of a superquadrics and NURBS based solid/surface modeling
engine that would serve as the basis for the Manufacturing Engineering
Conceptual Design Environment (MECDE). The research will provide the
capabilities to support (1) designing products rapidly and conceptually, (2)
assessing producibility, assemblibility, and other life-cycle characteristics,
and (3) providing necessary information for supporting manufacturing activities
such as process planning, tool path/NC code generation, and assembly task
planning.
