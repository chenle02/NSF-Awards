This research is concerned with the representation theory of artin algebras.
The principal investigator will study homological and computational questions
related to the representation theory of finite dimensional algebras. He will
continue to investigate the finitistic dimension conjecture both theoretically
and with the aid of computer-generated examples. This project is concerned with
the general area of ring theory. A ring is an algebraic structure having both an
addition and a multiplication. These objects arise naturally and are important
in many areas of mathematics and physics.
