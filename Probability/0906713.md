The proposed project considers problems with respect to various scaling limits
of a tagged, or distinguished particle, the space-time evolution of the mass
density of particles, or hydrodynamics, and their underlying connections in
certain systems of interacting random walks such as simple exclusion and zero-
range processes. The proposal will concentrate on relevant but less studied
situations when these systems are out of equilibrium, when particles
interactions are not finite-range, and when the systems are disordered. Specific
questions focused upon include (1) large deviations of a tagged particle in
symmetric simple exclusion processes, (2) hydrodynamics, and stable process
limits of a tagged particle in long range exclusion models, (3) hydrodynamics
and tagged particle limits in zero-range systems with random rates, and (4)
diffusive limits of a tagged particle in bounded rate zero- range processes.

Understanding the motion of a tagged interacting with others in large scale
systems is important in many applied contexts such as traffic, queues, fluids,
and granular and molecular flows, and is also a long standing concern in
statistical physics with regard to formulating the physical basis of Brownian
motion. One of the main difficulties in the analysis is that the bulk
contribution from the other particles is not easily incorporated into the
asymptotics of the tagged particle. In this context, a main thrust of the
proposal is to develop mathematical techniques to handle complex microscopic
particle interactions so that different types of macroscopic tagged particle
behaviors may be captured.
