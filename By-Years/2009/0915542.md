This project develops a framework for deploying multi-robot teams on man-made
structures for continual inspection, structural health monitoring, and minor
repair tasks.

Within this framework, sensory information obtained by a coordinated group of
mobile robots is pooled, resulting in a diagnosis of the state of the structure
on which the robots roam. In addition, methodologies for endowing the robots
with the ability to self-diagnose are being explored. These topics involve the
integration of advanced probabilistic, geometric, and mechanics-based
computations.

The results of this research are expected to enhance the robustness, lifetime,
and range of applicability of robotic systems. Research results will be
leveraged by collaborating with external research labs.

The robots and structures in the testbed being developed in this project, which
are scaled down models of real-world systems, are ideal for student projects.
Participation by undergraduates and local high-school students on research
projects in the PI's lab will serve as a model for increasing interest in
engineering research among these groups.
