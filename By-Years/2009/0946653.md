With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities:
Departmental Multi-User Instrumentation program (CRIF:MU), Professor Robert K.
Boeckman Jr. and Joseph P. Dinnocenzo of the University of Rochester will
acquire a high sensitivity, ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with a modern
liquid chromatograph (LC-MS), as well as electrospray (ES) and atmospheric
pressure chemical ionization (APCI) ion sources. It will be employed in a
variety of research projects including the study of: a) the chemistry of group
14 cation radical intermediates; b) the design and development of novel chemo-
enzymatic and chemo-biosynthetic methods; c) the chemistry and properties of
complexes of the heavier platinum and coinage group elements; d) the discovery
of new reactions for the synthesis of natural products; e) the properties of
unsaturated, reactive complexes of iron that are catalytically active; and, f)
the activation of C-H, C-S, C-CN, and C-F bonds using isotopically labeled
transition metal complexes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mass spectrometry (MS) is used
to identify the chemical composition of a sample and determine its purity by
measuring the mass of the molecular constituents in the sample after they are
ionized and detected by the mass spectrometer. Chromatography is an isolation
technique that precedes the mass spectrometry analysis. It separates a mixture
into its several constituent chemicals which are then analyzed by the mass
spectrometer. These are widely used analytical techniques to identify and
quantify the chemical composition of a sample. The acquisition will benefit
undergraduate and graduate students through research programs in the Department
and through utilization of the mass spectrometer in the undergraduate chemistry
laboratories. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
