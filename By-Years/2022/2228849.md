This award supports the organization of the 8th Physics At eXtreme (PAX)
workshop, entirely focusing on the opportunities and challenges of next-
generation gravitational-wave science. PAX is a discussion-driven workshop and
includes experts from the wide range of fields that will benefit from next-
generation detectors: astronomers, astrophysicists, general relativity
theorists, cosmologists, nuclear physicists, numerical relativists and data
analysts. PAX provides the optimal venue to identify actionable items and
initiate collaborations to tackle the work needed to maximize the scientific
output of the next-generation detectors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Next-generation
detectors would be built in the second half of the 2030s, when the current
generation of students will be leading the field. A major goal of PAX is to
directly and actively involve early career scientists in shaping the future of
the field. The 8th PAX workshop will include an early career scientist lunch
where young and experienced researches can discuss how to make academia more
accessible and equitable. A whole session of the workshop will be dedicated to
issues related to equity, diversity and inclusion, which are key to ensure the
continued success of the gravitational-wave field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
