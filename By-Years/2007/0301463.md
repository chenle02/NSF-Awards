Abstract

This three-year NSF award supports fundamental research in mechanical property
determination of living cells. Researchers from the Colleges of Engineering and
Medicine at the University of Cincinnati (UC) have assembled an
interdisciplinary team to examine indentation of living cells via atomic force
microscopy (AFM) for the purpose of determining cell mechanical properties. This
program directly addresses many of the limitations of current analysis
approaches for cell mechanical property determination through a combination of
detailed AFM experiments and comprehensive analytical and numerical modeling.
The intellectual merit of this work is that it will advance the ability to
extract mechanical properties of living cells from AFM indentation data. This
information will allow pursuit of the long-term research goal of understanding
the link between cell mechanical deformations and cell behavior. Broader impact
is achieved by integrating these improved modeling approaches and the AFM
experiments into a dual-level, interdisciplinary Cellular Mechanics course.
