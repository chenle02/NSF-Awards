9402807 Cleaveland The goals of this project involve the development of
practical approaches to the automatic verification of finite-state concurrent
systems, including hardware designs, communications protocols, and software
requirements specifications. Such systems are notoriously difficult to design,
debug and maintain, owing to the subtle and often unanticipated interactions
between components that parallelism induces. One appealing approach to
overcoming these problems involves the use of mathematical reasoning to ensure
that systems behave as intended; this research aims at making the use of such
formal analysis practical by developing suitable techniques, and associated
software tools, that enable designers to analyze their systems as they are
building them. The proposed work would develop along the following lines:
Research would undertaken into more efficient algorithms for determining the
correctness of concurrent systems; techniques would investigated for enabling
the analysis of larger systems than can currently be managed; he development of
usable graphical and textual design languages would undertaken, and appropriate
tools implemented; methods would develop and implement for reasoning about real-
time systems and about the relative reliability of systems. ***
