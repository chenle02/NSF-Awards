9711431 Parker Meandering channels of large submarine fans have a planiform
expression that is similar to subaerial meanders but cross sectional shape
differs. Levees are more prominent and asymetrical in the submarine channels.
Pis will delineate the connection between channelized sediment-driven flows on
the submarine fans and the evolution of submarine channel meandering. They will
also develop a numerical model for the submarine meanders, where their vast
experience in subaerial meanders, channels and floodplains will be very useful.
The study will lead to a better understanding of these little known
morphological features offshore major river systems.
