9451970 Garcia The acquisition of superspeed refrigerated centrifuges and an
ultracentrifuge upgrades the undergraduate biochemistry laboratory program for
B.S. biochemistry and B.A. chemistry majors. The curriculum has been expanded to
include the isolation of subcellular organelles by differential centrifugation,
the purification of plasmid DNA by CsCl density gradient ultracentrifugation,
and the separation of different classes of serum lipoproteins by single vertical
spin density gradient ultracentrifugation.
