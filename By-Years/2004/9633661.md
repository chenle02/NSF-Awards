The research aims at developing an integrated set of ontological conventions
that addresses the needs of experimental sciences. In the researchersO earlier
work in developing knowledge models for experimental biology, it was discovered
that there were several important areas where the knowledge to be represented
poses fundamental challenges to standard ontological frameworks. For example: 1)
the traditional part-of hierarchy is ill-suited to model the complex substances
and mixtures described in scientific experiments; 2) the primacy of
categorization in knowledge representation, which fundamentally defines entities
in terms of category membership, is at odds with the need to represent events
(such as biochemical reactions) that convert one substance into another. The
proposed research will improve the likelihood that ongoing artificial
intelligence in knowledge sharing technology will be of benefit to researchers
in experimental sciences.
