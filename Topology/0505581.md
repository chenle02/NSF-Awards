In this project we search for an algebraic definition that will serve the
mathematician working in several of those branches touched by quantum field
theory. The idea is to combine ideas from algebra and topology that serve to
describe a manifold with its Poincare' duality. Applying Hochshild constructions
leads to algebraic models of the free loop space of the manifold and the rich
supply of operations from string topology. The BV formalism appears and
solutions of the quantum master equation hopefully appear in several contexts
such as differential, symplectic and holomorphic topology.



The motivation for this project at a more practical level is that several
extremely interesting mathematical discussions are united in the language of
theoretical physics, namely quantum field theory, but there are not precise
mathematical concepts which provide such a synthesis for the working
mathematician. Also once we have such underlying mathematical concepts,
mathematicians will be able to develop their structure in a systematic manner
and go deeper. I do not expect this work to impact the real physical examples of
quantum field theory, but rather the converse-we use quantum field theory to
help mathematicians by merely trying to define some part of it.
