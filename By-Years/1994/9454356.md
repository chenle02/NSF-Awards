ABSTRACT 9454356 Swafford The PUMP Algebra Project The Peoria Urban Mathematics
Plan (PUMP) is a 3.5-year project to reform the teaching of mathematics in
Peoria's middle and high schools, with a special focus on increasing minority
student participation in the algebra track (circa 1/2 of Peoria's student
population is African American). To this end, 48 teachers (grades 5-9) are
selected (in teams of 2-4 from each of Peoria's 12 middle and 4 high schools) to
attend a 3 sequential summer teacher enhancement program that focuses on
reflective pedagogy, and content and technology enhancement. Each summer
consists of a 4-week institute: Summer 1 focuses on rational numbers and
proportional reasoning; Summer 2 looks at algebra, stressing patterns and
functions; Summer 3 looks in depth at how to implement PUMP algebra ideas and
techniques, and integrate them into the curricula that are in place in the
participants' schools. School year follow-up consists of 6 1/2-day seminars, as
well as 4 site visits by PUMP senior staff to each participating teacher's
classes. The program involves building principals, and draws on community
resources, such as, for example, an existing Urban League outreach program for
elementary students. An external evaluation, complementing on-going internal
evaluations, focuses especially on documenting student change. To disseminate
the project, 4 selected mid-sized cities around the country send observers to
the project, and some 70 cities are networked by a project newsletter. Cost
sharing is 64% of the NSF contribution.
