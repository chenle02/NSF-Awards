This action provides international travel support to enable the Principal
Investigator to travel to Taiwan to conduct research activities. The primary
focus of the investigation is the practical implementation of structural control
systems for seismic protection. During the one-week period major universities
and local investigators will be visited. Technical discussions and research
experiences, data and results will be exchanged. Cooperative research plans for
integrated design of building frames and protective control systems and
laboratory and field experiments for verification of the design will be
formulated.
