ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basic properties such as the particle shape and
size distribution have significant influence on the processing of particulate in
various chemical and pharmaceutical applications. For example, the shape and
size distribution of crystals used in pharmaceutical tablet production have a
strong influence on compaction and dissolution properties of the product. This
proposal focuses on understanding and modeling the variation in the size and
shape distribution due to breakage of dry crystals in various applications. The
objectives of the proposal are to investigate the effect of the system operating
conditions on crystal shape distribution due to breakage and to develop a novel
procedure quantitatively measure changes in particle shape and size in a stirred
vessel due to breakage. A stirred tank is used to obtain data for the rate of
breakage in terms of various process parameters. The data is used to establish
new and effective models for multidimensional population balance for the
variation in size and shape distribution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
