9703925 Niblett This U.S.-Mexico award will support a planning visit which will
allow Dr. C. L. Niblett, University of Florida, to go to Irapuato, Mexico to
work with Dr. Alejandro Blanco-Labra, Centro De Investigacion y De Estudios
Avanzados Del IPN, to prepare a collaborative research project on the
development of transgenic plants, which contain plant viral genes effective in
controlling virus diseases. The citrus industries of both Mexico and the U.S.
lose rootstock to the brown citrus aphid, and development of transgenic plants
containing plant viral genes has worked on controlling several virus diseases.
These researchers wish to test this approach in an attempt to develop citrus
genotypes which can resist Tristeza disease, the most destructive virus disease
to citrus. Both principal investigators have expertise in this research, and by
joining their labs and experience, they can rapidly test this novel approach to
control plant viruses. ***
