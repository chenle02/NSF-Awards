The purpose of this proposal is to provide an economic explanation for the
emergence of, and the effects, corporate culture. In the context of this
research, corporate culture is defined as the common language or code of conduct
shared by employees of the firm, which are not shared by those outside the firm.
Several approaches to analyzing corporate culture will be undertaken, which
attempt to translate in economic terms the insights derived from other
disciplines concerned with organizational behavior. One approach will focus on
the cognitive aspects of corporate culture, the knowledge of codes, facts, and
rules shared by the members of the organization. Another approach will emphasize
the incentive aspects of corporate culture, which uses the framework of
overlapping games to model the stability of organizational values while its
members change. Finally, these models are applied to examining the costs and
benefits of mergers, and to try and formalize the notion that ownership
instability can limit the investment of employees in firm-specific knowledge and
job skills. This project is important because it may provide a more fundememtal
understanding of the factors that determine the effectiveness of organizations.
