9505041 Cherry The proposed research lies in the interface of number theory and
several complex variables. The proposer wants to understand the relationship
between Nevanlinna theory and diophantine geometry. In particular, he will study
error terms in Nevanlinna theory and p-adic analogues of holomorphic curves.
Recently, formal analogies between certain areas of complex geometry and number
theory have been observed. This is unexpected in that these two areas are
traditionally unrelated areas of mathematics: number theory deals with integer
equations whereas complex geometry deals with non-discrete objects.
