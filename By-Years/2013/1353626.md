This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to develop a low
cost yet durable ice-release coating to mitigate icing-related problems
encountered by air transportation, power transmission, wind energy and
commercial refrigeration industries. In Phase I the first laboratory test for
ice adhesion using a commercial instrument led to rapid screening of ice release
coating candidates. A new theory for rigid adherent removal in shear from hybrid
elastomers led to a study of ice adhesion, that is, ice as a rigid adherent.
Guided by the new model and practical experience gained from laboratory tests, a
new coating system was identified from which ice could be removed easily and
with low force. Feasibility was demonstrated for being able to produce a
durable, low cost, ice-release coating with commercially available engineering
materials. This was a major success that achieved the main objective of Phase I
R&amp;D. In Phase II, the main technical objectives are to decrease peak removal
force and retain low cost components and easy processing.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project
include generation of low cost, durable ice-release coatings and related
products. These new materials will greatly reduce icing problems and enhance the
safety of operations in the aerospace, energy, and refrigeration industries.
More specifically, coatings developed in this project will be used as an
alternative to the following: environmentally problematic de-icing fluids,
energy inefficient electrical heating, and high cost but poor mechanically
durable deicing coatings.
