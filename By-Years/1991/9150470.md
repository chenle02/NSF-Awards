Engineering Lower Division Laboratory MaterialsFaculty at West Virginia
University, University of Wisconsin - Platteville, and Colorado School of Mines
are addressing the criticism of engineering education that it is weak in design,
and while producing engineers who excel at analysis, lack skills in design,
synthesis and evaluation. Many educators propose changes in curricula and
instructional methods aimed to integrate these skills back into the learning
experience. While many innovations have merit and work well for their
developers, educators elsewhere often experience difficulty incorporating them
into their particular environment. The faculty are developing lower-division
electrical engineering design oriented laboratory materials and plan to evaluate
their effectiveness in three very different curricular environments. A student
booklet of laboratory design exercises and an accompanying instructor's manual
describing in detail how to conduct a design-oriented laboratory is being
developed from the most broadly successful draft materials. The materials
transform the laboratory from the relatively passive intellectual experience of
verifying well established theories to an active intellectual experience
creating functional devices, circuits, and systems. The student materials are
heavily supported by extensive aids for the instructor, and all materials are
designed for and evaluated within disparate curricular structures to make them
broadly useful.
