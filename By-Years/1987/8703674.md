Under the previous award, the investigators have developed the synthesis of
3'-amino-3'-deoxynucleotides and of short oligomers derived from them. Using
these compounds, oligomerization reactions both in the presence and absence of
added oligonucleotide or oligodeoxynucleotide templates have been carried out.
Preliminary results indicate that an oligomer of the
3'-amino-3'-deoxynucleotides can act as a template to direct the synthesis of
further molecules of the template. The first set of experiments proposed will be
directed to the demonstration of autocatalysis in the simplest possible system:
the combination of the dinucleoside phosphoramidate GNHpCNH2 with the azide-
derivative pGNHpCN3 to give the tetramer GNHpCNHpGNHpCN3. The second set of
experiments will study the "open-ended" oligomerization of pGNHpCNH2. The
earliest step in the reaction are expected to be simple, autocatalytic template-
directed reactions. However, elongation by "sliding" may become the predominant
mechanism for longer oligomers. The final set of experiments will study the
copolymerization of pGNHpUNH2 and pANHpCNH2. This reaction can, in principle,
produce families of "information-carrying", replicating oligomers. Consequently,
it may provide an opportunity to study natural selection in a non-enzymatic
system. This would open us a novel area of polynucleotide chemistry.
