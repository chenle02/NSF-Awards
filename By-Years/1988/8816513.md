This is a collaborative project for making magnetotelluric measurements and
three dimensional interpretations in California that will concentrate on
determining the lower crust and upper mantle resistivities. These measurements
and their interpretation will be helpful in trying to understand the conditions
that exist in the lower crust of this region which must play a role in the
ongoing tectonics, and which are presently the subject of a good deal of debate.
These measurements should also be able to detect any unusual thermal conditions
in the upper mantle which could be related to mantle deformation processes. The
ability to determine crustal resistivities from magnetotelluric measurements is
due to the fortunate circumstance that the oceanic conductivity-resistivity
structure allows the oceanic current system to be brought up onto the California
upper crust, and therefore, magnetotelluric measurements can follow the way in
which these currents work their way back into the mantle through the lower
crust.
