This is a grant under the Scientific Computing Research Equipment for the
Mathematical Sciences program of the Division of Mathematical Sciences. It is
for the purchase of special purpose equipment dedicated to the support of
research in the mathematical sciences. In general, this equipment is required by
several research projects, and would be difficult to justify for one project
alone. Support from the National Science Foundation is coupled with discounts
and contributions from manufacturers, and with substantial cost-sharing from the
institution submitting the proposal. This is an instance of university,
industrial, and government cooperation in the support of basic research in the
mathematical sciences. The equipment in this project will be used for the
following mathematical research project to be carried out in the mathematics
department of Ohio State University: Coherence and Chaos in near Integrable
Partial Differential Equations; Qualitative Properties of Solutions to the
unsteady Prandtl Boundary Layer Equations near the Point of Separation;
Stability of Travelling Wave Solutions Arising from Systems of Reaction-
diffusion Equations; and Hausdorff Dimension, and other Fractal Dimensions, of
Non-self-similar Sets.
