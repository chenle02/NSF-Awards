This proposal combines strong capabilities in statistical modeling and
simulation with the development of rule-based expert systems that will assist in
the solution of agricultural production problems. General progress is expected
in developing better ways to handle and express uncertainty in the context of
expert systems models. Specific progress is expected in developing improved
tools for protecting soybean crops from pests, an important issue in
agricultural production research, and in extending the use of decision analytic
techniques to the agricultural sector. The project will employ the framework of
Bayesian probabilistic inference and the representation of stochastic
inferential networks through influence diagrams, which will help to structure
the problem and explore dependencies between key variables. The success of the
project should help to demonstrate the feasibility of using computer-based
expert systems as decision aids to address production decisions involving risk
and uncertainty.
