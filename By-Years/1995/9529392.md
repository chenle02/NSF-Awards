The PI will focus on high-frequency (HF) radio wave modification of the F-region
ionosphere using the upgraded HF facility near Arecibo. He will pay particular
attention to fundamental wave-plasma interactions in the ionospheric medium and
the use of controlled ionospheric perturbations to elucidate natural aeronomic
processes. The research will be timed with the solar sunspot cycle so that
experiments can be performed in two distinct ionospheric environments: the
nighttime, summer ionosphere (providing a highly stable plasma for controlled
experimentation), and the nighttime, winter ionosphere (low collisional loss
rates give rise to macroscale temperature/electron density modifications). Basic
plasma processes the PI will address include the resonant excitation of Langmuir
oscillations and ion waves, so he can fully explore wave-plasma interactions in
the 50-ms interaction interval following turn-on of the HF beam in a cold
unmodified plasma. He will advance current theories beyond the first 50 ms of
modification by investigating how HF-induced plasma irregularities/structures
impact wave propagation and altering the evolutionary path of the plasma
turbulence. The PI will examine plasma transport phenomena and elastic/inelastic
electron collision frequencies in the nighttime ionosphere with HF-induced
perturbations. The array of observations this project proposes will be made
mainly at Arecibo, but with supplementary processors from GRI.
