The objective of this project is to determine the feasibility of developing an
instrument for rapid, on-line determination of the organic content of water. The
concept being investigated involves a process by which organic compounds are
converted to volatile substances which are stripped from water solution and
catalytically oxidized. The temperature rise by release of the heat of
combustion is proportional to the amount of organic matter originally present.
The proposal leading to this Phase I award was submitted in response to the
Small Business Innovation Research Program Solicitation, NSF 89-30. The project
proposes to develop a concept that can be used to continuously monitor the
organic content of water and wastewater from municipal and industrial sources in
contrast to current methods that rely on costly instruments that require
frequent maintenance and operation by highly skilled technicians for discrete
samples.
