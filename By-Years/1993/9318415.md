9318415 Kingery The objective of this research is to improve the reliability and
effectiveness of additive-promoted sintering of ceramics. This process
constitutes the vast majority of competitive commercial practice. This requires
researching the distribution of additives (i.e., their wetting behavior) and
chemistry during the entire process of heating and cooling. The scientific
importance of this study is to refocus sintering paradigms away from formally
correct but often irrelevant isothermal models towards the more complex and
substantial changes occurring during heating and cooling. %%%% The practical
importance of the research will be to establish a basis for obtaining enhanced
quality and reliability and performance by using a sol-gel process for optimally
positioning a small fraction of critical additive. ***
