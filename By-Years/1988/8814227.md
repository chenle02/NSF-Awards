A series of cruises in 1989 in the North Atlantic will be conducted by an
international group of co-investigators with objective of studying in detail the
processes, environmental fluctuations, and biogeochemical fluxes associated with
the annual spring bloom in the North Atlantic Ocean. This effort by the Scripps
Institution of Oceanography's Oceanographic Data Facility (SIO/ODF) covers
"Level 1" CTD/hydrographic support services specifically required by the GOFS
investigators, in this case serial (CTDO) data acquisition and processing for
pressure, temperature, conductivity (salinity), and oxygen, and discrete
sampling for salinity, oxygen, and nutrients, carried out to "WOCE Hydrographic
Program" data quality and reporting standards. To do this, ODF will carry out
CTDO-rosette casts as directed, will assist with wire casts, will draw water
samples and carry out shipboard seawater analyses for hydrographic and chemical
properties, will provide shipboard and post-cruise data processing and will
provide tapes and printed reports of the final hydrographic and CTD data taken
during the experiment.
