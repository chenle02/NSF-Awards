A major part of understanding the proteome, the entire array of proteins
produced by a cell or organism, is understanding how proteins interact with each
other and the structure of that interaction. Much of the information about this
is in literature and not easy to search or follow. A categorization of known
information about protein interactions will be compiled and put into a web-
accessible, user-friendly database. The database structure will reflect the
biology of the proteins involved. The series of students are involved in
producing the raw data and in formatting the database. The data, accessible to
the general public, will be of particular use to researchers investigating
protein interactions and structures.
