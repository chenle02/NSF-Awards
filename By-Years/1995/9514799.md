9514799 Mickley Infants and, to a lesser extent, fetuses are now widley
recognized as having a diverse behavioral repertoire and intellectual abilities
to perceive and interact with their environment. The proposed studies are aimed
at determining how the fetal/neonatal brain develops appropriate
interconnections and how memories and motor behaviors are formed during the
perinatal period. Futher, these experiments will also reveal how changes in
brain neurochemistry modulate fetal and neonatal capacitites to learn and
remember.
