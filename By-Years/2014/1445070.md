This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating a discovery,
which involves storing hundreds of nanoliter-scale droplets in a microfluidic
device with unprecedented capabilities to control the chemical composition of
individual drops. This microfluidic dose response analyzer will deliver
significant societal benefit by transforming the way preclinical drug discovery
is conducted in the pharmaceutical industry. It will guide decision-making early
on in the drug discovery process helping to reduce drug development cycle time
and cost. The project will result in a prototype with defined design criteria
and performance parameters, as well as validation data on cell-based assays.
This technology uses significantly less sample and reagent volumes, eliminates
pipetting errors and allows automated reagent delivery and washing. These
features will lead to significant cost savings, high-resolution data and simpler
workflows compared to multiwell plates and pipetting systems that occupy the
current market space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the technical
obstacles as it translates from research discovery toward commercial
application. Current microfluidic drop methods lack the ability to store cells
at precise coordinates on a substrate, followed by addition or removal of media
or drugs. As a result, such approaches have difficulty culturing cells and
screening for drug efficacy, while retaining the benefits of nanoliter reagent
volumes. In this project, this bottleneck will be resolved by coalescing stored
and moving drops in a uniquely designed microfluidic network. A working
prototype and validation data will be produced by optimizing device design, cell
density and flow conditions. In addition, personnel involved in this project
(graduate and undergraduate students) will receive training in innovation and
entrepreneurship. The PI and co-PI have been involved in the University
Accelerator Program which will form a natural channel for students working on
this project to learn about entrepreneurship.
