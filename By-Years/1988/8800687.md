This research project is concerned with problems in ring theory and deals, more
precisely, with questions about the embedding of semi-simple algebras in central
simple algebras. If A is a semi-simple K-algebra where K is a global field, then
one goal of this investigation is to determine the minimum dimension of a
central simple K-algebra in which A embeds and the minimum t such that A embeds
in the t x t matrices over D, where D is a K- division ring. A related problem,
which will be considered, is to determine for a given group G the minimum t such
that the t x t matrices over D is a crossed product for G for some K-division
ring D. The research supported in this project is in the general area of ring
theory. Specifically, the principal investigator will study how one central
simple algebra can contain another. This work draws on some deep results in
group theory and will shed light on various questions in algebra and number
theory.
