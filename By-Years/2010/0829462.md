University&lt;br/&gt;Title ?Cyberinfrastructure Software Sustainability and
Reusability Workshop?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project
Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop proposal targets an examination of
sustainability and reusability of software developed, supported, and used by the
NSF community. Specifically, workshop goals include: examination of current
software evaluation and adoption models by labs and virtual organizations;
examination of long-term sustainability models; and mechanisms for supporting
sustainability via funding organizations, open source, and commercialization.
White papers on these topics and others will be solicited of the community in
advance of the workshop. Results from the workshop will be documented, as well
as recommendations to NSF. Intellectual merit is identified as the exploration
of this topic and a resulting deeper understanding of how we as a country of
scientists and educators deal with sustaining community sourced software over
the long term. Broader impact is multi-dimensional: in addition to the potential
transformative nature of resulting actions and strategies by both the community
and funding agencies, the proposal will make explicit funds available for HBCU
and MSI participation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
