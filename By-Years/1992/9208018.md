The developmental success of an early embryo depends fundamentally on the
efficacy of oogenesis. Developing oocytes are geared almost entirely to the
segregation and storage of newly synthesized macromolecules. Dr. Wessel will
examine the ontogeny of two classes of storage organelles in oocytes of the sea
urchin - vesicles storing extracellular matrix molecules that are destined for
the embryonic blastocoel, and cortical granules that are exocytosed during the
fertilization reaction. Both of these organelles originate early in oogenesis
and their contents are each secreted, yet each organelle contains a discreet,
non- overlapping population of proteins in distinct membrane bound vesicles. Dr.
Wessel will examine the ontogeny of these organelles using cDNA and antibody
probes that he has made to specific constituent proteins. The ultimate goal is
to understand the mechanism of specific protein "stockpiling" that developing
oocytes use to facilitate the commitment of their embryos to a program of rapid,
independent development.
