The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be an inclusive platform offering
individuals access to data-driven, personalized insights on hair health. Hair
health plays a large factor in overall mental/physical health; however, an
absence of transparent data has disproportionately disadvantaged access to
quality products and care information, particularly among minority communities.
This disparity has led individuals to use products and/or wear styles that
adversely impact hair and scalp health. The proposed technology will bridge
these gaps, providing users with hair/scalp health insights and matching them
with suitable products and regimens for their hair profile and goals. At the
same time, the data and user engagement with the platform can be leveraged to
offer brands, healthcare providers, insurance companies, etc. with deeper
insights into their customersâ€™ hair care-related goals, pain points, and health
conditions. In addition to supporting hair health, this project will mitigate
the scalp and hair pathologies (e.g., alopecia, burns, breakage, contact
dermatitis) stemming from ill-suited products and care
practices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
Phase I project aims to develop a data-driven hair intelligence platform that
uses big data to democratize hair insights for all. The technology and platform
will leverage big data from peer-reviewed publications and science-backed
databases as well as the users themselves, to continually refine personalized
insights and understand customer needs in the context of their unique hair
profile. Using proprietary algorithms, the technology will be able to seamlessly
recognize and map different hair types, identify secondary unique factors
(porosity, density, texture, etc.), map and analyze different ingredients in
products, track and map different treatment regimens and product usage, and
develop sentiment analysis, patterns, and predictions. This project will: 1)
Develop training dataset and tiered algorithm for hair profile classification
with high confidence; 2) Validate and refine the hair profile classification
system through a comparative study with dermatology residents; and 3) Establish
proof-of-concept demonstrating the connection between accurate hair profile
classification and data-driven product/style recommendations to improve hair-
esteem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
