Optogenetic control of memory formation in worms

Abstract: Neural circuits allow animals to store sensory information about their
environments, helping them to better reap benefits or avoid dangers by
appropriately adjusting their behaviors. However, the mechanisms of learning and
memory that improve animal fitness through behavioral plasticity remain elusive.
Because it is difficult to probe learning and memory throughout a whole nervous
system, neuroscientists have generally focused on mechanisms for neural
plasticity in selected cells or synapses. To gain deeper insight into how
experience modulates behavior, it would be tremendously useful to monitor and
manipulate the entire nervous system of an animal as it learns. Such a systems-
level approach to the problem is feasible with the nematode C. elegans, whose
tractable 302-neuron network has been characterized at the level of
connectivity. Its transparency, along with its small size, allow optical access
to every neuron in a constrained animal.

By monitoring neuronal activity using established calcium indicators and newer
electrical sensors, this project aims to develop a tool that can systematically
characterize how memories are formed in individual neurons. Combined with
optogenetic stimulation, such a tool would allow read and write activity in the
worm's brain. This approach may allow researchers to imprint, erase, or alter
memories in the brain circuit, creating specific learned behaviors while
circumventing actual sensory experience. The goal of this study is to provide
insight into fundamental features of learning and memory shared by all animals.
