This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will develop
biomass-processing technology for converting crude natural glycerin to
antifreeze. The rapidly expanding U.S. biodiesel industry collects millions of
gallons of crude glycerin per year as a by-product and much of this glycerin is
disposed of as waste. The proposed research will allow the conversion of this
crude glycerin to a product that can be produced and marketed by these very same
biodiesel facilities. The Phase I work is expected to result in an improved
understanding of the hydrogenation of glycerin to a propylene-glycol-based
antifreeze, and to commercialization of a non-toxic bio-based
antifreeze.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial application of this project is
in the area of biomass processing for production of a valuable consumer product
from waste materials.
