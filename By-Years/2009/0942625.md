The Workshop on Constructive Mathematics will bring together leading and
starting researchers from around the world to identify and make progress on the
most important questions in constructive mathematics. There will be four
sessions, each on a major branch of mathematics and led by an international
expert: algebra (Fred Richman), analysis (Doug Bridges), set theory (Michael
Rathjen), and topology (Bas Spitters). The goal is that, with the concentrated
time on each topic and time between sessions for reflection, results can be
achieved during the meeting itself. In addition, the attendees will have the
opportunity to form collaborations, and will leave with renewed focus and
stimulation to continue work on the problems identified. The intent is to
increase productivity in constructive mathematics across the board. Besides
these research sessions, there will also be a lecture on constructive
mathematics and computer science by Vladimir Lifschitz. The target audience will
be the attendees at the co-located sectional meeting of the AMS, and the talk
will be pitched to a general math audience. The result should be greater
awareness of and appreciation for constructive mathematics within the broader
mathematics community. Another benefit of the workshop will be to raise the
profile of Florida Atlantic University, a young institution still establishing
itself and its math program.
