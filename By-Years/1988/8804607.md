In this project Dr. Collier, an anthropologist at Stanford University, will
complete longitudinal research on stratification among the Highland Maya of
southeastern Mexico. The region has changed dramatically during the 1970's oil-
driven development boom and the 1980's economic crisis. During the boom the
study population, Indians of Zinacantan, shifted out of mid-century occupations
as peasant corn farmers into a more complex mix of wage-work, transport and
commerce, and agriculture using chemical fertilizer and pesticides. Using
ethnographic methods, interviews and systematic records of household and
production budgets, the project will document changes in Zanacanteco production
and allied socio-cultural changes in marriage patterns and the ritual office
system. This research will illuminate the role of peasantries in recent
capitalist agrarian development in Mexico and will offer important alternatives
to current thinking about the nature of highland Maya culture and social
organization. Most previous studies in this area did not analyze the political
economy of the Indian's relations with the larger economy and polity, thus Dr.
Collier's research will add a valuable dimension to a large corpus of studies.
