Kutztown University of Pennsylvania offers scholarships to incoming students
majoring in Environmental Science or Marine Science, according to academic
talent and financial need. These students are supported to persist in their
studies while developing their awareness of opportunities for careers and
postgraduate study in scientific fields. Because of the interdisciplinary nature
and scientific rigor of these two field-based majors, students are well-prepared
to apply their knowledge in a variety of STEM areas, both academic and
corporate. A large number of special opportunities target academic success
(tutoring, peer- and faculty-mentoring, intensive advising, supplemental
instruction), career development (seminars, Learning Community), and leadership
skills (leading discussion, presenting research, active involvement in student
science clubs, peer mentoring). Many of these programs are also available to
students not receiving scholarships, broadening the impact of the project. It is
anticipated that by the end of the project, 25 to 30 students, many of whom are
from rural and industrial urban areas of eastern Pennsylvania and are from
groups traditionally underrepresented in STEM, will benefit through scholarships
and learning opportunities.
