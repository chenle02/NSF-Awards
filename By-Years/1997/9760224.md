*** 9760224 Dwyer This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
proposes to develop improved methods for the measurement of the molecular weight
of synthetic polymers. Size Exclusion Chromatography and Matrix Assisted Laser
Desorption/Ionization Mass Spectrometry(MALDI-MS) will be combined in an
automated sample preparation and data analysis system. While MALDI-MS provides a
direct measurement of molecular weight, accurate determinations are obtained
only with narrow dispersity polymers. Chromatographic separation combined with
MALDI-MS is effective for polydisperse samples.The proposed instrument utilizes
established technology to concentrate/deposit chromatographically separated
components onto a metal foil pre-coated with matrix. The deposit is probed by
the MALDI-MS excitation laser, and spectra are collected, and processed to
provide molecular weight distribution of the sample. The resolving power of MS
also enables structural and comonomer composition analysis. Molecular weight
measurements are predictors of polymer performance and are routinely carried out
in 8,000 laboratories worldwide. Interest in determining the molecular weight
distribution of commercial polymers using the MALDI-MS technique is very high.
