The purpose of this project is to gain further understanding of the geodynamo
mechanism. The PI will carry out further integrations of the full
magnetohydrodynamic dynamo equations, paying particular attention to the
components of the magnetic field that depend on longitude, and will compare
their behavior with that of the observed geomagnetic secular variation. This
should lead to a better understanding of core conditions and of the nature of
the geodynamo.
