9526682 Johnson Lava flows, marine sediments and magnetic anomaly data will be
used to model the long term structure and variability in the geomagnetic field.
Data from both lava flows and sediments indicated different average field
configurations during normal and reverse polarity periods for the past 5Ma,
although the individual models based on each type of data are poorly
constrained. The PI's propose to investigate how long a time interval is
required to sample the full range of secular variation to get a good average of
the geomagnetic field. The PI's will also use paleointensity data to derive new
paleosecular variation models. Existing paleointensity data are incompatible
with the current model of Constable &amp; Parker, that is isotopic in
variability with respect to any geocentric coordinate system. New models will
sought, using evolutionary programming, that allow for anisotropy along the
geographic axis. Very long-term (millions of years) non-zonal structure in the
geomagnetic field, that may reflect control by core-mantle boundary conditions
will be investigated by looking for anomalies in the time-averaged field and the
paleosecular variation that correspond to similar structures seen in the
historical field.
