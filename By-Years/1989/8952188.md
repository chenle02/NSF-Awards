This funding supports acquisition of a Computer Aided Engineering work station
and a vector network analyzer for a RF/Microwave engineering test and design
laboratory. This facility allows students to cover the microwave and RF
engineering basics, use computer-aided design and optimization over the
operating bandwidth, make magnitude and phase measurements, and correlate
theoretical predictions with experimental circuit performance. This award is
being matched by an equal amount from the principal investigator's institution.
