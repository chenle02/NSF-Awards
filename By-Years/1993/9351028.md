Students use an image analysis facility: an integrated system of microscopes,
cameras, and a central processing computer, to capture and analyze a wide
variety of biological images. Students research subject areas as diverse as
molecular cell biology, biomechanics, microbial ecology, developmental biology,
and population ecology. The model of teaching through research translates
biological principles into real experiences and improves the preparation of
students for graduate studies and technological fields.
