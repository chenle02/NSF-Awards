9351413 Jeries This proposal addresses the need to strengthen the computer
science curriculum for major and non-majors by improving the laboratory. The
project will develop a workstation laboratory to support the computer science
curriculum, including networking and simulation. Under a separate proposal the
institution will request support for connection to NSFNet. The proposed
improvements will greatly enhance the laboratory experiences for the students
broadening their knowledge of the computer field, specifically in the
workstation and computer networking areas. This knowledge will enable students
from the HBCU to be more competitive in the workplace and/or to facilitate their
acceptance and success in graduate school. ***
