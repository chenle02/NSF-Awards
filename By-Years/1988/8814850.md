This award supports cooperative research on chemical studies of Chilean flora
to be conducted by Maurice Shamma of Penn State University, Victor Fajardo of
the University of Magallanes in Punta Arenas and Alejandro Urzua of the
University of Santiago, Chile. They will study certain steroids obtained from
the sticky compounds present on the surface of the leaves of plants from several
genera. These compounds may act as defense against herbivorous pests and will be
investigated for possible anticancer potential. The facilities of both sides are
complementary; the U.S. scientist will contribute expertise in the
interpretation of complex NMR spectra and the Chileans will help elucidate the
chemical structures through the use of their chromatographic equipment and UV
and IR spectrometers. They also have facilities for plant extraction. These two
scientists will spend time at Penn State to isolate the natural products from
plants and obtain spectral data. This project is a good example of the
fulfillment of the goals of the Science in Developing Countries program.
