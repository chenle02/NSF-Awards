This project supports travel costs for students attending the American
Geophysical Union Chapman Conference on "Modeling the Ionosphere/Thermosphere
System". The conference will address the current state of large-scale, complex
computational models of the coupled upper atmosphere as well as future modeling
needs of the ionosphere/thermosphere (IT) research community. Specific
objectives of the conference are to provide the IT community, including its
student members, with the following: - an overview of existing IT models -
examples of model applications - data/model comparisons - assessment of model
strengths and weaknesses - identification of future efforts to improve IT
modeling capabilities
