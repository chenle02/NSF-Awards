The National Academy of Sciences and the National Research Council will
continue the activities of the Committee for the Decade for Natural Disaster
Reduction for one more year. The efforts of the Committee will aim at the
coordination of some non-governmental activities between national and
international organizations and communities; at organizing and conducting the
unveiling ceremonies for the National Decade; and at reviewing the Federal Plan
for the Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction. The cooperation between the
public and private sectors of the United States for decreasing the unremitting
losses caused by natural hazards will be of great benefit to the country and to
many other nations.
