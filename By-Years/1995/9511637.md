9511637 Sejnowski Recently a new field of engineering has emerged, referred to
as neuromorphic engineering, that is based on the design and fabrication of
artificial neural systems, such as vision chips, head-eye systems, and roving
robots, whose architecture and design principles are based on those of
biological nervous systems. A two-week workshop on neuromorphic engineering will
be held to bring together young investigators and more established researchers
from academia with their counterparts in industry and national laboratories,
working on both neurobiological as well as engineering aspects of sensory
systems and sensory-motor integration. Formal lectures will be given, but the
primary focus will be hands-on experience with research tools for all
participants. The workshop will serve as a bridge between the engineering world
of artificial neural systems and the neuroscience community. The workshop will
provide an environment for intensive interactions between members of these two
communities - merging engineering principles with experimental results from
neuroscience. The interaction of these two disciplines should have significant
impact both on the development of new technologies (new artificial neural
systems) and on our understanding of how the nervous system is designed. ??
