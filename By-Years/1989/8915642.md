The PI has been doing volcanological studies with his students in western
Mexico since 1974. This proposal is designed to wrap up this work in the next
two years. Mapping of volcan Tequila will be completed as a PhD project. Other
research will be completed on the Mascota-Los Volcanos area where some
additional analyses are needed, and in the area north of the Santiago River
where additional sampling should confirm the extent of the ash-flow sheets.
