The project will support a science workshop at the University of Hawaii in 2013
that will bring together members of the analytical chemistry community and
chemical oceanography community. The goal of the workshop is to foster
collaboration between these two disciplines and thereby advance the application
of novel analytical chemistry techniques to the field of chemical oceanography.
The proponents are leaders in their respective fields and have identified an
important and growing gap in the field of chemical oceanography; namely, the
need to develop the next generation of chemical oceanographers that are skilled
in the trace analytical chemistry of seawater. The proposed workshop will bring
together a broad range of expertise in the application of analytical chemistry
to marine environmental problems, which has important broader implications in
regards to developing future marine chemical sensors and observing systems.
