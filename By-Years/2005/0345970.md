ABSTRACT

Professor Yujie J. Ding of Lehigh University is developing new methods for
molecular spectroscopy in the THz frequency region. The idea is to make a
rugged, portable and reliable compact chemical identifier for the presence
and/or concentration of toxic gases (e.g. Chemical Warfare Agents). The goal of
this project is to perform proof-of-concept experiments with improved types of
THz detectors, improved experimental methodologies, and improved THz sources.
One graduate student will be involved in this THz spectroscopy project.

This award is supported jointly by the NSF and the Intelligence Community. The
Approaches to Combat Terrorism Program in the Directorate for Mathematics and
Physical Sciences supports new concepts in basic research and workforce
development with the potential to contribute to national security.
