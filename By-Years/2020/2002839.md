The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to provide a
novel approach to improve the stability and bioavailability of beneficial
health-promoting ingredients (such as nutraceuticals and vitamins) in the food,
supplement, cosmetic, and pet nutrition industries. Manufacturing companies
using high-value ingredients are facing the problem of loss of bioactive
ingredients during processing. The proposed innovation can reduce the loss by
protecting bioactive components from the environmental stresses products
experience during processing, transport, and storage, thus increasing economic
value, improving food sustainability, and improving efficacy. Furthermore, the
technology can also increase the absorption of health-promoting components into
the human body, thereby increasing their efficacy. The proposed innovation
provides a safe and cost-effective method of improving the bioavailability of
bioactive agents through oral administration.

This I-Corps project is based on an encapsulation technology utilizing food-
grade biopolymers to create cross-linked protective membranes around bioactive-
loaded food particles. Advantages include the ability to endure environmental
stresses such as extreme pH values, high salt concentrations, freezing and
thawing; and improving the bioavailability and absorption of bioactive compounds
from food. Food-grade ingredients can be used to assemble colloidal delivery
systems to protect bioactives from the harsh conditions foods experience during
their shelf life as well as during passage through the gastrointestinal tract.
Moreover, they can be used to target bioactive agents to specific tissues. For
instance, preliminary studies have shown that the bioaccessibility of curcumin
can be increased by 80% using the proposed technology compared with existing
products on the market. The proposed technology can therefore increase efficacy,
reduce costs, and extend the shelf life of health-promoting functional foods.
