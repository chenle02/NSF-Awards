Abstract &lt;br/&gt;PI:Steven Weinberg &lt;br/&gt;Institution : University of
Texas at Austin &lt;br/&gt;PHY-0455649 &lt;br/&gt;Title: Quantum Field Theory of
Elementary Particles &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal describes research
covering a broad area in Theoretical Physics. The work ranges from physics at
the most fundamental level to computations relevant to current observations in
cosmology. The Group intends to pursue a deeper understanding of String Theory
with the hope of connecting with experiment. This will entail progress in the
understanding of cosmology and low energy physics in the context of String
Theory. At the same time they will proceed with their pragmatic phenomenological
approach to questions in cosmology and physics beyond the Standard Model. The
broader impact of the propal is that the group plans to make physics accessible
to a wider audience through popular lectures and other media including Press,
Radio, TV and the Internet. Through the development of Web technologies and the
authoring of graduate textbooks in physics and cosmology the work of the Theory
Group has a unique impact beyond the confines of high energy theory..
