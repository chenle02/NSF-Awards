The evolution of multicellularity is a major transition in organismal form.
However, the genetic basis of multicellularity, in any group of organisms, is
not well understood. This project will utilize multicellular green algae as
model eukaryotes that have undergone the most recent known example of
multicellular evolution. One member, Volvox, often appear in undergraduate texts
and in museums as prime examples of multicellular evolution. Despite the
importance of multicellular evolution for life on Earth, the genetic basis of
multicellularity in any of these organisms is unknown. The goal of this project
is to address this fundamental gap in our knowledge of multicellular evolution
by examining how the cell cycles of these organisms have evolved for
multicellularity. Broader Impact activities will include the training of young
scientists from underrepresented groups along with first generation college
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central hypothesis of this project is that
cell cycle regulation from unicellular Chlamydomonas has been co-opted to evolve
multicellularity in its undifferentiated multicellular relative Gonium. Previous
experiments show that the retinoblastoma (RB) cell cycle repressor from Gonium,
when expressed in unicellular Chlamydomonas, causes Chlamydomonas to become
multicellular suggesting that evolutionary co-option of cell cycle regulation is
important for the evolution of multicellularity. Two approaches will be used to
test the central hypothesis. First, how RB control of the cell cycle has evolved
from unicellular Chlamydomonas to undifferentiated multicellular Gonium will be
determined to identify genes that are differently regulated by RB in Gonium
compared to Chlamydomonas. Second, candidate multicellularity genes in Gonium
identified from the first approach and from comparative genomics will be
functionally tested for gain-of-function in Chlamydomonas and by loss-of-
function in Gonium. In sum, from a combination of approaches, this project will
advance our understanding of genetic determinants of multicellular evolution.
