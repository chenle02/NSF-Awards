Proteins are the fundamental building blocks of all life, and changes in
proteins over evolutionary time have resulted in the incredible diversity of
life on earth. Because the function of any particular protein is dictated by the
sequence of its amino acids, any alterations in sequence have the potential of
modifying the protein's function. The need to maintain proper functionality of a
particular protein, therefore, puts constraints on the extent to which a protein
sequence can diverge during evolution. This focus of this project is B2-tubulin,
a major structural component of the spermtail of the fruit fly, Drosophila
melanogaster. Within the spermtail, B2-tubulin is organized into an array of
precisely ordered filaments in a structure known as the axoneme, which is
required for sperm motility. Slight alterations in its amino acid composition
cause the Drosophila spermtail to fall apart, raising the question of how B2 was
able to evolve in other fly species while maintaining a functional spermtail.
This project involves a comparative study of the B2 tubulins from various fly
species designed to identify features of the B2-tubulin amino acid sequence
responsible for its assembly into axonemes and for sperm motility. The
B2-tubulin gene will be cloned from different species of flies, and the
evolution of the B2 amino acid sequence will be detailed. Based on this
information, recombinant DNA technology will be used to engineer modified forms
of B2-tubulin. These modified forms of B2-tubulin will be expressed in
transgenic flies to determine how changes in the B2-tubulin amino acid
composition affect its ability to function in vivo. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
research contributes new understanding to the process by which subtle
evolutionary changes in amino acid sequence contribute to divergent functional
properties of a protein. These experiments will involve both undergraduate and
graduate students who will gain research training in molecular biology and
microscopic techniques. &lt;br/&gt;
