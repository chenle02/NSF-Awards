This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) will support pilot research on
the first systematic, comparative study of children's ombudspersons. This
research is part of a larger project which seeks to answer two questions: Why is
law used to mend public-private gaps in social policy? And how is law used to
mend these public-private gaps? The office of children's ombudsperson is a
social policy innovation established for purposes of advocating for children and
enforcing their rights. Children's ombudsperson offices are a potentially
powerful mediating factor between the at-risk child, parents, the state, and
other public and private actors and institutions. Adding the children's
ombudsperson to studies of children's welfare reinforces the importance of
understanding the role of children's rights in the welfare state and legal
system. The data take the form of observations and interviews from attending a
meeting of the European Network of Ombudsmen for Children (ENOC) in Wales from
October 13 to 15, 2004. The conference presents an unusual and important
opportunity to interview numerous children's ombudspersons from a wide range of
nations, including Belgium, Denmark, France, Georgia, Iceland, Lithuania,
Macedonia, the Catalonian community of Spain, Norway, Poland, Sweden, Finland,
Hungary, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, and three oblasts of the Russian Federation.
In addition, at this meeting, participants will discuss the establishment of an
office of children's ombudsperson at the level of the European Union. This
research will contribute to law and society research through its analysis of why
and how law is used to mend public-private gaps in social policy. Moreover, the
research holds the potential for broad societal impacts, including contributions
to law and policy making affecting children.
