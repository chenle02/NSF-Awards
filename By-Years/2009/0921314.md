This project investigates (1) how new legal initiatives and governmental
practices that encourage the adoption of children are reconfiguring the
relationship of family and state in Mexico; and (2) the ways in which new legal
conceptions of kinship intersect with other cross-class adoption practices
related to domestic service. With the Mexican state's adherence to international
adoption conventions since the 1980s, and the shift towards the right in Mexican
politics after 2000, federal and state-level governments have adjusted existing
codes to facilitate the full adoption of poor children. The reforms, which
define full adoption as the creation of biological ties, mark a move away from
earlier simple adoption provisions, in which adoption was defined as a contract
between two individuals that could be revoked. These previous laws provided
tenuous regulation of widespread practices of informal adoption, in which
wealthier families took in poor children either as domestic servants or because
their mothers worked as servants for the adopting family. Taking as its
ethnographic site the state of Morelos, this research will use social science
methodologies--archival work, interviews, case studies and participant
observation--to provide an account of (1) the legal and administrative structure
of adoption and the forms of inclusion and exclusion that it makes possible; (2)
the manner in which legal provisions for adoption are interpreted and translated
into governmental practices within state agencies; and (3) the forms of
relatedness that earlier and new adoption laws make possible. This project will
provide new data and insights concerning how the law intervenes in and attempts
to shape family and parent-child relationships. Moreover, by looking at how
adoption has been reinvented against the backdrop of longstanding forms of
domestic service, the study will also illuminate how relationships of kinship
interact with and are shaped by forms of race and class inequality.
