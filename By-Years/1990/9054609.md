Harry S. Truman College of the City Colleges of Chicago is conducting a four-
year project for Biotechnician Training. This project will develop a two-year
curriculum leading to an A.A.S. degree in biotechnology, it will prepare
students for employment as biotechnicians, it will increase the representation
of minority and disadvantaged populations in science and high technology, and it
will introduce the College's faculty to current developments in biotechnology.
