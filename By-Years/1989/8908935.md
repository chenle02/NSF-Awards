The aim of this research is to understand the role of social cognitive skills
and biases in the development of social maladjustment in children. These skills
and biases include the accurate recognition of others' intentions, the tendency
to attribute hostile intent to others, the ability to generate many competent
solutions to interpersonal problems, and the ability to anticipate the
consequences of one's own behavior. It is hypothesized that: 1) these skills and
biases are stable across time within a child, thus representing personality.like
characteristics; 2) children who display skill deficits and biases are likely to
be socially maladjusted; and 3) children who display skill deficits and biases
are at risk for later social and school maladjustment, particularly during the
transition to middle school. A sample of 259 boys and girls in grades 1, 2, and
3 have been followed for two years and will continue to be followed for an
additional three years. Assessments of social cognitive skills and biases have
been collected each year on each child and will be collected yearly. Measures of
social and school maladjustment will be collected yearly, including ratings of
aggressive behavior problems, psychiatric symptoms, school disciplinary action,
and other forms of deviance. This research will further our understanding of
social cognitive development during middle childhood. The findings could form
the empirical base for an intervention aimed at improving children's social
cognitive skills as a way of preventing social and school maladjustment.
