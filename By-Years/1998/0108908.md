&lt;br/&gt;0108908&lt;br/&gt;Freericks&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a
conference, Spintronics 2001, to held August 9-11, 2001, at Georgetown
University. This conference will deal with novel aspects and possible
applications of spin-polarized transport and spin dynamics in a wide range of
materials, such as magnetic semiconductors, superconductors and carbon
nanotubes. The feasibility of novel hybrid devices, including spin transistors,
spin filters and memory devices, and their future technological impact will be
the main focus of this meeting. Scientists with very diverse backgrounds will be
encouraged to participate, with the goal to bring together expertise and ideas
from different scientific communities and provide a broad view of the status and
perspectives of spintronics research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports
conference costs for young participants (graduate students, postdoctoral fellows
and junior faculty).&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a conference,
