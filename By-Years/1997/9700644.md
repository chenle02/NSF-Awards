Form 10 Abstract Proposal AST 97-00644 PI: Pierre Ramond Institution: Aspen
Center for Physics This award supports partial travel expenses for attendees at
the Aspen Winter Astrophysics Conference, to be held in Aspen, CO on 5-12
January, 1997. The theme for this year's conference is "Observational Tests of
Cosmological Models". Theorists and observers will confront theories with a wide
range of observational facts. Topics include: global structure; dynamical
measures of dark matter density; cosmological nucleosynthesis and baryon
density; galaxy structure, evolution and clustering; high redshift galaxies,
star formation history, number counts; protogalactic and intergalactic media;
large scale structure and galaxy clusters; and spectrum and anisotropy of cosmic
background radiation.
