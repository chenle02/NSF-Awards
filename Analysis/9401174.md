9401174 Muhly Muhly will investigate a range of problems in the structure theory
of operator algebras. He will concentrate on the question of how the collection
of Hilbert space representations of an operator algebra (or the category of
Hilbert modules over the algebra) reflect on the algebra. He will study, too,
the structure of operator spaces that are modules over operatoralgebras.
Operators can be viewed as infinite dimensional versions of matrices. operators
have a natural addition and multiplication and a collection of operators can be
consider as a mathematical structure referred to as an operator algebra. These
operator algebras can be represented in various explicit manners and Muhly will
look at how the various representations reflect on the algebra. He will also
study applications of operator algebras to questions of design and control
theory. Particular attention will be given to applications to neural networks
and to non-stationary control theory that occurs in materials production and
noise abatement. ***
