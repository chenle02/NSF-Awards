Under this RAPID project, a fully-documented community version of the aquaplanet
configuration of the Community Atmospheric Model (CAM4) and CAM5 will be
developed in time for the next version of the Community Earth System Model
(CESM), currently scheduled for summer of 2016. The model can be run either with
prescribed SST or coupled to a slab mixed-layer ocean. The model development
process will include gathering input to understand the community's needs along
with numerical experimentation to design the optimal functionality of the model.
The software group at National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) will
facilitate the development of the model for community use; the PI and her team
will perform Diagnostic, Evaluation and Characterization of Klima (DECK)
experiments following the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6)
protocols and prepare manuscripts documenting the model's behavior.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will result in a tool that can be effectively
used by other researchers in the climate science community.
