The New England region has a high concentration of research, educational, and
entrepreneurial organizations. This concentration has created a heavy demand for
network communication services to facilitate the exchange of information and
ideas, both within the region and with colleagues in other parts of the nation
and even internationally. Recognizing this need, Boston University, Harvard
University, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have spearheaded the
formation of a regional network to improve communication services. The network,
the New England Academic and Research Network (NEARNET), has 21 member
organizations and is growing rapidly. Its current connection to the NSFNET
backbone is shared with other JVNCNET users in the Northeast and increases the
hopcount between NEARNET's most remote members and the backbone point of
presence by as much as a factor of two. An additional backbone node located at
MIT would provide more reliable, faster service to New England users of NSF
facilities, such as supercomputers, and would make the unique resources that
this region has to offer more accessible to the NSFNET community. This
significantly improved access will be a catalyst for the development of the
"information infrastructure" in New England.***
