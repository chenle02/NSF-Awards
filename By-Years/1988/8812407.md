This proposal is a renewal of the 2 year award made to Rice University to
implement a regional network in the state of Texas. This second phase is a three
year award that would add 7 new universities: Baylor University, Lamar
University, Prarie View A&M University, Southwest Research Institute, Texas Tech
University, The University of Texas at Arlington, and The University of Texas at
Dallas to the network. Also, this phase would augment the current Sesquinet
Network Operation Center with a Network Information Center which would provide
all campuses in the Sesquinet region with documentation, training and other
much-needed user services. The network backbone would connect the major areas in
the state with high speed (224 thousand bits per second - 1.5 million bits per
second) lines via., Dallas, Austin, San Antonio, Houston, and the Johnson Space
Center. Each campus would be connected to these major "nodes" with medium speed
communication lines (56 thousand bits per second). Cost sharing is offered by
each campus participating in the network. Each campus pays for half the purchase
price of the routing equipment, half the price of software maintenance, and the
complete cost of maintaining equipment.***
