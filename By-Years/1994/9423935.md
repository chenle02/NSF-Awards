In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, Mark Berg of the
University of South Carolina will study the interactions responsible for solvent
induced processes observed in solution phase chemistry. The polarized transient
holeburning technique will be used to study solvent interactions with electronic
states, and coherent Raman spectroscopies will be used to determine solvent
interactions with vibrational states. Studies will be conducted as a function of
temperature to span the region from solid to liquid phase across the glass
transition to distinguish between phonon-induced and structural solvation
dynamics. Systems to be studied include anthracenes and tetrazines in a set of
quasi-spherical solvent molecules. The theory necessary to explain and interpret
the experimental results will also be developed or expanded. Much of chemistry
takes place in the liquid phase. However, because of the interactions between
solvent molecules, it is often difficult to determine the processes responsible
for chemical reactions. Professor Berg will apply sophisticated laser techniques
to differentiate various forms of these interactions and their effects on the
internal states of molecules. Such studies will be of value in the design of new
optical materials.
