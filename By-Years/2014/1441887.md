Granular Materials Workshop

This award will help support a technical meeting entitled, ?12th Northeastern
Granular Materials Workshop?. The conference, which will be held June 6, 2014 at
Brown University in Providence, RI, will bring together about 50 leading
researchers, postdoctoral students and graduate students to present their
research on granular materials. Granular materials refer to fluid-particle
systems composed of particles in air or in a liquid. Granular materials are
found in many industrial, consumer, healthcare, and food products. Understanding
the behavior of these materials will improve manufacturing efficiency, enhance
product quality, reduce waste, and lead to the development of new advanced
products. This workshop will provide researchers with an overview of current
research in the field as well as stimulate new collaborations among
participants. The workshop will enlist participation of young researchers,
including junior faculty members, students, and post-doctoral students, who will
be able to meet leaders in the field and their peers at other institutions.

The workshop will include presentations describing the latest experimental,
theoretical and computational research on such topics as granular packing,
jamming, rheology, flow, wave propagation, continuum models for discrete
systems, porous media flows, and geomechanics. The workshop will also include
research on related materials and other disordered and glassy systems, such as
suspensions, emulsions, colloids, and foams. This broad view will help workshop
participants to identify key similarities and differences between these classes
of materials. Workshop participants will represent an array of academic fields,
including engineering, physics and mathematics, which illustrates the
interdisciplinary nature of research in granular systems.
