There is the possibility of using gas targets as plasma based optical devices to
manipulate laser pulses of ultra-high energy density. Some simulations and
theory have offered tantalizing glimpses of the use of plasma as an optical
device. If these effects could be controlled, then the propagation and
applicability of the laser could be tailored by redirecting the laser energy,
improving the focusing properties, compressing and guiding the pulse, broadening
the pulse spectrum and eliminating pre- and post-pulses. In the course of this
project, the PI and graduate students intend to perform experiments and
numerical work to understand non-linear optical effects at the ultra-high
intensities available on the Hercules laser system at the University of
Michigan. Following demonstrations of optical control of the laser pulse, the
modified, tailored pulses could then be used for laser-driven particle
acceleration, both solid target proton acceleration by radiation pressure
acceleration and laser wakefield acceleration of electrons in a gas
jet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research may lead to new practical techniques for
manipulating laser pulses for ultra-intense applications. By implementing the
techniques learnt during the course of the research, improved stability for
particle acceleration, and particle beams of higher quality should
result&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal was submitted to the NSF-DoE
Partnership in Plasma Science and Engineering joint solicitation 08-589. This
