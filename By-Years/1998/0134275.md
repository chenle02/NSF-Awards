ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;CTS-0134275&lt;br/&gt;J. Oberhauser, University of
Virginia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective the proposed research is to study
the rheology and microstructure of polymer-clay nanocomposites, a novel class of
material whose properties combine elements of suspension rheology and non-
Newtonian fluid mechanics. The research plan has three parts: (1) to understand
the basic rheology of a well-characterized nanocomposite fluid as a function of
a number of material properties, (2) to assess the ability of the clay platelets
to function as nucleating sites for oriented crystal growth by using a mini-
extrusion device, and (3) to develop constitutive theory based on the
experimental results. The education plan consists of improving existing courses
by including various media and implementing some newer pedagogical techniques,
to introduce new courses, and to include undergraduates in research. &lt;br/&gt;
