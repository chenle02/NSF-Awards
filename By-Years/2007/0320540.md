The New Jersey Institute of Technology, in collaboration with the University of
Hawaii, will upgrade its Big Bear Solar Observatory by replacing its principal
65 cm aperture telescope with a modern off-axis 1.6 m clear aperture instrument.
This new telescope will offer significant incremental improvement in ground-
based infrared and high angular-resolution capabilities, and it also enhances
the national effort to understand solar photospheric magneto-convection and
chromospheric dynamics. These are the intrinsic drivers and origins of what is
broadly called "space weather": a critical problem that impacts human
technologies and life on Earth, and which is the focus of the multi-agency
National Space Weather Program. As important as these scientific benefits are,
the educational opportunities and advantages expected to accrue from this
development are perhaps more profound. The New Jersey Institute of Technology
will maintain its unique cutting-edge position in training the next generation
of engineers, physicists and astronomers in the rapidly developing technologies
associated with precision optics and instrument design. The current 65 cm
telescope will be donated to Prairie View A&amp;M University, to replace their
existing 35 cm solar telescope. Through this acquisition of a research-class
solar telescope, under-represented students who form the focus of Prairie View's
educational efforts will gain valuable exposure and training in solar-
terrestrial research problems.
