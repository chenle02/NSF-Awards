instrumentation in support of NSF-funded research. Instrumentation funded
includes a CD-ROM writer, a rock saw, a multi-purpose winch, and an ARGOS

University in order to provide necessary support to NSF-funded projects during
1996 and to enhance the scientific capability of the research vessel in the
future.
