The research involves deep questions related to the study of L^2-analytic
torsion and the relationship with the Von-Neumann- Reidermeister torsion.
Determinants of operators relative to elliptic boundary problems, periodic
problems and inequalities between Dirichlet and Neumann eigenvalues for domains
with large isometry groups are also to be considered.
