With funding from the National Science Foundation's Robert Noyce Teacher
Scholarship program, the Preparing Leaders in STEM Education for High-Need
Populations project at Lycoming College will recruit undergraduate majors in
biology, chemistry, mathematics, and physics and prepare them to become grade
7-12 biology, chemistry, mathematics, and physics teachers. The project will
fund 18 scholarships/stipends over 5 years. In this Noyce Track 1 project,
Lycoming College will collaborate with the Williamsport Area School District,
Waterdale Environmental Education Center, and Lycoming College alumni teaching
STEM subjects in high-need schools. Noyce scholars will be guaranteed one paid
summer research experience or internship, with on-campus housing provided.
Summer experiences will be developed on an individual basis in conjunction with
the college's Center for Enhanced Academic Experiences to ensure an experience
and placement that best fits each student's needs and
interests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The foremost goals of this project include
preparing grade 7 - 12 biology, chemistry, mathematics, and physics teachers and
increasing the number of high-achieving undergraduate STEM majors recruited into
a career in the teaching profession. Additionally, the project will serve to
create lasting improvements to the Lycoming Secondary Teacher Certificate
Program by increasing the expertise of education and STEM faculty preparing
students to teach in high-need schools; developing a sustainable structure for
student networking with mentors and with experts on teaching economically
disadvantaged populations; and increasing understanding of effective teacher
certification program components. Evaluation of the Noyce scholarship grant will
be accomplished with a mixed-method approach using both formative and summative
elements. The framework for evaluation will be focus on scholars' reactions to
the training provided, learning, and use of new knowledge and skills, as well as
organizational support and change, and secondary student outcomes.
