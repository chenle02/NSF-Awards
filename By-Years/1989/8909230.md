An experimental investigation is to be carried out to explore one particular
mechanism of drag reduction through polymer additives in liquids. This is the
effect of the additive on streamwise, counter- rotating vortices near the wall.
These are hypothesised to interact with concentrated polymer threads. The
configuration to be utilized will be the annular gap between concentric rotating
cylinders. Fluoresecnt dye and two-component Laser-Doppler anemometry will be
used as diagnostic tools over a range of Reynolds number and rotation rates.
