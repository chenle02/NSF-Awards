This award will partially support the 2018 Field of Dreams Conference, to be
held at the Renaissance St. Louis Airport Hotel, in St. Louis, MO, from November
2-4, 2018. The Field of Drams Conference is organized by the National Alliance
for Doctoral Studies in the Mathematical Sciences (Math Alliance), an
organization whose goal is to increase the number of students from backgrounds
underrepresented in the mathematical sciences who earn doctorates in those
fields. Approximately 200 students will attend the conference, and about 75% of
those will be underrepresented minorities. The conference coordinates with the
Alliance's Facilitated Graduate Admissions Process (F-GAP), which has helped
place approximately 70 Alliance Scholars in graduate programs each of the last
five years with very good retention to this point. So, the conference is an
essential part of a program to produce a more diverse professional mathematical
workforce. In addition, there are events at the conference which assist faculty
in mentoring practices and help academic departments transform their cultures to
be more supportive of student success. The Field of Dreams conference has
several purposes, including: providing information about all aspects of the
mathematical sciences professions to students wishing to pursue doctoral
studies; providing information about summer research programs and opportunities
at the NSF-funded Mathematical Sciences Institutes; facilitating appropriate
placement of Alliance students in graduate programs; providing professional
development in mentoring and cultural competence for our Alliance faculty; and
serving as a clearinghouse for employment opportunities for new Alliance
doctoral recipients. More information about the alliance is available at
www.mathalliance.org. The 2018 Field of Dreams Conference program, and material
from previous years' conferences, are available at
https://mathalliance.org/field-of-dreams-conference/.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
