This project is to distinguish the mantle helium isotopic signature with new
measurements of deeply buried diamonds from kimberlites of various ages. The
helium isotopic measurements combined with IR spectroscopy and
cathodeluminescence microscopy will make it possible to relate the isotopic data
to diamond mineralogy. Laser dissection of individual diamonds will eliminate
the possible effects of alpha particle implantation, resolve variations within
individual diamonds. Studies of several new alluvial localities will allow an
assessment of the importance of cosmic-ray-produced 3He to the diamond work.
