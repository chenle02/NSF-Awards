The investigator and his colleagues study several problems in the analytic
theory of L-functions. The long term goal of these projects is to gain an
improved understanding on zeros of L-functions, and on the distribution of
values of L-functions and related number theoretic objects. In collaboration
with Zeev Rudnick, the investigator is developing methods to obtain lower bounds
in many families of L-functions. These lower bounds are of the same order of
magnitude as the conjectured asymptotic formulae of Keating and Snaith. In
related work, the investigator is developing a new method for obtaining extreme
values of L-functions, and the emerging ideas seem to be of wide applicability.
The investigator will also work on finding new asymptotic formulae for certain
moments of quadratic twists of L-functions. Lastly, with Andrew Granville, the
investigator will work on questions from multilplicative number theory,
especially related to character sums.

The investigator's area of research is analytic number theory. The central
objects of study in number theory are L-functions. These are certain analytic
functions built out of arithmetically interesting objects such as prime numbers.
Understanding the zeros and values of L-functions is one of the major themes of
modern mathematics. Apart from the intrinsic interest in these questions,
progress in this area has practical implications for cryptography and coding
theory.
