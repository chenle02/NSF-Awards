The design of globally synchronous systems must account for clock skew due to
propagation delays through a distribution network. In large or fast systems,
electrical path delays must be individually equalized, a tedious and error-prone
process. Alternatively, systems can be designed in an asynchronous or clockless
form, but asynchronous design is not currently or widely understood or
practiced. Therefore, improved technology for distribution of clock signals
continues to be important for high-performance systems. Sinusoidal clock signals
in the form of standing waves on the clock-distribution conductors can
substantially eliminate clock skew across a system. This has been operationally
demonstrated in a branching tree of transmission lines in the Pixel-Planes 5
system, where a 160 MHz clock is distributed across a three-rack system with
less than 200 ps skew. The work in this project will allow generalization to
surfaces, suggesting the design of synchronous PC boards using clock planes for
low-complexity and low-skew clock distribution. A series of experiments and
circuit developments are being performed to reduce the clock-plane concept to
engineering practice. The expected results of this research effort consist of a
design methodology that is both simple and reliable, supported by a library of
basic circuits and CAD tools.
