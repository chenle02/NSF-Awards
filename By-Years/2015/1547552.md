This award is to provide 20 need-based student travel grants to the
International Conference on Mobile Ad hoc and Sensor Systems (IEEE MASS), in
Dallas, Texas, Oct 19-22, 2015. Travel grants for the conference and also to
support pre-conference workshops will be offered to interested young researches
in the field of wireless, mobile, and sensing technology and systems, who
otherwise would not have the opportunity to attend. The conference traditionally
brings together researchers in the broad field of wireless, mobile and sensor
systems including distributed signal processing, cyber-physical applications,
networked services, architectural considerations, sensing systems, network
middleware, platform design, and system resource management to facilitate
intellectual exchange and expose students to first-class research in these
areas.
