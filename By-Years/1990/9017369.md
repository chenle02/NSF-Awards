Puerto Rico faces two major natural hazards: hurricanes (and related wind and
water damage) and earthquakes. This research deals with response to multiple
natural hazards in Puerto Rico following the experience of homeowners with
Hurricane Hugo in 1989. The research will focus on the impacts of direct or
indirect experience with hurricane damage on the adoption of subsequent
mitigation measures. It involves a survey of a geographically stratified sample
of homeowners, and the spatial and statistical analysis of responses using a
geographic information system. We will be able to test for the impact of
geographic location of the household as well as family connections with
households in areas that suffered damage on attitudes towards risk and the
purchase of flood insurance, as well as earthquake insurance beyond that
mandated by lenders. We will explore the relationship of the perception of
hurricane risk with perceptions and preparedness for the other major natural
hazard facing Puerto Rico - earthquakes.
