ABSTRACT Proposal Number: CCR-0238289 Title: CAREER: Infrastructure for Software
Generators and Components PI: Ioannis Smaragdakis

Domain-specific techniques are among the most promising approaches to software
construction and reuse. The research objective of this proposal is to provide
advanced infrastructure for software generators and components--the most common
domain-specific implementation techniques.

Specifically, this proposal puts forward two concrete ideas, one in the area of
(embedded) software generators and one in the area of component programming:
-Designing a programming language with C++-like meta-programming support, but
without the problems that have plagued C++ template meta-programming.
-Implementing a component infrastructure for layered libraries of binary
components. This infrastructure uses the technology of dynamic loading/linking
in modern operating systems.

Developing such infrastructure is particularly valuable because it is the only
domain-independent (and thus transferable) part of the intellectual effort of
building a generator or component library. The education and outreach objectives
of the proposal are to (1) develop a new course on component-based and
generative software engineering; (2) enhance existing courses with the results
of the proposed research; (3) author a textbook on software component
technologies and generative programming; and (4) initiate efforts for social
outreach and outreach to other scientific areas and software professionals.
