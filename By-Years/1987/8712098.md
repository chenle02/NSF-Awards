A major emphasis of recent marine geological studies has been to relate the
detailed geochemistry and petrology of crustal rocks to the fine-scale features
present along mid-ocean ridges. Initial models of the sea-floor spreading
process had assumed that crust was created from long, fairly continuous, axial
magma chambers. Although minor variations in chemistry were allowed in these
models, the composition of the erupted lavas was assumed to be fairly constant.
With the advent of detailed mapping systems such as Seabeam and Seamarc, a whole
new class of processes were revealed in ridge crest bathymetry. New models
emerging from these data indicate that the ridge axis is composed of a series of
small, discrete magmatic segments or individual volcanoes. The lavas produced
from these volcanoes appears in many cases to be chemically distinct. The
objective of the present project is to examine the chemistry of basalts in
several of these segments along the East Pacific Rise using the research
submersible Alvin. Previous surface ship sampling has defined the gross changes
in basalt chemistry related to features such as overlapping spreading centers,
off-set ridge axis, and transform faults. Alvin will now be used to sample in
detail at boundaries between such features. These data will be used to constrain
the nature and distribution of subsurface magma chambers and their relation to
the individual morphological segments along the ridge axis. The principal
investigators are well qualified to complete the proposed project.
