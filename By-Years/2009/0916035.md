This project will advance the understanding of swarms of simple vehicles that
can collectively accomplish complex tasks. Prof. Rossi and Shen take their
inspiration from social animals such as flocks of birds and schools of fish that
communicate using simple rules to coordinate motion and make decisions for the
entire group. There can be significant differences between rules found in
biology and technological applications. For instance, birds coordinate motion
with visual cues whereas networked robots coordinate activities using wireless
communication. These two types of communication provide different kinds of
information and have different limitations. Profs. Shen and Rossi are
particularly interested in autonomous underwater vehicles because they face the
challenge of low or irregular communication quality and poor position
information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Profs. Shen and Rossi will combine
mathematical modeling and analysis with engineering applications to study
specific problems. First, they will explore leadership within swarms to
understand how small numbers of individuals within a swarm can shape decision
making for the entire group. Second, they will study swarm behavior in the
presence of background flows to understand how currents can distort or
disassemble swarms that would be effective in calm conditions. Third, they will
study threat avoidance strategies to understand how complex motion can protect a
swarm when individual evasion is impossible. Finally, they will study
coordinated detection of a scalar field such as nutrients or contaminants in the
ocean. Profs. Shen and Rossi will create an interdisciplinary research team
around these problems involving students from both mathematics and computer
science.&lt;br/&gt;
