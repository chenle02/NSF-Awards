The commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to provide a computational
platform that facilitates multiple entities to transact where data owned by
different stakeholders is used but not disclosed to anyone, including the
platform. The resulting transaction would allow entities to make informed
decisions about not only choosing from a pool of potential partners but also
explore avenues to generate value from their potential partnership(s). This
platform eliminates any possibility of losing ownership of data as well as any
misuse/abuse of data in transactions. Consequently, it would motivate
partnerships among disparate entities, leading to value enhancements and new
products. It can be a game changer in allowing a range of businesses to create
new products/services, especially when such businesses are complimentary to each
other. Moreover, this platform would allow personalized service deliveries to
end customers, involving different entities, who can collaborate without
exchanging data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project uses a suite of
building blocks within its computational platform to perform mutually-agreed
computations. Each building block is designed to perform a specific arithmetic
or a logical operation using a single external server (SES), wherein the server
learns nothing about the inputs. The entities using these building blocks learn
only the outputs of the computation but not their collaborators' inputs. Thus,
computations executed using these building blocks preserve input confidentiality
and data ownership for every involved entity. There are existing technologies
that achieve some of the stated functionalities but they either use multiple
external servers or computationally intensive cryptographic techniques. These
requirements substantially affect the performance overhead and scalability,
which make it difficult to deploy them in real-world applications. In contrast,
this SES-based building blocks lead to substantial reductions in performance
overhead as compared to the existing technologies and are easily scalable.
