9314288 Batiza This project involves an ALVIN dive program at "Seamount" on the
East Pacific Rise near 12 degrees north. Hyaloclastite deposits will be sampled
to evaluate the dynamics of hyaloclastite eruptions with the objective of
constraining magma ascent velocity and plume dynamics for the high eruption-rate
end member of magmatic activity at ridges. Modelling studies and laboratory
experimentation will also be employed. ***
