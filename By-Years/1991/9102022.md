This project supports the dissertation research of a cultural anthropologist
studying large-scale population resettlement associated with an economic
development project in China. Using methods of participant observation, surveys
and intensive interviews of households, the project will study how people
affected by resettlement can call upon their kinship networks to develop
creative solutions to the problems they face. The theory explaining how
communities adapt to massive relocation and disruption has been developed from
case studies in Africa, Latin America and other areas, and this comparative case
study will provide valuable material to advance our understanding. This research
is important because more and more communities in the developing world will be
affected by massive hydroelectric projects which flood them out of their
historic homelands, as energy costs increase. This additional case study from a
part of the world where resettlement has not been studied ethnographically will
advance our understanding of the abilities of people in traditional communities
to adapt to radical change.
