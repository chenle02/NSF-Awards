The objective of this program is to reveal experimentally many unusual
properties of graphene surface plasmon and to develop next-generation
nanophotonic devices. This research will investigate localized surface plasmon
resonances in doped graphene nanostructures, explore transverse electrical
surface plasmon, and develop a pump-probe space-time-resolved spectroscopy
method to study terahertz surface plasmon polaritons. Graphene-based active
plasmonic devices including modulators, interferometers, and dynamic infrared
frequency-selective surfaces will be demonstrated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
intellectual merit is to integrate fundamental research of graphene plasmonics
with novel device applications. The research addresses the current needs and
challenges of graphene plasmonics, designs and develops experimental techniques
to understand basic properties of graphene surface plasmon. The development and
demonstration of the proposed active plamsonic devices will further provide new
understanding of manipulating light on a two-dimensional surface, paving the way
for advanced applications of graphene as an active metamaterial. The proposed
research is transformative in that it enables the development of a range of
novel photonic devices with integration and functionality that cannot be
achieved with conventional materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts
are to provide ultrasmall photonic devices and integrated electronic-photonic
circuits for photonic industry and information technology, and to integrate
cutting-edge research with education which provides a broader education
opportunity for one of the most diverse student body in the nation. The
education and outreach programs include the integration of the proposed research
with the UH-based NSF programs, curriculum development for nanoengineering minor
option, and providing summer camp and science projects for local high school
students.
