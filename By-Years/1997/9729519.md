This grant supports the continuation of collaborative, cross linguistic
research on long distance reflexives. Long distance reflexives are reflexive
forms which can take antecedents outside of their local domain (governing
category). For instance, in the example below from Mandarin the reflexive can
refer to either the subject of the complement clause or of the matrix clause:
Zhangsan renwei Mali piping ziji Zhangsan thinks Mary criticized self 'Zhangsan
thinks that Mary criticized him/herself.' The focus of this project is on
determining empirically the conditions under which a reflexive can be long
distance and the properties that correlate with the occurrence of long distance
reflexives. A second goal is to develop a theory that will predict when a
reflexive will be long distance and will have these properties. The project
involves collaboration among three PIs and three cooperating colleagues at
universities in Singapore and Malaysia. A major, new focus of research will be
on determining which of the conditions on long distance reflexives are
grammatical in nature and which derive from principles of discourse such as
logophoricity. The PIs will also examine whether the interaction between grammar
and discourse is the same in all languages or whether languages exhibit
different mixtures of grammatical and discourse conditions.
