The application of fuzzy modeling and on-line signal processing to develop an
expert system analysis for the operation and control of bulk transportation
systems is proposed. Pressure fluctuation signals will be used to identify the
flow pattern. The proposed expert system will provide a diagnostic and
optimization tool for gas-solid transport systems.
