The elevated-temperature lubricating effects of naturally occurring rhenium
oxide, formed by in-situ oxidation of base metals with small alloying additions
of rhenium, will be investigated. Different compositions of two-phase copper-
rhenium alloys and solid solution iron-rhenium alloys will be prepared in a
cooperative effort by the Chinese Institute of Metal Research. The tribological
testing will include determination of the range of conditions and the minimum
rhenium content for which the oxides provide significant lubrication. The
fundamental nature of the effects will be studied by analysis of alloy and oxide
structure and composition.
