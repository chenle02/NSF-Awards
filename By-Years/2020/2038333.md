This project will organize workshops aimed at generating the next National
Broadband Research Agenda (NBRA) report, an update to the NBRA 2016 report. The
three main thrusts will be: i) broadband technology and deployment, ii)
broadband economics, and iii) socioeconomic issues. Progress since the last NBRA
report (published in 2016) will be elucidated, and new and open research
challenges will be identified. Workshop participants will be drawn from
government, industry and academia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
