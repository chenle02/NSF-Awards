Nonductile reinforced concrete moment-resisting frames constructed twenty or
more years ago have been indentified as one of the most pressing problems
associated with mitigating hazards in the existing building inventory. During
the past six years a variety of repair and strengthening techniques for
reinforced concrete frames have been investigated and includes addition of
structural walls, jacketing or enlarging columns and/or beams, and addition of
steel bracing. This research program extends previous work conducted at the
University of Texas. This program consists of frame tests as well as tests on
critical details of strengthening procedures for nonductile moment-resisting
frames. The project is divided into two major tasks: (1) Problems associated
with addition of structural walls to nonductile frames, including improvement of
column splice performance, study of interface flaws at top of wall, interface
shear transfer tests (influence of axial load and dowels), and frame tests with
infill walls; and (2) Addition of steel bracing systems to reinforced concrete
frames including detailing of connections for continuity, systems with braces
having high slenderness ratios, and systems with braces having low slenderness
ratios. This is a collaborative research project between the University of Texas
at Austin and H. J. Degenkolb Associates. This research project represents the
participation by H. J. Degenkolb Associates.
