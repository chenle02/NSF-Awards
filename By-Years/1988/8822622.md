Optimality of inference procedures as well as new methodology in statistics are
to be studied. The problem areas include (1) unbiasedness and monotonicity of
power functions of tests; (2) inference in curved exponential families; (3)
analysis of incomplete block designs; (4) variable selection techniques; (5)
extensions of James-Stein results to non-normal cases; (6) extension of James-
Stein results to non-quadratic losses.
