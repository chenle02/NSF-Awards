9520978 Sokal Quantum field theory is the central tool employed to study
problems, elementary particle and nuclear physics as well as many problems in
astrophysics and condensed matter physics. With the advent of high speed
computers, many problems in quantum field theory can be modeled and examined by
computer simulations. This research proposes to study such problems as well as
to develop techniques for more efficient computer simulations. ***
