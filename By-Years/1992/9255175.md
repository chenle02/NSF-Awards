"Middle School Mathematics and Science at California State University San
Marcos" ((MS)2(SM)) is a summer camp initiative sponsored by California State
University san Marcos in collaboration with the public school districts of
Escondido, Oceanside, San Marcos, and Vista. This academically based enrichment
program offers mathematics and science related activities to develop and sustain
the interest of seventh through ninth grade African-American, Hispanic, Native-
American, and Pan-Asian students in north San Diego County. Each summer the
students attend a four- week institute taught by local science and mathematics
teachers and college or university scientists and mathematicians. Students use
calculators and computers as they develop the critical thinking and problem-
solving skills that form the basis for scientific work. During the summer and
academic year, participants take field trips to interact with scientists in a
variety of work settings and are mentored by local college students and academic
or industrial scientists. Project results will be disseminated through
professional education networks, submission of articles to refereed journals,
and presentations at local, state and national meetings.
