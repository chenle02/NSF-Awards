The Symposium On Usable Privacy and Security (SOUPS) brings together an
interdisciplinary group of researchers and practitioners in human computer
interaction, security, and privacy. The program features technical papers,
workshops and tutorials, a poster session, panels and invited talks, and
discussion sessions. The ninth SOUPS will be held July 24-26, 2013 at
Northumbria University in Newcastle, UK. The funds support travel grants for
American students to attend the conference. SOUPS is the top conference devoted
to usable privacy and security. By increasing student participation at the SOUPS
conference, it may encourage more students to get involved in usable security
research and pursue further graduate education and careers in this area.
