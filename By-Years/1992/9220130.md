The quantitative role of bacteriophages in the biogeochemical cycles of the
marine environment is a most urgent question. At present, there is no direct
method to measure phage production, only indirect estimates of phage production
based on measures of phage decay rates by Norwegians scientists. This project
will develop urgently needed and innovative techniques for measuring phage
production in seawater. Two radiotracer approaches will be attempted to
specifically measure DNA and RNA phage production. The approach is risky because
the strategy is to metabolically label bacteria and secondarily the phage DNA
and RNA. The methods will be calibrated and field tested to assess whether or
not phage proliferation is an important process in marine ecosystems.
