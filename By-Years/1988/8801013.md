This research project focuses on monolithic high-frequency (1-1000 MHz)
communications circuits and is directed at exploring new ways to use silicon
integrated-circuit technology to improve the performance and reduce the cost of
communications systems of various kinds with primary emphasis on data
communications. Particular emphasis is placed on circuit techniques applicable
to the photocurrent amplifier and the clock recovery problem in fiber-optic
receivers. The following four specific areas are being investigated: fundamental
performance limits in fiber-optic transceivers, low- noise switched-capacitor
filters, wideband MOS amplifiers with low input-noise voltage, and device
modeling for MOS analog circuit design.
