CTS-9707778 R.G. LARSON UNIV. OF MICHIGAN SUMMARY Brownian dynamics simulations
will be performed to predict the stretching behavior of long DNA molecules in
simple flows, including uniform extensional, uniform, shear, and plane
Poiseuille flows. The results of these simulations will be compared directly
with experiments on single long, fluorescing, molecules of DNA in corresponding
simple flows. The research will consider the transient process by which long
polymer molecules stretch out in extensional or shear flows, and determine
whether or not the physical forces that describe uniform flows at steady state
work for the complex unraveling transient flow processes. The simulations, when
combined with the experimental results, may also help explain why light
scattering studies indicate little polymer stretching in such flows. These
studies have applications not only in traditional areas of polymer fluid
mechanics, Such as turbulent drag reduction and now through porous media, but
are also relevant to Technologies involving DNA micro-manipulation, including
the new technology of "fluid fixation", i.e., the use of hydrodynamic flows to
stretch long DNA molecules to aid in genetic mapping.
