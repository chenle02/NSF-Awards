Leavenworthia, a small genus of mustards, includes a number of species that
exhibit varying levels of specialization for self-fertilization. This presents
an opportunity to understand the origin of selfing and subsequent modification
of floral and genetic structure. To accomplish, however, it is essential that
rigorous hypotheses of infra-generic phylogeny be developed. This research
proposes to use variation in restriction sites in chloroplast and nuclear DNA
within an parsimony/out-group analysis of phylogeny. The results will then be
used to explore adaptive radiation of selfing and its adaptive significance.
Correlations of floral characters will be sought to understand how selfing
originates and expands within a single phylogenetic lineage. Electrophoresis of
enzymes will be used to determine effectiveness of those traits in selfing.
