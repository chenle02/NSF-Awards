This research extends the PI's unique and transformative Vega-Lite grammar and
language for specifying information visualizations to focus on mechanisms for
interaction. New tools will be integrated with popular open source / industry
research authoring platforms. Prior research has developed theories of effective
visual encoding (i.e., how best to map data values to visual properties such as
position, shape, or size). Implementing these theories in software has advanced
society's adoption of visualization as a medium for recording, analyzing, and
communicating about data. However, there has been little analogous theory-
building for interactivity, a critical component for enabling tight feedback
between generating and answering hypotheses. For instance, how do different
interaction design choices affect dataset coverage, the rate of insights, and
people's confidence in their findings? Limits of prior theory impede support for
interaction design in visualization systems, and establishing conventions for
interaction design. For example, in different tools, dragging may pan a chart,
highlight brushed points, or zoom into a selected
region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will develop theory by evaluating
interaction techniques for information visualization via crowdsourced,
laboratory, and field studies. Design choices, data distributions, and analytic
tasks will be investigated, vis-Ã -vis measurable outcomes, such as usability,
completion time, accuracy, and higher-level cognition. The impact of resulting
new theory on techniques for interactive visualization will be studied,
addressing research questions such as: (1) How to present results to augment
static visualizations with effective interactivity? (2) How to promote
exploration? (3) How to suggest unexplored visualization
states?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
