9317670 Yuille This is the first year funding of a three-year continuing award
to investigate the problems of robust face recognition under lighting, albedo,
geometry and viewpoint variations by formulating new modeling and matching
alogrithms. The approach consists of deriving sets of models which, when
interpolated, serve to handle wide variations in viewpoint. The model used
consists of two parts: first, a geometric model related to spatial variations
and individual and expression changes, and second, an imaging model, which
handles variations in lighting and albedo. The research involves the following
four goals: 1) the design, test, and implementation of algorithms to match the
model described against frontally-viewed faces, 2) the extension of deformable
template techniques for tracking faces and their features and determine an
interpretative mapping in terms of expressions, 3) the development of
probabilistic methodologies for first learning from a database the prior
distributions used by deformable templates, and later, to develop a learning
method to determine the maximum a posteriori estimate of the model, and 4) to
generalize the model to detect multiple faces in complex visual scenes, and
perform robustly even in the presence of outliers and occluders.
