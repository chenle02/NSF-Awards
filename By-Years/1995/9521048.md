This award is made in the Organic Dynamics Program in support of the continuing
research of Dr. David Whitten at the University of Rochester. The research will
deal with the design, synthesis, and characterization of Langmuir-Blodgett
films, vesicles, and membranes bearing aggregates of chromophores. The
chromophores will typically be trans-stilbenes, trans-azobenzenes, polypyridines
and polypyrimidenes attached to phospholipids, calixarenes or dendrimeric
amphiphiles. The research will investigate the the effect of light on the
chromophoric aggregates and what influence it has on the stability and physical
properties of the films. The ultimate application of these materials will be
photoregulatable or optical films and membranes which can change their
permeability, stability, and ion-binding ability in a controlled manner upon
exposure to light. The synthesis of optical films and membranes whose stability
and physical properties can be predictably controlled by light of the
appropriate frequency and intensity is of great interest to the organic
dynamics, materials and biophysics communities. Such materials are likely to
find applications in molecular optoelectronics, drug-delivery systems and gas
separation systems.
