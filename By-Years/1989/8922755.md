This project is an experimental and theoretical study of heat flux from circular
cylinders in He II. The experiment will use a SQUID to make careful measurement
of the temperature gradient in the vicinity of heated cylinders. Both steady
state and transient processes will be considered. The effort will include a
comparison between experimental results and those predicted from the He II model
applied to cylindrical geometries. A secondary issue will be to search for the
onset of the turbulent state in this configuration. The effect of both
temperature and heating rate will also be considered. This project is a basic
engineering study of heat transfer in superfluid helium which could be of
benefit to superconductor, supercollider, astromagnetic and aerospace
applications.
