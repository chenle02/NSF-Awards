Professor Zilm is supported by a grant from the Experimental Physical Chemistry
Program to study the structure of metastable molecular fragments captured in a
low temperature matrix using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques for
high resolution studies in the solid state. These studies should provide
information on the nature of the intermediates formed during the course of a
chemical reaction and thus further our understanding of how chemical reactions
occur. A combination of the structure-specific information from high-resolution
techniques of solid state NMR and the matrix isolation techniques for reactive
intermediates have been demonstrated by Zilm as a useful tool for the transient
species produced in a chemical reaction. With new NMR techniques that he has
developed he will investigate the structure of singlet biradicals, singlet
carbenes and silylenes, singlet nitrenes, ynols, and other species. Dipolar
couplings and therefore internuclear distances and relative orientations of
bonds will provide detailed structure, and chemical shift tensors will provide
additional information about the electron distribution in these fragments.
Sensitivity of the NMR techniques will be increased by operating at 20 K.
