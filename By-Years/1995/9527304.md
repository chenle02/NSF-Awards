9527304 Scalapino This project is for work on the physical properties of
strongly interacting many electron systems. It includes numerical (using variety
of techniques, MonteCarlo, density matrix renormalization group and transfer
matrix diagonalization) calculations for the Heisenberg, Hubbard and t-J models
describing fermions confined to coupled chains and/or planes. The goal of this
work is to obtain a clearer physical understanding of the basic mechanism
responsible for the magnetic, charge-density and pairing correlations and how
these correlations give rise to the observed physical properties of strongly
correlated materials. There are further proposals for phenomenological analyses
that help elucidate the insights gained from the numerical calculations. %%%
Some of the recently discovered magnets and superconductors are either chain-
like (fibrous) or planar (flake) in their properties. The underlying materials
are often the novel- synthetic materials. This theoretical study will help
understand the properties and will be critical to potential applications of the
novel synthetic materials. ***
