9505687 Sack Stomata consist of two guard cells surrounding a pore that
regulates gas exchange through the aerial plant epidermis. Little is known about
the genes that regulate stomatal patterning, determination and differentiation.
Two recessive Arabidopsis mutants have been isolated, too many mouths (tmm) and
four lips (flp), each with extra adjacent stomata. Both affect stomatal
production and determination more than patterning or differentiation. ttm
appears to affect both precursor cell formation and activity and may be an
important regulator of stomatal production. The research proposed has three
objectives overall. First, to understand the phenotypes better, Dr. Sack will
attempt to: a) isolate new alleles, b) characterize the distribution of the
stomatal phenotypes throughout the plant, c) determine whether tmm and flp
induce ectopic expression of stomatal genes, d) analyze the extent of pore
development in mutants, e) determine whether substomatal placement and size is
affected, and f) characterize cell lineages involved in the development of wild
type stomata and of stomatal clusters. A second objective is to isolate new
mutants and loci affecting stomatal development. The third major objective is to
do fine mapping to choose appropriate cloning strategies. These mutants are
likely to help answer basic questions of plant cell development such as how
cells are selected for specific fates, as well as how differentiation is
initiated and executed. In the long term, knowledge of the genetics and
molecular biology of stomatal development would be quite valuable given the
importance of stomata for plant productivity. ***
