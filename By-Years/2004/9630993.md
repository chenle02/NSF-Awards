With this renewal award, the Organic Dynamics Program is supporting the work of
Professor Dowd from the University of Pittsburgh. The focus of this research is
a detailed understanding of the pathway used by vitamin K which is a cofactor
for carboxylase. This system is responsible for activating the proteins for the
blood-clotting cascade. The study is to include elaborating the details of how
vitamin K is oxidized and whether or not dialkoxy dianions are an integral part
of the pathway. An additional goal is to establish the relationship between
Vitamins K and E with regard to the latter acting as an inhibitor of the Vitamin
K pathway. Vitamin K is the blood-clotting vitamin. As such, it is an obligatory
cofactor for a carboxylase that bears responsibility for activating the proteins
of the blood-clotting cascade. Professor Dowd is to focus on the mechanistic
details of the pathway followed by vitamin K when it facilitates the blood-
clotting process.
