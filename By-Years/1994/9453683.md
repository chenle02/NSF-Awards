9453683 Onaral Under the leadership of the Women in Engineering Committee and
the Women in Engineering Program, the College of Engineering at Drexel
University proposes to launch an outreach effort to motivate larger numbers of
girls to consider engineering as a viable career option. The outreach effort
will be in the form of an engineering education workshop called GOES (Girls
Opportunities in Engineering and Science) for middle and junior high schools
that are more than one hour away from Drexel University. Eight trips are
scheduled during the one-year funding period. The effort builds upon Drexel's
successful on-campus engineering career days where girls are given an
opportunity to participate in hands-on engineering experiments while informally
interacting with engineering college faculty and students, as well as practicing
female engineers. GOES will take the "career day" to middle schools. Teacher and
parent participation will be encouraged. This intervention program is for pre-
high school students in grades 6 to 9, to help make them aware of opportunities
offered by the engineering profession, and to encourage them to take college-
track math and science courses which would prepare them for possible careers in
science and engineering. The purpose of the hands-on laboratories is to convey
the excitement and fun of engineering through practical experience. The project
will be "fine-tuned" with input from a systematic evaluation procedure. Results
of the project will be widely shared regionally and nationally, according to a
comprehensive dissemination plan. After the project funding period, GOES will be
institutionalized as part of the outreach effort of the College of Engineering.
University resources will be used to maintain a minimum of 10 trips per year. If
additional funds are available, the program will be diversified to reach out to
populations of younger learners, and organizations for girls. ***
