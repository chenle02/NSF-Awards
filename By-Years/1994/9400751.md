Rigsby 9400751 In this project the PIs will determine the O, C, Sr, and Pb-
isotopic composition of carbonates recovered from the Middle Valley of the
northern JdF at ODP Leg 139. They will also perform whole-core radiography to
determine textural variations downhole. The objective is to obtain past and
existing thermal profiles, fluid advection, and sources of metals in sediments
of past and present hydrothermal system. They also wish to investigate the
sulfide ore deposition in these sediments. The PIs' and their collaborators'
ultimate goal is to develop models of hydrothermal fluid circulation and
chemical exchange between fluids and sediments through time. A second Leg is now
being planned (along with USGS collaborators) to drill the Middle Valley
sediments to specifically examine the problem of sulfide mineralization.
