Professor Hans J. Reich, of the Department of Chemistry at the University of
Wisconsin at Madison, is supported by the Organic Synthesis Program for his
synthetic and mechanistic studies of organometallic reagents. His research is
aimed at gaining a mechanistic understanding of a number of important reactions
and processes in organolithium chemistry, including chelation effects, the role
of ion pair structure on reactivity, the formation and potential interconversion
of allenyl and propargyllithium reagents, the properties of stereochemically
defined organolithium reagents, and the thermodynamics of the lithium metalloid
exchange reaction. With the support of the Organic Synthesis Program, Professor
Hans J. Reich, of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin at
Madison, studies the chemistry of certain classes of organometallic compounds,
molecules bearing metal-carbon bonds. His research is focused primarily on
organolithium compounds, which play a central role in both organic and inorganic
chemistry. Lithium reagents are often used in reactions forming new carbon-
carbon bonds and thereby helping to build up the often complex structures of
compounds displaying interesting chemical or biological activity. In addition,
they are also common precursors to many other organometallic reagents which
provide additional opportunities to synthetic chemists. Professor Reich explores
organolithium compounds in solution in order to provide a better understanding
of the factors influencing their structure and chemistry, thereby helping to
achieve better predictability of their chemical reactions and expanding the
applications of lithium reagents.
