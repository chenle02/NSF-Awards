9711826 Grove This grant provides $150,000 as three years partial salary support
for a technician to oversee operation and maintenance, train new users and
develop analytical routines using the soon-to- be upgraded (EAR-9616827)
electron microprobes at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This is a
Phase I request for technical support under the IF/EAR program. A large number
of faculty at MIT and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (through their
relationship in the MIT/WHOI joint program in oceanography) and within the
region will benefit from the capabilities of this facility. Currently funded and
planned studies that will take advantage of the newly upgraded microprobes
include determination of the influence of water on partial melting in subduction
zones, petrologic studies of volcanics in the southern Cascades, and high-
resolution textural and mineralogic classification of samples in order to
identify prime locations for subsequent secondary ion microprobe analysis of
isotopic composition. ***
