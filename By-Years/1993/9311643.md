9311643 El-Shall In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, El-Shall will apply new techniques to study cationic
polymerization in clusters and in the gas phase. The different reaction pathways
and mechanisms following ionic initiation in van der Waals clusters of olefins
will be characterized, and the resulting polymeric ions will be identified. Rate
information on related gas-phase reactions will be studied by ion cyclotron
resonance (ICR) and high-pressure mass spectroscopy. New initiation mechanisms
involving transition metal ions and charge-transfer will also be explored. %%%
This project involves the study of chemical processes in which reagent molecules
(called monomers) react to continually add together to form what eventually
becomes a very large molecule, called a polymer. Polymers have considerable
commercial application in such diverse areas as plastics and textiles. This work
will investigate the reaction steps involved in selected polymerization
processes and will attempt to find new mechanisms by which polymers with
desirable properties, such as electrical conductivity, can be produced. The
results of these studies may impact important commercial processes. ***
