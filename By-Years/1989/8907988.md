The PI will apply inverse theory to problems of main-field geomagnetism.
Controversial questions include (1) how to estimate the errors in the
geomagnetic field B at the earth's surface, obtained from observatory and
satellite data; (2) how to extrapolate B down through the conducting mantle to
the core-mantle boundary (CMB); (3) how to test for flux conservation at the
CMB; (4) how to estimate the fluid velocity v at the top of the core from B at
the CMB; (5) how to interpret v in terms of core physics.
