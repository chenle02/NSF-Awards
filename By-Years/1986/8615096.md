The advanced Combustion Engineering Research Center at Brigham Young University
has several researchers who would benefit from access to supercomputing. They
will be connected to the San Diego Supercomputing Center (SDSC) and hence to the
National Science Foundation Network (NSFnet) through a medium speed (56,000 bits
per second) communication line. Six federally-funded supercomputing centers can
be accessed through NSFnet. This award will fund a communication line to the
University of Utah, which already is connected to SDSC, and router equipment and
software.
