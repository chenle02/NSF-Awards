The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP)
has identified research in broadening participation in STEM as one of its
priorities and is committed to funding innovative models and research to enhance
the understanding of the barriers that hinder and factors that enhance our
ability to broaden participation in STEM. The project at Morehouse College has
been designed to initiate the implementation of essential research that will set
the foundation for the development of the theoretical model for resilient
science identity formation. The project in collaboration with Virginia State
University and four other HBCU institutions is designed to strengthen education
research capacity by implementing a comprehensive faculty development
program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the HBCU Identity Research Center for
STEM is to establish the foundational tenets of the theoretical model for
resilient science identity formation. The project will achieve this goal
through: 1) research activities that will contribute to an increased knowledge
base on science identity formation and other psychosocial constructs that
promote the formation of a resilient identity and ultimately success and
retention in STEM; 2) education activities that contribute to learning about the
experiences and accomplishments of STEM education at HBCUs; 3) knowledge
translation activities that will facilitate the development of an intellectual
infrastructure to ensure mutually beneficial communication and collaboration
between individuals to propagate ideas and discover new research opportunities
in the science of broadening participation; and 4) outreach activities to all
stakeholders and the broader academic community to engage in project activities
and to inform the higher education community. The project will impact the
research training and education of thousands of students, hundreds of faculty,
and the academic community at large about the science of broadening
participation in general and identity formation
specifically.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
