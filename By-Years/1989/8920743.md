The proposal seeks to explore the properties of "Agar Powder" to develop a
technique for high quality undisturbed sampling of cohesionless soils, both
above and below the ground water table. Undisturbed sampling of cohesionless
soils is a critical issue in geotechnical engineering, and the development of a
superior technique would benefit both research efforts and design practice for
static and dynamic loading of these soils.
