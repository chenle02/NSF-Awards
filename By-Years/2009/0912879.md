This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to develop a tunable,
low power miniaturized laser which can be applied to a wide variety of sensing
applications. The laser will use thermal tuning and is expected to provide a
tuning range of >40nm with less than 2V, and a tuning power dissipation of less
than 4mW.

Homeland security, industrial safety, and indoor environmental monitoring are
driving a demand for increased chemical and biological sensing. There is also
increasing activity in the area of biomedical monitoring, allowing one to
monitor a patient for vital signs and biomarkers in order to take action before
the situation becomes a crisis. A widely tunable VCSEL would enable very compact
solutions, allowing such sensors to be incorporated into a wearable device, or a
portable sensor.
