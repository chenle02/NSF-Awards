Funds are being provided to upgrade the mechanical testing facilities in the
Dept. of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering at the Colorado School of
Mines. This multi-user facility is extensively used for metals and ceramics-
based research programs at this university. Addition of the requested state-of-
the-art electronics and computer systems to the existing test frame hardware
will result in a state-of-the-art facility with significantly enhanced data
acquisition and analysis capabilities. These upgraded facilities are to be used
for studies of material formability, fatigue, and fracture mechanics.
