Equipment will be purchased to upgrade a new petrography lab: fifteen binocular
polarizing microscopes and two automated point counting stages. Ten of the
microscopes will be used to examine samples in transmitted light, and five will
be outfitted for either transmitted or reflected light. They will be used for
General Education courses and courses for advanced geology students. They will
permit the teaching of optical mineralogy in the mineralogy course, and will be
used in two lab exercises in physical geology. They will also be used to enhance
economic geology and sedimentary petrology courses. The university will provide
50% matching funds.
