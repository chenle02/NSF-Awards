This award provides funds to partially support the international workshop
Grostat V on applications of computational commutative algebra to statistics.
The workshop will take place from September 4 - 6, 2001, at Tulane University in
New Orleans. This is the first workshop of its kind in the United States, and
will bring together researchers from Europe and the United States from the
fields of algebra and statistics. The use of Grobner bases in data analysis and
design of experiments forms the main focus of this interdisciplinary workshop.
Approximately 20 talks will be given, including two invited lectures. A primary
objective of the workshop is to promote this area of research in the United
States. The workshop is also expected to have an immediate positive impact on
graduate education in the Gulf South region.
