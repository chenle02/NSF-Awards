9313746 Finn The focus of this research is the development of the chemistry of
bimetallic Fischer carbene complexes containing an added, electron deficient,
metal center attached to the carbene heteroatom. The second metal center serves
to heighten the reactivity of the complexes and acts as a template for the
organization of the carbene and substrate moieties leading to selective
transformations. The potential of the reagents for catalytic carbene transfer
will also be explored. %%% With this renewal award, the Synthetic Organic
Program is supporting the research of Dr. M.G. Finn of the Department of
Chemistry at the University of Virginia. Professor Finn will focus his work on
the chemistry of Fischer complexes, carbene complexes that that engage in a wide
variety of reactions with carbon-carbon double and triple bonds. ***
