The Mining Engineering Department serves the local gold mines in the Black Hills
and 14 large open pit coal mines in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming and has
very sophisticated computerized mine planning capabilities. The department
offers a mine surveying course for all geology, mining, and geological
engineering students. The Civil and Environmental Engineering Department serves
a large area including the SD Transportation Board and currently offers a two-
semester sequence of surveying courses, the second elective. The main thrust of
this project is to obtain a one-person total surveying system for both
departments to use. The one-person total station manufactured by Geotronics is
an entirely new surveying system. Very accurate measurement is done from the
reflector station with the surveying instrument remaining unattended during the
procedure and controlled from the reflector station. Data are acquired
electronically with easy transfer to any IBM computer for use in maps, mine
planning, and GIS. The Geology/Geological Engineering Department has recently
acquired two GIS systems for use in class and research.
