This award provides support for undergraduate students to attend and participate
in the Laser Science XXIV Conference to be held in Rochester, NY between October
19 and October 23, 2008. The students' participation will be via the "Symposium
on Undergraduate Research" scheduled for Monday, October 20. The intellectual
merit aspect of this project is to present and disseminate the results of the
research work of the participants and possibly to initialize collaborations
among them. The broader impact is to provide the opportunity for the students to
attend a national meeting of this stature and give their first public talks.
