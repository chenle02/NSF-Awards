9406109 Furman This is part of long-term research program that integrates field,
geochronologic, geochemical, isotopic, petrographic and experimental data on
young lavas to determine the dynamics of continental rift volcanism. The Rungwe
volcanic province in Tanzania was selected for detailed study because samples
for m this area will contribute to understanding both large-scale geodynamic
problems and regional tectonic questions. A fundamental objective is to
investigate the geochemical consequences of mixing between asthenospheric and
lithospheric source melts. A second objective is to document temporal variations
in lava geochemistry at individual volcanic centers. All samples analyzed in
this study are currently in hand; only fresh samples of young lavas will be
used. High quality petrographic, mineralogic and geochemical (including
incompatible trace and rare earth element) data will be interpreted in
conjunction with available isotopic (Sr, Nd, Pb, O, He) data on the same
samples. The investigation at Rungwe will enable both local and regional
syntheses of data on the dynamics of asthenosphere-lithosphere interaction in
the genesis of continental rift volcanism.
