The linear peptide chain of proteins folds into stable, biologically active
structures. The mechanism of this action is an important field of study. Dr.
Terwilliger will directly test the hypotheses which propose specific roles for
certain amino acids residues or groups of residues in the folding and stability
of various protins. The experimental work will be complemented by theoretical
calculations on the relative stabilities of the various folded proteins. This
approach is unique in that it directly tests models for the folding of proteins
and will yield a detailed description of the importance of particular amino
acids in the folding process.
