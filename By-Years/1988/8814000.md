This planning project at the Community College of Philadelphia will develop a
Lagrangian calculus for their students, who are predominantly women, minorities
and returning adults. Lagrangian calculus develops concepts via polynomial
approximations rather than limits. It reduces questions about "any" function to
the same question about a power function, which appears in the approximating
polynomial. This two semester course will be equivalent to pre-calculus and one
semester of calculus. The first semester will consist of linear approximations,
quadratic, and power functions. The second semester will consist of the
differential study of polynomials, Laurent polynomials, rational and elementary
transcendental functions by Lagrange's approach. Experimental sections of the
course will also be taught at Essex and Middlesex Community Colleges. The
College is providing over a third of the project's cost.
