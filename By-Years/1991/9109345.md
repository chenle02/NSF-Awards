This project will investigate theoretical and computational aspects of a class
of nonsmooth equations involving functions called normal maps. These normal maps
express the necessary conditions for solution of optimization or equilibrium
problems, so solving an equation involving such a function amounts to satisfying
the necessary conditions for solution of optimization or for equilibrium. A
great many practical problems involve the solution of such problems, so the
proposed work, if successful, would have substantial practical utility.
Generally nonsmooth normal maps have a considerable amount of structure, and
much of the first-order local theory of differentiable functions has already
been extended to these maps. On the theoretical side, several global topological
aspects of such functions will be investigated. In particular, special
conditions will be studied under which normal maps will be homeomorphisms, in
order to investigate more generally, the nature of their critical values, and to
explore the possibility of extending global homotopy approaches from equations
containing smooth functions to those involving normal maps. On the computation
side, some of the embedding and homotopy methods will be implemented to
investigate their numerical behavior. These computational investigations will be
aimed particularly at producing methods that could help in solving hard
nonlinear optimization or equilibrium problems for which good starting values
are not available.
