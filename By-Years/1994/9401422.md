9401422 Koch Professor Koch is investigating spin models relevant to the theory
of critical phenomena, neural network models related to disordered systems in
statistical mechanics and variational problems for non-periodic orbits and
configurations. the techniques and results from previous work on hierarchical
models are applied and extended to a larger class of ferromagnetic models. The
investigation of neural networks focuses on large general purpose associative
memories of the type of Hopfield's model with thermal noise. The third project
deals with variational problems for nontrivial orbits and ground states of
dynamical systems and statistical mechanics models, respectively. Professor
Koch's work is in the area broadly known as mathematical physics where a deep
mathematical understanding of physical models is sought. One of his projects
involves an investigation of the renormalization group, where an attempt is made
to understand interactions at all length scales simultaneously. This is one of
the most important problems in statistical mechanics and quantum field theory.
