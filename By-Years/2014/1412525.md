M dwarf stars (which are cooler and less massive than the Sun, but are the most
common stars in the universe) are thought to be the most likely to harbor
planetary systems. The potential habitability of these planets is likely to
depend on the magnetic activity of their host star. Habitable planets are likely
to lie close to their host star, and M dwarf stars flare more frequently and
more energetically than the Sun. The space weather associated with these flares
might be the deciding factor that determines whether these planets can harbor
life. Planetary habitability is a subject of broad interest among the general
public, and it crosses many scientific disciplines. The detection of space
weather among other stars would open the door to studies that could advance our
understanding of space weather in our solar system as well as the origins of
life on Earth. This project will involve the training of a graduate student, who
will not only learn radio observing techniques but will also learn how to
coordinate international observing campaigns. The PI is the US representative
commissioning a new facility in The Netherlands (LOFAR) for low-frequency radio
observations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI and her graduate student will use the
JVLA and the LOFAR radio telescopes to observe flares from a small sample of
nearby M dwarf stars. They will also arrange for simultaneous observations at
other wavelengths. Their primary goal is to detect and characterize events
analogous to solar coronal mass ejections, which have never been observed in
other stellar systems. The PI has an excellent track record conducting
multiwavelength observations of stellar flares, with a particular specialty in
radio observations. By analogy with space weather in our solar system, it is the
radio observations that hold the most potential for detecting CME?s from other
stars.
