Queensborough Community College is upgrading the laboratory modern optics
component of its technology courses by introducing current instrumentation for
the study of the lasers. Through laboratory experiments students gain an
understanding of the principles and measurement techniques involved in the study
and use of high power lasers. The centerpiece of the laboratory is a mode-locked
Nd-YAG laser. With the additional of a Q-switch and second harmonic generator, a
number of experiments cover the principles of thermal lensing, acousto-optic
modulation and mode-locking, Q- switching and non-linear optics (second harmonic
generation). Along with aligning the lasers and beam profile measurements, these
experiments provide a practical application of many of the principles discussed
in optics courses. By using sampling Oscilloscopes and fast photodetectors,
students not only observe phenomena normally outside the range of observation
but also gain experience with valuable research tools. The experience provides
students who are uniquely equipped to either become laser technicians or
continue in a four year degree program.
