Proposal Number: 1439983&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a project to partially
cover travel and organizing expenses related to the workshop entitled "Workshop
on Emerging Directions in Biological Fluid Dynamics" that will be held in
Arlington, Virginia, on September 15 and 16, 2014. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim
of this workshop is to bring together engineers and scientists, who do not have
such a chance in other professional meetings, to define core areas of interest
in biological fluid dynamics that are of critical technological and societal
importance. The meeting will be attended by both prominent and young scientists
in fluid dynamics from around the Nation, who will be discussing future
directions of research and research challenges in these research areas. The
meeting will focus on addressing challenges that need to be overcome in order to
advance the field for the next five to ten years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About 100
attendees are expected to attend, including engineers and mathematicians
involved in all aspects of theoretical, computational, and experimental
biological fluid dynamics and scientists from adjacent fields including
comparative and integrative biology, oceanography, marine science, medicine,
molecular and cellular physics, and epidemiology. The American Institute of
Physics Publishing (AIP) will publish proceedings from the conference in an
open-access format.
