Participation by U.S. astronomers in meetings in foreign countries is becoming
more and more important. Over one-quarter of the active U.S. research
astronomers are working on projects in collaboration with foreign scientists.
Several large foreign instruments which have unique capabilities are routinely
used by U.S. astronomers. Many international scientific meetings are held in
foreign countries. It is important for the continued health of astronomy in the
U.S. that American scientists be able to participate in these meetings. The
American Astronomical Society (AAS) will continue operation of a program of
support for travel to attend foreign scientific meetings in the field of
astronomy. Each year the AAS will select a series of foreign meetings of
scientific importance. Applications for travel to these meetings will be
accepted, and awards will be made by a selection committee which will be
convened by the AAS. The program will be publicized by the AAS at its meetings
and through published announcements.
