The long range scientific goals of this research are to increase understanding
of the correlation of molecular structure with physical properties of
ferroelectric liquid crystal (FLC) phases, and to test strategies for design of
new materials. The practical goal is the invention of new FLC materials with
properties suited for incorporation into commercial FLC shutters and large-area
matrix displays. Ferroelectric (chiral) smectic C liquid crystals have been
shown to exhibit high speed, multistate electro-optic and display device
applications, particularly when incorporated into the surface stabilized
ferroelectric liquid crystal (SSFLC) light valve. The best materials for use in
such devices would have a high ferroelectric polarization and low orientational
viscosity, affording a fast electro-optic response time, broad temperature
range, and excellent chemical stability. No materials currently available,
however, possess the required speed, temperature range and stability to allow
fabrication of large area multiplexed arrays operating at video rates with gray
scale. The proposal outlines a plan of work directed toward the preparation of
new materials satisfying this need. The new materials will be both pure FLC
components designed for high polarization, low viscosity, and chemical
stability, and also mixtures of materials containing the new components with
broad temperature ranges and fast electro-optic response times.//
