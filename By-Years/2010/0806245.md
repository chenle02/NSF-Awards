The initial year of this project is focused on developing a recruitment plan to
target prospective students and working with feeder schools to identify and
recruit students who would be successful STEM graduates. Because the University
accepts students only after they have successfully completed their first two
years of college, generally at a community college, the track record for a
successful STEM career is well established. The project supports three cohort
groups. Each cohort group is comprised of ten students, actively recruited under
this funding. Students who demonstrate academic success, an interest in the STEM
disciplines, and have financial need receive up to $7500 per academic year,
based on need. The University ensures that these students receive academic
support by staff as well as community support through working as interns with
local military and civilian organizations. &lt;br/&gt;
