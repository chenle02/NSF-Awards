This award supports the research of Professor L. Ein to work in algebraic
geometry. Professor Ein will study vector bundles and syzygies of algebraic
varieties. He wishes to study the relationship between vector bundles, vanishing
theorems and syzygies. This research is in the field of algebraic geometry, one
of the oldest parts of modern mathematics. Originally, it treated figures
defined in the plane by the simplest of equations, namely polynomials. Today,
the field uses methods not only from algebra, but also from analysis and
topology, and conversely it is extensively used in those fields. Moreover, it
has proved itself useful in fields as diverse as physics, theoretical computer
science, cryptography, coding theory and robotics.
