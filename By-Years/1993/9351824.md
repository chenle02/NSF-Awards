9351824 George Assessing the risk incurred by a worker as a result of
occupational exposure to chemical or physical agents is an extremely complex
process involving the interaction of a variety of scientific disciplines. One
vital aspect of risk assessment is the accurate quantification of worker
exposure to the agent(s) involved. The specific aim of this proposal is to
provide the Industrial Hygiene curriculum with the instrumentation necessary to
teach students the basic skills involved in adequate quantification of
chemical/physical stressors in the occupational environment. The equipment
requested enables students to gain expertise in quantification techniques
covering a broad range of commonly encountered occupational hazards. Students
will gain knowledge in the scientific principles of instrument operation,
procedures of instrument calibration and manipulation, and the actual use of the
equipment in field situations.
