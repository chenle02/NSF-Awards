Silicon carbide whiskers which are single crystal SiC are known to exhibit near
theoretical mechanical properties including virtually no creep and strength
retention at high temperatures. The techniques of growing single crystal SiC
whiskers will be adapted to the growth of continuous single crystal SiC fibers.
Development of continuous filament SiC that has exceptional strength and creep
resistance to very high temperatures will contribute to the development of
advanced ceramic, intermetallic and metal matrix composite materials in a
variety of engine, energy conversion and structural applications.
