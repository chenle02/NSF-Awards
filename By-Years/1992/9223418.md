This study in social onomatology will evaluate six theoretical propositions on
the origins of social standards through analysis of multi-decade datasets on
children's first names, including information about social characteristics of
the parents. The research examines both exogenous forces and internal mechanisms
that transform habits of naming. Among the factors that may be significant are:
family structures, social movements, fashion cycles, race relations, social
class, popular culture, and parental age cohort. Perhaps because first names are
such familiar parts of daily life, sociologists have not exploited them as
potent sources of information about changing cultural standards. Yet one of the
most important and sociologically revealing decisions a person can make is what
to name a child. This study will apply sophisticated analytical techniques to
extensive datasets, investigating the social changes throughout the twentieth
century reflected in what Americans named their children.
