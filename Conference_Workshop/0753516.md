This award will support the participation of invited speakers, junior faculty,
postdocs, and graduate students in the 2008 Ahlfors-Bers Colloquium, the fourth
in a triennial series of conferences that celebrate the mathematical legacies of
Lars Ahlfors and Lipman Bers. It will be held at Rutgers University-Newark from
May 10-12, 2008.

The colloquium program will feature ten to twelve one-hour plenary talks by a
diverse group of established senior scientists (e.g., David Gabai, Ursula
Hamenstadt, William Minicozzi, Stephanie Petermichl, Stas Smirnov). Younger
mathematicians will have the opportunity to speak in a workshop that will run
before the formal colloquium program begins.
