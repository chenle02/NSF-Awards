Hydrothermal fluids circulating at the world's mid-ocean ridges provide
fundamental clues to first-order chemical exchange processes occurring in the
mantle and crust between seawater and the ocean crust. These fluids provide
essential nutrients to hydrothermally based ecosystems and constitute a crucial
component of many oceanic elemental budgets. This project archives hydrothermal
vent fluid samples from over 32 cruises from nine different mid ocean ridge vent
systems collected by Dr. Karen Von Damm prior to her untimely demise from
cancer. Samples include time series fluids from visits to the East Pacific Rise
(EPR) 9-10 N vents, over a time interval of two volcanic eruption cycles. High
quality datasets, associated analytical modeling and interpretations for many
hydrothermal systems, especially those along the EPR that were generated by Dr.
von Damm will also be archived in NSF-funded databases. The work also involves
properly archiving existing fluid samples collected prior to 2004 and
establishing a mechanism for handling and distributing requests for samples.
Broader impacts of the work include support of two early career faculty whose
gender is under-represented in the sciences.
