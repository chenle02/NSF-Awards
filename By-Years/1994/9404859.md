Houstis 9404859 This project focuses on creating systems and tools for
scientific applications that require the solution of complex partial
differential equations (PDEs) in two or three dimensions. It will enable the
rapid and easy development of systems to model scientific phenomenon with PDEs.
An intelligent interface to support the tools on mobile platforms, will minimize
the communication between the mobile device and the static hosts which give
access to HPC (High Performance Computing) hardware.
