The proposed research by this experienced computer scientist will extend his
previous work on advanced user interfaces for scientific software, thereby
making it easier for other scientists and engineers to solve problems.
Additional research will be performed on parallel algorithms for exact symbolic
mathematical computation and on algorithms and systems for symbolic computation
with complex variables.
