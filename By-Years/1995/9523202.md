9523202 Wolf This research is to develop a compact wavelength dispersive
spectrometer (WDS) to install inside the specimen chamber of an electron
microscope. The WDS employs a crystal of known lattice spacing to separate
collected x-rays by energy or wavelength. This provides higher energy-resolution
of x-ray peaks, higher peak-to-background ratios, and better elemental x-ray
images. Mounting the WDS units inside the microscope specimen chamber would
significantly increase the x-ray collection angle and result in accurate and in-
depth chemical analysis. A miniature WDS system would provide chemical analysis
in situations where other spectrometer systems cannot. This development would be
commercially applicable to several thousand existing standard electron
microscopes, and may be extended to analytical electron microscopes in the
future.
