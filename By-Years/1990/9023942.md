The purpose of the project is to provide the first rigorous empirical analysis
of the impact of unionization on firm bankruptcy, liquidation and unemployment
due to plant closings. A consistent empirical finding is that unions raise wages
above those found in nonunion firms and that in a competitive product market one
would expect to find that unionized firms would go out of business more than
nonunion firms. However, if unions engage in economic rent sharing then during
periods of economic hardship unionized firms may be able to remain solvent by
giving back some of these rents. These potential outcomes will be empirically
analyzed by first examining the extent to which unionized firms become insolvent
relative to nonunion firms. Second, the extent to which firms drop unionized
lines of business relative to nonunionized ones will be determined. Finally, the
extent to which unionized plants close and workers become unemployed relative to
nonunionized ones will be investigated. Data from COMPUSTAT, Census of
Manufactures data on plant closings, the Current Population Survey, as well as
new survey data developed from these companies will be used. The project will
make an important contribution in two areas of economics - labor economics and
industrial organization. The results will improve our understanding of firm
shutdowns, the role of unions on firm performance and how these are related to
varying levels of profit, employment and industrial structure.
