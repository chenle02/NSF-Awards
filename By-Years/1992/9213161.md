A high power laser and microscopic image analysis system will be used to
perform controlled experiments on multilayered ceramic thermal barrier coatings.
These coatings are developed for high- temperature applications such as diesel
engines, jet engines and gas turbines used in land and aerospace vehicles.
Current research performed by subjecting coated specimens to low heat fluxes has
resulted in identifying some of the failure modes. It is now necessary to
subject similar specimens, as well as specimen with thin multi-layer coatings to
large heat fluxes in order to obtain larger temperatures and temperature
gradients. The cracking process occurring during the application of the high
heat flux will be quantified interactively using the microscopic image analysis
system. The fundamental understanding that this research will provide will be
used to develop and design multilayer coatings with a significantly longer life
under high temperature. The second program is a multidisciplinary investigation
to develop a thermally enhanced processing technique in order to improve the
productivity and surface quality in the machining of ceramics. The approach is
to locally heat the surface of the workpiece by using a high power laser beam in
front of the cutting tool edge so as to soften the material and increase the
ductility. It is anticipated that this hybrid technique can allow for machining
of the difficult-to-cut materials. Thereby reducing the cost to fabricate
ceramic parts and improving dimensional and surface quality. The research seeks
to perform experimental investigation by constructing a testbed, to develop
models for heat transfer and surface deformation along with crack propagation,
and to implement a control scheme based on the process models. In- process
sensing techniques pertinent to process control will be developed as well.
