This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program and the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program will assist the
Department of Chemistry at West Virginia University acquire an electron
paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometer. This equipment will enhance research
in a number of areas including the following: (1) characterize the electronic
structures and spin delocalizations in metal complexes of unusual tetrapyrrole
compounds, (2) establish the site of redox reactions of tetrapyrrole metal
complexes, (3) paramagnetic alkyl-nickel and hydrido-nickel complexes, and (4)
characterization and investigation of the highly electrophilic paramagnetic
early transition metal complexes. An electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)
spectrometer is an instrument used to obtain information about the molecular and
electronic structure of molecules. It may also be used to obtain information
about the lifetimes of free radicals which are often essential for the
initiation of tumor growth and/or a variety of chemical reactions.
