9511955 Behrman The principal objective of this project is to improve
understanding of the determinants of human capital investments and
intergenerational financial transfers and their consequences for the level of
and changes in the inequality in earnings and income. The project develops and
tests models that incorporate family behavior, endowment inequality within and
among families, and interactions between family resources and opportunities for
post-secondary schooling. The project investigates issues of bias and potential
bias in estimates obtained using standard cross-sectional, sibling and twins
estimators, the role and importance of measurement errors, and the effects of
unmeasured shocks differentiating human capital investments among siblings, net
of endowment differences. The models will be applied to a newly-collected large-
scale survey data set describing identical twins, their spouses, their children
and their parents using a questionnaire designed specifically to elicit
information relevant to the project s objectives within family and life-cycle
contexts. More specifically, the project will yield estimates of (1) endowment
effects on human capital investments - measured by time in school, school
quality, and work experience - and financial transfers between adults and their
parents, (2) how such effects varied across cohorts with different college and
labor market opportunities, (3) differences in such investment determinants
across men and women and by family background, and (4) the consequences of these
interactions among endowments, family behavior, family resource constraints and
schooling opportunities fort the distributions of earnings and income. The
investigations will also help determine the value of twins data in social
science research, which is currently imperfectly understood. The project will
also produce a public-use data set from the new survey data.
