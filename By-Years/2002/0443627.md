With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities -
Multiuser Instrument Acquisition (CRIF-MU) Program, the Department of Chemistry
at the University of Memphis will acquire a 400 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) Spectrometer. This equipment will enable researchers to carry out studies
on organometallic complexes containing low receptivity metals; nanomaterials;
and peptides. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the
elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown
substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and
to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to
state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out
frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in
materials chemistry and biochemistry. &lt;br/&gt;
