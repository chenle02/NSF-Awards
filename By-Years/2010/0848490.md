This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is to develop a new
technology for manufacturing ultra-low dielectric constant materials for
leading-edge logic devices for the 22 nm technology node and beyond. The
research approach is based on the bottom-up synthesis of honeycomb-like nano-
structured films in which porogen component is pre-built into the nano-sized
cells and can be decomposed in a strictly controlled manner.

By extending microchip miniaturization this project may impact information
technologies and related fields. This program may also significantly expand the
overall knowledge and understanding of nano-structured materials and
nanotechnology in general.
