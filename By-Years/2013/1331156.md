Microbursts are electron precipitation from the radiation belts that occur in
short bursts (~100ms). Although the particle loss from each burst is very small,
they occur in sufficiently large numbers that the total loss from the radiation
belts may be significant. This is an Atmospheric and Geospace Post-doctoral
Fellowship to determine the total loss from the radiation belts in the form of
microbursts. The study will use observations from the forthcoming NSF funded
FIREBIRD CubeSats, the Van Allen Probes mission and the BARREL balloon array.
The FIREBIRD satellites will provide observations of precipitation at two low
altitude locations and the BARREL balloon array will provide multiple nearly
stationary observations near the Earth. The Van Allen Probes will provide
radiation belt observations for context. At each position there will be multiple
simultaneous observations. They will determine the size and frequency of
microbursts.

This award will provide early career training for a young researcher at
Stanford. This project will support his career ambition to be an
instrumentalist. If microbursts turn out to be an important loss mechanism for
the radiation belts this research will have impact on space weather research.
