Schwarz The award supports research in invariant theory and algebraic groups.
The principal investigator will study the structure of differential operators on
quotient varieties; study the structure of the modules of covariants; and work
on part of Fefferman's program of parabolic invariant theory. The research
supported involves invariant theory and algebraic groups. In general, invariant
theory involves the actions of linear algebraic groups on manifolds or linear
spaces and the determination of the mathematical invariants of the space under
these group actions. ***
