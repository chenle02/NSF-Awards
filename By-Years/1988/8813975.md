This project involves the use of theoretical modeling which incorporates
observational constraints to explain the observed global distributions of
different ionospheric constituents, such as O+, H+ and He+. The observations are
primarily of composition and structure of the ionospheric plasma as observed
from various satellites: AE, DE and DMSP. Application of the modeling and
collaborative data analyses to ground based observations is also planned in
order to study the principal parameters determining the high latitude convection
pattern response to changing magnetic activity and interplanetary conditions.
