The PIs have requested a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) investigate
the technology of solar powered floats while solving an important practical
problem by building a "Solar Beacon" for floats. The beacon will power an ARGOS
satellite tracking beacon with solar cells thus allowing a float to be tracked
nearly indefinitely and making it much easier to recover. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
