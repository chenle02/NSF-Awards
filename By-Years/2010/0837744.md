Engineering - Electrical (55)

This project is developing an internet accessible high performance laser
communication laboratory for use in undergraduate engineering courses by
institutions around the world. The laboratory contains a collection of state of
the art equipment, including a one kilometer 1.25 gigabit free-space laser
communication test bed, acquired through a variety of federal programs. The
total cost of this facility is prohibitive for the vast majority of educational
institutions offering undergraduate engineering degrees. In this project, the
investigators are adding internet based control and communication capabilities
to the laboratory to enable remote use of the facility. The investigators are
also developing a set of undergraduate experiments appropriate for the
laboratory facility that can be used in signal processing, communications and
optics courses. The project includes a formal evaluation plan with both
formative and summative components that is led by an independent evaluator. The
materials developed during the course of the project are being disseminated
through the National Science Digital Library (NSDL) and through appropriate
conferences and journals. The project includes a nationally recognized
industrial partner that increases the broader impacts of the project.
