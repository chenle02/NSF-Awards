This project investigates how privacy can be used to inform the design and
management of future data sensing systems. Networked systems that collect data
about individuals will play an increasingly important role in our lives, with
applications including industrial monitoring and control, "smart" homes/cities,
and personalized health care. These systems will gather private information
about individuals, which creates many coupled engineering challenges. This work
seeks to understand the interplay between two of these: managing the massive
amounts of data that must be collected and protecting the privacy of individuals
in the system. For applications or services that rely on populations of
individuals, reducing the amount of information transmitted can save bandwith
while enhancing privacy. The objectives of this work are to use ideas from data
privacy technologies and wireless resource management techniques to jointly
manage privacy and bandwidth in wireless sensing
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical objectives of this project involve
reformulating distributed data collection and estimation problems under privacy
constraints in wireless network settings. Differential privacy gives a framework
for quantifying the privacy risk of different strategies for compression and
data reduction, leading to a privacy-bandwidth-quality tradeoff. At the system
level, total privacy risk is a resource that can be managed; this project uses
that insight to design novel privacy-allocation schemes. Ultimately, this
project seeks to formulate new tradeoffs between privacy and quality-of-service
that can generalize to other networking problems. To see how these approaches
work in practice, this work involves prototyping and testing the methods in a
wireless networking testbed.
