The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a high pressure liquid chromatography
(HPLC) system with variable wavelength detection and gradient capabilities for
use in a variety of undergraduate courses. In the physical chemistry course,
students learn modern HPLC techniques. In the organic chemistry, biochemistry
and biotechnology courses, students are introduced to separation and
purification methods. Experiments are selected and designed for use with this
instrumentation to demonstrate the capabilities of gradient liquid
chromatography and provide the students with the direct hands-on experience
important to career preparation in this field.
