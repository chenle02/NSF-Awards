A high quality three-dimensional graphics computer work station will be
obtained. The work station will consist of a real-time image acquisition and a
HP 9000 computer that will be housed in the Microsystems Laboratory of the
University of Maryland. The image acquisition system consists of two video color
cameras together with video digitizers and preprocessors. The HP 9000 computer
is a 32-bit processor system supported by powerful and flexible software to
accommodate diverse demands. The work station will be utilized to support the
research of twelve cooperating faculty members and their students from diverse
segments of the University (in the College of Engineering, the Division of
Agriculture and Life Sciences, and the Medical School). The research projects
include: microcomputer-based control and analysis in neural networks, intrinsic
3D curve characterizations for robots, cytoskeletal studies through computer-
based feature extraction techniques, semiconductor device modeling, hysteretic
semistate described systems, goal-seeking cybernetic systems, 3D solid-state
device structures, control of large interconnections of robots, real-time and
distributed program systems, repetitive adjustment technique for robot control,
robot component fracturing, and CAD of microwave amplifiers.
