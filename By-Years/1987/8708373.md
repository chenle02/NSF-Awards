Dr. Edwards proposes to answer the following questions about the sqt-3 locus of
C. elegans: 1) What are the morphological and behavioral phenotypes of animals
carrying a null allele of sqt-3 and thus lacking any sqt-3 gene product? 2) What
gene product(s) does the locus encode? Is it a collagen, one of the predominant
proteins in the nematode cuticle? 3) How is the expression of the locus
regulated during the life cycle of this nematode? This research project
addresses an important unresolved problem in developmental and cell biology,
namely, how morphological patterns are generated. The cuticle of the nematode C.
elegans is particularly well- suited for such investigations: mutants with
cuticular defects can be easily isolated; the cuticle and the cells responsible
for its synthesis can be seen in living and preserved animals; genes can be
cloned by transposon-mediated mutagenesis; and sufficient quantities of purified
cuticles can be obtained for biochemical studies.
