This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program is to
support research by Dr. Dorothy H. Gibson of the Chemistry Department,
University of Louisville, for studies of bimetallic complexes of late transition
metals. Complexes bridged by small oxycarbon ligands, such as dioxymethylene,
and carbon dioxide, will be synthesized and characterized. These complexes are
models for species which have been suggested as intermediates in catalytic
conversions of carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide to ethylene glycol,
acetaldehyde, and other oxygenated products. The synthesis will be followed by
studies of the reactions of the bimetallic compounds, including carbon monoxide,
carbon dioxide, and formaldehyde insertion reactions, reaction with
electrophiles, and thermolysis reactions. Crystallographic structures will be
determined where possible. %%% Although "syngas", a mixture of carbon monoxide
and hydrogen, has long been been processed commercially to produce hydrocarbons
and oxygen-containing organic compounds using catalytic methods, the details of
the processes are not completely understood. The catalysts used contain cobalt,
iron, ruthenium and other transition metals. Because it is desirable to have
more control over the distribution of products and to effect the conversions at
lower temperatures, it is important to probe the details of this chemistry in
order to develop improved or alternative methods. In this project, some
bimetallic compounds which been suggested as models for intermediates in the
production of ethylene glycol and related products will be prepared and
characterized with the goal of understanding the factors which affect their
reactivity.
