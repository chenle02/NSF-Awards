A previous study indicated that thin films of Ag-Si and Ag- CuInSe2 composites
may be produced with unique optical and good electrical transport properties and
they may be used to construct optoelectronic devices with some very unusual
properties. Theoretical studies of the Ag-0-Cs S-1 photocathode showed that a
"tailored" Ag-0-Cs system could produce a photoelectric quantum yield (PQY) of a
few percent at 1.5um, something not realized with presently existing
photoemitters. In particular, Ag-polycrystalline Si composites 1um thick have
been made with selective absorption peaks at 2.4, 3.0, 3.8, 4.8, 7.2 and l2um
with extremely large absorption coefficients (10**3-10**4/cm-+) relative to Si
at these wavelengths, in good agreement with a recently formulated dynamic
effective medium approximation (DEMA) developed to describe these systems. These
composites have measured Hall mobilities of 425cm2/ (volt-sec) are n-type with
resistivities varying between 10**6 to 10**-3 ohm-cm depending upon the volume
fraction of Ag. The effort here will be to dope these composites with well-
defined p- or n- type conductivity to make them useful in constructing very thin
optoelectronic devices.
