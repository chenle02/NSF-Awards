This grant supports a study of internal energy sources of the plasma waves in
the space plasma (the magnetospheres of the earth and other planets) by using
analytical and numerical methods. The theoretical models will be developed to
incorporate realistic features of space plasma including inhomogeneities in
density and temperature, anisotropy of the temperature, finite beta and larmor
radius effects. The detailed study of the internal energy sources of gradients,
particle beams and nonlinear parametric processes will be carried out.
Appropriate dispersion relations will be derived and numerically analyzed to
obtain wave frequency, growth rates and threshold limits. The model generated
wave parameters will be compared with the observations. The importance of
geophysical low frequency waves is the interpretation of geomagnetic pulsations
(micropulsations) as low frequency hydromagnetic waves originating in the
magnetosphere. Thus the waves become a tool for the study of the near earth
plasma density. Furthermore, the study of the waves provide an opportunity to
elucidate basic processes not readily available in the laboratory.
