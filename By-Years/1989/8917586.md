With support from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry
Program, Dr. Gregory S. Girolami will synthesize and study soluble models of the
heterogeneous catalysts used widely for the industrial synthesis of such
polymers as polyethylene, the so-called Ziegler-Natta catalysts. The results of
the project are expected to aid in the identification of the species responsible
for the catalytic activity and in the formulation of a detailed mechanism for
the catalytic process. Homogeneous models of Ziegler-Natta catalysts will be
synthesized and studied, with particular emphasis on the preparation and
reactivity of electronically unsaturated alkyl derivatives of the early
transition elements. Among the effects to be examined are the unexpected spin-
state changes which occur as a result of the extremely strong pi-electron
donation by the early transition metals, e.g., those of group 4, to ligand
acceptor orbitals. Although octahedral geometries are generally assumed for
Ziegler-Natta catalysts, d-zero metal alkyls can adopt non-octahedral
geometries, and the role of the latter geometries in the catalytic process will
be probed. Studies of new chromium-based polymerization systems and mechanistic
studies related to the thermolysis of transition metal alkyls will be pursued
also.
