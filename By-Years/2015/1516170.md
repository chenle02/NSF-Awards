This collaborative award will support personnel to complete a commensal search
for the recently discovered Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) using the 20-m telescope at
Green Bank at L-band (1.4 GHz). The project, GBTrans, will utilize existing
infrastructure and development. Broader impacts of the work include research
training of one graduate student and two undergrads, and outreach to high-school
students and their teachers to enhance the research experience as part of the
NSF-funded "Pulsar Search Collaboratory" which is run by researchers at NRAO and
WVU.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GBTrans will also perform extensive searches for giant
pulses from known radio pulsars, and will provide constraints on the statistics
of the brightest such pulses. An important capability of the instrument is its
full-polarization recording, which will identify the polarization properties of
FRBs and perhaps even their rotation measures.
