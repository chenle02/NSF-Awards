9623054 Uribe The proposed research lies in the general area of mathematical
physics. More specifically, the investigator intends to study the relationship
between the reduction procedure in classical mechanics and the corresponding
operation in quantum mechanics, namely the restriction of the associated Hilbert
space to the space of vectors invariant under the symmetries. The geometry of
eigenfunctions of a Schrodinger-type operator on a compact Riemannian manifold
will also be studied, in the semi-classical limit. The proposed work stems from
various mathematical difficulties coming out of quantum mechanics; lies in the
interface between modern analysis and geometry. Quantum mechanics, although
makes more accurate predictions than classical mechanics, is perceived to be
riddled with certain foundational as well as technical difficulties by some
workers in the field, not the least among these difficulties are the very
difficult mathematics involved.
