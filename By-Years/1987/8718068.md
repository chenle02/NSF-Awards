Dr. Mark Morris, at the University of California, Los Angeles, will carry out
observational research on the nucleus of our Galaxy at radio wavelengths. During
several years of observing with the Very Large Array, the PI and his colleagues
have gathered a very extensive body of data on the Galactic Center, and they
have made several discoveries which highlight the importance of strong magnetic
fields in the inner regions of the Galaxy. Their current research continues
these studies with intensive computational work to realize the full potential of
the existing data base and with new observations to clarify the physical
processes responsible for the unique observed phenomenology. The Galactic Center
provides a close-up example of a moderately active galactic nucleus. As such it
can be expected to give us new insights into processes which also occur in the
more active Seyfert and quasar phenomena. With new instrumentation such as the
Very Large Array and new data analysis capabilities such as image processing on
supercomputers, we are able to study the structure of the center of our Galaxy
in unprecedented detail. Dr. Morris has been a leader in refining our knowledge
about the Galactic Center.
