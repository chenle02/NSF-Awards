This project upgrades the status of the biotechnology laboratory in order to
serve the specific training needs of the biotechnology private sector. Students
graduating with a degree in biotechnology from the college are conducting
analyses using the HPLC in the following areas of biotechnology: (1) analysis,
separation, and purification of polypeptides and oligonucleotides proteins
including protein variants; (2) pharmaceutical compounds such as water soluble
vitamins, anticonvulsants, antihistamines, cateholarnines, antidepressants, and
polyaromaic hydrocarbons; (3) compounds sometimes found in air, water, or other
natural environments that need to be monitored to maintain a healthy
environment; and (4) compounds found in the food industry.
