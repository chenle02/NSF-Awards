Huang will study the relationship between representations of a semisimple Lie
groups and those of its covering group. He will investigate how their unitary
duals and Kazhdan-Lustig conjecture are related. He will also extend the major
results of harmonic analysis on symmetric spaces to a certain class of
homogeneous spaces which he terms polar. These are homogeneous spaces for which
the restricted adjoint representation is polar in the sense of Dadok. The theory
of Lie groups, named in honor of the Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie, has
been one of the major themes in twentieth century mathematics. As the
mathematical vehicle for exploiting the symmetries inherent in a system, the
representation theory of Lie groups has had a profound impact upon mathematics
itself, particularly in analysis and number theory, and upon theoretical
physics, especially quantum mechanics and elementary particle physics.
