Nagel DMS-9501041 Nagel will study a variety of problems in complex and harmonic
analysis. The first will be to study certain aspects of function theory on non-
pseudoconvex domains of finite type in complex 2-space. The second will be to
study certain model generic CR submanifolds of CR dimension 1 in higher
dimensional spaces. The final problem is to study certain special cases of
domains of finite type in complex n-space where n is greater than two. All three
involve the interplay of complex and harmonic analysis, as well as aspects of
linear pde's. Classical function theory has introduced geometric techniques
which have proved to have far wider applicability than first imagined. The
subject exploits the interplay between geometric interpretation with powerful
analytic techniques to yield some of the most complete mathematical results in
the field of analysis.
