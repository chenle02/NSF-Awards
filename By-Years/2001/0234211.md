As a cloud droplet or ice crystal grows by condensation, water molecules flow
from the vapor surrounding the particle to its surface and the heat released by
condensation flows away from the particle. Classical theory treats the
environment of the particle as a continuum, so that the heat and mass transfer
are described by the diffusion equation. This is a valid approximation for drops
that are much larger than the molecular mean free path, which is about 0.06
microns for normal sea level conditions. However, newly formed droplets have
sizes typically between 0.1 and 1 microns. For these, the classical, continuum
theory must be modified to include gas kinetic effects. The modification
introduces two new parameters that characterize the transfer of heat and mass,
called the condensation coefficient and the accommodation coefficient. The
condensation coefficient may be described as the fraction of the molecules
hitting the surface of the particle that stick to it. The accommodation
coefficient may be thought of as the fraction of the molecules bouncing off the
surface of a particle that have acquired the temperature of the particle. In
general, these so-called kinetic coefficients must be determined experimentally,
because there is no known way to derive their values theoretically. Previous
attempts to evaluate them have given widely variable results. This project
approaches the problem a new way, by suspending the particles by electrodynamic
levitation under controlled conditions of temperature, pressure, and humidity,
heating them with pulses of laser energy, and deducing the accommodation and
condensation coefficients from the temperature change and the loss of mass by
evaporation. Recent attention has focused on the possible influence of trace
amounts of volatile solutes on cloud droplet growth and evaporation. Experiments
using droplets doped with these materials will determine their effect on the
kinetic coefficients. Sensitivity tests using a numerical cloud model will be
carried out to evaluate the significance of the kinetic coefficients and their
variability. This work is fundamental for understanding the formation,
development, and dissipation of clouds in the atmosphere. Furthermore, an
accurate accounting of the effects of clouds on solar radiation may require
knowledge of the kinetic coefficients.
