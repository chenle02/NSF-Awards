The goal is to provide the first experimental deescription of the properties of
a weakly interacting Bose gas in the quantum regime. Substantial advances are
reported in trapping and cooling atomic hydrogen, as a result of which it is
believed that the way is now open to achieve the conditions for Bose-Einstein
condensation.
