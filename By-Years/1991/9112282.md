This is a grant for research equipment to support the fabrication and testing of
piezoelectric sensors that operate in the megahertz to gigahertz frequency
range. The most extensive research project that will be supported by this
equipment involves a surface acoustic wave (SAW) microsensor for gas detection.
Other research projects include the study of properties and adhesion of
polyimide films with SAW sensors, the study of an acoustic plate mode biosensor
and the study of slurries using acoustic wave devices.
