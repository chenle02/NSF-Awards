Cuyahoga Community College will initiate a five-week, commuter Young Scholars
(EAI) project in Mathematics and Physics for 60 students entering grades 7,8.
The project will provide math and science enrichment, mentoring experiences and
career exploration as well as activities to involve parents in their children's
learning. The target group is boys and girls of Hispanic, Black and American
Indian ethnic backgrounds and other economically disadvantaged youngsters
attending school in the College's district (greater Cleveland area).
