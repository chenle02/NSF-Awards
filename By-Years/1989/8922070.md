This award supports research involving detailed sedimentological and
stratigraphic studies of the lower Tanana erg, a large stabilized sand sea of
late-Quaternary age in central Alaska. The objectives of the study are (1) to
provide a paleoenvironmental record of glacially influenced lowland
sedimentation that can be compared to similar records from other periglacial
basins in Alaska and to dated glacial records in the Alaska Range, and (2) to
increase the understanding of depositional processes and facies distributions in
cold-climate eolian systems as a whole. Among the specific hypotheses to be
tested is whether prominent surface dunes represent full-glacial conditions or
formed by late-glacial reworking of full- glacial sand sheets. The results of
the study will have broad implications for paleoclimatic, paleoecological, and
archeological research in Alaska and for stratigraphic and sedimentological
research in Pleistocene periglacial regions in general.
