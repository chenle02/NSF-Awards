9410930 Tung A summer school on quantum chromodynamics (the theory of the strong
nuclear force) and its implications for experiments in elementary particle
physics will be held August 10-18, 1994. the school will promote a knowledge of
quantum chromodynamics, whose predictions are important for very many
experiments in particle physics, among younger scientists, including both
experimentalists and theorists. ***
