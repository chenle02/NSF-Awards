The Department of Statistics at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State
University will purchase equipment that will be dedicated to support research in
the mathematical sciences. Additionally, support of a half-time system
programmer/analyst for two years. The planned projects address issues in
graphical representations (visualization) and numerical methodological
computations and simulations. Two of the projects involve the development of
Bayesian computational methods which are generally computationally intensive and
require state-of-the-art numerical, symbolic, and graphical computing
capabilities. A second area is the area of nonparametric density estimation and
nonparametric regression. Finally, interest is focused on the development of
highly interactive dynamic graphical methods.
