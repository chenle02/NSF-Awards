9417513 Betts This award supports the participation of eight U.S. scientists in
a U.S.-Japan seminar on Clustering Phenomena in Nuclear and Mesoscopic Systems,
to be held at the East-West Conference Center, Honolulu from December 14-16,
1995. The co-organizers are Dr. Russell Betts of the University of Illinois and
Dr. Yasuhisa Abe of Kyoto University. The seminar will explore recent advances
in cluster phenomena in nuclei and their connection to clustering in a more
general sense. The current state of comparison between theory and experiment
will be covered in detail and the theoretical connection between multi-center
shell models and the deformed, single-center shell model will be examined. The
relationship between the physics of clustering in nuclear systems to more
general aspects of cluster and molecular physics will be discussed to develop a
wider understanding of their common features. The seminar will foster the type
of contact between Japanese and U.S. scientists that can be expected to have
significant influence on the future course of the field. The proposed
participants and observers have been selected for their past contributions and
current activity in the field and the meeting can be expected to produce
concrete plans for future cooperation and exchange. Therefore, this proposal
fulfills the objectives of the Program in its exchange and transfer of
scientific knowledge through an international collaboration. ***
