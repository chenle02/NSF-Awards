9306387 Lu The project will focus on several mathematical problems related to
the unique continuation property of partial differential equations. This
research is concerned with the question of whether solutions of certain types of
differential equations can be equal to zero on an open set without being zero
everywhere. Here, the concern is whether recent improvements on the classical
Carleman method will produce a weak unique continuation property of differential
inequalities for small weak norm on the potentials. A second line of
investigation concerns weighted and nonweighted Sobolev interpolation
inequalities for vector fields. Inequalities of the Poincare-Sobolev type for
vector fields abound, but nothing much has been done in the direction of
interpolation inequalities. Work will also be done weighted restriction results
for the Fourier transform with weights in the Fefferman-Phong class and an
effort will be made to obtain a sharp covering lemma in n-dimensional Euclidean
space refining earlier results of Stein and Stromberg. The combination of
harmonic analysis and inequalities is used to provide precise background
information for practitioners in partial differential equations. The
inequalities developed give essential a priori information about solutions as
well as important estimates of their growth properties. ***
