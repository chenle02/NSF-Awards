NSF INCLUDES Planning Grants Project - Women in a Network of Discovery
(WIND)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This NSF INCLUDES planning grant is funded by NSF
Inclusion across the Nation of Communities of Learners of Underrepresented
Discoverers in Engineering and Science (NSF INCLUDES), a comprehensive national
initiative to enhance U.S. leadership in discoveries and innovations by focusing
on diversity, inclusion, and broadening participation in STEM at scale. The goal
of this planning grant is to increase the number of women engineers from
minority, low-income, and first-generation groups. The U.S. needs more women
engineers to contribute to economic and national security and strengthen
engineering research, commercialization, and product development through
inclusive innovation. The vibrancy of inclusive innovation will positively
impact academic, business, and national security
competitiveness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The WIND approach is research-based and
includes the Kettering Foundationâ€™s Learning Exchanges Model, which encourages
collaborative change within communities through the participation of all
stakeholders in visioning, asset mapping, and decision making. The planning
grant will be used to convene partners with a range of expertise and experience
to build a pathway to engineering for women in North Carolina, particularly
women from underrepresented groups. Initial partners include Alamance-Burlington
School System (K-12), Alamance Community College (Associate Degree), and Elon
University and North Carolina State University (Bachelor's Degree). The WIND
project exemplifies the partnerships element of collaborative infrastructure
building and efforts will be directed to developing a model and network that are
scalable to the state of North Carolina and the
Nation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
