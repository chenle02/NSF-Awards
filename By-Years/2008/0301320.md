Irreducible representations of the affine and double affine Hecke algebras of
type A

The aim of this project is to parameterize, construct, and describe the
irreducible modules of the affine and double affine Hecke algebras. The
investigator intends to extract combinatorial structure from the non-semisimple
representations of these algebras, a key example of which is the crystal graph
structure on the irreducible representations of the affine Hecke algebra of type
A. The representation theory of Hecke algebras has applications in many areas of
mathematics. Hecke algebras appear naturally in the representation theory of
semisimple p-adic groups and are also a tool in the study of the modular
representation theory of reductive groups over finite fields. They have intimate
connections to quantum groups, statistical mechanics, and knot theory. Double
affine Hecke algebras were defined by Cherednik and used by him to prove certain
conjectures of Macdonald. They have connections to harmonic analysis of
symmetric spaces and the classical theories of hypergeometric functions and
q-hypergeometric functions.

This is a project in representation theory, which is the study of symmetry.
Representation theory gives us the tools to solve problems about any system that
exhibits symmetry, and so has wide applications in chemistry, physics, computer
science, and even within other areas of mathematics. The investigator will study
the most basic objects whose symmetries are encoded in a structure called the
Hecke algebra. One of her primary methods is to "glue" these basic objects
together in such a way that their global controlling structure is apparent---
much in the same way that organizing the elements into the periodic table gives
us information about the shared chemical properties of halogens (or other
groups).
