This project is the operation of sensitive extremely low frequency and very low
frequency (ELF/VLF) receivers at Arrival Heights near McMurdo. This emplacement
is part of a large radiometer made up of eight identical receiver stations at
various sites around the world. The purpose of the radiometer is to study the
distribution of radio noise from 5Hz-30leHz. The major portion of the funding is
provided by the Office of Naval Research.
