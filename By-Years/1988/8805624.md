This work will pursue earlier findings by this laboratory on several heretofore
unknown chemical species of chlorophyll. These newly described chlorophylls
suggest different pathways for greening in higher plants. Now that the new
compounds have been described, the enzymes responsible for forming them will be
isolated and characterized. Then the regulation of the pathway and its enzymes
can be determined.%%% Chlorophyll catalyzes the conversion of solar energy to
chemical energy via the process of photosynthesis. Without photosynthesis,
organic life is not possible in the biosphere. It now appears that different Chl
chemical species have different functions in photosynthesis and are formed via
different biosynthetic routes. A full understanding of the biochemistry of the
various Chl chemical species is mandatory for a thorough understanding of
photosynthesis.***//
