This proposal seeks to describe and explain patterns of electronic media
selection and use in settings where individuals have access to two options,
voice messaging and electronic mail, as well as traditional communication
channels. The research will provide an improved understanding of the perceived
advantages and disadvantages (e.g., ease of learning vs. efficiency) of these
communication media and it will provide new insights into the ways in which
media selection affects the organizational setting. The project will develop a
model of choice between media alternatives and it will test this model in an
ambitious field investigation that will employ both quantitative and qualitative
methods to examine electronic media usage patterns at the individual,
departmental, and organizational levels of analysis. The three proposed
explanations for media choice behaviors (rational choice, critical mass, and
social influence) are considered to be of general interest, in terms of how
individuals and groups make choices among competing or complementary
alternatives, as well as of specific interest in the context of media-use
decisions.
