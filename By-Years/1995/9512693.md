This proposal calls for the development of a, "Femtosecond X- ray Source for
Probing Structural Dynamics of Materials on an Atomic Scale". The scientific
objective of this proposal is to develop a prototype tunable ultrafast x-ray
source generating 200 fs pulses with 106 photons per second in the 1A wavelength
regime. This new instrument will enable one to directly probe the structure of
materials on an atomic spatial dimension with ultrafast time resolution. The
ability to directly observe the movement of atoms associated with phase
transitions, coherent vibrational motion, chemical reactions, and surface
phenomena, will provide a fundamental new understanding of the mechanisms which
drive these processes.
