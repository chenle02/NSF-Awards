Drafting a Blueprint for Teaching Tomorrow's Engineers Today is a two-year MSP
Start-Partnership that is bringing together students, educators, and industry to
hold continued conversations in which partners discuss, define, discover, and
design a clear path that leads to an MSP Targeted Partnership. This partnership
will have three goals: 1) increase awareness about engineering by the 5,692
middle school (grades 6 - 8) students in the Springfield Public Schools (SPS);
2) improve the knowledge base of approximately 240 future and in-service middle
school teachers so that they will have the skills, materials, and enthusiasm to
excite their students about engineering; and 3) create a fluid and dynamic
engineering education pipeline where each level (industry, four year college
programs, two year college programs, K-12 schools) informs the preceding level
about the skill base needed to ensure success. The goal of this initial work is
a partnership that will leverage the expertise of all its participants,
connections, and experience to accelerate the development of methodologies and
techniques in STEM teaching, growing the pool of subject matter and expertise
available to all STEM teachers, thereby increasing the diversity of thought and
practice. Increased understanding of STEM concepts helps remove the fear factor
and allows students to achieve a comfort level characterized by curiosity and
creativity in these areas, inspiring them to continue to pursue STEM projects
and classes and make relevant connections between STEM concepts and the analysis
and solution of real world problems. Teachers will become an integral part of a
dynamic, supportive network of college faculty and business and industry
partners that will provide sustained support and be responsive to the changing
needs of both teachers and students.
