This project is centered on the further exploration of 2-methyleneoxetanes,
1,5-dioxa-spiro[3.2]hexanes, 4-oxaspiro[2.3]hexanes and
3-alkylidene-2-methyleneoxetanes, strained heterocycles with useful
reactivities. Improved access to a range of 3-alkylidene-2-methyleneoxetanes
will allow preliminary examination of the utility of these compounds as
inhibitors of fatty acid synthases. Initial studies have shown that novel,
oxetane-containing nucleosides, which may serve as anti-viral or anti-bacterial
agents, can be accessed with this methodology. In addition, a new,
mechanistically interesting approach to usefully functionalized tetrahydrofurans
will be investigated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and
Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor Amy R.
Howell of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Connecticut.
Professor Howell's research efforts revolve around exploiting unusual, strained
heterocycles as scaffolds for efficient organic synthesis. Such chemistry will
contribute to the preparation of novel, biologically interesting small molecules
and will have an impact on the pharmaceutical and agricultural sectors.
