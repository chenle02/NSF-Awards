The Project is intended to improve career access for American Indians into
technological fields by increasing the entrance and retention rate among
American Indian students with potential for science and engineering careers.
This proposal is being submitted for continuation of the mentoring project with
the three current university sites, and the expansion of the program to five
additional sites through the 1994-95 funding period. The project focuses on the
improvement, continuation and expansion of the "mentorship" model.
