ABSTRACT This work will monitor the deposition and growth of thin films onto a
surface at the molecular level using a novel microcalorimeter to measure the
energy release during deposition of the film. Besides the development of a
diagnostic tool and the fundamental measurement of energy release during
molecular-thickness thin-film deposition, the work may lead to a method for
control of industrial thin-film deposition.
