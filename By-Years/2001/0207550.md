Objectives and Significance: The turbo principle [27 ],namely,the strategy that
exploits the iterated exchange of soft information between di .erent blocks in a
communication receiver,has grown to be a powerful tool in attacking a diverse
set of problems in communications.In particular,the turbo multiuser detection
(MUD)paradigm [59 ]has attracted signi .cant recent attention as an e .ective
technique for joint decoding in multiuser communication systems.However to date
the performance of various turbo MUD schemes is largely demonstrated via
simulations,and the impact of turbo MUD on the network performance (e.g.,
throughput and delay)has not been explored systematically.It also remains
unclear at this time how the upper-layer functionalities (such as ARQ
protocol,power control,and admission control)should be designed to exploit the
physical-layer turbo MUD.The objective of the proposed project is to develop
analytical tools to assess and optimize the performance of various turbo MUD
methods,and to apply these esults to c oss-layer design in wireless networks.
Recently a technique known as density evolution [66,67 ]has been developed in
the coding community that permits analysis of iterative decoding algorithm for
in .nite-length codewords.In this proposal,under the density evolution
framework,we outline a research plan aimed at understanding of the design and
analysis of turbo multiuser detection for a variety of channel conditions and
receiver structures,and the design of some upper-layer functionalities which
takes into account the physical layer turbo MUD.While in this study we focus on
multiuser CDMA systems,the general principle is applicable to several
systems,such as space-time coding systems,OFDM systems,and intersymbol
interference systems.
