Investigating the properties of superfluid (sf) 3He in confined geometries, we
propose to continue studies of our recently discovered phase transition in thin
films. Additional work on sf 3He films thinner than 200> over a monolayer of 4He
will probe the two-dimensional regime. This research is designed to enhance our
understanding of quantum fluids, testing existing theories and providing data
that will lead to further improvements therein.
