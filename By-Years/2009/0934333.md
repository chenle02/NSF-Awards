Planning Grant for an I/UCRC for Wind Energy &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;0934321

James Madison University (JMU); Jonathan Miles&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The Center
for Wind Energy is aimed at enhancing national excellence in wind energy
research and development of direct relevance to the industry; and, developing a
cadre of diverse undergraduate and graduate students who will support and
eventually lead in the design, manufacture, installation, operation, and
maintenance of wind energy systems. The academic partners listed above are
collaborating to establish the proposed center, with UMA as the lead
institution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed Center is motivated by the
possibility of integrating engineering with ocean and atmospheric sciences to
support the development of systems with low cost of energy and high reliability.
The thrust areas include: oceanography and geology as it relates to preparing
wind turbine sites, turbine design, environmental effects, particularly impact
on flying wildlife, land use, and system management and integration into the
electrical grid. The proposed work has a very good focus on a well-defined area
that is of long-term importance to energy generation in the US. The
investigators have an excellent background, and will provide the needed
expertise to expand the use of wind power for electrical generation.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work by the proposed Center will make wind energy,
particularly off-shore wind energy, more competitive with energy from non-
renewable sources. The proposed Center would build on Amherst's wind research
program, consolidating all aspects of wind power into a single unit. The Center
plans to increase the diversity of participants in wind energy research and
industry. Since UMA is the lead institution for the Northeast Alliance for
Graduate Education and the Professoriate (NEAGEP), the NEAGEP infrastructure
will be available to the proposed I/UCRC. ODU has strong research and academic
ties with Hampton University and Norfolk State University, both designated as
HBCUs. The long standing collaborations with these universities will be
leveraged to promote the participation of minority students in wind energy
projects.
