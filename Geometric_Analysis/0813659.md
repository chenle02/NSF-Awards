Abstract

Award: DMS-0813659 Principal Investigator: Frederick Wilhelm

This award provides partial support for US participation in a Workshop in Global
Riemannian Geometry to be held at the Instituto de Matematicas (Unidad
Cuernavaca) Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (IMATE-UNAM Cuernavaca) in
May 2008. The meeting will consist of two mini-courses taught by Detlef Gromoll,
Gerard Walschap, and Karsten Grove, plus approximately eighteen research talks.
The conference will be preceded by an additional mini-course reviewing basic
Riemannian geometry to prepare student participants for the workshop.

The conference aims to disseminate knowledge of recent progress in Riemannian
geometry among junior participants, to promote the involvement of female and
minority researchers in the subject, to strengthen the presence of Riemannian
geometry in Mexico, and to encourage collaborations between geometric
researchers in Mexico, other countries of Latin America, the United States,
Canada, and Europe. The workshop is receiving support from the Clay Mathematical
Institute, CIMAT, CONACYT, the International Mathematics Union, and the IMATE-
UNAM, as well as NSF. The conference web site is
