Bohren/Abstract The objective of this research is an optical examination of
green thunderstorms using a spectral photometer to evalute two competing
theories about the transmission, absorption and scatting of (visible) light in
and near thunderstorms. The observations will ne made in Oklahoma during a
meteorologicalfield experiment (VORTEX) designed to investigate tornados.
