This project is a numerical study of the dynamics of large amplitude motion of
interfaces between two fluids. The scope of the study is twofold: to obtain
fundamental insight into the mechanisms of mixing due to interfacial
instabilities in two dimensions using already developed numerical methods, to
extend these investigations into three dimensions. The three- dimensional
simulations will address aspects of these problems currently unavailable.
Simulations, following the evolution of many competing and interacting
interfacial waves, will be conducted. The role of the controlling parameters
will be investigated, and the basic wave interaction mechanisms studied.
