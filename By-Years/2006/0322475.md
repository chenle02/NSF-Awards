The goal of this research is to develop fundamental theory and algorithms for
efficient and reliable data broadcast scheduling. Broadcast is an effective and
efficient means for information dissemination over many networks. It is becoming
more and more important with the increasing deployment of wireless local and
wide area networks. Scheduling of data items is crucial in maximizing the
efficiency of broadcast. This research will address a few fundamental and
important issues that have not been well studied, i.e. broadcast schedules that
can combat channel errors effectively, theory and schedule design for scheduling
over multiple channels, and, scheduling for streaming data. This project
presents an integration of theory and techniques of error correcting codes to
the broadcast scheduling problem, which no previous works on this topic have
applied. This research will exploit, and contribute towards, theoretical studies
in information and coding theory, probability analysis and combinatorics.
