This award will support a conference on three areas of Goro Azumaya's research:
Azumaya algebras, group actions, and modules. The conference will be held from
May 23 to May 27, 1990 at Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana. The main
purpose of the this conference is to bring together a useful intersection of
mathematicians from three areas of Azumaya's research in order to encourage and
to revitalize this historical intersection. The main speakers are Shimshon
Amitsur, Maurice Auslander, Susan Montgomery, Donald Passman, David Saltman, and
Richard Swan.
