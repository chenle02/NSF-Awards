A tandem repeat is an occurrence of two or more adjacent, often approximate
copies of a sequence of nucleotides. Tandem repeats have known functional roles,
including coding with loss of function, switching, and acting as modifiers of
gene expression. Tandem repeats are primary components of chromosomal
structures. They are useful for genetic linkage analysis, bacterial strain
typing, DNA fingerprinting and studies of changes in DNA over short time scales.

Identification of tandem repeats has been made easier by new software that
processes the entire genome. The rapid analysis permits identification and
annotation of repeats, clustering into families for further study. A multi-
genome Tandem Repeats Database will bring together information about repeats as
well as serving as the platform for development of new tools. These include
algorithms to compare and cluster repeats, as well as for identifying predictive
criteria for copy number polymorphisms. This will further enable annotation of
repeats and of repeat families, including genomic environment, copy number
polymorphisms, whole genome properties and family properties. All of this will
be available through a web site with integrated data visualization and data
model specification for transfer to other formats.
