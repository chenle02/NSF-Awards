A fundamental approach to studying any scientific phenomena is to compare
standard occurrences of that phenomena with its most extreme manifestations. For
instance, one cannot understand the fundamental nature of light by considering
only visible light. As the wavelength of light varies, we see a whole family of
possible behaviors with visible light in the center and with x-rays and radio
waves at extreme opposite positions on the wavelength spectrum. In this project,
the PI seeks to study modular forms, fundamental mathematical objects which
appear in multiple branches of mathematics. The PI aims to focus his study on a
newly discovered extremal instance of this object in an effort to deepen our
understanding of classical modular forms akin to how understanding x-rays and
radio waves allows us to deepen our understanding of visible light.

More precisely, the recent work of Andreatta, Iovita, and Pilloni has produced
extended eigenvarities which contain additional points sitting over
characteristic p weights. These additional points can be viewed as limits of
classical modular forms near the boundary of weight space. In this project, the
PI will make a systematic study of these extended eigenvarieties with a large
emphasis going towards studying their Iwasawa theory. Namely, he seeks to
associate to these characteristic p automorphic forms both Selmer groups and
p-adic L-functions, and to formulate a main conjecture relating these two
objects. Additionally, he aims to show that the integral structure given to the
extended eigenvariety around these characteristic p points allows for Iwasawa
theoretic information to flow back and forth between the characteristic 0 and
characteristic p world. For instance, he aims to deduce a characteristic p main
conjecture from the characteristic 0 main conjecture, and in good situations
show that these conjectures are actually equivalent.
