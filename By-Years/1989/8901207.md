Graduate student Cornejo proposes to study the tropical columnar cactus genus
Stenocereus using protein electrophoresis methods in order to reconstruct
species-level evolutionary relationships. Flies of the genus Drosophila and
species of yeast are associated with particular cactus species, and this cactus-
fly-yeast system has been the subject of previous ecological and evolutionary
study. Approximately 20 species of these cacti are distributed on both sides of
the Panamanian Ishthmus and through the Caribbean, and the group's biogeographic
history is in question. The proposed research on the evolutionary history of the
cacti will allow comparisons with those already known for the yeast and
Drosphila associated with the cactus. The proposed research will test important
hypotheses concerning the evolutionary and biogeographic history of the cacti,
and will open a new area of research on coevolutionary processes involving other
groups. Alternate hypotheses will be tested, and the results will hold interest
for a wide audience of botanists, biogeographers, and evolutionary biologists.
