This award is for renewed support for the Natural Hazards Research and
Applications Information Center at the University of Colorado in Boulder. The
Center monitors and disseminates hazards research information to multiple users
--administrators, practitioners, policy makers, and scientists. The Center
publishes and distributes the Natural Hazards Observer to over 9,000 subscribers
six times a year, and publishes monographs, working papers, bibliographies and
special publications. It holds an annual workshop involving users and producers
of hazards research, and it provides information on a day-to-day basis in
response to inquiries. The Center conducts modest research activities relating
to societal response to natural hazards and it supports researchers throughout
the nation as they carry out "quick response" studies of specific hazard events.
