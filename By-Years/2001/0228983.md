The volume of sequence data grows exponentially; its analysis is a comutational
challenge. The ability to analyze the data does not keep pace with production.
One of the central tasks it rapid sequence comparisons. Effective strategies
require algorithms that are better than linear on the size of the database in
order to address the problem. In order to get an idea of how efficient various
algorithms that index the database before comparing sequences are, a sensitive
study of their utility against the major sequence database will be performed,
considering exact and short mismatches. Indexing does improve performance so
there is a possibility of identifying better ways to do it. An interdisciplinary
graduate student is deeply involved in the work supported here.
