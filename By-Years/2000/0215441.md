EAR-0215441&lt;br/&gt;Catherine Constable&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI's request
funds to help support travel costs of conference participants to the 8th
symposium of Study of the Earth's Deep Interior, to be held in July, 2002 in
Lake Tahoe, California. The program this year will focus on the geophysical and
geochemical evolution of the Earth's deep interior and is focused mainly on the
Earth's core. This meeting will be an important venue for a diverse group of
researchers to integrate their ideas and develop a consistent picture on
questions such as the age of the inner core, the driving forces for the
geodynamo, the structure of the inner core, and the behavior of the
paleomagnetic fielding the distant past. The meeting format is well designed and
should stimulate discussion among conference attendees.
