A great variety of mathematical models involve multiple scales: an explicit
description of a system's microscopic properties is given, and a challenge is to
describe the effective behavior induced by it on much larger scales. In order to
predict the correct large-scale effective behavior theoretically, physicists
introduced the idea of "renormalization," a systematic technique for
implementing a progressive coarsening of the system of interest. The broad goal
of research supported by this award is to widen and strengthen the mathematical
understanding of this idea. The project provides research training opportunities
for graduate students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The past few years have seen great
progress on fundamental models that can be represented as partial differential
equations with random coefficients. In the present project, the investigator
plans to test the versatility and power of the methods developed there on new
classes of models, including Langevin dynamics and systems of particles in
interaction. The project will take inspiration from renormalization ideas to
study mean-field models with disordered interactions, such as spin
glasses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
