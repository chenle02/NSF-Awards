The research goal of this project is the development of a method for the design
of compliant mechanisms, systems which are composed partially or entirely of
elastic elements and which undergo large deflections. Traditionally, the area of
mechanisms design has been dominated by the mechanics of rigid body analysis and
synthesis. It is beginning to incorporate advantages of large displacement
elastic elements. However, formalized treatment of the design process for this
type of mechanism has been lacking. Heuristic means are often inadequate as
predictive tools for design, and trial and error prototyping as a design
approach can be prohibitive in cost. This research constitutes an effort to
develop a methodology for compliant mechanism design which will allow the
designer to create desired mechanisms systematically and economically. The
research comprises three phases of activity including a development phase, a
formulation phase, and an evaluation phase. In the first phase, the objective is
to develop a nomenclature or terminology, and kinematic concepts for compliant
mechanisms. Some work has already been done in this area and the intent is to
extend it. Specifically, the compliance number concept, which is related to the
number of mechanism degrees of freedom will be refined. Other parameters will be
defined as necessary. The formulation phase consists of two activities. The
first is an effort to categorize compliant mechanism synthesis types by
structure, function, or other criteria. The second activity attempts to
systematically establish rules and guidelines for design conceptualization of
compliant mechanisms. The third research phase is also a two part activity. The
first includes mathematical modeling, development of efficient numerical
algorithms, and use of computer simulation and optimization techniques in
arriving at design solutions for compliant mechanisms. The second part of the
evaluation phase consists of validation of prediction techniques, design
procedures and kinematic concepts through extensive prototyping and testing.
