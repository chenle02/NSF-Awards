The team will use a new facility, the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
Array (ALMA), to observe the cold gas inside galaxies. The team will study the
details of how stars form in the cold gas. These details will enable strong
tests of competing theories of star formation. Senior team members will mentor
junior members, including undergraduate students who have disabilities. The PI
will engage high school students from Ohio in hands-on, astronomy-themed
projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team will use ALMA's unrivaled angular
resolution, wavelength coverage and sensitivity to study the physical conditions
in the cold gas inside galaxies. Their goals are to (1) measure the variations
in volume densities to test theories that posit gas density as the main driver
of star formation; (2) make the first systematic measurements of the cloud-scale
structure, density, turbulence, and self-gravity of the gas in a representative
sample of galaxies; (3) model the life-cycle of star-forming clouds and
constrain the dominant cloud destruction mechanism; and (4) develop, refine, and
disseminate new methods to handle the complex data analysis.
