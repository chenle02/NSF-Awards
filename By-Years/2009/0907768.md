This proposal requests partial support for The Wabash Seminar, along with its
annual Miniconference. It is devoted to stimulation and dissemination of
significant contributions to Modern Analysis in the Midwest region. For about 40
years of operation, it has earned a national and international reputation for
its success, and has provided a unique opportunity and an excellent environment
for young researchers, visitors, postdocs and graduate students to meet
regularly and exchange ideas with leading experts in the fields.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Wabash Seminar and Miniconference series will bring
together functional analysts and their students in the Midwest region. This will
further contribute to fruitful interactions of experts working in different
areas of operator algebras and operator theory. During the past years the
seminar and the conference have attracted numerous faculty members, postdocs,
and Ph.D students from Indiana University, IUPUI, Purdue University, University
of Illinois, University of Cincinnati and Washington University at St Louis. The
Wabash Seminar series offers an excellent opportunity to the junior people to be
exposed to and to be informed of the latest major mathematical developments in
Modern Analysis. These contacts develop very often their mathematical taste and
could influence very beneficially the future directions of their
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
