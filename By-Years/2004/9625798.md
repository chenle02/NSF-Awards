9625798 This work seeks to integrate two numerical techniques for solution of
the neutral particle Boltzman equation. Variational nodal methods, which combine
a hybrid finite element treatment of the spatial variable with spherical
harmonics expansions in angle, will be used in conjuction with adaptive grid
techniques to form a powerful new approach to the simulation. Applications of
this technology are anticipated in radiation therapy, radiative heat transfer,
nuclear fission, and nuclear fusion.
