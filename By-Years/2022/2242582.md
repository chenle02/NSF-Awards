This project uses experimental methods to study how an individual’s social
connectedness affects the likelihood of that person securing employment. The
project is conducted in partnership with several large construction worksites
and seeks to unpack the reasons why less socially connected individuals tend to
have a harder time finding work. The project focuses on testing several
potential channels that have been proposed as important drivers of this
difference: (i) less socially connected workers have a harder time signaling
their ability to employers, (ii) employers may prefer to spend the workday with
employees for whom they have a social connection already, (iii) employers may be
better able to hold socially connected workers accountable in the long run, (iv)
employers may prefer to provide the benefits of employment to those they are
connected to, or (v) social connectedness is actually an accurate predictor of
underlying productivity. The results of this project will provide inputs into
policies to promote equal access to employment and increase the efficiency of
the labor market. This will improve labor allocation, labor productivity, and
economic growth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Five hypotheses have been put forth to
explain why employers hire from their social networks and how this affects group
productivity: (i) signal ability to employers; (ii) employer preference for
people in their network, (iii) accountability and better monitoring, (iv)
personal favor, and (v) social network may be an indicator of worker
productivity. This research tests each of these potential mechanisms by varying
the information employers have about worker’s productivity, financial incentives
associated with employee productivity, and the extent of monitoring capability
employers have over employees. The research measures worker productivity before
treatment and then again during and after the treatment. The PIs will construct
a measure productivity that captures detailed information about the tasks
completed by the worker each day. Finally, the PIs will track workers over time
to see how hiring patterns change for workers depending on the treatment they
received during the experimental phase. Combined, these pieces of information
allow the PIs to disentangle which of these channels explains the cross-
sectional variation in employment rates. The results of this project will
provide inputs into policies to promote equal access to employment and increase
the efficiency of the labor market, improve labor allocation, labor
productivity, and economic growth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
