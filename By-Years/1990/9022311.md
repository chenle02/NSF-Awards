The U.S. Joint Global Ocean Flux Study is proposing an inquiry into the cycling
of carbon and other bioactive elements in the central Equatorial Pacific Ocean.
With respect to the upper water column, key objectives include (1) understanding
controls on primary production, which appears anomalously low study given the
high nutrient concentrations present in the waters; (2) understanding new
production in terms of limitations on phytoplankton growth and pathways of
carbon cycling within the ecosystems; and (3) studying changes in fluxes and
ecodynamics resulting from seasonal and interannual changes in physical forcing.
This project will measure net and gross O2 production at 2o N, Oo, and 2o S
during cruises in fall, 1991 and spring, 1992. Net production from the change of
Ä±O2! will be measured in samples incubated for 24 hours. Gross production by
spiking will also be measured in seawater samples with H218O and measuring the
production rate of 18O - labelled O2.
