EAR/0106924&lt;br/&gt;Jordan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COLLABORATION FOR EARTHQUAKE
RESEARCH&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Southern California, in
collaboration with the California Institute of Technology, Columbia University,
Harvard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, San Diego State
University, Stanford University, United States Geological Survey, Golden, United
States Geological Survey, Menlo Park, United States Geological Survey, Pasadena,
University of California, Los Angeles, University of California, San Diego,
University of California, Santa Barbara, and University of Nevada, Reno form the
core of the newly organized Southern California Earthquake Center. Other
academic institutes and private corporations participate as associate members in
research projects. The Center is a regionally focused organization with the
mission to gather new information about earthquakes in southern California,
integrate knowledge into a comprehensive and predictive understanding of
earthquake phenomena, and communicate this understanding to engineers, emergency
managers, government officials, and the general public. It does this through the
application of research findings from the various disciplines in earthquake-
related science and engineering. Extensive data bases are being developed
including seismicity, strong motion and geodetic data that are available to all
users both within and outside the center through remote access such as the
Internet. The Center leads a consortium of university and government scientists
in development of a fixed array of Global Positioning System stations to monitor
crustal distortion in southern California. The Center brings together scientists
from core and participating institutions, a visiting scientist program, the U.S.
Geological Survey, and the user community. It is also a highly effective
intellectual training ground for undergraduate students, graduate students, and
post-doctoral fellows. Earthquake hazard mitigation is also done through public
information and education programs, museum displays, and the training of
teachers and K-12 students. The center is led by Professor Thomas H. Jordan as
Principal Investigator/Center Director and Professor Thomas L. Henyey as Deputy
Director.&lt;br/&gt;*** &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
