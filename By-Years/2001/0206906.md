Strong electrostatic double layers have been observed in the downward current
region of the auroral zone. These double layers are found in close proximity to
regions of intense plasma turbulence associated with electron phase-space holes.
This project will develop a new two-dimensional Vlasov simulation code with open
boundary conditions that will be suitable for studying the complex plasma
processes that take place in the auroral downward current region. Among the
topics that will be examined using the new code are: (a) the processes
responsible for the structure of phase space holes in the direction
perpendicular to the magnetic field, (b) the source mechanism for very low
frequency (VLF) "saucer" emissions, (c) transverse ion acceleration, (d) the
relation of double layers and phase space holes to large scales electrostatic
shocks, and (e) the role of velocity shears in transverse. The results of the
simulations will be compared with data from the FAST satellite.
