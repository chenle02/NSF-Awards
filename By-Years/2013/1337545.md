Technical Descrition:&lt;br/&gt;This award from the National Science Foundation
is for the acquisition of an electrospinning system for cutting-edge research in
nanofibers. It will be used by faculty from the Mechanical Engineering,
Chemistry, Material Science, and Biology departments at Georgia Southern
University in a wide variety of research projects, from generating new avenues
for cancer therapeutics, biocompatible nanofibers, lightweight ultra-tough
hybrid fibers, multifunctional materials to antimicrobial coatings and compounds
with extraordinary thermal, mechanical and biological properties, to name just a
few. The acquisition of the electrospinning system will greatly enhance the
emerging group of nanotechnology researchers at Georgia Southern University and
southeast Georgia. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical
Description:&lt;br/&gt;This award from the National Science Foundation is for
the acquisition of an electrospinning system for cutting-edge research in
nanofibers. The instrument will be an important resource for rural southeast
Georgia, strengthening the already existing ties with Armstrong Atlantic
University, South University, and Savannah State University, as well as
industry, and establishing new partnerships. Undergraduate and graduate students
throughout southeast Georgia will benefit from exposure to research and courses
on nanofiber- and nanotechnology that otherwise does not exist in this form in
this region, providing hands-on, real-life experiences and preparing them for
their careers. To strengthen the science, technology, engineering, and
mathematics (STEM) pipeline, the PIs will develop a professional development
workshop for high school teachers in rural southeast GA sponsored by an industry
partner, Solvay Specialty Polymers (Alpharetta, GA).
