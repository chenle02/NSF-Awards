Through this project, the institution was able to purchase an FT- NMR
spectrometer to use as a laboratory tool for the structure identification of
organic compounds. Most of the compounds are synthesized by students in one of
several organic and polymer chemistry laboratory courses offered in the
department. In this project, a variety of experiments were carefully chosen to
enable the students to gain an appreciation and understanding of the instrument
as a spectroscopic tool for structural analysis. These include (a) analysis of
polymer tacticity, (b) residual monomer and microstructural product analysis of
polymers synthesized by ring-opening and ring-closing polymerizations, (c)
simplification of spectra of some amides and alcohols by use of chiral/non-
chiral lanthanide shift reagents and by deuterium exchange of acidic protons,
(d) demonstration of rotameric transformation in amides by variable temperature
NMR, and (e) general utility in synthetic organic chemistry. The instrument has
also been useful in several student research projects in progress at the
department. The instrument improved the quality and effectiveness of teaching in
relevant lab- associated courses and better prepared the students for advanced
careers in chemistry. The institution contributed to this project in an amount
equal to the NSF funds.
