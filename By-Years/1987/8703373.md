The area of research is in the tools and methods for performance measurement and
analysis of parallel and distributed programs. The research is based on two main
principles. The first principle is that programmers should be supplied with the
maximum information about their program. This information should be available
from all levels of abstraction. To prevent the programmer from being inundate
with irrelevant details, there must a logical and intuitive organization to this
data. The second principle is that programmers should be supplied with answers,
not numbers. The performance tool should be able to guide the programmer to the
location of the performance problem, and describe the problem in terms of the
source program. The current research is in techniques for automatically guiding
the programmer to performance problems. The techniques for identifying critical
resource utilization, determining interaction and scheduling affects, and
detecting program time phase behavior will be explored. The investigators will
include user interface issues to relate performance results and measurement
specification to the program source code. The combination of these techniques
will provide programmers with information needed to more easily make significant
improvements in their programs.
