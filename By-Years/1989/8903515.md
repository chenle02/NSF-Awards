Dr. Taparowsky's long term goal is to understand the biochemical pathways
through which programs of cell proliferation, differentiation and transformation
are regulated during development. As a first step toward this goal, she has
investigated how the expression of an activated ras oncogene disrupts the
differentiation of cultured myoblasts and have correlated the inability of ras
cells to differentiate with the down-regulation of the myogenic regulatory gene,
MyoD1. Interestingly, she has demonstrated that other inhibitors of myogenesis
in culture, such as FGF and TGF-beta, also negatively affect transcription of
the MyoD1 gene. To investigate the intracellular mechanisms that mediate the
myogenic program, she proposes to examine if changes in phosphatidylinositol
metabolism or protein kinase C activity are associated with ras expression or
TGF-beta or FGF treatment in myoblasts. In addition, she has cloned the rat
MyoD1 gene and propose to use this gene to map the cis-acting elements that
regulate the transcription of the MyoD1 gene in normal and differentiation
defective myoblasts. %%% The development of embryonic cells into distinct cell
types, such as muscle cells, requires an as yet not well understood balance
between cell division and differentiation. This project investigates at the
molecular level the interaction of a gene involved in transformation to a state
characterized by a high rate of cell division and a gene that targets a cell to
differentiate into muscle cells.
