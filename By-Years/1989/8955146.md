This 40-month project provides courses and internship activities for teachers
of science who have a minimal background in the science they are teaching. The
project will teach content, develop hands-on laboratory activities and provide
an internship experience to follow up on the coursework to assure the
implementation of new approaches in the classroom. The target schools have a
large minority population (60% Black, Hispanic, Asian, Filipino, Pacific
Islanders) and have not been traditionally strong in the sciences. In addition
to basic science courses, advanced, or enrichment, courses will be offered to
those who reach the appropriate level of preparation. A total of 252 teachers
will be involved in the project over its three year duration. The project will
be advised by a Planning Committee which consists of teachers, school
administrators, local representatives of business and industry, and University
personnel. Design teams will be chosen from the schools to aid in the
development of the course curriculum. The NSF portion of the total project cost
is $792,688 matched by $191,569 of institutional support. Thus the cost share is
approximately 24%.
