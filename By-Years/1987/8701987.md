One of the most striking properties of the pigmented bacterium Serratia
marcescens is the phenomenon of color instability. Different strains differ
greatly both in color and in the frequency with which they produce color
variants. Within a strain, the variations occur at constant rates and are
reversible. The high degree of genetic instability is reminiscent of DNA
rearrangements such as transpositions, deletions or inversions which are found
to occur during various biological processes. During an investigation of this
phenomenon Dr. Harshey observed that variation of a 39 kilodalton protein in S.
marcescens strain 274, is closely associated with color variation. Using
antibodies to this protein she identified it as being the bacterial flagellin.
Neither color nor flagellin are produced at temperatures above 37 oC. Thus,
pigment synthesis and flagellin synthesis appear to be co-regulated. We propose
to isolate and characterize the gene(s) for Serratia flagellin.
