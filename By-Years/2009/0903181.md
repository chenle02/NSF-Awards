Three community colleges are collaborating with an area four-year college to
educate and prepare students from low-income and underrepresented communities to
compete for the many documented high-tech, high-paying information technology
(IT) jobs. This goal is achieved by accomplishing the following objectives: (1)
Increasing recruitment of students from local communities into associate and
undergraduate programs in computer networking; (2) Increasing collaboration with
industry and governmental agencies through capstone projects, internships and
workshops; and (3) Integrating industry standard simulation tools into the
networking curriculum to improve the quality and scope of the education
provided.

Expected outcomes of this project are: (1) Increasing the overall recruitment of
students into computer networking programs at each participating institution by
10% each year, and the number of women students in all participating
institutions by at least 10 (double the current total) within a three year
period; (2) Developing 15 capstone projects in collaboration with industry and
governmental agencies; (3) Placing a minimum of 50 students into summer
internship positions in industry and governmental agencies; (4) Increasing the
number of students being placed into IT jobs by 10% each year; (5) Attaining 80%
student satisfaction with the use of simulation tools in networking courses; and
(6) Highlighting three employer sponsored networking capstone projects using
simulation tools each year at the capstone festival.
