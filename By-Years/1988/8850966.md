The Rutgers/Industry Program for Teachers of Modern Biology is designed to
modernize and deepen the biology background of 90 well-prepared high school
teachers nationwide over three years, and to provide them with teaching
materials (modules) representative of topics of modern scientific and
technological interest. The program will consist of three main activities: (i)
module development and revision: during this time teachers and scientists will
work together to develop and revise modules on topics of scientific and
technological interest for general distribution throughout the country. These
revisions will be based on suggestions made by the teachers involved in all
three of the program's activities. (ii) a leadership institute: here, biology
teachers will study the modules with the assistance of lead teachers and
faculty, attend seminars developed by university and industry scientists and
consider alternative teaching strategies; and (iii) a summer program; here, the
lead teachers will use the modules with a group of high school girls. An
essential component of the program is the establishment of an academic/industry
relationship and a support system consisting ofmeetings, a newsletter and a
computer network. An amount equivalent to nearly 30% of the NSF award is being
contributed by Rutgers University and other sources.
