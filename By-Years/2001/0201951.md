0201951 Keaveny Under this Investigator Initiated Award, the investigators will
test the theory that cells adapt in a mechanically integrative fashion to become
tuned to their mechanical environment. The overall hypothesis is that a cell
loaded habitually by high stresses will behave in a stiffer fashion than one
loaded by low stresses, but that the cell deformation would be similar for both.
The overall hypothesis will be tested by addressing three objectives: 1) develop
a technique to measure the force deformation characteristics of whole cells
using a modified atomic force microscope and provide a detailed description of
the whole cell behavior for various loading conditions; 2) develop constitutive
mathematical models of the cell using both phenomenological and micromechanical
approaches; and 3) determine the effects of loading history on the mechanical
behavior of both osteoblasts and osteocytes, with a focus on mechanical loading
that result from both fluid flow (constant versus pulsatile) and bone matrix
deformation. Results of the studies will contribute to the advancement of bone
adaptation computational models and design of tissue-engineered bone
substitutes.
