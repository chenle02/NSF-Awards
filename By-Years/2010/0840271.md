This planning grant award addresses the subject of cosmology using contemporary
film technology. A screen play and film prototype will take viewers from the
historical Big Bang phenomena to contemporary thinking on dark energy and
matter. STEM disciplines incorporated within this project are mathematics,
physics, biology, chemistry and geology, in addition to astronomy.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An additional significant issue in this award will be the
effort to form a network of dome and planetarium theaters. Such an organization
could facilitate promotion and evaluation of this project and future projects.
In the future, the network will be positioned to assess the differences in
educational impact from large format flat screen, large format dome screen and
planetarium dome presentations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collaborations on this
project include The Reuben H. Fleet Science Center, the Mathematics Science
Research Institute, and advisors George Smoot and Saul Perlmutter of the
Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. Barbara Flagg is the project evaluator.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Specific needs for the planning grant are to:
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. gather formative evaluation on audience parameters;
&lt;br/&gt;2. develop a short prototype film and a first draft of the screen
play; &lt;br/&gt;3. complete the advisory team;&lt;br/&gt;4. translate the
deliverables into Spanish language; &lt;br/&gt;5. evaluate and bid the computer
animation facilities; and &lt;br/&gt;5. identify a network of dome and
planetarium theaters for their evaluation.&lt;br/&gt;
