RNA viruses include significant pathogens of plants and animals. Pathogenesis of
these viruses requires the replication of the viral genome, which is predicated
upon specific recognition of portions of the viral RNA (RNA promoters) and the
multi-subunit enzyme complex, the replicase. Analysis of the specificity in this
interaction would benefit tremendously from knowledge of the structures of the
RNA motifs and the protein enzymes. While the structures of a number of viral
replication proteins have been solved, knowledge of the viral RNA promoters is
limited. In fact, the high-resolution structure of only one RNA promoter has
been reported. This research focuses on the structure and function of RNA
promoters of Brome mosaic virus (BMV), with the goal of solving the high-
resolution structures of all of the promoters. Furthermore, the structure of a
promoter from Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) will be solved to allow comparison of
the recognition motifs used by two related RNA viruses. Effort will also be made
to identify additional RNA sequences/structures that bind to the BMV replicase.
Anticipated results from this research will deepen our basic understanding of
RNA-dependent RNA synthesis and will identify novel targets that can be
manipulated to limit viral infections. This research is a collaboration between
researchers at California State University at Hayward, an undergraduate and
masters institution, and Texas A&amp;M University. At CSU-Hayward, a talented
team of undergraduates and masters students will participate in the research and
thus learn concepts and techniques at the interface of biology and structural
studies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A more thorough understanding of the replication
of RNA plant viruses will not only add to our basic knowledge of nature but also
help us devise ways to control plant diseases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
