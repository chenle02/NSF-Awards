The most widely used parallel languages require users to worry about mundane
details. High performance programs written in these languages unnecessarily
require both algorithmic and architecture expertise interposed in the same
program text. This lack of separation overly complicates programs. Furthermore,
the programmers have to explicitly, or implicitly, choose a data and computation
distribution. This reduces the compatibility, malleability, portability, and
maintainability of the optimized programs. This research addresses how
programmers can express parallelism in computation by directly allowing experts
to create reusable software constructs or "bricks."

The research explores the PetaBricks compositional language, in which automatic
parallelism extraction and locality recognition will become tractable. The major
task is the building of the compiler to map the algorithmic parallelism and
locality to near optimal utilization of the resources.

The language will be composed of base cases and compositions. They can be
composed recursively to solve large problems. The ordering and granularity of
these compositions will be managed by the compiler and runtime framework to
allow programs to adapt. The research introduces Patlo: a pattern transformation
language for optimization where domain experts can program patterns and
corresponding transformations for algorithm-specific and architecture-specific
optimizations.
