This award provides partial funding for the support of a research technician
for a period of three year. The technician will be working in the isotope
geochemistry facility in the Department of Earth Sciences at the University of
California in Santa Cruz. The technician will support the work of five senior
researchers and their graduate students in common-access laboratories. The
primary instrumentation is a multi-collector, high mass resolution mass
spectrometer. The group's research focuses on the chemical evolution of the
Earth's crust and mantle from earliest pre-Cambrian time to the present, using
isotopic analysis for dating processes and tracing mass transfers.
