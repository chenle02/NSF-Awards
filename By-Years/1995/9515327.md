Typical research on violence is concerned with identifying the characteristics
and predictors of why certain people are more disposed to violence than others.
However, these studies do not address the specific conditions that channel such
dispositions into violent events. This study addresses this gap in violence
research through examining the situational contexts in which violence events
occur and the interactive social processes or exchanges that lead to criminal
violence. Analyses will be conducted of the process by which a decision is made
to commit a gun-related crime in order to better understand the use of guns by
young males. This project includes interviews with 80 respondents from three New
York City (South Bronx) and East New York (Brooklyn) neighborhoods with high
rates of homicide among young males 16-22 years of age. Samples include young
males recently released on weapons charges and males from the neighborhood (who
have used guns or been victims of gun assaults but were not involved in the
criminal justice system). Interviews with respondents will examine the dynamics
of gun events, including reconstruction of dialogues of events which culminated
in gunshots, and the aftermath of these events. This research will contribute to
the development of a framework for analyzing the process of events that lead to
acts of gun violence with implications for the development of frameworks to
study patterns of interaction that lead to other forms of interpersonal
violence. This framework represents a distinct departure from commonly used
deterministic models and can be extended and modified to examine different
selection processes involved in violent events.
