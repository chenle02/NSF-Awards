Abstract ATM-9312667 Akasofu The second International Conference on Substorms
(ICS-2) is proposed to be held in Fairbanks March 7-11, 1994, partially in
celebrating the 30-year anniversary of the birth of the discipline and that
ICS-3 be held in France in 1996. It is one of the major intents of ICS to bring
in young researchers to the discipline of magnetospheric substorms. They, it was
agreed that special efforts be made to encourage graduate students to
participate in it. The study of magnetospheric stbstroms has now become well
established as one of the major disciplines in space plasma physics,
magnetospheric physics and solar-terrestrial physics. It includes practically a
study of all fundamental processes in the magnetosphere-ionosphere system
similar processes may be found in solar flares, the magnetized planets and even
in comets. The first ICS (ICS-1) was held in Kiruna, Sweden, on March, 1992. It
was attended by about 150 researchers and was a great success as can be judged
from the excellent Proceedings produced promptly by the organizers. In order for
every attendant to hear talks by the others, there was no parallel session. (The
program was attached in Appendix II). ***
