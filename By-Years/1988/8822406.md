The PI will build and model the performance of power microwave (Al,Ga) As/GaAs
heterojunction bipolar transistors. He will attempt to obtain considerable power
at X band frequencies. He will try various methods of improving device
reliability with attention to thermal management. He will collaborate with
Rockwell International Science Center for detailed power measurements and
transistor reliability studies.
