This project will study the types of alignments in products formed from
photodissociation. Photodissociation is the simplest among various processes
(e.g., photodissociation, chemical reaction, inelastic scattering, surface
desorption) which have a common characteristic: a transition complex which
dissociates to fragments. Therefore, the planned experiments on
photodissociation will provide information for all these processes.
