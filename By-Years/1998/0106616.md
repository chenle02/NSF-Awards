INT 0106616 Szumowski

This is a U.S.-Polish collaborative research project to support the
participation of Polish scientists in DYCOMS-11 (Dynamics and Chemistry of
Marine Stratocumulus) scheduled for July 2001. The principal investigator,
Marcin Szumowski, is from the University of Nevada Desert Research Institute.
His Polish collaborators, Szymon Malinowski and Krzysztof Haman, are from the
Institute of Geophysics at Warsaw University.

The researchers will use a suite of high-frequency instruments developed in the
last decade to simultaneously measure the temperature, cloud liquid water
content, and microphysical structure within the cloud. This suite of instruments
has never been used simultaneously before and has the potential to create an
unprecedented robust data set characterizing the entrainment process and its
effects on cloud microphysical evolution with very fine spatial resolution.

This project in atmospheric sciences research fulfills the program objectives of
bringing together leading experts in the U.S. and Central/Eastern Europe to
combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual
interest and competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of
benefit.
