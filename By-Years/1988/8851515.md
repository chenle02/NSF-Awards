An optical laboratory will be assembled that will illustrate many important
concepts in optics, allow testing of the theories developed in courses, and
provide crucial experimental techniques for probing condensed matter systems.
All Wooster students are required to perform a year-long research project in
their senior year. An extended investigation allows students to integrate
material from a variety of courses and labs and provides an essential example of
their profession. This grant will allow a new technique to be available for
student research - laser light scattering. By providing a series of optics
experiments in modern physics and junior independent study, the students will be
able to use static and dynamic light scattering as a probe of many physical
systems currently of interest to the scientific community. The acquisition of a
5 W Argon ion laser, a vibration isolated optics table, laser amplitude
stabilizer and several optical components will allow our undergraduates to
investigate fundamental molecular processes and to do holography in laboratory
courses and in senior independent study projects. The College of Wooster will
match the NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.
