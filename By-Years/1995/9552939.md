9552939 Snow The University of South Florida (Tampa)will initiate a 4-week,
commuter Young Scholars project to serve 48 young women entering the seventh and
eighth grades during the summers of 1996 and 1997. The disciplinary focus will
be on earth and life sciences with an emphasis on how the plants, animals,
water, and soil interact in three diverse Florida ecosystems: coastal/estuary,
freshwater wetland, and upland/sandhill. Students will develop questions and,
with guidance, gather and analyze data to answer their questions. Field trips
will focus on environmental policy and ethics, while faculty and guest leaders
emphasize career options and build participants scientific interest, knowledge,
and self-confidence.
