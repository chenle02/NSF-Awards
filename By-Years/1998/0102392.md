DMS-0102392 - Abstract Fangyang Zheng

This award provides partial support for active research mathematicians with
limited means of support to attend and participate in the Conference on geometry
in dimension 3 and 4 to be held at the Columbus campus of the Ohio State
Univeristy during Spring 2002.

The list of main speakers includes Gregory Margulis (Yale), John Morgan
(Columbia), Rick Schoen (Stanford), Cliff Taubes (Harvard) and S-T. Yau
(Harvard). The conference will be scheduled for a 3 day weekend, most likely in
late March of 2002. The schedule will be arranged so that there will be plenty
of time for discussions between all the participants. The full program will
appear soon in posters as well as in the web page:
