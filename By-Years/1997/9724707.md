The objective of the proposed research is to adapt embedding methods for
modeling nonlinear time-series developed by the academic community for their
routine use in engineering problems. The specific methods to be employed are
based of those developed to model chaotic nonlinear systems. These methods will
be adapted so that they can handle nonlinear systems describing input/output
data from industrial devices under test. Specifically, current modeling methods
developed for automonous systems will be extended to handle systems driven by
mixed signals. Input/output systems are fundamental to engineering and
industrial applications. Currently, the majority of input/output modeling
techniques are designed for linear systems and provide the basis for a wide
range of test equipment (spectrum, signal, and network analyzers) and an
engineering methodology at the heart of our modern technology based society.
However, industrial systems and devices typically exhibit nonlinear behavior
when stressed, and industry has a continual need for methods that work when
devices are pushed beyond their original design envelope. Therefore, the
proposed research will address the generic industrial needs for improved
modeling and diagnostics of nonlinear devices based on the latest research from
nonlinear dynamics, dynamical systems theory, and nonlinear time-series
analysis.
