This project includes both experimental and modeling studies to investigate
processes that occur during the formation and aging of small particles in the
atmosphere. Small organic particles can separate into liquid phases that then
can change the subsequent chemistry of the atmosphere. Experiments will be
conducted to study how particle properties such as size, shape, and composition
affect particle phase separation. Models will be used to study the impacts these
particles have on the atmosphere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hypothesis of the
project is that the liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) process is governed by
the molecular composition of the particle and the particle size. This hypothesis
will be tested using secondary organic aerosol (SOA) produced from the dark
ozonolysis of alpha-pined and the photooxidation of 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene in a
flow reactor. Particles will be collected, and their morphology will be analyzed
by cryotransmission electron microscopy. The research questions that will be
addressed by the proposal are the following: (1) What particle-level parameters
(O:C, organic:sulfate ratio, size, etc.) determine particle morphology? (2) How
does the morphology of aerosol particles evolve in time? Specifically, how do
the size of particles and aging influence particle morphology? and (3) What is
the impact of aerosol morphology on aerosol processes such as heterogeneous N2O5
hydrolysis? A particle-resolved modeling framework will make use of the
experimental results and integrate them to quantify the relevance of the
findings for atmospheric chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
