Insect flight is a complex system comprised of multiple interacting elements.
Despite recent progress in understanding the underlying unsteady aerodynamics,
which are notably different from conventional aerodynamics, relatively little is
known about how insects execute flight maneuvers and far less is known about the
main mechanisms that determine the diverse behaviors seen in natural flight. We
propose an integrated approach to the study of insect flight that incorporates
high resolution kinematics of freely flying insects, aerodynamic analysis of
wing and body motions, and dynamical systems analysis of these data that will
lead to reduced order models. Specifically, we propose three high risk pilot
studies: 1) develop automated tracking techniques for 3D flight data that will
be essential for aerodynamic and statistical analysis of cross-species
comparison of free flight behaviors, 2) provide for the first time a direct
connection between the internal muscles to the external observables in free
flight through aerodynamics analysis and direct measurements, and 3) perform
novel mathematical analysis of stability of free flight and build tools for
constructing data-driven reduced order models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We expect
that this unprecedented integration of large experimental data sets and
numerical analyses will transform research on insect flight. Our work will
provide new tools to investigate fundamental issues relating to efficiency,
stability, and control in animal locomotion. The techniques, algorithms and
routines we develop will be distributed and made available to the research
community through our web sites. The PI's will continue with their outreach
activities which include: giving public lectures, providing K-12 teaching
support, and organizing workshops. &lt;br/&gt;
