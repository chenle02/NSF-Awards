This project will supply shipboard scientific support equipment for the research
vessel CONRAD, operated by the Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory of Columbia
University and dedicated to use in support of ocean science research. The
Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program provides funds for ship equipment
deemed essential to the proper and safe conduct of ocean science research. This
Program provides support for such items as deck equipment including winch
systems for the deployment and retrieval of scientific instruments, navigational
equipment such as radars, gyroscopes and earth satellite receivers to pin point
the location of research sites, communication equipment including radio
transceivers and satellite transceivers for voice and scientific data
communications and other equipment such as motorized workboats for transporting
scientists to and from data retrieval sites. The Project Directors, Robert D.
Gerard and Dennis E. Hayes are fully qualified to direct this project having had
considerable experience in overseeing the acquisition and installation of
shipboard equipment. This project will allow the institution to increase the
hydro winch's speed for improve wire handling, acquire radar replacement parts,
two VHF radios, and a digital scale for safe loading of scientific equipment. It
will also improve safety through the installation of liferaft floodlights and
reflectors.
