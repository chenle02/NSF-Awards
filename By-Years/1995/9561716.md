This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate
an ultra high-precision position sensing system, intended for next generation
microelectronics production. Before a product prototype of this system can be
developed, which is suitable for rigorous use in commercial manufacturing,
design issues related to reliability, high speed capability, and
manufacturability must be solved. The new system uses scanning probe microscope
(SPM) technology and some reference scale such as a synthetic grating or an
atomic layer of crystal. This unique combination, together with synchronized
signal detection, is an innovation in the area of ultra high precision position
sensing, which is basic to high precision positioning systems (XY stage control)
in microelectronics manufacturing. Subnanometer precision (repeatability) has
been demonstrated both in the height and lateral direction. Phase I will study
the system design which fully utilizes the integrated micromachined sensor probe
and actuator, establishing a dynamic model. Three areas of application are
anticipated in commercial microelectronics manufacturing: 1)steppers,
electron/ion beam lithography systems, mask aligners, and inspection systems for
X-ray lithography; 2)inspection and manufacturing systems of high-precision
X-ray optics and other high precision machining systems; and 3)servo writer
control systems for computer hard disk and optical disk mass memory.
