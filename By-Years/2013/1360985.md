In this project funded by the Chemical Catalysis program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor William Jones of the University of Rochester is examining
new reactions that can be used to make organic compounds of interest in biology
and the pharmaceutical industry. To accomplish this, fundamental reactions of
transition metal catalysts are being examined that can be used to form
heterocycles from readily available, inexpensive starting materials. Professor
Jones is also examining new catalysts that can break open heterocycles and allow
their structures to be altered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this
work include outreach to high school students to attract interest to careers in
STEM related fields, as well as the development of new processes for routes to
intermediates of pharmaceutical importance. The combination of a detailed
physical-organometallic background combined with an understanding of how to
apply modern computational methods to these problems produces extremely well
trained scientists for the US chemical industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One
specific goal of this project is to examine fundamental aspects of
cyclometallation via the "Concerted Metallation-Deprotonation" pathway that is
now popular in organic synthetic methodology to produce heterocycles. These
cyclometallation studies are revealing fundamental aspects of how these
molecules effect the chemical transformations, and are providing insight into
the control of the selectivity that is critical to formation of the desired
product. A second goal is to develop uses for the now commonly observed
transition metal based carbon-sulfur bond cleavage sulfur-containing molecules.
One application involves anchoring a reversible carbon-sulfur activation
catalyst to a solid support that allows this material to act as a "sulfur
sponge," thereby permitting the cleanup of hydrocarbon fuels prior to
combustion.
