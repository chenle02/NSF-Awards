This work is directed toward understanding the kinetics and mechanisms of
heterogeneous selective oxidation of cycle alkenes and of oxygen-addition
reactions and selective oxidation of linear alkenes on selected metal surfaces,
principally silver. It includes the identification of reaction products and
determination of reaction selectivity under oxygen-rich and oxygen-lean
conditions; the determination of the rate-determining step in the formation of
each product, and of the activation energy and preexponential factor for each
such steps; the identification of reaction intermediates, and the clarification
of the details of the elementary bond-breaking and bond-forming processes
leading from reactant to product. The study employs a combination of ultrahigh-
vacuum techniques including temperature-programmed reaction spectroscopy and
vibrational spectroscopy; in some cases, synchrotron radiation techniques are
used to assist in the determination of adsorbate geometries. The systems under
study form the basis of a number of commodity and specialty chemical processes
in which selectivity and minimization of deleterious byproducts are crucial to
commercial success. This work should provide valuable guidance for design
improvements and control in these processes.
