The principal investigator will use a robust numerical technique based on the
powerful mountain pass lemma to find multiple solutions of semilinear elliptic
boundary value problems and in particular to find those solutions which are not
local minima. A deeper theoretical understanding of the method and further
expansion of the horizon of its applicability will be pursued. Solution
structure is strongly dependent on the spatial dimension and the geometry of the
domain. The existence and stability of steady state solutions in the case where
multiple solutions exist is extremely delicate and important in most physical
situations.
