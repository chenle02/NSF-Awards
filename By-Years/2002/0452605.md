The goal of this project is to improve our understanding of behavioral responses
to taxation. The ultimate aim is to develop better tax policies using a better
understanding of how people respond to specific kinds of tax
changes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will fund two distinct projects. The
first considers the effects of dividend taxation on firm behavior. In 2003, the
maximum federal tax rate on corporate dividends substantially decreased. The
investigator will examine how this drop in the tax rate changed the decisions
made by corporations about whether to grant dividends and the size of such
dividends. In previous work, the investigator and a co-author have shown that
the 2003 changes led to a marked increase in dividends and a marked increase in
the number of firms granting dividends. This award will fund additional work
designed to determine the relationship between ownership composition and
dividend behavior. Did firms with high levels of executive and institutional
ownership respond differently than firms with large numbers of small
investors?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second project considers how car buyers
respond to changes in two different kinds of taxes: sales taxes (which are paid
at the time a car is purchased), and excise taxes (which are levied on car
owners during their years of ownership and depend on the estimated used-car
value). A preliminary study of state-level aggregate data suggests that new car
purchases fall when sales taxes increase, but do not change when excise taxes
increase. This project will use detailed data on new car sales to determine
whether this is really the case. The PI also plans to develop an economic theory
of whether or not there is any socially optimal use of "hidden" taxes, taxes
that do not affect individual behavior in significant ways because they are not
well understood.&lt;br/&gt;
