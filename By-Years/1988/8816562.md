There are a number of models for the evolution of extensional basin systems,
and the Death Valley region has figured prominently in their development. This
project will attempt to distinguish between two models involving large-scale
kinematics of crustal extension. In one model extension is accommodated by the
movement of originally adjacent upper crustal fault blocks above a deep
detachment whereas the other suggests that adjacent upper crustal fault blocks
above a deep detachment whereas the other suggests that adjacent blocks
originally were on top of each other prior to Cenozoic extension. Mapping of
faults to establish fault chronologies and orientation and 40Ar/39Ar
geochronology to clarify the uplift history are planned. Results are expected to
help define the kinematics of extensional basin systems.
