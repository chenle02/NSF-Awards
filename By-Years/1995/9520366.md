The development of scanning tunneling microscopy for the imaging of molecular
adsorbates is the goal of this research project, supported in the Analytical and
Surface Chemistry Program. An ultra high vacuum scanning tunneling microscope
will be used to image selected molecular adsorbate systems and surface chemical
reactions. Small aromatic molecules adsorbed on Pd(111) surfaces will be
investigated both experimentally and theoretically to develop an understanding
of the STM imaging mechanism, and to determine the limits of real space and real
time observation of chemical reactions on surfaces. Cyclization of acetylene to
benzene will form the focus of reaction studies. In order to develop a
microscopic understanding of chemical reactions catalyzed by noble metal
surfaces, real space and real time structural information must be obtained. The
goal of this research project is to develop both the experimental methods and
the theoretical understanding needed to use scanning tunneling microscopy to
provide this structural information.
