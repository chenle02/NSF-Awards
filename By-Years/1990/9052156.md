This project focuses on the development of a set of undergraduate laboratory
courses in microelectronics processing. These courses complement the extensive
collection of lecture classes in microelectronics by providing hands-on
experience for the students. The first quarter course concentrates on
experiments to teach the steps of device fabrication such as photoresist,
etching and oxidation. The second quarter course allows deeper investigation of
the scientific details of fabrication. Given that progress in microelectronics
has historically been a result of strong interdisciplinary activity, the course
will be offered to students in physics, chemistry, chemical engineering,
electrical engineering, and materials engineering. This project is significant
because it will introduce the microelectronic device fabrication process to
undergraduates early in their academic life through hands-on laboratory
experimentation.
