Our knowledge of the functional architecture of normal tissue is gained slowly
because tools for studying cell structure have been either very tedious to use
(electron microscopy) or ineffective in cells of normal thickness (conventional
light microscopy). The aim of this proposal is to acquire a system for studying
the 3D functional architecture of cells based on the revolutionary new
techniques of confocal light microscopy. This system will be utilized by a core
user group of cell, developmental, and neuro-biologists who are engaged in the
following major areas of research. 1) a mutational analysis of morphogenetic
mutants of C. elegans; 2) the distribution of integrins in developing skeletal
muscle membranes; 3) examining the changes of distribution of proteins and
membranes involved in excitation contraction coupling resulting from targeted
mutations in the ryanodine receptor; 4) correlative light and EM studies of the
structure and arrangement of microtubules and MAPS in the mitotic spindle; S)
the attachment of actin filaments to the cleavage furrow membrane of dividing
cells; 6) studying the recruitment of cytoskeletal proteins by the intracellular
bacteria Listeria monocytogenes; 7) the microcircuitry of retinal ganglion cell
interconnections. The subjects studied by this core user group are diverse.
However, we share the need for a rapid way of studying cell architecture in the
0.1 to 1.0 resolution range, a way that is not rendered useless by tissue
thickness in the range 0.1-0.5 mm. We have jointly used a previous generation
laser scanning confocal microscope very productively in our research, and have
demonstrated that an up-to-date instrument would open up exciting new
possibilities for all of us.
