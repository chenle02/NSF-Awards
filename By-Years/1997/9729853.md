Buffalo CISE Research Instrumentation: Establishment of a High Performance Real-
Time Visualization Research Laboratory This research instrumentation grant
contributes to the purchase of an ONYX 2 Silicon Graphics computer with Infinite
Reality Engine dedicated to support research in Computer and Information
Sciences and Engineering. The award will enable the following projects: -
Virtual Manufacturing Visualization, - Visualization Environment for Large-Scale
Multidisciplinary Design Optimization (MDO) Problems, - Visualization-Based Mass
Customization of Complex Assemblies, and - Analysis and Visualization of
Multidimensional Biomedical Structures. The research instrumentation will foster
new knowledge in four research areas: (i) Virtual Reality (VR) based
manufacturing and design, (ii) Multivariable concurrent design visualization,
(iii) Analysis and visualization of multidimensional biomedical structures and
(iv) Visualization-based mass customization of complex assemblies. In the first
application, this computer will be used to develop a Virtual Factory Testbed
consisting of models of machines, processes and simulations where new factories
and products can be tested without having to build costly physical prototypes.
In the second application, a new method called "Graphmorphing" will be developed
to enable multi-variable design optimization of aircraft and automobiles. In the
third application, researchers at UB will use the visualization laboratory for
very advanced bio-engineering application namely study of Microscopic
Biolomedical Structures in 3D and Multimodality Cranial Structures for
Radiotherapy. In the fourth application a new Visualization-Based Mass
Customization of Complex Assemblies will be developed which will benefit
selective design of new products in an efficient way.
