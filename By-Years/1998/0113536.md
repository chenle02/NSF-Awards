Simple RNA viruses have evolved complex interactions with their host's cellular
machinery that facilitate their replication, cell-to-cell movement, and systemic
transport. These interactions often lead to a disruption in the development and
homeostasis of the host's cellular processes, resulting in the expression of
disease symptoms that impact the host's well being and/or its economic value.
The goals of this project focus on the identification of host components that
are either involved in or affected by virus replication. To accomplish these
goals the molecular tools available for the plant virus Tobacco mosaic virus
(TMV) will be combined with the genetic tractability of Arabidopsis thaliana to
identify novel host genes that either directly contribute to the virus life-
cycle or are transcriptionally altered during the infection process. Specific
studies in this project will address three objectives. 1) A map-based cloning
approach will be used to identify a previously classified Arabidopsis locus that
controls the rate of TMV cell-to-cell movement. Additional studies will address
the function of this locus and its role in virus cell-to-cell movement. 2)
Available microarray technologies will be used to identify Arabidopsis genes
that are differentially regulated during distinct stages of the TMV infection
cycle, including inoculated and systemically infected whole leaf tissue as well
as synchronously infected protoplasts. 3) Symptoms displayed by TMV infected
Arabidopsis will be used to identify Arabidopsis mutants with altered virus
susceptibilities. Map-based cloning strategies will then be initiated to
identify the genes that impart these altered susceptibilities. Overall, studies
from this project should significantly enhance our understanding of the
interactions that occur between viruses and their hosts.
