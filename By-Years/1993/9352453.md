This project requests equipment to provide computer-based laboratory experiences
for undergraduate archaeology students. Archaeology, by its very nature, is an
experiential, hands on field. Yet ethical and legal concerns make it difficult
to teach archaeology using actual archaeological materials. Such concerns are
particularly important at Northern Arizona University, which has large numbers
of Native American students, the group most directly affected by archaeological
research in this country. The PI is in the process of developing interactive
computer programs in Hypercard on the Macintosh to teach archaeology using
visual images. The students analyze archaeological materials (for example, pots,
animal bones) on the screen, and interpret their results. In doing so, students
learn how archaeological data are collected, analyzed, and applied within a
problem-solving context.
