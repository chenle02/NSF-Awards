Tyrosine hydroxylase, an iron-containing, pterin-dependent monoxygenase catalyze
the rate-controlling step in the biosynthesis of catecholamine
neurotransmitters, the hydroxlation of tyrosine to form dihydroxyphenylalanine.
The pterin-dependent monooxygenases are a poorly understood group of enzymes.
The primary goal of this research is to understand the catalytic mechanism of
tyrosine hydroxylase. The DNA for rat PC 12 tyrosine hydroxylase has been cloned
and will be expressed in a high efficiency baculovirus expression system in
order to obtain enough pure material for detailed mechanistic studies. The
kinetic mechanism will be determined using steady state kinetics and isotope
trapping. Rapid reaction techniques will be used to measure the rates of
formation of catalytic intermediates. Several nonphysiological amino acids
appear to act as substrates for tyrosine hydroxylase; these reactions will be
studies to gain information about the identity of the oxygenating species. This
class of enzymes, the monooxygenases, catalyze some of the most difficult
reactions in biochemistry. Consequently, they have been the objects of a great
deal of study. The mechanism of phenylalanine hydroxylase has been well studied
in contrast to tyrosine hydroxylase. It shows a number of significant
differences; phenylalanine does not appear to be a substrate for tyrosine
hydroxylase although the data is not consistent; the redox state of the resting
enzymes are different; tyrosine hydroxylase can use H2 02 in place of
tetrahydropterins. This study could also offer fundamental insights into the
mechanism of other classes of monooxygenases since it has features in common
with both flavoprotein hydroxylases and Fe(11) monooxygenases.
