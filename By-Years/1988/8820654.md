A program of nuclear structure investigations using intermediate energy
electrons will be carried out. A major portion of the effort will be directed
towards the study of magnetic excitations in medium mass nuclei. These
investigations will be the first to use a new 180 degree electron scattering
set-up designed by the CUA group and installed at the Illinois microtron.
Electron scattering studies of high spin stretch states will be made at the
MIT/Bates linac. Also, electron induced proton knockout studies of medium-A
nuclei, 2S orbital occupation probabilities will be carried out at Dutch Nuclear
Research Center (NIKHEF). Other work will be continued in connection with design
and construction of a photon tagger for the CEBAF LAS experimental facility.
