Prof. Karl Freed of the University of Chicago is supported by the Theoretical
and Computational Chemistry program to develop theoretical methods for
describing polymerization and clustering transitions in equilibrium material
systems. The work extends his prior research on equilibrium linear transitions
to include the following: (1) the competition between linear and branched self-
assembly; (2) the connection between self-association and macroscopic phase
separation; (3) thermodynamic signatures that may help characterize different
types of association processes; and (4) a logical means for determining model
parameters from both simulations and experiments. The research is expected to
have a broad impact on both biology and materials science. &lt;br/&gt;
