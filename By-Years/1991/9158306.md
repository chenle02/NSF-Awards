This Presidential Young Investigator will work on Mordell- Weil lattices of
elliptic surfaces, the size and structure of the Tate-Safarevic group and the
connection to coding theory via the Barnes-Wall lattices. This project falls
into the general area of arithmetic geometry -a subject that blends two of the
oldest areas of mathematics: number theory and geometry. This combination has
proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems that withstood
generations. Among its many consequences are new error correcting codes. Such
codes are essential for both modern computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
