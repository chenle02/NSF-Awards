This award supports participation in the 11th International Conference on
Computability, Complexity, and Randomness, held on the campus of the University
of Hawaii at Manoa during January 4-8, 2016. The conference features invited
talks, contributed talks, and a tutorial. The conference covers topics such as
computability theory, computational complexity theory, algorithmic randomness,
and interactions between logic and analysis. Participants may submit abstracts
for talks which upon acceptance by the program committee may be presented at the
conference. Selected papers based on the talks will be published in a post-
conference journal volume. The conference organizers are committed to helping to
advance the careers of young researchers, women, and minorities in mathematics.
Priority for financial support to attend the conference will be given to
graduate students, postdocs, women, and minorities, as well as to faculty at
smaller institutions who do not have other sources of financial support.

The CCR conference series has become a fixture in the community of algorithmic
randomness researchers since its inception in 2004. Many of the most prominent
workers in this field make a habit of attending it most years. The conference
promotes applications of algorithmic randomness and computability theory in
other areas of mathematics, and in other disciplines such as statistics,
economics, and finance. The invited presentations provide a platform for the
latest developments in the field. Moreover, the contributed talk session gives
graduate students and young researchers an opportunity to expose themselves to
the most recent research trends and present their own work, thereby contributing
to their training and professional development. Financial support to attend the
conference will preferentially be given to graduate students, postdocs, women,
and minorities, as well as to junior faculty who may not otherwise be able to
attend the conference.
