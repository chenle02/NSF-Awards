The purpose of this project is to analyze changes in the location of
manufacturing activity in the U.S. between 1963 and 1992 in order to see whether
these changes are influenced by differences in environmental regulations among
states. The Census Bureau's longitudinal Research Database provides information
at five-year intervals for all manufacturing plants. Using these data, each
active plant in each period is categorized as opening, closing, expanding, or
contracting. These data are aggregated up to the state-level to create dependent
variables such as the number of newly opened plants in a state during a five
year interval. The explanatory variables for the estimation include regulatory
measures such as enforcement activity, pollution abatement expenditures, and
state laws, and other factors influencing location such as taxes, wages, and
unionization. This research is important because it will develop a new state-
level data set on manufacturing activity, and it will help quantify the impact
of state imposed environmental regulations on the location of manufacturing
activity.
