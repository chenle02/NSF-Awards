Physical, biological, and economic dynamics systems in heterogeneous and random
environments are ubiquitous in nature, and include examples as diverse as
spreading in ecology, economic growth, and fluid turbulence. The mathematical
modeling of such systems involves nonlinear partial differential equations and
stochastic processes, which for real-world applications contain a multitude of
temporal and spatial scales, making the numerical simulation of the microscopic
details of their behavior beyond reach even of modern computers. To mitigate
this issue, one approach is to use approximate macroscopic effective models.
Another is to consider simplified models that inherit the qualitative properties
of the dynamics of the larger system. The overarching goal of this project is to
study the validity of such approximations in applications of interest to
physical sciences and macroeconomics, among others. The mentoring and training
of graduate students will be integrated in the project.

The first part of the project aims to develop new tools and better understanding
of the connection between branching processes and nonlinear parabolic equations.
One focus is on the study of branching Brownian motion in dimensions higher than
one. The second part concerns the long-time behavior of nonlinear equations
arising in the fluid dynamics and reaction-diffusion modeling, with a focus on
very long-time scales, when fluctuations in the solutions start building up in
ways beyond the classical central limit theorem time scales. The third part
investigates the long-time behavior of the solutions to systems of mean-field
equations that arise in macroeconomics.
