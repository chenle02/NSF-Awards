9302846 Rubin This award provides funding for 25% of the cost of a high-
abundance-sensitivity thermal ionization mass spectrometer to be operated and
maintained in the School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology at the
University of Hawaii. Remaining funds required for this acquisition are
committed by the University of Hawaii. The new mass spectrometer is capable of
measuring precisely the relative abundance of isotopes of thorium and the
uranium decay series and will be used by University researchers in research on
the geochronology of mid-ocean ridge basalt volcanism, mantle geochemistry, and
the chronology of global sealevel changes via the dating of island coral
platforms. ***
