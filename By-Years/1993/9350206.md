9350206 Popovic The research concentrates on quasi optical power combining of
microwave and millimeter wave solid state devices. This technique allows the
powers of a large number of individual devices to be combined in a compact, low
cost, reliable high power source. Since the power combining occurs in free
space, radiation and antenna design are addressed. Both amplifier and oscillator
combiners are studied, using FETs or bipolar transistors. A design oriented
analysis is developed for optimizing the radiating structure geometry towards
different design criteria, such as power, bandwidth, efficiency or low noise. In
the case of oscillators, nonlinear behaviour and injection locking of a large
number of devices are studied. In the case of amplifiers, a high efficiency
circuit topology is combined with the radiating structure in order to minimize
heat sinking requirements. The goal of the work is to develop a compact,
inexpensive microwave solid state source for a variety of applications, such as
vehicular radar, mobile communications, wireless communications, atmospheric
studies and remote sensing. ***
