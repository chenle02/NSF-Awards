The objective of this project is to research how a new educational software
tool, the Geometer's Sketchpad, based on state-of-the- art computer technology
and advanced programming techniques, can best be used by students and teachers
in secondary schools. This research will lay the basis for the development and
publication of a set of teacher support materials including both teacher
training materials an student activity guides. These can be used to better
enable teachers to effectively use the dynamic geometric constructions and
script saving feature in The Geometer's Sketchpad. This project will include:
analysis of educational research that used existing geometric modeling software,
observations and interviews with the initial group of students and teachers
using the The Geometer's Sketchpad, assessment of the attitudes and performance
of these same students, identification of teacher in effectively employing the
software technology, creation and testing of prototype teaching materials, and
identification of needs for teacher training. Special attention will be given to
identifying how The Geometer's Sketchpad can be used successfully by the
broadest spectrum of students, especially those underrepresented in advanced
mathematics classes-women, members of minorities, and disabled.
