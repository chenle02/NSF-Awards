The objective of this research is to systematize the derivation of algorithms in
the field of iterative linear system solving: iterative methods,
preconditioners, multigrid. The approach is by extending the Formal Linear
Algebra Methods Environment (FLAME), a system originally developed for deriving
dense matrix algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The merit of this research lies
firstly in the fact that it facilitates experimentation, since it makes
derivation of new algorithms essentially simpler than the lengthy induction
arguments that are traditionally necessary. Secondly, it will lead to algorithms
being proved correct by the very mechanism of derivation. Finally, a complete
systematization of FLAME may take the form of a symbolic system, where algorithm
implementations are derived mechanically, steered by the user but otherwise
autonomously, from a specification of their properties rather than from an
algorithmic description.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The impact of this research will
be on the computational community, since it lowers the threshold to exploring
new algorithmic strategies, and on software developers, since it makes it easier
to derive correct implementations of algorithms. Additionally, it will impact
the way the subject of iterative linear system solving is taught, since FLAME
worksheets offer a simpler and more insightful description of algorithms than is
used traditionally.
