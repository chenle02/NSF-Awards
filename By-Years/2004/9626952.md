9626952 Schatz The Pacific Science Center will develop a 7000 sq. ft. traveling
exhibit "Other Worlds! Other Beings"? Concerned that the general public is
largely uninformed about the results of the years of basic science research
carried out by U.S. scientists, this exhibit will provide an opportunity for
visitors to learn about the results of this research and increase their own
understanding of the earth and the solar system in general. The exhibit will
introduce visitors to the planets, their environmental characteristics,
potential and unlikely probability for life to exist on other planets and the
processes involved in astronomical research. In addition to the exhibit, they
will develop a planetarium program, materials for use by teachers and students,
various workshops and other programs for teachers and community leaders, and a
full marketing package for participating museums. The exhibit will travel to a
minimum of nine museums during its three year tour after opening at the Pacific
Science Center in December, 1997.
