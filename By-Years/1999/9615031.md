With National Science Foundation support, the Grace Hudson Museum, which is
located in the city of Ukiah, California, will curate the Pomoan materials
collected during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Pomo Indians
inhabited this region of California to the North of San Francisco and Grace
Hudson, her father and later her husband collected Pomoan materials in a careful
and systematic fashion. The documentation which accompanies the collections is,
in most cases, detailed and the scientific value of the materials is increased
by photographs, systematic ethnographic investigation, field notebooks and
related correspondence. Unfortunately the collection suffers from
disorganization and a lack of cataloguing and cross-referencing that renders
much of these important holdings inaccessible to all but the most knowledgeable
and persistent researchers. NSF has already awarded a grant to re-transcribe
linguistic manuscripts, catalogue and annotate photographs and catalog
ethnographic artifacts. This current award will allow MS Smith-Ferri to continue
this process. Written materials and photographs will be correlated, annotated,
indexed and cross-referenced. The information and papers themselves will be made
available to interested users, institutions with related collections and Indian
communities through the use of both microfilm and CD-ROM technology. The last
native speaker of Pomo is extremely old and much of what is known of early
historic Pomoan lifeways is contained in the collections of the Hudson Museum
and a few other institutions. Not only are these materials of great historical
significance, but they are also invaluable scientific resources. In the current
condition however they are very difficult to use and this grant will
significantly increase their access to the scientific community.
