One of the important areas in nanotechnology is nanoscale devices, manufacturing
and measurement for advance of science, engineering and economy. Precision stage
systems are widely used not only in semiconductor manufacturing systems and
precision machine tools, but also in scanning-type measuring instruments such as
coordinate measuring machines and surface measuring machines. These systems are
required to have submicron to nanometer positioning resolution, but also high
speed and long travel range in the presence of unavoidable uncertainties and
disturbances, which is a challenge and a well-known difficulty in nanotechnology
devices in broad manufacturing and instrumentation areas.

Through this research planning visit, Prof. Sheng-Guo Wang from the UNC-
Charlotte, together with Japan partner Prof. Wei Gao, Director of Nano-Metrology
and Control Laboratory/Research Center at Tohoku University, will investigate
precision stage systems, and develop a collaborative advanced practical research
project to meet this challenge in nanotechnology by sharing their complementary
expertise and research resources.

Broader impacts include the international cooperation; training of U.S. graduate
students by providing an early career introduction to collaborative
international work in advanced areas in two leading industrial countries; and
promotion of a mutually beneficial collaborative relationship.
