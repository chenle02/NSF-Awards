This project researches the energy release and particle acceleration mechanism
in solar flares. The source of flare energy is the current-carrying magnetic
field, and the bulk of this energy goes into the acceleration of particles, but
exactly how the energy is dissipated or accelerates particles is uncertain.
Direct heating, acceleration, and production of plasma waves or turbulence are
possible dissipation channels. The PI will gain insight through comparing
microwave, hard X-ray and gamma-ray observations with theoretical results in a
gradual process, where lower foundations of understanding will proceed to more
complex situations. Specifically, he will determine (1) if the background
thermal plasma particles can be accelerated efficiently, (2) how effectively the
observations can be explained, and (3) what new testable predictions can be
made. The project will support one graduate student, and result in an important
understanding of the flare problem, as well as giving useful information about
magnetospheric phenomena around the earth, other planets, compact stars, and
nuclei of active galaxies.
