This award will expose undergraduate students, chosen from several central
Florida institutions, to one year of research experience in the development and
applications of lasers. Several internationally recognized faculty in the Center
for Research in Electro-Optics and Lasers (CREOL) will act as research
supervisors in this project. CREOL is a world-leading center of excellence in
optics, laser development and laser-related sciences. The primary emphasis of
this effort is to encourage more talented undergraduate students from the
central Florida region to pursue graduate studies in the field of optics and
lasers.
