The goal of this software capitalization project is the development and
distribution of a "release" quality version of STR+VE, a theorem prover for the
first-order predicate calculus with inequality. This prover employs the
Shielding Term Removal and Variable Elimination strategy with its emphasis on
"larger steps". It is a fully automatic prover which has proved several
important results in analysis, for example, the theorem that the sum of
continuous functions is continuous.
