Carleton College proposes to renovate research space in Mudd Hall for the
Departments of Chemistry and Geology. The remodeling of the chemistry facilities
will provide new labs devoted to research in physical, organic, inorganic and
analytic chemistry, and biochemistry. In addition, instrument rooms and
hazardous waste storage will be reconfigured. The result will be a logical and
efficient arrangement of research space which will noticeably enhance the
department's research program. All seven chemistry faculty members maintain
active research programs and work together with about two dozen students per
year. Each year Carleton graduates about 25 to 30 students with chemistry
majors. The renovation of the geology research facilities will result in a room
dedicated to computers, a modernized geochemistry lab with proper ventilation
and storage, a dedicated rock preparation room, and a properly ventilated area
for x-ray machines. The renovation will have a significant impact on the
research of 3 faculty and the 20 plus geology seniors who conduct independent
research projects each year.
