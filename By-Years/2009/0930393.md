This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Technology Transfer
Phase I project is for the development of ultrahigh thermal conductivity carbon
fiber for use in graphite-metal composites. The use of graphite fiber in a metal
matrix produces a composite with high thermal conductivity and controlled CTE,
the two key requirements for a material to be used in electronic packaging
components. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of mesophase pitch carbon
fiber with a combination of ultrahigh thermal conductivity and mechanical
properties will support the commercialization of next generation graphite-metal
electronic packaging products that will require lower thermal
resistance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
