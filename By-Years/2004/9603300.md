9603300 Okamura This award supports a two year collaborative research project
between Professor Melvin Okamura of the University of California at San Diego
and Dr. Teizo Kitagawa of the Okazaki National Research Institute in Japan. This
project undertakes a study of the elucidation of a coupling mechanism of
electron and proton transfers at the quinone-B site of photosynthetic reaction
centers by using resonance Raman spectroscopy. The major goals of this project
are: 1) investigate the structure and function of photosynthetic reaction
centers; 2) determine the role of quinone-B in electron and proton transfer; and
3) apply resonance Raman studies to quinones in bacterial reaction centers. The
project brings together the efforts of two laboratories that have constituted
different parts of the process: the Americans have expertise in the preparation
and characterization of reaction centers and the Japanese laboratory has the
facilities for extensive experience in biological application of resonance Raman
spectroscopy. Through the exchange of ideas and technology, this project will
broaden our base of basic knowledge and promote international understanding and
cooperation. ***
