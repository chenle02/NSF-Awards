The principal investigator proposes to initiate a research project with the
following goals: a) to identify the final products of the reactions between ClNO
(XNO) and other atmospheric species, in particular ozone, water, sulfur oxides
and simple alkenes, and their relevance to atmospheric chemistry b) to obtain
information on the time scales in which these reactions occur. c) to provide
some insight into the reaction mechanisms by use of matrix isolation techniques.
d) to determine whether vibrationally induced chemistry is observed in XNO
reactions and investigate the mechanisms by which these infrared induced
reactions occur. Preliminary activities to be done during the planning period
include the following: 1) Synthesis of the nitrosyl halides and ozone. 2) Design
and construction of a vacuum system that will allow the preparation of the
reactants 3) Modify the designs of a cryostat to prepare clean matrices and to
allow the transportation of samples from the FT-IR to the UV-Vis spectrometer.
4) Adaptation of the departmental FT-IR to fit the cryostat 5) Modification of
laboratory space so as to provide adequate electrical requirements, water
requirements, and ventilation for the vacuum equipment.
