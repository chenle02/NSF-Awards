The deposition of highly formable ceramic coatings on sheet metal by Ion Beam
Assisted Deposition (IBAD) suggests that these coatings may ultimately supplant
painting or anodizing in many roll-coating operations. The process has been used
to synthesize alumina, zirconia, and boron nitride coatings on various
substrates at temperatures a low as room temperature. This research effort will
examine the ductility behavior of potentially superplastic IBAD coatings as they
are affected by IBAD parameters (the parameters that govern formability). The
work will be coordinated with vendors to assure that practicable processes
capable of producing acceptable industrial coatings are developed.
