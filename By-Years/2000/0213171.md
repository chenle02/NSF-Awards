A grant has been awarded to Dr. John Gatesy at the University of California,
Riverside to study the evolution of reproductive protein genes in mammals.
Recently, "reproductive proteins" that are important for fertilization have been
characterized in several mammalian species. Preliminary studies suggest that
many of these proteins, both egg and sperm-specific, have evolved at a rapid
rate. In this proposed research, modern molecular techniques will be used to
survey reproductive protein gene sequences from several species of even-toed
hoofed mammals. These data will be used to better characterize the pattern of
molecular evolution in mammalian reproductive proteins, to determine which
regions of these molecules are prone to mutation, and to test whether
reproductive proteins are useful for reconstructing the evolutionary history of
mammals.&lt;br/&gt; Dr. Gatesy will mentor teams of undergraduate students at
the University of California, Riverside within the context of this
multidisciplinary project. In addition to getting first-hand experience in a wet
lab, the students will integrate their laboratory work with library research and
computer analysis. The combined research group will produce basic data that are
relevant to diverse biological sub-disciplines by exploring reproduction, a
foundation of evolutionary biology, at the genetic level. A detailed
understanding of reproductive proteins also is important for studies of human
fertility and infertility. Some of the species utilized in this study (cow,
sheep, goat) are standard model organisms for fertility research. Comparative
analyses of reproductive molecules from these species and close relatives will
facilitate experimental research on reproduction.&lt;br/&gt;
