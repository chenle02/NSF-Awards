Abstract: Macdonald polynomials, diagonal harmonics, and the geometry of Hilbert
schemes.

Professor Haiman is working to complete the proof of a series of conjectures
involving Macdonald polynomials, the so-called "n-factorial" conjecture, and the
character formula for diagonal harmonics. The methods involve a detailed
algebraic geometrical study of the Hilbert scheme of points in the plane and
related algebraic varieties. In earlier work Professor Haiman showed that
certain hypotheses on the singularities and sheaf cohomology of these varieties
would imply the desired algebraic results (and with Garsia, showed that the
latter imply related combinatorial results). The current work is to establish
these geometric hypotheses.

Macdonald polynomials are a new family of symmetric functions. Their discovery
by Macdonald in 1988 was a surprising development in the theory of symmetric
functions, which is a fundamental and classical part of mathematics with roots
in the work of Euler, Jacobi, and Cauchy over a century ago. Macdonald
polynomials have since been found to have important applications in a wide range
of areas including geometry, representation theory, and even theoretical
physics. At the time of their discovery, Macdonald conjectured that certain
coefficients associated with his polynomials should be positive integers, the
proof of which remains the most important unsolved problem in this area. The
successful completion of this project will solve this problem, proving the
"Macdonald positivity conjecture," along with a related representation-theoretic
conjecture of Garsia and the investigator known as the "n-factorial" conjecture,
some related combinatorial conjectures, and strong new geometric properties of
Hilbert schemes, which are likely to have further applications in geometry and
representation theory.
