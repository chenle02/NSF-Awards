Dr. Erick M. Carreira has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Carreira's doctoral degree was from Harvard University under the
supervision of David Evans. Dr. Carreira intends to continue research at the
California Institute of Technology under the sponsorship of Professor Peter B.
Dervan. Dr. Carreira's area of postdoctoral research will be the design and
synthesis of neutral oligonucleotides which will engage in triple helix
formation. The recognition specificity of the neutral strands will be compared
to their charged counterparts. The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in
Chemistry Program is viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to
broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D's and attract them into
meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and teaching.
