Our computing systems are constantly under attack, by everyone from pranksters
to agents of hostile nations. Many of those systems and networks make the task
of the adversary easier by responding to attacks with useful information. This
is because software and protocols have been written for decades to provide
informative feedback for error detection and correction. It is precisely this
behavior that enhances the chances of success by attackers, by allowing them to
map networks and determine system flaws. This research addresses the question
"Are there uses of deceptive responses that help prevent successful attacks?"
Furthermore, the study investigates if it is possible to characterize and model
the types of situations where deception may be useful. The result of this work
provides cyber system designers with some new defensive measures, and guidance
as to when they are useful to deploy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project includes
two related lines of research. The first of these is to explore some new
applications of deceit in system defense. The researchers investigate presenting
deceptive responses to attempts to exploit known vulnerabilities, and building a
file system that "lies" about the creation and deletion of key files. Each of
these mechanisms should support a system's security by providing early warning
of bad behavior as well as blunting attacks. Deceitful responses to attacks can
lead a perpetrator to employ ineffective attacks, thus wasting time and effort.
A deceptive file system can capture forensic data about an attempted attack
while only appearing to allow the installation of malicious files. The second
line of research explores how to apply hypergame models to cyber defenses using
deceptive techniques. Hypergames are an extension of game theory that includes
incorrect and uncertain information. By constructing hypergame models we should
be able to determine situations where there is a favorable result when deception
is employed as a defense.
