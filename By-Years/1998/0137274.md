ABSTRACT

OCE-0137274 / OCE-0136617 / OCE-0136897

The ocean is second only to the atmosphere as a sink for anthropogenic CO2.
Over the last decade, our ability to quantify the oceanic sink using
observations has dramatically increased. The improvement derives from two major
factors. The first is the JGOFS/WOCE/OACES global ocean carbon survey, which
produced the first high-quality, global-scale inorganic carbon data set. The
second is the continuing development of improved techniques to estimate
anthropogenic carbon from new measurements. Still, significant uncertainties
remain regarding estimation of the spatial distribution of anthropogenic CO2
uptake and storage in the sea. This uncertainty derives from the fact that the
task of unambiguously discerning the natural and anthropogenic CO2 signals is
far from trivial. The estimates require assumptions that are difficult to verify
and whose uncertainties are hard to estimate. Better quantification of the
spatial storage pattern and the associated uncertainties is required to assess
the value of oceanic data constraints on the global carbon budget and ocean
model evaluations, such as those undertaken by the Ocean Carbon-cycle Model
Intercomparison Project (OCMIP).

On this project, a team of researchers from the University of California at Los
Angeles, the University of Washington, and Princeton University will perform
global analysis of observation-based estimates of the oceanic storage of
anthropogenic carbon dioxide. Their goal is to assess a range of ocean data to
provide a well-constrained estimate of the oceanic anthropogenic CO2
distribution. Particular emphasis will be placed on the estimation of
uncertainties and differences between the several approaches. This work would
depend upon and extend results from recently completed and ongoing research that
these investigators have been involved in as part of the Synthesis and Modeling
Project of the U.S. Joint Global Ocean Flux Study.
