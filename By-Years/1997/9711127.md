This study will focus on the cultural and technological development of studio
recording in postwar America. It will explore how the studio became a new medium
as tape both revolutionized the process of recording and broadened participation
in the audio engineering field. It investigates the working relationship of
audio engineers, musicians, and record producers during a period of intense
growth, experimentation, and entrepreneurship in the field of sound recording.
The primary method of getting at this history is through oral interviews with
studio engineers and owners, musicians, radio personnel, and others involved
with sound recording in this era.
