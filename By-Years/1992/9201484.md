Steiglitz The research is on the limits of scalable special-purpose
architectures for highly parallel computation, especially computation on regular
arrays. Important applications of array- based computation can be found in
digital signal processing, and in many areas of scientific computation,
including many-body problems with gravitational or coulombic interactions, fluid
dynamics, and wave propagation. These applications require highly parallel
computation either because of the need for real- time operation, or because the
total number of operations required is very large. The basic problems being
addressed are: 1. The design and reliability analysis of large fault-tolerant
arrays, and on-line reconfiguration and error-detection algorithms for these
special-purpose architectures; 2. The design and analysis of reliable clocking
schemes for very large arrays of processors, especially the comparison of
synchronous, self-timed, and hybrid clocking; 3. A study of the general issue of
cost-effective scaling of large, special-purpose computer architectures for
regular computations; and, 4. Extension of the work to Hierarchical Data
Computations, such as those in the fast monopole and multipole methods for many-
body problems, where particles are distributed in space, and are clustered by
decomposing space into hierarchical domains.
