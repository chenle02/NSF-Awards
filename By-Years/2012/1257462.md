The principles underlying the process of adaptive evolution are well
established, and have been well tested in the laboratory and over short time
periods in the field. However, we also know that the long-term rate of
adaptation can be subject to additional processes. The primary objective of this
research is to examine how a population's genetic variability affects the rate
of adaptation over many generations, in the face of variation in environmental
conditions and the depletion of that genetic variation by natural selection.
Quantitative genetic experiments will be conducted in nature to assess potential
and realized adaptation for three populations of the annual plant species,
Chamaecrista fasciculata (partridge pea).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research
will establish an empirical basis for predicting rates of ongoing adaptation.
Beyond their fundamental importance, rates of adaptation are now of urgent
societal importance in the context of rapidly changing climate. This research
will inform policy and efforts directed toward conservation of natural
populations. Moreover, the project will contribute to development of scientific
capability by involving undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral scholars,
including members of groups underrepresented in STEM fields.
