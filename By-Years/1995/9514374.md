Nunez 9514374 The brain and its cells are unique in their ability to change in
response to their internal surroundings and the animal's experiences. This
ability to adapt can be demonstrated at the molecular, cellular and behavioral
levels. One of the most plastic cells in the brain are not even nerve cells, but
are peripherally derived mast cells. The mast cells and glial elements provide
an enriched environment in which the nerve cells function. However, much is
unknown about the mast cells in brain especially their function and anatomy. Dr.
Nunez is assessing the ability of daylength, a strong environmental cue, to
alter the anatomy of brain mast cells and their central nervous system location.
These investigations lay the foundation for studies on the influence of mast
cells on adaptive behaviors and other neurochemical changes. These
investigations will provide significant basic information about the interplay
between the environment and brain function. This information will then be used
to further understand the how environmental factors increase or decrease species
survivability in the wild or captivity.
