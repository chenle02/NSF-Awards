9720663 Edelson This effort integrates a research program in the development of
educational technologies and educational program that will provide undergraduate
and graduate students with experiences in the design and study of these
technologies. The research component of this effort will develop a software
architecture for science learning environments that engage students in design
tasks involving everyday devices. The goal of this Designing to Learn
architecture is to use the task of design and the topic of everyday things to
provide a context that motivates learning and supports the application of
scientific principles in familiar settings.
