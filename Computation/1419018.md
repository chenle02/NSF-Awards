Linear algebra and its numerical methods are the foundation of scientific
computing and inform a wide range of research in applied mathematics. Algebraic
geometry is the geometry of non-linear algebra; its primary objects are sets
described by collections of polynomials in several variables. Such sets, which
include varieties and semialgebraic sets, arise in many contexts, notably in
optimization, statistics, finance, and quantitative biology. Recent advances,
both in theory and in computing resources, have enabled researchers to extend
some of the techniques available for linear models to non-linear models. This
project develops new methodologies based on algebraic geometry for both symbolic
and numerical computing to tackle problems arising in such applications.

Intermediate steps between linear and non-linear algebra include piecewise-
linear algebra (in particular, the max-plus algebra and tropical geometry) and
multilinear algebra (in particular, the study of tensors and their
decompositions). This project builds on these connections. Its four main themes
are maximum likelihood geometry, Euclidean distance optimization, convex
algebraic geometry, and classical moduli spaces. Concrete goals include the
determination of the maximum likelihood degrees of determinantal varieties, the
semialgebraic characterization of matrices with bounded nonnegative rank, the
development of sum of squares relaxations for the Euclidean distance degree
problem, and a geometric characterization of Gram spectrahedra. The design and
implementation of novel algorithms for moduli spaces, for example for del Pezzo
surfaces, forms a bridge to the research communities in core algebraic geometry.
