This research project advances artificial-intelligence research in the areas of
planning and reinforcement learning. The primary goal of the research is to
create theoretically justified planning algorithms with wide applicability to
tasks including robot navigation and control, medical decision making, flexible
manufacturing, communications-network monitoring, and space mission scheduling.
The research takes a two-pronged approach to develop algorithms for solving
large-scale domains derived from practical, real-world problems: careful formal
analysis to aid in the construction and identification of justifiable
algorithms, and the development and intensive empirical validation of
algorithms. This strategy encourages the creation of algorithms that will be
useful in solving practical tasks while avoiding ``over fitting'' (i.e., losing
generality by tailoring algorithms to attributes of specific domains). New
planning algorithms developed in the course of this research combine insights
from the areas of planning and reinforcement learning to make it possible to
solve larger and more difficult problems than could be addressed previously. The
research is creating methods for approximately solving large control problems
that could be used in engineering applications ranging from elevator design to
the adaptive control of computer systems; this will help create systems that
aremore efficient, safe, and reliable.
