plenary and workshop sessions will focus on applying for and persisting in
graduate schools; identifying graduate school fellowships and financial aid;
identifying, interviewing for, and persisting in STEM careers in all employment
sectors; and understanding science, technology, engineering and mathematics
(STEM) research in a global context. Other conference features will include
exhibitors from government, academia, and business who will showcase graduate
programs, fellowships, summer undergraduate research programs, employment
opportunities, and international research and education opportunities. Estimated
annual conference participation is 1,000, including 650 students and 350 faculty
