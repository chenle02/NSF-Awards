Experimental studies will be carried out on basalt and andesite magma
compositions from convergent plate margin environments. High pressure phase
equilibrium experiments (up to 25 kbar) will provide compositions of magmas
derived by melting mantle peridotite and allow development of models of the
processes that modify these melts as they rise through overlying mantle into the
crust. Experimental studies carried out at crustal level pressures will
determine the compositional variations produced by fractional crystallization.
These experimental studies provide constraints on the transfer of material from
the upper mantle to the crust by volcanism in subduction zone settings. These
studies also apply directly to the interpretation of calc- alkaline volcanic and
plutonic rocks in the Cascades and Sierra Nevada. Field, petrologic and
geochemical investigations at Medicine Lake Highland and Mount Shasta in
northern California and Onion Valley, S. Sierra Nevada will use the experimental
results to develop a framework for understanding the magmatic processes that
lead to the compositional diversity of lavas and plutonic rocks in these calc-
alkaline magmatic systems.
