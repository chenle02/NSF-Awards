This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
tool for fisheries biomass assessment that fuses airborne LIDAR with ship-borne
SONAR data. This is expected to be an improved survey technique that extends a
fishery survey area while also increasing the quality of the data that is
collected. Phase I will apply the system to two important fisheries issues: the
decline of the endangered Stellar Sea Lion population in the presence of
commercial fishing; and the need for increased information for salmon life cycle
modeling. Both of these issues impact thousands of lives in Alaska and the
Pacific Northwest. The mathematical relationship between LIDAR and SONAR
backscatter will be established. A prototype fusion engine will be developed and
validated on existing data from the North Pacific.

The system will be migrated to a web-based prototype LIDAR-SONAR data fusion
engine for use in the fisheries management and scientific communities. A real-
time data fusion engine will be deployed for future fish survey operations.
