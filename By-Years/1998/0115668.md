In the past decade, there has been a movement in the design of computational
objects toward "relational artifacts," computational objects designed to present
themselves as having affective states that are influenced by the objects'
interactions with human beings. They include digital dolls for children and for
the homebound elderly, for whom they can double as health-monitoring systems.
The designers of such systems incorporate models of human and animal cognition
and build machines that learn from experience and adapt over time. In turn,
experiences with such machines provide users and designers with powerful
"objects to think with" about how their own minds work, and about what is
special about being a person. This award funds data collection to examine a
range of psychological, cultural, and ethical questions raised by relational
artifacts. The investigator will explore and document the experiences of the
groups having "first contact" with relational artifacts: designers, children,
`early adopters', and the elderly. The methodology includes ethnographic
fieldwork, observations, and interviews; sites include academic and corporate
laboratories, children's after-school programs, elder housing, and individual
subjects' homes. Interviews and observations will be taped and transcribed;
results will be disseminated in published papers, presentations at conferences,
and in a monograph. The investigator for this project has already launched
preliminary pilot studies on this topic. She proposes that this new kind of
computational object provokes striking changes in the ways people categorize and
assign value to qualities such as "emotion," "relationship," and "aliveness."
The dynamic between a person and an interactive, evolving, "caring" machine is
not the same as the relationship one might have with another person, a pet, or a
cherished inanimate object. This research project will explore the nature and
implications of this new sort of relationship. Its goal is to better understand
how experiences with relational artifacts affect people's sense of who they are
and their place in the world.
