Stensel The problems in environmental engineering and science have become
broader, more complex and more sophisticated over the past 10-15 years. Water
and waste water treatment issues have been joined by concerns about ground water
contamination, sediment contamination, pollution prevention and recycle,
handling of toxic and hazardous substances, drinking water quality, sludge
reclamation and disposal, nutrient removal and air quality. Thus, environmental
engineering problems are multi media requiring knowledge of the behavior of
contaminants and their interaction in air, soil and water. The University of
Washington has first class research and research training programs that focus on
these environmental engineering issues. This award will support the renovation
of their environmental engineering laboratories which is an area of about 9500
square feet. The renovation will reorganize lab areas, provide improved
ventilation for toxic compounds and reaction studies, improve the heating and
air conditioning systems, improve bench tops and cabinets, and provide proper
areas for analytical equipment. This renovation project will impact about 15
faculty and 100 graduate students. Finally, this more modern facility will add
capability and capacity to researchers involved in biotransformation and
bioremediation research, research integral to understanding environmental
transformations.
