Over the past decade and a half, Tilman has developed a theory of competition
based on the premise that the species withthe lowest equilibrium resource
concentration (R*) will be the superior competitor. Considerable controversy
exists on the validity of the R* concept. Current experimental evidence is
somewhat contradictory as to the validity of the R* concept, and in particular,
how generally it applies. This research will evaluate the basic mechanism of
competition and the applicability of the R* concept. Preliminary studies will
determine the relationships between competitive success and various resource use
characteristics (including estimates of R*) for 10 species of emergent marsh
plants at low and high fertility levels. The project will also include the
completion of on-going experiments on nutrient competition, salinity effects and
above/below ground partitioning of competition in 5 marsh species. It hoped that
in addition to resolving the debate about the validity of the R concept, this
research will help us to understand the mechanisms of resource competition and
their applicability to both short-term and long-term success in nature.
