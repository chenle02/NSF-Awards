The main objectives of this research are to understand the reactions, schemes,
and pathways for the decomposition of Printed Wiring Board (PWB) wastes, through
which clean and useful fuel products are to be obtained; to find suitable and
efficient catalysts for the combustion and pyrolysis of PWB wastes in order to
control the emission of toxic gas and heavy metals; and to propose green
processes for the recycling of PWB wastes at industrial scale. Both combustion
and pyrolysis will be investigated. The ultimate goal is to create an efficient
and environmentally friendly thermal treatment process for PWB wastes to recycle
the energy contained therein by extracting fuels, recovering precious metals,
and avoiding pollution from the process. Both graduate and undergraduate
students will participate in the research. A homepage on "Recycling of
Electronic Wastes" will be built, and a course on the recycling of materials
will be taught every spring semester.
