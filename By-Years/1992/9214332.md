A unique free electron laser (FEL) system, tunable in the far-infrared (FIR)
system portion of the electromagnetic spectrum will be acquired from AT&amp;T
Bell Laboratories and installed in renovated laboratory space at Rutgers
University. The instrument consists of a high current microtron electron
accelerator, an electron beamline with quadruple and dipole magnets, a helical
undulator electromagnet, ancillary optics, optical devices and high vacuum
equipment. Laboratory renovation required for installation of the
instrumentation consists primarily of the excavation and masonry of an
underground vault for radiation shielding of the FEL and modernization of
existing laboratory space for a multidisciplinary research program utilizing the
system. The FEL laboratory will be the major scientific research facility of its
type in the eastern United States. Research will be conducted in the fields of
physics, chemistry, biophysics and materials science. Initial areas for study
include linear and nonlinear time resolved FIR spectroscopy , relativistic
electron physics, and advanced instrumentation development. Specific experiments
planned include the study of superconductors including high Tc materials and
Buckyball superconductors, compound semiconductors and devices, DNA and other
important biological molecules, and chemical kinetics. Training of undergraduate
and graduate students will be included in this facility.
