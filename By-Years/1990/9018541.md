Work just completed has shown that the isotopic fractionation accompanying
photosynthetic fixation of carbon by marine algae can be related to the
concentration of dissolved CO>.>2 in surface waters. Specifically, during the
past 100 kyr, the carbon>.>isotopic difference between planktonic foraminiferal
carbonate and C>.>37 diunsaturated ketones produced by coccolithophorid algae
has varied in proportion to the partial pressure of CO>.>2 in the atmosphere.
This phenomenon can be understood in terms of the molecular processes involved
in carbon fixation, and it is the goal of this work to determine whether a
consistent quantitative relationship between CO>.>2 levels (oceanic and
atmospheric) and isotopic fractionation can be established. If so, it should be
possible to define a "paleobarometer" for CO>.>2 and to examine the variation of
levels of this important greenhouse gas over tens, if not hundreds, of millions
of years of earth history.
