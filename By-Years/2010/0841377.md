Scientists as Teachers ? Teachers as Scientists&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project addresses two significant issues; the need to improve graduate students
education and training for careers either in or outside the laboratory, and for
the educational and research communities to collaborate at all levels of the
educational spectrum to improve K12 science
achievement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the project include: Improved
communication, collaboration, team building and leadership (graduate fellows);
improved outreach and collaborations (STEM faculty); increased professional
development and research laboratory skills (high school teachers); increased
science achievement and interest in STEM careers (high school students);
improved graduate education (Temple University). Key elements of this project
are: (1) a required science ethics course for all Fellows; (2) a professional
development program that STEM faculty and teaching and learning experts will
pilot with the intent to incorporate into a college-wide permanent addition to
the graduate programs; (3) the GK Fellows in-school component, and (4) GK
Fellows /teacher summer institute which will combine pedagogy, content, and
laboratory research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the project
includes the immediate affect all participants by improving STEM graduate
education at Temple University and increasing collaborative relationships
between a large urban university and the complex urban school district of
Philadelphia. On-line and in-person dissemination of the outcomes will support
the wider impact of the project. Changes in the graduate science programs will
have lasting effects on the participants and future Temple University students
throughout their careers and students at other universities implementing
elements of our project. &lt;br/&gt;
