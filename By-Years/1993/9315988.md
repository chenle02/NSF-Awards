9315988 Van der Voo Major curves or bends in orogenic belts occur in most
orogens, however their origin is complex and not well understood. Paleomagentic
data, for example, indicate that some rotations appear to pre-date the
development of major folds and thrusts, while others clearly post-date the
folds. This study will combine paleomagnetic and magnetic fabric study of three
representative oroclines to help define the temporal relations between folding,
remagnetization, rotation and strain. Results should provide important kinematic
constraints on the evolution of curved fold and thrust belts.
