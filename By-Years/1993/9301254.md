The project investigates problems within three broad areas of computational
geometry: (1) design and implementation of efficient and robust geometric
primitives, (2) algorithmic complexity of multidimensional searching and (3)
mathematical tools (e.g. discrepancy theory) for randomized (and derandomized)
geometric algorithms. These areas cover the spectrum from practical
considerations which arise when implementing and debugging geometric algorithms
to theoretical questions arising in algorithm design and lower bound proofs.
Tools continue to be built which can ultimately be used to produce and share
geometric software.
