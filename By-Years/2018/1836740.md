There is little knowledge established regarding the phototoxicity of fluorescent
molecular imaging agents at doses and exposure levels used for imaging, as well
as best practices for safety testing of products incorporating these agents.
This project fills a major gap by quantitatively characterizing the reactive
oxygen species (ROS) generation and cytotoxic potential of common agents. The
findings will provide critical regulatory science data needed for a
comprehensive approach to safety evaluation. The PI will identify photoproduct
and cytotoxicity assays that are robust, validated and suitable for use. This
research will generate journal articles to elucidate these photochemical safety
issues and guide future medical product developers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;This work will ensure consistency in regulatory reviews; address
additional issues such as spectral dependency and the impact of tissue
scattering in determining safety thresholds, while also helping to evaluate the
need for future research on genotoxicity testing of fluorescence imaging
products. . This work will provide a strong foundation for establishment of
standardized best practices for evaluating the phototoxicity of emerging
fluorescence agents. The proposed research will be seamlessly integrated with
educational, mentoring, and outreach activities to advance the cross-
disciplinary program in the field of Biophotonics and regulatory science. The
research results will be disseminated broadly through journal publications,
conferences, and workshops held jointly at FDA and UMD. This work will be
presented at international conferences on biomedical optics, molecular imaging,
and photobiology. The findings will be presented to regulatory reviewers in CDRH
to make informed regulatory decisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
