Single crystal and powder X-ray crystallography is the most powerful analytical
method for structure determination of solids. In synthetic inorganic, organic,
bioinorganic and organometallic chemistry, single crystal X-ray diffraction is
an invaluable tool to characterize molecular structure, whereas powder
diffraction determines purity. The information gained from the knowledge of the
intermolecular composition and structure helps to develop new reactions of
potentially general interest in catalysis or organic synthesis. This award from
the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program will help the Department of
Chemistry at the Iowa State University acquire a single-crystal X-ray
diffractometer and a powder diffraction system. Among the areas of chemical
research that will be enhanced by the acquisition are the following: l. Solid
state chemistry of metal-metal bonded cluster, chain and sheet systems 2. High-
temperature solid state chemistry of binary and ternary phases 3. Precursors to
carbides, nitrides and oxides of metals and nonmetals 4. Ultra-thin mixed metal
oxide film structures 5. Organo-element chemistry where the element is silicon,
germanium, tin, phosphorus, arsenic, mercury or a transition metal 6.
