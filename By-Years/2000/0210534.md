Traditional methods of particle classification such as ultrasonic sieves and
cyclones do not operate in the submicron range. The PI proposes deelopment of a
novel method for particle size classification in the nanoscale range. The method
is based on simultaneous application of pulsed and continuous DC electric fields
on charged metallic particles in non-acqueous suspensions. In this setup,
continuous DC fields are applied in the vertical direction, while pulsed DC
field is applied in the horizontal direction. because of the difference in the
electrophoretic response of charged particles to pulsed and continuous fields,
the particle velocity field will be dependent on the particle size. This
principle is used to classify submicron size particles.
