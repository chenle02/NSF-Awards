9720643 Ballinger The Nebraska EPSCoR program will focus new infrastructure
developments in three targeted research areas as well as maintain existing
efforts supporting the statewide office to promote research competitiveness
through S&amp;T planning, outreach and education, technology transfer, and
faculty development. The targeted areas include development of computational
capacity and computer networking for scientists and engineers at the University
of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) and the University of Nebraska at Omaha (UNO) and
enhancement of research in peptide-based bioorganic chemistry at Creighton
University (CU). Infrastructure enhancement in these areas builds on strengths
of the participating research universities, is consistent with on-going program
development and strategic plans, and seeks to improve the state's R&amp;D
competitiveness in specifically identified areas. Infrastructure developments in
the three targeted areas will involve up-grading computational facilities and
computer networking environments at UNL and UNO and obtaining state-of-the-art
laboratory equipment at CU. Mechanisms, including training and maintenance, to
assist faculty and student researchers in the use of these improvements will
enhance research competitiveness in a broad range of disciplines that require
computational and analytical capabilities. The infrastructure improvements will
greatly enhance the range and depth of research projects that are not presently
possible with the existing infrastructure. Nebraska EPSCoR will continue to
provide opportunities for planning and development of the state's science and
engineering research capacity as well as assist the Nebraska Technology
Development Corporation in enhancing private sector interactions and development
of SBIR/STTR grant proposals.
