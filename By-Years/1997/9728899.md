972889 ROBINOW The selective loss of neurons is an important process in the
development of a functional nervous system. Cell death within the nervous system
is developmentally programmed and generally occurs by apoptosis, an intrinsic
mechanism of cellular suicide that is employed by most, if not all, cells that
die during the course of development. The programming of neuron death is
conferred not only by neuronal identity, but also by developmental signals such
as the titer of steroid hormones and the availability of trophic factors. These
developmental signals are likely to act by regulating the expression of genes
that either induce or prevent apoptosis in specific neurons. Invertebrates offer
a useful system in which to investigate the developmental regulation of
apoptosis, because they have relatively simple nervous systems in which
individual doomed neurons can be reliably re-identified in every animal. In the
fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, five genes have been identified that control
apoptosis. Expression of the genes "reaper", "grim" and "hid" induce apoptosis,
whereas expression of the genes DIAP1 and DIAP2 inhibit apoptosis. Dr. Robinow
will investigate the expression of these five genes in two independent sets of
doomed neurons. The death of these doomed neurons can be prevented by treatment
with the steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone. Previous work has shown that
steroid hormone treatment prevents the up-regulation of the reaper gene in one
set of doomed neurons. Dr. Robinow will investigate whether steroid hormone
treatment prevents death by altering the expression of others of these genes.
Experiments are planned that will also begin to address the mechanism by which
steroid hormone prevents reaper expression. Results from the project will
further our understanding of nervous system assembly by characterizing the
mechanisms by which steroid hormones act to regulate the expression of genes
that control apoptosis.
