*** 9760945 Meehan This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
use NSF-sponsored research on SnGe films to develop of an infrared two-
dimensional SnxGel-x photoconductive array on Si substrates. The direct bandgap
of the SnxGel-x (O<x<0.15) varies from 0.8eV to 0.25eV. There is a potential of
covering a wavelength range extending beyond 4@m into the far-infrared region
with increasing Sn concentrations. The goal of the proposed Phase I project will
be to demonstrate that high quality, 4x4 photoconductive arrays can be
fabricated using p-type SnxGel-x films (x=0.15)grown on Si substrates. Material
issues will be addressed including characterization of defects, exploration of
the bandgap versus composition, and the development of n-type material. Ohmic
and Schoftky contacts the SnGe films will be developed as well as electrical and
optical isolation techniques. Characterization of the devices will include
responsivity as a function of wavelength and temperature, S/N ratio, and the
high speed response time. Processes will be developed that will enable the
development of larger arrays integrated with Si circuitry" in Phase II.
Applications requiring a stable, low cost, mid-IR detector include threshold
sensing and quantitative measurements such as fire detection, night vision,
thermal imaging and optical chemical spectroscopy. ***
