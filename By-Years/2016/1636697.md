The Q-Bio (Quantitative Biology) Conference brings together a community of
researchers interested in developing a theory-driven and predictive
understanding of biology. Such an understanding provides not only insight into
basic biological phenomena, but is also a foundation for advances in
biotechnology, agriculture and medicine. The conference will bring together
researchers working in biology, mathematics, physics, chemistry, computer
science and engineering, and broaden participation in this emerging area by
supporting the attendance of early career researchers, women and members of
groups under-represented in the field. Through encouragement and support of the
attendance of junior researchers (including postdoctoral fellows and graduate
students) the conference will provide opportunities for them to meet with
senior, leading investigators to exchange ideas and information, thereby helping
to train the next generation of researchers in the
field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Conference will include keynote talks, oral
presentations and opportunities for poster presentations; these will all be
organized around a common set of themes. These themes will be: Cellular
processes and signaling networks in prokaryotes and eukaryotes; Ecology and
evolution of cellular collectives; Mechanisms of force sensing, transmission and
generation and their relationship to signaling processes; Stochasticity in
cellular signaling; Computational methods in the study of systems-level cellular
processes; Metabolic processes and cellular signaling.
