This project will determine the distribution of the shallower branch of the
deep western boundary current delineated by a distinct core of water with high
CFM at 4-5 deg. C. The identification of sources for this water in the southern
Labrador Sea and the processes leading to its formation and modification are
primary objectives of this field program. Variations in the formation of deep
western boundary currents are hypothesized as a major contributor to widespread
climate changes.
