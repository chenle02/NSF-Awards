The goal of this proposal is to expand and enhance a laboratory course in cell
and molecular biology by providing opportunities for students to participate in
semester-length research projects to study the storage, processing, and transfer
of genetic information in biological systems. An ultracentrifuge, phase-contrast
microscope, UV spectrophotometer, and electrophoretic apparatus are requested to
conduct experiments involving plasmid DNA isolation, DNA cloning, and
