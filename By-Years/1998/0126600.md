The objectives of this collaborative project are to improve post-calculus
students' learning of probability and statistics and to provide students with
better preparation for their future careers in mathematics and statistics,
mathematics education, and computer science. These objectives are being achieved
by focusing on active and cooperative learning, visualization of concepts, and
use of simulations in post-calculus introductory probability and statistics
courses at Athens State University and Middle Tennessee State University via the
adaptation and implementation of two recently developed National Science
Foundation funded materials. The materials are (a) A Data-Oriented, Active
Learning, Post-Calculus Introduction to Statistical Concepts, Methods, and
Theory (DUE-9950476) and the (b) Virtual Laboratories in Probability and
Statistics (DUE-9652870). Project activities include faculty enhancement at the
institutions, the respective institutional adaptation and implementation (A&I)
of the materials, the evaluation of the A&I of the materials, and the assessment
of students learning while using the materials. The University of Alabama
Huntsville is providing the evaluation.
