Education Development Center proposes a four-year project, "Fostering Geometric
Thinking in the Middle Grades (FGT)," to develop a research-based professional
development curriculum focused on geometric thinking in the middle grades, which
will serve teachers in grades 5 through 9. FGT will confront a major national
education challenge: On the TIMMS international comparisons, U.S. eighth-grade
students' weakest performances were in the areas of geometry and measurement.
Furthermore, at the end of grade 12, the U.S. scores in geometry were the lowest
of all participating countries. To meet this challenge, FGT will (1) expand the
research knowledge base on students' geometric thinking, teachers' understanding
of geometric thinking, and their application of this understanding to the
classroom; and (2) add to the research base on the design of effective models of
professional development for teachers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FGT will meet these
goals by working with nearly 220 teachers in grades 5-9 and developing:
&lt;br/&gt;A Framework designed to help teachers better understand geometric
thinking and how it develops in learners;&lt;br/&gt;A Curriculum for
professional development in geometry based on this framework; Quantitative and
qualitative studies of the impact of the curriculum; and Research reports
disseminating the results of this work. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
