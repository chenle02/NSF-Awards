Experiments are proposed on the details of vapor-adsorption at the free surface
of a binary liquid mixture. On approaching the liquid critical temperature, the
adsorption also becomes "critical"; its "profile" (CAP) has been the object of
much research, both theoretical and experimental, in recent years. There are
numerous practical consequences such as the particular behavior of colloids and
of liquid mixtures in random media. They propose to examine some of the
important questions re CAP using the sensitive technique of evanescent-wave
ellipsometry (EWE).
