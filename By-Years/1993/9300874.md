P# 9300874 Desjardin This three year project seeks to document, describe and
illustrate the diversity, systematics and geographic distribution of the
Agaricales (basidiomycete fungi) of the Hawaiian Islands. These fungi play a
vital ecological role in nutrient cycling in forest communities. Only 100
species out of an estimated diversity of 250 species have been reported from
Hawaii. The primary product will be a complete database of all specimens
(including distribution, plant associates, plant community types), which will
contribute to an Agaricales flora of the Hawaiian Islands. The results of the
flora will allow the testing of hypotheses of island biogeography, vicariance,
dispersal and fungal endemism, and will contribute to a reconstruction of the
biotic history of the Hawaiian Islands and the maintenance of its biodiversity.
The degree of urbanization in Hawaii makes this project extremely urgent and
extremely important to conservation planning by land managers. The fungal
collections will be used for research and for training students. .%%% This three
year project will survey, describe and illustrate the diversity and geographic
distribution of the Agaricales fungi (mushrooms and allies) of the Hawaiian
Islands. These fungi play a vital ecological role in nutrient cycling in forest
communities, yet only 100 species out of an estimated diversity of 250 species
have been reported from Hawaii. The primary product of this study will be a
complete database of all specimens of fungi, their distribution on the islands,
their particular association with specific plants and their membership in
specific plant communities. This database will be issued as a complete,
illustrated manual. The results of the survey will also help investigators to
reconstruct of the biotic history of the Hawaiian Islands and to plan the
maintenance of its biodiversity. The degree of urbanization in Hawaii makes this
project extremely urgent and extremely important to conservation planning by
land managers. The plant collections will be used for research and for training
students. *** ` h p x (# ` h p x (#
