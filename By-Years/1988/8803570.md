In 1941, Dr. Lewis Leakey discovered the remains of a fossil primate termed
"Proconsul" in deposits on Rusinga Island in Western Kenya. Over the last
several years with NSF support, Dr. Alan Walker and his colleagues have
systematically excavated at the original and newly discovered sites to increase
the sample of Proconsul remains. To date, they have collected well over 800
specimens. Postcranial remains are particularly noteworthy, and analysis
indicates that at least nine individuals, ranging in age from infancy through
adulthood, are represented. With continued support, Drs. Walker, Teaford and
colleagues will continue to collect material. They will, however, focus their
attention on the restoration and analysis of the entire sample. Since many
specimens are in a fragmentary state, extensive refitting and restoration is
necessary. The investigators will provide the first functional interpretations
of certain areas of the skeleton, such as the pelvis. They will also apply
relatively new methods such as finite element scaling analysis and dental
microwear analyses to help determine how growth occurred and how Proconsul moved
through and utilized its environment. The genus Proconsul flourished during the
Miocene, which dates from ca. 25 to 4 million years ago. This period saw the
appearance and radiation of many species of apes, including the Proconsuls.
While most went extinct, one line led to the African great apes and to humans.
While Proconsul probably lies outside this direct line of descent, it can
provide important information on the more general group from which this lineage
emerged. This sample is particularly important because it includes many
postcranial specimens which because of their fragile nature are generally
underrepresented in the primate fossil record. With these remains, it will be
possible to obtain a more complete picture of the several Proconsul species and
to determine how they moved through their environment. Many scientists will be
interested not only in the team's conclusions, but also in the basic data.
