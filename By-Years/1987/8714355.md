This project will provide partial operational support for the Culture
Collection of Algae at the University of Texas at Austin. The Collection insures
that important algal stocks which are essential for a wide range of research
activities are preserved for present and future scientists. It serves as a
center from which stocks of algae of known systematic determination and of known
quality can be obtained. Project funds will be used for technical assistance
needed for the maintenance of the cultures and for the convening of an annual
meeting of the Collection's advisory committee.
