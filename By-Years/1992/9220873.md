Plants from high resource levels are typically fast-growers and rapid consumers
of resources, while plants from low resource levels are slow-growers with
conservative, efficient use of resources. In the proposed set of studies we will
be determining the degree to which this general pattern holds for resources
ranging from nutrients and water (below ground resources for plants) to light
(an above ground resource). Our experiments will attempt to resolve some knotty
questions about the general pattern of adaptation to low and high resources: Are
the relationships described above caused by the environment, or is there a
genetic basis to them? What genetic tradeoffs prevent simultaneous adaptation to
both low and high resources? (i.e., why shouldn't a plant be both efficient and
rapidly-growing?) Finally, can we demonstrate that natural selection acts on
traits relevant to resource use, resource acquisition and growth in natural
environments? The results of this research will have direct relevance to the
impacts of humans on natural plant populations because the environmental
perturbations caused by humans often directly or indirectly affect resource
availability. In addition, our research is directed toward improving the
mechanistic understanding of natural selection in wild plant populations, thus
linking plant physiological ecology to plant population biology, two fields
which have developed largely in isolation over the past three decades.//
