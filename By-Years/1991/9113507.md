The National Institutes of Health, Agency for International Development and
National Science Foundation will sponsor a workshop on "Drug Development,
Biodiversity and Economic Growth." The workshop will convene governmental
leaders and scientists from developing countries, representatives from the
pharmaceutical industry, and agency personnel to discuss the valuation and
preservation of biological diversity. One mechanism for assigning value to
naturally occurring organisms is the screening of plants and animals for
medically useful chemicals; the workshop attendees will evaluate current
screening activities, discuss the need to also gather information about the
traditional uses of plants and animals by indigenous peoples, and recommend ways
in which the three sponsoring agencies can work together to support the
inventorying and preservation of biological diversity in developing countries.
