This proposal requests funds to purchase an automated protein sequencing system.
This system will become part of a protein chemistry core facility which will
provide Worcester Foundation scientists with readily available expertise and
equipment for the characterization of protein structure. Five major users have
proposed projects that will utilize the instrumentation. These include
structural and functional properties of DNA polymerase alpha, hormone regulated
GTP-binding proteins, mammalian pheromones, microtubule-associated proteins and
dynein ATPase function in flagellar motility.
