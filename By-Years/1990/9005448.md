This project is concerned with the design of algorithms and programming
environments for parallel computer systems containing large numbers of
interconnected processors. The goals are to develop some of the generic
algorithmic techniques that users of such systems will require, to determine
what primitive operations should be included in a high-level parallel
programming language, and to solve some of the algorithmic problems that will
arise in the implementation of such primitive operations. The operations of
particular interest relate to set-oriented data structures and combinatorial
search. The approach to the efficient implementation of these operations uses
ideas from randomized load balancing, parallel tree search and dynamic tree
embedding. In order to support high-level parallel programming, efficient
algorithms for sorting in the presence of faulty processors, message routing and
synchronization control are also investigated.
