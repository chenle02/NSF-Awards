This project is a renewal of the DC I-Corps Node for the midatlantic and
southeast region led by the University of Maryland College Park (UMD), in
partnership with the George Washington University (GWU), Virginia Tech (VT), and
Johns Hopkins (JHU). The DMV Node has a history of utilizing collective
university resources, experience in successful technology startup formation, and
skilled at entrepreneurial education bringing significant contributions and
assets to the National Innovation Network (NIN). The Node will continue to
operate as a "regional network", and uses a management model of cooperation and
collaboration that sets a standard for the NIN. The Node is also integrating
I-Corps concepts into the core curriculum for over 3,000 students of all majors.
The Node intends to pursue multiple research initiatives to further improve the
program outcomes, and will continue to teach innovators about customer
discovery, commercial readiness and the development of sustainable business
models. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will continue to contribute a wide
range of I-Corps materials, training practices, and curricula built upon its
prior activities. These program components will be tailored to suit students,
faculty, and other regional innovators. The Node will continue to work closely
with Howard University (an I-Corps Site) to bring more I-Corps teams from this
leading Historically Black College and University (HBCU). The Node will also
collaborate with engineering research groups to provide women entrepreneurs
training through I-Corps. Finally, the Node will continue to serve a wide
geographic area with a very diverse demographic of innovators and entrepreneurs,
including urban and rural populations. The DC Node will improve the success rate
of technology transfer and commercialization from world-leading research
universities and federal labs by creating new venture or licensing opportunities
for program participants.
