DMS-9500466 Friedlander Recent results of Friedlander and Vishik give a
sufficient condition for linear instability of a steady Euler flow. It is
proposed to extend this work in several directions. Friedlander is showing that
for classes of PDE, including the Euler equations, linear instability under
certain spectral conditions implies nonlinear instability. Using the theory of
oscillatory integrals it is proposed to extend the instability criteria to the
more complicated system of magnetohydrodynamics. Another line of research is the
study of the completeness of a system of Floquet root vectors for time periodic
problems of fluid dynamics. Aspects of this work will be undertaken in
collaboration with M.M. Vishik, W. Strauss and V.I. Yudovich. The question of
stability/instability of fluid motion is a classical problem that has received
much attention in the past 100 years. It is fundamental to studies in
meteorology, oceanography, geophysics, astrophysics and plasma physics where
physical phenomena are governed by the underlying fluid instabilities. Despite
its long history, a number of important questions remain open. It is proposed to
increase our understanding of the fundamental behaviour of fluids by studying
the mathematical partial differential equations that describe fluid flow .
