9404657 Kapouleas The research covers topics related to the construction of
Einstein metrics using perturbation techniques. Included is the geometric study
of classes of Ricci-flat complete manifolds of 4- dimensions. Solutions to the
hyperbolic Einstein's equation will also be investigated. The research has
potential applications to general relativity theory in theoretical physics. ***
