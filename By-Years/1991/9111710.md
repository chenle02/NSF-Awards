A user mode research program will be carried out in nuclear structure studies
using light and heavy ions. The interaction mechanisms and formation (in heavy
ion reactions) of complex fragments will be explored. Data will provide the
basis for phenomenological models of complex light ion scattering and
fragmentation in heavy ion central collisions. Also, research will be conducted
on alpha-particle clustering and knockout reactions. This data will be used to
extract spectroscopic information, and to test early hypotheses regarding alpha
clustering in the low-density nuclear surface region. Undergraduate student
involvement is a very important element of this research. Some detector and data
acquisition development, data analysis, interpretation, and other related
activities will be carried out at the University of Michigan Dearborn Campus.
