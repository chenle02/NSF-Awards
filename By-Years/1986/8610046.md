This project will investigate a combination of concepts which may lead to better
performance of the concrete material. The two concepts which are being merged
are: the use of roller compacted concrete which requires less cement in addition
to poorer grades of aggregates, because high grade aggregates are becoming
scarce, and the use of steel fibers to provide extra tensile strength and
durability to the concrete. The potential benefits to be derived are: possible
overall economies, longer life for the pavement, and thinner pavements because
of the extra strength. The results will be of benefit to local, state, Federal
agencies, and industry concerned with highways, airports, parking areas, and
industrial building construction.
