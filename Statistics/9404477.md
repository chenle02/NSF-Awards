The Principal Investigator plans to study several problems in design of
experiments. The projection properties of orthogonal arrays and some other
designs will be investigated. Recent research has shown that interesting
projection properties of certain orthogonal arrays have important statistical
implications. The newly introduced concept of estimation capacity, a measure of
the capability of a design to handle and estimate different potential models
involving interactions, will also be investigated. In addition to factorial
designs, the Principal Investigator will study optimal and efficient regression
designs under random block-effects models. Other proposed research includes the
Principal Investigator's collaboration with Professor Ker-Chau Li on the study
of dimension reduction techniques for the analysis of data from designed
experiments. Such techniques, in conjunction with dynamic graphics, can help
extract additional useful information that may not be provided by traditional
analyses. The resulting design issues will also be studied. Experimental design
is used extensively in a wide range of scientific and industrial investigations.
In industrial experiments, often a large number of factors have to be studied,
but the experiments are expensive to conduct. Fractional factorial designs are
particularly useful to handle this problem. In recent years, factorial designs
have received considerable attention, mainly due to the Japanese success in
applying them to improve quality in industrial manufacturing. This re-surgence
of interest provides an opportunity to re-examine some conventional wisdom. This
will be given the highest priority in the Principal Investigator's research
activities during the coming years. In addition to theoretical studies, good
designs will also be constructed for experimenters' use. Other proposed research
includes a problem arising from a recent optometry experiment, and the study of
the performance of a new data-analyt ic tool on experimental data.
