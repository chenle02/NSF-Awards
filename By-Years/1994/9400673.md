9400673 Rosenberg Research in the structure and scattering of atomic systems,
their interaction with radiation and with fundamental atomic forces, the so-
called "Casimir forces" will be continued and extended to new physical
situations. Mathematical techniques involving the formulation of variational
principles, minimum principles, and semi-classical approaches etc. will be
developed to attack problems involving long-range forces, laser-matter
interactions and QED. The approaches involve a mix of formalism and computation
useful for training graduate students and postdoctorals in modern atomic theory.
