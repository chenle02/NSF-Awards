Abstract

Children, Sport, and Character Development

David L. Shields

This project seeks to investigate the efficacy of sport in character
development. There is a surprising paucity of research evidence to support the
widely acclaimed benefits of sports in character development.

The project will engage a focus group of local coaches to assist in refining
research ideas about the moral culture of sport teams and the means by which the
moral culture can be enhanced. The intent is to develop three developmentally-
tailored "guidebooks" for coaches, and this would greatly assist with that
project.

A second objective is to conduct in-depth interviews with the basketball players
and coaches of 12 teams (2 male and 2 female teams at each of three levels:
junior high/youth sport, interscholastic, and intercollegiate). These semi-
structured, open-ended interviews will focus on perceptions of team moral
culture and will provide one source of in-put for the further development of the
Team Culture Questionnaire (TCQ).

The project will also consult with the leadership of three major training
programs for coaches: Michigan State's Youth Sports Institute, the Positive
Coaching Alliance at Stanford University, and Maine's Center for Coaching
Education. These programs were selected because they regularly train large
numbers of volunteer and part-time coaches through workshops and seminars. They
represent the types of organizations, through which most youth sport coaches
will be trained, if they are trained at all. It is worth noting that of the 21
graduate programs that offer degrees in coaching, none have required course that
focus on the coaches' role in character education, and only three - Ohio
University, Smith College, and Western Michigan University - have required
courses in sport ethics. The purpose of these consultations is to identify and
evaluate the ways in which character education is integrated into these select
institution's coach training methods. These activities, taken together, will
help to develop a research agenda.
