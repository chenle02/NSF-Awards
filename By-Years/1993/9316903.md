x @ h h h h tX @ 2 < < 9316903 Sozen This is an equipment grant to acquire
research equipment dedicated primarily to dynamic experiments by (1) replacement
of the current VAXII with a 4 Mb memory by a SUN SPARC System (SIOGX 30 325)
with a 32 Mb memory, (2) enhancement of the disk capacity from 480 Mb to 5200
Mb, (3) improvement of the accelerometer filters to enable acquisition of
reliable data at high (30 Hz and above) frequencies, (4) purchase of state of
the art optical transducers to facilitate instrumentation for displacement, and
(5) acquisition of hardware and software to accelerate and improve presentation
of acquired data. These research equipment to be acquired are essential to
maintain the seismic experimental research capability at the University of
Illinois at a high, productive level. ***
