The field of dynamical systems studies qualitative and measure theoretic
properties of systems that evolve in time, including iterated mappings, ordinary
differential equations, and partial differential equations. Various ideas in
dynamical systems, such as bifurcation, chaos, and strange attractors, have
applications in a variety of scientific areas. This project will support the
1992 Southeast Dynamical Systems Conference to be held from April 3-5, 1992 at
North Carolina State University. In the southeast, there are active dynamical
systems groups at about a dozen universities and for the past three years the
Southeast Dynamical Systems Conference has promoted exchanges of ideas among
these groups. The conference will include nine invited lectures and will promote
interaction among senior researchers and recent doctoral recipients and graduate
students.
