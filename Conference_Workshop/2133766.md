This NSF award supports the travel of U.S. based mathematicians to the
international conference "Math Circles Around the World" scheduled to take place
in St. Petersburg, Russia, July 1?3, 2022, as a satellite to the International
Congress of Mathematicians. The conference is dedicated to mathematics
enrichment programs and research experiences for school students. Over the next
decades these programs will have a major impact on the future development of
STEM disciplines in the United States. Early engagement of school students in
advanced math activities is today?s investment in the future of science and
technology. Participation of the US delegation will inspire more active
engagement of professional mathematicians into math outreach programs and help
advocate recruitment and retention of diverse populations to math programs for
school students. In the long run this experience will have a very positive
impact on the scientific community in the United States.

Conference participants will review existing practices of dissemination of
mathematics, advertise the achievements of math circle programs in the USA,
develop deeper understanding of the context of mathematical culture in different
countries, establish new international collaborations, and acquire practical
skills that include recruitment and retention of more diverse population into
STEM education. The project seeks to broaden the diversity of participation of
the meeting and to increase international visibility of the US-based leaders of
math circles. Mathematicians at an early stage of their careers and
underrepresented groups will especially benefit from the travel support for this
conference. More information about the conference is found at the website:

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
