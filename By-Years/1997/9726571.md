9726571 Andersen Montana State University provides a 3-year Research Experiences
for Teachers and Students project serving 20 students entering 11th grade and 10
teachers each year. The project conducts a 3-year statewide research project
focused on a theme of Western Water Resources. School teams take part in a
4-week summer institute to establish mentorships with faculty, staff, and
researchers and develop relevant research and problem solving skills prior to
initiating their research projects. An electronic network links participants and
MSU faculty and researchers during the academic year, providing continuing
interaction, research direction, and research-related short courses. School
teams lead and participate in statewide workshops focused on integrating
research into the high school curriculum.
