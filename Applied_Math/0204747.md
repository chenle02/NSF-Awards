Title: RUI: Spatial and Temporal Variation in Smoldering Combustion

Models of smoldering combustion require a description of porous fluid flow as
well as a description of the reaction process. The resulting partial
differential equations are highly nonlinear, making description of the solutions
difficult. Numerical simulations involving adaptive methods which change
resolution as the process evolves are necessary to resolve these solutions.
Asymptotic methods have also been successful in describing steady and slowly
varying approximate solutions to these models. The proposed project involves
extending both asymptotic and numerical methods in order to study non-steady and
spatially varying smolder combustion. These techniques will then be used to
describe the details of the dynamics and transitions of these solutions. The
techniques developed will likely be applicable in other areas of combustion and
problems of flow in porous media. This project should be of interest to
scientists using asymptotic methods, using adaptive numerical methods for high-
performance computing, interested in issues of stability of solutions with many
time scales, or interested in the development of chaotic solutions. The results
should be of particular interest to fire safety experts and combustion control
engineers who wish to understand dynamics of smoldering near extinction limits,
transitions from smoldering to flaming and patterns such as fingering of smolder
waves as they move through materials.

Smoldering combustion refers to fire in a porous medium in which the oxygen
supply to the reaction site is limited, for example when it must flow through
the porous substance to reach the fuel. Smolder is often a precursor to airborne
flames and is particularly dangerous because of the amount of smoke produced and
the difficulty of ensuring extinction. When controlled, smolder also has
important applications to material synthesis (high temperature synthesis) and to
the design of timing devices (fuses). A better understanding of the processes
controlling smolder combustion will enhance fire safety as well as allow better
control for engineering uses of smoldering combustion. This Research in
Undergraduate Institutions project includes a training program and participation
of several undergraduate students, mentored by the principal investigator.
