The investigator will continue his longstanding project with Henry King of the
University of Maryland to formulate topological characterizations of manifolds
which can support the structure of real algebraic varieties. The subgroup of
algebraic cycles within the homology figures prominently in this work, and
surprisingly, this year, they have shown that certain obstructions vanish if one
allows singular varieties. A second direction for the investigator's research
involves gauge theory and its role in the study of 4-manifolds. A final
direction concerns the question of Nash: do all closed smooth manifolds have
rational structure?
