This grant supports the fieldwork and research for Thiago Chacon's doctoral
dissertation on the grammar of Kubeo (Cubeo), a Tukanoan language spoken on the
Uaupes (Vaup√©s) River and its tributaries along the border of Brazil and
Colombia. Despite having approximately 4,000 speakers, Kubeo is in critical
condition. The degree of language vitality varies by location: in smaller
villages, the language is transmitted to children; in larger villages, the
children "refuse" to speak Kubeo, shifting to either Portuguese or Spanish.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this dissertation research is to provide an
in-depth description of the grammar of Kubeo, with particular emphasis on the
analysis of the unusual and unique linguistic traits found in this language,
such as nasal harmony, unusual properties of tone, a complex system of
evidentials, serial verbs, and the noun classifier system. The analysis will
contribute to central issues in linguistic typology, increasing understanding of
what is possible in human languages and what the limitations with regard to
these linguistic features are. The dissertation also will expand knowledge of
historical linguistics (language change) and language contact in this region of
the Amazon, which has been of particular scientific interest. The dissertation
research benefits from and contributes to the commitment of Kubeo people to
document and preserve their language and cultural heritage.
