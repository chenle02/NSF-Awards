9726032 Chang This Americas Program award will support a planning meeting for a
regional workshop in materials research. The planning meeting, which will take
place in Sao Carlos, Brazil, at the Universidade Federale do Sao Carlos will
convene organizers from Brazil, Argentina, and Chile to develop an agenda for
the regional workshop that will include representatives from most of the
southern cone countries of South America. Expected outcomes of this planning
meeting will be: definition of workshop goals, criteria for selection and number
of participants, identification of workshop site and possible related site
visits, selection of date and duration of the workshop, workshop design,
definition of deliverables, and an agreed planning schedule and budget. This
planning meeting is being organized by Dr. Robert Chang of Northwestern
University and Dr. Kathleen Taylor of General Motors Corporation for the U.S.
