9321350 Harbor This award is for support for a project to use a finite element
model for cross-sectional flow to constrain sliding and flow laws for the Haut
Glacier d'Arolla (Switzerland). By varying sliding law exponents, the
piezometric surface form and position, and the pattern of basil friction it will
be possible to constrain the range of conditions that yields velocity fields
consistent with empirical data. This work takes advantage of a unique chance to
test and refine the general sliding law, and an opportunity to explicitly
examine spatial variations in sliding in the context of detailed information on
the temporal and spatial development of the glacier's hydrologic system.
Although this work will be based on data collected in a mid-latitude alpine
area, the results will be of direct relevance to polar glaciology because they
can also be applied to glaciers with temperate (warm based) areas in polar
regions. ***
