This Research Opportunities for Women planning grant will support Dr. Herrero
in reorienting and reactivating her research program in an area of mathematics
that has come to be known as noncommutative algebraic topology. There is a great
deal of activity currently in this field, which draws on ideas from functional
analysis as well as from geometry and topology. The central thrust is to go from
topological spaces to algebras of functions on them and then to more general
sorts of algebras, thereby putting the powerful machinery of differential
geometry and algebraic topology to work on a greater variety of problems.
