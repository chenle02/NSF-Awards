9452408 Abraham The acquisition of a precision grating spectrometer and a beam
profiler will significantly improve intermediate and advanced optics laboratory
instruction at Bryn Mawr College. These two instruments with computer-controlled
data acquisition and data analysis will be used throughout both semester of the
academic year for projects in Zeeman spectroscopy, atomic spectroscopy, analysis
of optical patterns of lasers modes, phase conjugated signals and fiber optics,
and in studies of black body radiation and diffraction patterns. The use of
precision instruments in the training of one of the largest groups of women
physics majors in the country, will enhance their understanding of phenomena in
physical optics, laser physics, nonlinear optics, and atomic spectroscopy. It
will also give them confidence and competence in the use of advanced
instrumentation which will encourage them to pursue careers in experimental
fields and to explore research and advanced experimental work.
