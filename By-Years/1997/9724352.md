This is a request for a cognitive neuroscience research facility comprised of a
topographic EEG/EP mapper that would permit our faculty to engage in state of
the art research in cognitive neuroscience. The essence of this proposal is that
measurement of electrophysiology provides an avenue for performing basic
research on the question of how the brain processes information. In addition, a
computer workstation is requested to permit faculty and students to engage in
the off-line analysis and editing of the data which will result from faculty-
student collaborative research. As our faculty are already heavily engaged in
research with undergraduates that leads to co-authored presentations and
publications and our majors are required to generate their own in their senior
year, this instrumentation will be heavily used.
