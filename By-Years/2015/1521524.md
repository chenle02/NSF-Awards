The 2015 Collective Intelligence Conference in Santa Clara, California, provides
a unique opportunity for graduate students to interact with scholars and
practitioners from universities, businesses, nonprofit organizations, and
various government agencies. The term "collective intelligence" refers to the
processing of information by a group of people and technological resources, in a
manner comparable to but more extensive than the functioning of an individual
human brain. Owing to its interdisciplinary origins, this nascent field attracts
open-minded graduate students willing to step out of their academic silos. The
conference itself will address cutting edge ideas including how collective
intelligence emerges, social computing, crowdsourcing, collective search and
memory, the use of technology to improve collective intelligence, and collective
responses to emergencies and crises such as earthquakes and power outages.
Attendance at the conference will offer students concepts, ideas, and
experiences that will encourage them to do transformative work in their future
careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special graduate student activities will play a
distinct role in the 2015 Conference. A panel discussion on careers in
collective intelligence will offer presentations by leaders in the academy,
business, non-profit sector, and government, and will focus on four key
dimensions: knowledge, tools, questions, and portfolios. In a collective
intelligence syllabus project, students will work in teams to construct possible
syllabi for an upper level undergraduate, interdisciplinary course. A graduate
student challenge will involve students in constructing a set of crowdsourcing
and collective intelligence challenges that can be used in the classroom.
