CISE CNPq: US-Argentina and US-Chile Collaborative Research on Computer Science
and Engineering

This is an award to support two workshops, each of two days duration in May
2000, in Chile and Argentina. It is anticipated that these workshops will build
on the success of the CISE/NSF programs with Mexico and Brazil (CONACyT and
CNPq, respectively) to begin creating the collaborations and personal
connections necessary to support the possibilities for similar government to
government bilateral arrangements with Chile and Argentina.
