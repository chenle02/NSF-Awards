9714368 Coffin Large igneous provinces have been produced by massive
accumulations of basalt produced in the mantle and are represented by features
such as continental flood basalts and ocean plateaus. Although significant in
terms of global geochemical cycling, mantle convection and cooling, and
potentially global climate change, little is known about the specific processes
responsible for production of such large volumes of mantle melt or their
emplacement at the earth's surface. The present award will support participation
of U.S. scientists in a Japanese led study of the Ontong Java Plateau in the
western Pacific which is one of the best examples of an oceanic large igneous
province. Seismic refraction and reflection data will be acquired to examine the
crustal structure and history of formation of the Plateau. Dr. Coffin will have
primary responsibility for processing and interpreting seismic reflection data
to be acquired by the Japanese, and will also be involved in all other aspects
of data interpretation and modelling. Data from the cruise will be used to guide
selection of candidate drill sites for planning by the Ocean Drilling Program.
