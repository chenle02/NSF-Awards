The objectives of this research are to develop compiler and runtime
optimization techniques for parallel programming on homogeneous and
heterogeneous high-performance parallel computers. Specifically, this research
addresses the following issues: (1) Scalable Parallel I/O-Scalable massively
parallel computers must include scalable I/O systems to provide a balance
between computing power and I/O. The thrust of this research is to investigate
compiler transformation for parallelizing I/O operations, stripmining and
prefetching data, overlapping computation and I/O, generate efficient I/O access
schedules, develop runtime support that can recognize and use access patterns to
perform efficient parallel I/O, and develop language primitives that allow users
to specify parallel I/O operations; (2) Automatic Data Distribution for
Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Systems-The goals are to develop algorithms to
automatically generate data distributions that incorporate global analysis, use
realistic cost models, and that allow dynamic alignments, distributions and data
replication; and (3) Runtime Support for Dynamic Data Redistribution-Dynamic
data redistribution may be necessary due to explicit program constructs,
compiler generated distributions, across procedure boundaries, or adaptive
nature of a problem. The goals are to develop parallel algorithms (including
communication scheduling, index conversion, and space optimization) for runtime
support for dynamic data redistribution.
