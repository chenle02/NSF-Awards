9313161 Khonsari The bearing friction torque characteristics of model instrument
ball bearings for ultra-low-speed operation will be determined experimentally
and modeled theoretically. The pre-rolling rest slope and the steady-rolling
friction torque combine to trace out hysteresis loops which determine the
operating characteristics of precision positioning mechanisms. Both liquid
lubricated and thin-film coated surfaces will be studied and the generic
characteristics of these hysteresis loops will be correlated with lubricant
properties and bearing characteristics. ***
