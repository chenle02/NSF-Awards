This award from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program
is in the area of organometallic chemistry. The focus of the project is the
chemistry of transition metal compounds in which two metal atoms are bridged by
an oxygen atom. The results of the project are expected to provide a better
understanding of the behavior of an important class of industrial catalysts,
namely heterogeneous catalysts in which small metal crystallites are supported
on the surfaces of such metal oxides as alumina and silica. The objective of the
project is to develop the chemistry of Group VIII transition metal complexes
having bridging oxo, amido and imido ligands. The research will focus on the
preparation and reactivity of mixed-metal mu-oxo complexes that model metal-
support interactions of oxide supported heterogeneous catalysts, and on the
reactivity of mu-amido and mu-imido ligands relevant to catalytic processes that
could involve these functionalities. Appropriate complexes with these bridging
ligands will be prepared, and their reactivity will be investigated, with
emphasis on reactions that involve directly the M-O and M-N linkages in the
compounds.
