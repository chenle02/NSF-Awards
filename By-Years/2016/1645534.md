2016 Dielectrophoresis Meeting at MIT

This project will provide travel funds to partially support approximately 30
graduate and post doctoral students and junior faculty to attend the 2016
Dielectrophoresis at MIT, in Cambridge, MA from July 13-15, 2016. This meeting
is designed to provide an intimate setting for engineers and scientists with
expertise in dielectrophoresis and non-linear electrokinetics can discuss
research frontiers. Dielectrophoresis is a well-known particle manipulation
technique that has been able to capture, sort, concentrate, and characterize a
variety of particles and biological entities as small as a few nanometers. The
recent, rapid expansion of DEP has demonstrated that this technique is a viable
method for micro-total analytical systems, especially for biological and health
care microsystems. The conference is organized into ten sessions. This meeting
includes a plenary session with a diverse group of eminent researchers that
represents the most exciting advances in non-linear electrokinetics and
dielectrophoresis.

Funding from the National Science Foundation would be used for student and
postdoc conference expenses and junior faculty, enabling more young US engineers
and scientists to participate in Dielectrophoresis 2016. The expected outcomes
include: 1. Enable greater participation by junior faculty and thus facilitating
networking opportunities and establish international collaborations with veteran
researchers. 2. Disseminate public knowledge on dielectrophoresis (and related
topics) with students writing and posting session and conference summaries on
dielectrophoresis.org and live-Tweet Dielectrophoresis 2016. In addition to the
development of human resources, the support provided will allow presentation of
the latest research results from the most innovative academic laboratories
around the country.
