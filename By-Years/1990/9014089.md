Scientists from developing countries will be supported to participate in
scientific activities of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) of
the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment
Programme (UNEP). These scientists will work with colleagues from the United
States and other industrialized countries under the aegis of the IPCC,
particularly its Working Group I, to review the state of climate change with
emphasis on a full-scale and scientifically valid assessment of climate change,
that is, an assess- ment of such change on the global scale. This assessment is
intended to provide valuable input to the Second World Climate Conference later
this year, as well as to the development of a broad range of international and
national global change research programs. Activities to be supported will
include scientific planning meetings and workshops.
