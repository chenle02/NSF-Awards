9322705 Swift Research conducted by this award is a component of the 1994
U.S./Canada Arctic Ocean Section (AOS). The AOS is a collaborative effort with
Canada that involves approximately 60 scientists participating on a Canadian and
a U.S. icebreaker during a 55-day field program in the summer of 1994. The AOS
is under the auspices of the Arctic Systems Science (ARCSS) Global Change
Research Program and research is jointly sponsored by the Division of Ocean
Sciences, the Office of Polar Programs and Office of Naval Research (ONR). Data
collected should be relevant to improving our understanding of how the Arctic is
an indicator of changing global climate conditions and how it affects the
physical, chemical, and biological features of the more temperate oceans and
regions. This project encompasses a service and research program. The
Oceanographic Data Facility (ODF) at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography
will conduct a detailed hydrographic survey consisting of about 100 precision
temperature, conductivity, oxygen, and nutrient profiles at approximately 30 km
intervals along the cruise track. Resulting data will be shared with all
participants. Swift will use the hydrography data to focus on a study of the
origin and circulation of the intermediate and deep waters of the Arctic Ocean
and nearby seas. Parameters to be determined are the surface-to-bottom
distributions and sources of the physical and chemical characteristics, and the
location, origin, and the structure of sub-surface boundary currents.
Information thus obtained will augment other studies during the AOS and will
contribute to studies of the response of the regimes to environmental forcing.
