ABSTRACT CTS-9753287 Qian Zhou/Purdue This research program will focus on spray
modeling that will provide an efficient tool for fundamental studies and the
development of engineering devices. The results of the research will be
incorporated into engineering curriculum. An efficient group approach for the
modeling of droplet dispersions and evaporation turbulent sprays will be
developed. The model uses droplet groups to represent a spray. Each group
containing many droplets has dimensional extent that grows with time due to
turbulent droplet dispersion. The model will take into account of the effects of
gas-phase turbulence on the droplet dispersion as well as vaporization and
multiple-droplet interaction effects on droplet vaporization within a group.
Turbulent spray combustion processes are utilized in many engineering
applications. Understanding of mechanisms of the process is vital to the
improvement of the efficiency of these processes and better control of
pollutants in combustion products. For this purpose, computational fluid
dynamics (CFD) has been used increasingly. Although much progress has been made
in CFD models, submodels such as droplet dispersion and vaporization still
require improvement, which is the aim of the present research.
