In this project, the new wave of cyber-hostility occasioned by COVID-19 is
investigated through exploration and analysis of data from prominent social
media sites over a twelve-month period. COVID-19-related cyber-hostility
targeting people based on race/ethnicity, age, social class, immigrant status,
and political ideology has emerged on social media. Through this project,
insights are provided into COVID-19-related cyber-hostility and, more broadly,
light is shed on how people respond online to unexpected societal calamities.
Findings from this project offer cues on how to communicate with the public
during destabilizing times and how to ease tension during crises and stop
further escalation of outbursts of cyber-hostility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data
for this project are collected from prominent social media sites, including
Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and Reddit, over a 12-month period.
These data allow exploration of how quickly and broadly cyber-hostility related
to COVID-19 spreads, both within and between social networks. Machine learning
methods are developed to provide a timely and necessary understanding of the
sources of COVID-19-related cyber-hostility, how and where it circulates online,
and individual and situational factors associated with COVID-19-related cyber-
hostility. This analysis allows insight into whether COVID-19-related cyber-
hostility develops into a persistent fixture in cyberspace, or becomes less
prevalent as the severity of the pandemic diminishes. This project is jointly
funded by Sociology, the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research
(EPSCoR), and Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace
(SaTC).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
