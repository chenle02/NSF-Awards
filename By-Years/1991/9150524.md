An innovative science course for non-science majors will be developed in a
collaborative effort involving Columbia College, Indiana University and
Princeton University. The course will use topics in environmental science to
communicate basic scientific concepts in a relevant and meaningful way. For
example, the topic of nuclear power will provide a vehicle for teaching atomic
structure, chemical bonds, radioactivity, fission and fusion. Environmental
issues offer an excellent way to introduce the major scientific disciplines
because so many of them have important physical, geological, chemical and
biological dimensions as well as others involving engineering, economics,
political science and psychology. The course will have an interdisciplinary
approach; learning will be facilitated by having the students incorporate the
skills of their major field of study in course projects, such as video tapes,
magazine articles, theater scripts, paintings, posters and sculptures.
Dissemination will be accomplished with workshops and video tapes as well as
printed material and meeting presentations. There is significant institutional
support for this project.
