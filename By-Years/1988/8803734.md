A recently developed model for thrust belts requires that the thrust wedge
deform internally to attain and maintain a critical taper angle during fault
development. Although a number of mechanisms are known that would accomplish
this, the model has been questioned on the grounds that there is a lack of
extensive internal deformation and continuous yielding within thrust belts and
that there is evidence that thrusts develop in piggy-back fashion. This study
seeks to determine if taper angle-maintaining mechanisms operate in sufficient
magnitude to allow the wedge model to function. Fault sequences in both the
Rocky Mountains and the southern Appalachians will be studied and sequentially
restored from balanced cross-sections and results compared to products predicted
from forward modeling with the original section. Results are expected to
establish the viability of the wedge model for thrust sheet emplacement.
