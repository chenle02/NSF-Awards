This a workshop on neural net applications in electric power engineering. The
objectives of the workshop are to identify the most logical and most appropriate
areas of application of neural net methodology in power engineering; at the same
time it is hoped to identify the least appropriate areas of application. Neural
net methodology is a controversial area of study and we hope to attract
proponents and persons who are not proponents of the technique.
