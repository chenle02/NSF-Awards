The Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) is the primary international
organization in the field of natural language processing, and its annual
conference is the primary international conference in this research field. This
project supports the travel, conference, and housing expenses of students
selected to participate in the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL)
Student Research Workshop, held in conjunction with the ACL conference on June
23-25, 2014 in Baltimore. The workshop consists of two tracks: full paper
presentations and poster presentations. All selected work has only student
authors. The full paper sessions are composed of paper presentations followed by
a discussion panel led by respected researchers in the field. The workshop is
organized and run by students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Student Research
Workshop provides a valuable opportunity for the next generation of researchers
to enter the computational linguistics community. It allows the best students in
the field to receive critical feedback on their work from external experts and
to forge contacts with other students and senior researchers. The organizers
also pair each participant with a senior researcher to provide specific feedback
on the students' research. The students who select papers for the workshop and
plan the sessions also gain valuable opportunities for professional growth and
interaction with the researchers on the organizing committee of the main
conference. The workshop contributes to the maintenance and development of a
skilled and diverse computational linguistics and natural language processing
research community.
