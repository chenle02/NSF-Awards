The Cretaceous was a time of voluminous magmatism along the western margin of
the U.S. Cordillera and occurred in a tectonic setting similar to that underway
in the Andes. To the east, the Sevier orogenic belt of east-directed thrusts was
forming, however Cretaceous events between the well-known Sierra Nevada
batholith and the Sevier foreland are not well documented. This project will
expand on prior work in the northern Basin and Range and will focus on the
intrusion of granite, regional metamorphism and ductile deformation during the
Cretaceous. The work will involve extensive geochronologic work, particularly
U/Pb and 40Ar/39Ar techniques. Results should provide better constraints on
Cretaceous tectonism of the western U.S.
