Because of its geographical isolation and remoteness from the major sources of
anthropogenic emissions. Antarctic provides an excellent location for studying
natural sources of the atmospheric aerosols. Volcanoes are usually implicated as
major natural sources for the enriched elements in remote atmospheric aerosol
and Mt. Erebus, the world's southern-most active volcano, is the principal
source of volcanic emissions to the Antarctic atmosphere. Preliminary
examination of plume aerosol data from Mt. Erebus, and other volcanoes around
the world suggests that volcanoes of different composition can be distinguished
on the basis of certain elemental ratios in their plumes. this investigation
will establish a trace elemental signature characteristic of Mt. Erebus in order
to determine whether the volcano is an important source of trace elements and
other impurities to the Antarctic atmosphere. Comparison of the elemental ratios
in Erebus plume samples and snow samples collected near the volcano will allow
determination of whether snow samples provide good surrogates for aerosol
measurements.
