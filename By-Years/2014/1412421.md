The Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) is a major new international observatory to
study the low-frequency radio sky. Kaplan and Croft will develop new
capabilities to observe and identify transient and variable radio sources. This
will provide insight about explosive and flaring sources, from nearby stars to
distant galaxies. These techniques will be necessary to maximize the scientific
return from the next generation of radio telescopes. Kaplan and Croft will also
introduce undergraduate students to the excitement of this growing field, both
through focused, in-depth research projects with individual students, and
through regular discussions with a larger group of students covering research
methods, advances in the field, and large-scale participatory projects. They
will continue working to increase representation of underrepresented minorities
through public talks, school visits, workshops, star parties, and web materials,
exploring creative ways to attract them to science, technology, engineering, and
mathematics careers through campus-based activities and researcher visits to
local schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Co-PIs are members of the MWA transient
collaboration. They will develop tools to recover transients from deep, low-
frequency radio images out of the galactic plane obtained for Epoch of
Reionization (EoR) studies. They will also conduct pointed observations in the
galactic plane to search for transient and variable radio counterparts to X-ray
binaries, active galactic nuclei, stellar coronal sources, and previously
unknown sources. Radio light curves will be released to the astronomical
community. Characterizing variable sources in the background is also an
important step towards extracting the redshifted 21 cm emission from the EoR
images, a key project of MWA.
