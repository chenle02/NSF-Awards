NSF's chemistry (CHE) and materials science research (DMR) divisions will
jointly fund the University of Washington's Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site for the summers of 2005-2007. The program director is
Philip Reid who is assisted by Co-PI Sara Selfe. This REU site will provide
research experiences at the University of Washington's Materials and Devices for
Information Technology Research (MDITR) Center. The recruiting focus is for
Gateway students, that is, lower-level undergraduates (entering sophomore and
juniors) from community colleges and 4-year institutions that lack research
facilities. Recruitment will emphasize women and underrepresented minorities.
Seventeen faculty members from six UW departments have agreed to host two or
more students in their labs for at least one of the three years of the proposed
project. For each 10-week summer program, the 9-student cohort will engage in
authentic hands-on research projects directly related to MDITR research. MDITR
PIs will present technical seminars to provide students the opportunity to place
their research into context related to the broad interdisciplinary field of
photonics; and students will engage in workshops related to ethics,
communicating science, and careers in order to learn about the community and
culture of science and engineering in general. Furthermore, students will be
engaged in research within the field of Information Technology, a critically
important technology, impacting economic and social (education, health care,
defense, entertainment, transportation, etc.) well-being both globally and
nationally.
