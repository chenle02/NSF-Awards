The dissertation makes a contribution to the history of contraception by showing
the interplay of scientific, religious, public administrative, and other groups
in the development and dissemination of natural birth control.. The project will
examine in particular the process whereby the current notion of the woman's time
of evaluation was established and applied to the development of birth control
methods, especially rhythm methods. This study will, for the first time, trace
the steps of the process that led from work done in European, Japanese, and
American laboratories to its social impact. It will take into account the
interplay of the various agents involved (researchers, medical practitioners,
government, and religious authorities), showing how their different values
(professional, moral, religious, and ideological) have interacted. Further, the
research takes up religious differences as they are reflected in national
differences, between a Roman Catholic dominated state and one where separation
of church and state is rhetorically important but does not describe politics as
practiced.
