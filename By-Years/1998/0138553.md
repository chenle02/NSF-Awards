Biochemistry and molecular biology employ methods from chemistry, physics, cell
biology, microbiology, and genetics to study the structure and function of
complex biomolecules. These functions include how they operate in living
organisms and how alterations in these molecules perturb the living state.
Biochemistry and molecular biology research integrates didactic and experimental
material learned in many basic courses. This REU Site Program in Molecular
Biosciences will continue to enable qualified undergraduates to do independent
research projects using a variety of experimental approaches. The program is
designed to offer the participants a variety of research areas from which to
choose a meaningful and exciting independent study project. Students will learn
how to formulate and test hypotheses and develop the ability to troubleshoot and
problem-solve when confronted with the unexpected. They will have access to and
training in the use of state-of-the-art instrumentation. Through weekly meetings
and a research poster presentation, students will develop the ability to
communicate their results to their peers. The program will provide appropriate
role models for these students to reinforce their excitement for a scientific
research career and will emphasize to all participants the gender and diversity
issues that impact research careers in science. For the past two years, through
International Internships, the program has provided and will continue to provide
the opportunity for undergraduates who demonstrate superior research aptitude to
work in a foreign host laboratory on a collaborative research project for which
they have received prior training. These students have learned to appreciate
scientific research as an international endeavor and have helped strengthen
international collaborative research projects. The program will assist
participants in preparing applications to graduate schools and graduate
fellowships.
