Under an SBIR phase II grant, research will be carried out to further improve
the configuration and performance of drag-reducing devices, developed under
earlier grants, to be fitted to the back of tractor-trailers. The effect of
cross- winds, surface roughness, and further configration refinement is to be
investigated. The research may facilitate significant fuel savings in the
trucking industry.
