Two projects will be initiated on this PYI grant: one involves improving ab-
initio tight binding code for electronic structure and the other deals with pre-
melting at surfaces. In the first project, the proposed code improvements using
localized orbitals promise extremely fast calculations of the molecular dynamics
of systems with up to 200 atoms. The method can presently handle s- and
p-orbitals, but will be expanded to deal with d-orbitals so that transition
element properties can be calculated. The improved code will be used to study
adhesion at polymer-metal interfaces and the structure of nanoscale metallic
clusters. The study of pre- melting of surfaces will focus on lead. The
effective atom method will be used to calculate the Gibbs free energy of the
bulk solid and the bulk liquid; the melting point will be obtained from this
information. For a range of temperatures below the melting point molecular
dynamics will be used to simulate several lead surfaces. %%% On this
Presidential Young Investigator grant two projects in theoretical materials
science will be initiated. The first will involve the improvement of a computer
code to deal with transition metals which are important in many applications.
This improved code will then be used to study adhesion at polymer-metal
interfaces and the structure of nanoscale metal clusters. The study of the pre-
melting of lead surfaces will improve our understanding of why the surfaces of
metals often melt prior to the melting of the bulk materials. This has important
ramifications in the processing of metals for a variety of applications.
