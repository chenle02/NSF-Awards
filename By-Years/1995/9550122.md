global change education. The planning year is primarily devoted to research of
the issues, technologies and materials that are appropriate; building awareness
throughout the state through presentations and articles; and forging
partnerships. At the completion of the project, the state will be ready to
implement a comprehensive global education plan through models, technology
teacher training awareness campaigns, and ongoing partnerships. Cost sharing is
232% and includes funds from the state, other Federal agencies, corporations and
other sources.
