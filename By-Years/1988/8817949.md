Transient thermal processing is an essential step in multilayer thin film
fabrication for electronic devices. Major hurdles in current thermal processing
techniques are the material defects, such as warpage and slip, caused by thermal
stresses due to temperature gradients in the thin-film structures. During the
proposed investigation, a numerical technique will be developed to predict the
temperature distribution in a multilayer thin film structure at all times during
thermal processing. The technique will simulate complex geometries of films with
variable optical and thermal properties, will allow for phase change, and will
include stationary and variable heat sources. Parametric study following the
development will focus on two emerging transient thermal processing
technologies, Zone Melting Recrystallization (ZMR) and Rapid Thermal Annealing
(RTA), where there is immediate need for thermal analysis. The technique will be
tested experimentally on "large scale" models of the thin film structure.
