This project deals with smooth actions of compact Lie groups on manifolds and
algebraic actions of algebraic groups on affine varieties. Here are two of the
many problems in the algebraic setting: Are conjugacy classes of algebraic
actions of a finite (reductive) group on a non-singular variety V countable? In
the case V is complex n-space, is this number finite? Among the aims of the
project in the smooth setting: Give information on the equivariant surgery
obstructions for an equivariant normal map in the non-free case (in favorable
cases) in terms of fixed point data, and provide conditions which guarantee
these obstructions vanish (i.e. give vanishing theorems). Group actions are
ubiquitous in nature. Understanding them is akin to understanding dynamical
systems.
