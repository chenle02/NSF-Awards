Iowa State University established a UNIDATA system using State funds. The
system will be enhanced under this award. UNIDATA plays an important role in the
teaching and research programs for both the atmospheric science and agricultural
meteorology programs. For example, the jointly taught Introduction to
Meteorology course with a yearly enrollment in excess of 800 students uses
McIDAS products in the weather discussion which begins each lecture. Several
research projects depend upon "real-time" data input including a project which
uses upper-air data, radar observations and satellite imagery in an operational
forecast mode to predict insect pest movements in the boundary layer. The
equipment to be acquired will accomplish five main objectives: 1. Update the
four IBM PS/2 model 60 computers with three IBM PS/2 model 70 computers. This
will allow Iowa State University to continue receiving McIDAS weather products
after the UNIDATA support for the DOS version of PC-McIDAS terminates; 2. Obtain
networking software (TCP/2) for the OS/2 operating system for the IBM PS/2 model
80 (which will act as the ingester) and the four model 70's; 3. Obtain PC
X-Window software to use with the existing IBM PS/2 model 60 computers as
X-Window systems. An existing Sun 3/160 which now manages UNIDATA SDM will act
as the X-Window server; 4. Add a 700 megabyte hard disk unit to improve the
ability to archive McIDAS and SDM products; 5. Initiate the introduction of
COMET computer based learning models as an educational resource for
undergraduate and graduate instruction at the university and to foster synergism
between the UNIDATA and COMET Programs.
