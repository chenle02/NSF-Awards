The objectives of this project are to understand pulsed gel electrophoresis at
the molecular level through a study of 1) the acceleration and alignment of DNA
chains measured by video detection and fluorescence-detected linear dichroism;
2) fluctuations in the velocity of single DNA chains in gels using high-
resolution, video-enhanced epifluorescence microscopy; 3) the mobility of bent-
end and non-bent-end DNA; and 4) the effects of pulse frequency and angle on the
width of DNA bands. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis is a powerful new technique
which can separate DNAs containing 50-6000 kilobasepairs by forcing the
molecules to change direction periodically. Dr. Holzwarth is attempting to
understand it at the molecular level.
