This project will allow a student studying for an MD as well as a PhD in
Anthropology from the University of Illinois to study how medical professionals
talk about AIDS. the project will take place in several locations in the US and
one hospital in France where AIDS research is advanced. Methods will consist of
ethnographic "participant-observation" as a medical worker in some clinics, and
intensive interviewing. This research is important because AIDS is one of the
most important medical facts of life in the modern world. Increased
understanding of how the medical model of the disease is created and modified in
the daily practice of hospitals and clinics will help us understand how to
disseminate accurate understanding of the disease in the population at large.
