The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to provide
educational developers, who may not be familiar with psychological and
pedagogical theories, a design framework to help forge a new way of designing
learning activities that will engage students and help them to accelerate and
solidify their understanding of Science Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM)
concepts being taught in lab setting. The anticipated improvement of STEM
education will be particularly beneficial to learners of disparate backgrounds
who are traditionally less likely to pursue STEM degrees and for those who face
learning challenges traditionally viewed as disabilities. Success will mean
institutions and departments of learning, both academic and corporate, will
engage in more efficient ways of instilling knowledge and engendering skills to
achieve a better trained and more inclusive STEM work
force.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project will further develop a
framework for the creation of effective educational software running in a three
dimensional Virtual Learning Environment. A set of design heuristics has been
created that combine existing usability heuristics for general software design,
educational software design, and software designed for virtual spaces, along
with principles of human learning and memory taken from cognitive science. The
applications developed using this framework are Learning Machines that are
deployed into a(three dimensional Virtual Learning Space. The effectiveness of
these applications are maximized through controlled implementation of evidence
based principles of learning and memory during application design and user
testing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
