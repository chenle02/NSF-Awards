Vertebrates evolved from small filter-feeding worms around a half-billion years
ago. The vertebrate subphylum has since become one of the most widespread animal
groups, giving rise to a stunning diversity of species, including humans. One of
the keys to vertebrate success is the robust and highly adaptable vertebrate
head skeleton. Despite the central role of the head skeleton in vertebrate
evolution very little is known about how it first formed. This project uses
modern molecular methods to address this long-standing and previously
intractable question by analyzing the genetic mechanisms underlying skeletal
development in three key species. The first animal, amphioxus, is an
invertebrate regarded as a 'living fossil' highly similar to the worm-like
ancestor of the vertebrates. While previously thought to lack a vertebrate-type
skeletal tissue, we have found exciting evidence that such tissue may form
during its larval phase. The second, the lamprey, is a living representative of
the most ancient vertebrate group, the agnathans. The third, the African clawed
frog, is an easily accessible model vertebrate with a head skeleton similar to
our own. By the novel application of modern molecular methods to the embryos and
larvae of these animals, we are elucidating the genetic and developmental
changes driving the evolution of the vertebrate head. In the process, the work
provides training for a postdoctoral scholar, graduate, and several
undergraduate students, as well as hands-on research experiences for high school
students. The project also provides an opportunity for undergraduates to
participate directly in novel basic research through an upper division lab
course. Finally, the results of the work will be incorporated into the
curriculum of a large general biology course and widely disseminated to the
public through a traveling exhibit at the University of Colorado Museum of
Natural History.
