The proposed research is for developing new algorithms for distributed
implementation of "optimal power flow" (OPF) in a large power system. In view of
the size of the system a decomposition of the system is proposed. "Shadow costs"
on , among other things, interchanges of active and reactive power between
regions would guide the distributed calculations in such a way that the economic
interpretations can be placed in the regional interchanges. The regions would be
relatively large to accommodate a coarse-grained processor architecture. BY
dividing the processing into regions, data communication can be largely
localized to the regions. The interregional communications requirements can be
considerably less than for a centralized implementation of OPF. However, the
main advantage of distributed processing is the potential decrease in solution
time due to increased (distributed) computing power.
