This project is a study of how a native prairie perennial plant is able to
persist in an oak savannah woodland developed on a sand plain. The project is
based on the notion that explanations of persistence are affected by the spatial
scale under study. The study species for this project is Penstemon grandiflorus
(Scrophulariaceae) a plant native to midwestern sand prairies and savannahs.
Specifically, it is proposed to determine how Penstemon persists at three
spatial scales: the plant neighborhood, individual openings in the
savannah/forest complex, and the overall landscape. The way in which, pocket
gophers, and processes associated with succession interact to affect the
persistence of this species at the three different scales will be examined.
Small experimental plots will be used to test hypotheses involving persistence
at the scale of the neighborhood; larger long-term observation plots will be
used to test hypotheses regarding successional dynamics of openings; and aerial
photography and computer mapping will be used to test hypotheses at the
landscape level.
