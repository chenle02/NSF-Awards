The purpose of the Conference on Econometrics and Mathematical Economics (CEME)
is to stimulate discussion and research on the frontiers of econometric and
mathematical economic theory and methodology and to apply advanced mathematical,
statistical, and numerical analysis techniques in empirical economic studies. It
tries to encourage research on new topics and to speed the dissemination of the
latest findings of leading scholars. CEME accomplishes these goals through
seminar groups. These seminars provide informal channels of communication for
specialists in selected topic areas at widely dispersed institutions to meet
periodically and for longer periods than is generally possible at meetings of
professional societies and at sporadic conferences. There are currently active
seminar groups in general equilibrium models, decentralized economic planning,
comparison of econometric models, Bayesian econometrics and time series
analysis. A new seminar series on microeconometrics will be formed to address
the methodological issues arising in the econometric analysis of microeconomic
models with cross-sectional or panel data. Since CEME's inception in 1970, its
seminar groups have produced more than 850 working papers and have published
many books and numerous articles in professional journals.
