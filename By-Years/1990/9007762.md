Funds are requested to add several important pieces of equipment to existing
laboratories. The research areas range from insect cell culture to the
interaction of mammalian cells with polymer surfaces to studies of
microorganisms from extreme environments. The equipment requested to support
these projects includes a Fast Performance Liquid Chromatography (FPLC) system
and associated protein purification items, a mid-size autoclave for
sterilization of fermentation vessels, an ELISA microplate reader, a
lyophilizer, a scintillation counter and other supporting equipment. This
equipment will supplement existing facilities and help to expand current
biochemical engineering research efforts.
