9313460 Glander The Duke University Primate Center, built in 1968, houses the
largest and most diverse collection of prosimian primates in the world as well
as the largest number of endangered primates. Many of the species housed at this
center have thrived only at this facility. Therefore, this center operates as a
research resource providing observational opportunities, cadavers of animals
that expire at the end of their life-spans, and tissue and blood samples to
scientists on a local, regional, national, and international level. In-house
research is also conducted by faculty, staff members, visiting scientists,
students, and post- doctoral fellows. Prosimians are important to primatology
because they are "living fossils". They are the first primates to appear in the
fossil record and provide clues about the earth's past environment. This award
to Duke University will allow for the renovation of 86 enclosed outdoor runs at
this primate center. This renovation will allow the facility to meet current
university and USDA code requirements. The renovation to be undertaken will also
dramatically and positively impact the quality and quantity of research and
training opportunities by providing a safe and reliable environment for the
animals. Finally, the renovations will increase opportunities for scientists and
facilitate the implementation of an educational outreach program to area K-12
school children. ***
