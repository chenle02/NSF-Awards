This project is about the understanding of complex-valued functions. Complex
numbers and functions of complex variables have become, since the nineteenth
century, indispensable tools in many areas of mathematics and its application to
other areas of science and engineering. The solutions of many problems in the
applied sciences could ultimately depend on improvements in these complex
analytic tools and a deeper understanding of their basic properties. For
example, in materials science the standard method for treating multidirectional
stresses in a uniform way is to represent them as complex numbers or, in more
complicated situations, as complex functions. It then turns out that, among
other things, the direction of the propagation of cracks in materials is related
to the properties of certain equations associated with these complex numbers or
functions. Results of the research to be carried out in this project may lead to
the discovery of new properties of solutions of these equations. This project
has significant educational and training aspects: At least two graduate students
and one undergraduate student will be actively involved in this project. Also,
the principal investigator will continue to organize international conferences
on several complex variables and complex geometry, bringing together
mathematicians to discuss their research and teaching.

In the research aspect, the principal investigator will continue his work on
several fundamental problems in complex analysis of several variables that are
closely related to research in differential geometry, algebraic geometry and
classical dynamics. More specifically, the principal investigator would like to
continue his research on the equivalence problem and rigidity problem in several
complex variables, carry further his work on the complex structure of the
holomorphic hull of a real submanifold in a complex space, and further his study
on the existence and regularity problem for Levi-flat submanifolds bounded by
real submanifolds with CR singularities.
