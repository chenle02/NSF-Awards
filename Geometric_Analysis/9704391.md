In this project, the investigator aims to apply methods of symplectic and
Poisson geometry, and Lie groupoids and Lie algebroids, to the study of various
differential structures related to Poisson manifolds and the quantization
problem. More specifically, the project involves the study of bihamiltonian
structures and hyperkahler structures using the theory of Lie bialgebroids.
Also, this project will investigate deformation quantization of Lagrangian
submanifolds, the characteristic class of star products on symplectic manifolds,
quantization of Poisson manifolds, and their application in knot theory.
Symplectic geometry is a mathematical tool used to lay a theoretical framework
encompassing large parts of classical mechanics of Newton. Ideas from symplectic
geometry and Poisson geometry can be used to explain and predict various
mechanical phenomena - e.g., locomotion generation and motion control. Knot
theory has profound application in biotechnology such as the understanding of
different DNA structures.
