This award will support a study of entanglement in spin models. In XY spin
chains, the entropy of several blocks of spins will be represented as a block
Toeplitz determinant, and then the generalized Fisher - Hartwig formula will be
used to evaluate asymptotic. The project will consider both von Neumann and
Renyi entropies. The entanglement spectrum also will be evaluated. This question
has attracted attention recently and requires rigorous mathematical treatment.
Entanglement of two blocks of spins in ground states of spin models is
important. After tracing the rest of the ground state, these two blocks are left
in a mixed state. An appropriate measure of entanglement of mixed systems is
negativity. The project will describe entanglement of 2 blocks of spins in the
AKLT (Affleck, Lieb, Kennedy Takasi) spin chain by means of negativity. The
ground state of the AKLT model is known as valence-bond-solid (VBS) state. It
plays an important role in quantum information, especially in measurement based
quantum computation.

Entanglement is a special phenomenon of quantum systems, which cannot happen in
the classical (macroscopic) case. It is an important resource for quantum
control, which is central for quantum devices, including quantum computers. This
has recently become important, because experimentalist who are working with
optical lattices can now build models of interacting spins, which had only
previously been studied from the mathematical point of view. This is a
substantial contribution of mathematical physics towards the goal of quantum
information processing, and progress in the laboratory now depends on further
theoretical study. The award will support the mathematical analysis of such
entanglement, in order to guide atom-molecular-optics experiments.
