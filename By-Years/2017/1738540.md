This SBIR Phase II project continues previous development of an invention
disclosure tool that allows users to draft a United States Patent and Trademark
Office compliant patent applications by using an intuitive interface and game-
based educational tools to draft patent applications. Inventors and small
companies having no background in patent law and patent-application drafting
strategies struggle with properly describing their inventions. Overcoming this
lack of understanding on the part of the inventor requires a great deal of one-
on-one educational training with a patent professional in order to draft a
quality patent application. However, engaging a patent professional is costly
and time consuming. This project expands the capacity of the invention
disclosure software by allowing users to configure and customize the software
for specific types of inventions and arts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically,
this project proposes a new customization tool for integration with the existing
invention disclosure tool to allow for widespread adoption into varied
technology arts. The customization tool comprises software modules that allow
end users to identify and create narrative goals, design software interfaces by
configuring display rules, design text output state configurations based on
logical operators, design natural language output, design the natural language
generated output that is desired for that product type and configure template
text, token input, and grammar associations, and determine the position of
natural language output into an overall document structure. This customization
tool will allow for rapid, scalable distribution of the product to be driven by
end users rather than through a traditional software development process, e.g.,
1) researching, 2) market testing, and 3) designing and implementing each new
version of a product for different technology arts.
