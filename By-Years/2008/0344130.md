&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the past quarter-century and more, social choice
experiments have &lt;br/&gt;studied how people choose between what can be earned
by each acting in pure &lt;br/&gt;self-interest as against what would be jointly
earned if all could commit &lt;br/&gt;themselves to act in their common
interest. This proposal grows out of a &lt;br/&gt;pilot project that produced
striking early results from fresh analysis of &lt;br/&gt;archived data from
several prominent sets of experiments, using an &lt;br/&gt;unconventional
extension of standard rational actor theory to allow for &lt;br/&gt;social
motivation ("nsnx"), and giving close attention to what has been
&lt;br/&gt;learned in recent decades about the cognitive cuing of
&lt;br/&gt;choices. Coincidentally (since the proposal was submitted) the Nobel
prize &lt;br/&gt;for Economics this year has been shared between Vernon Smith,
who has &lt;br/&gt;pioneered in the use of rational choice theory in
experimental work and &lt;br/&gt;Daniel Kahneman who (with Amos Tversky)
pioneered in the application of &lt;br/&gt;cognitive concerns to economics. The
project builds on that work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results of several strong
tests for "nsnx" effects have shown effects of &lt;br/&gt;size and robustness
beyond what has often been seen in the social &lt;br/&gt;sciences. A
downloadable "template" allows other researchers to run the &lt;br/&gt;tests on
data of their own choice. The work aims at gaining insight from
&lt;br/&gt;controlled experimental conditions that can be applied to socially
urgent &lt;br/&gt;problems (from voluntarism at home to terrorism and ethnic
conflict aboard) &lt;br/&gt;that turn heavily on the ability of groups to
sustain or disrupt &lt;br/&gt;cooperation under conditions where binding
agreements and third-party &lt;br/&gt;enforcement are difficult. This is
arguably the most fundamental issue &lt;br/&gt;of the social
sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
