The investigator and his graduate research students study correlation and
sorting problems for finite partially ordered sets and graphs. Specific goals of
this research include (1) finding combinatorial arguments for correlation
inequalities with attention to error estimates and structural information, (2)
bijective proofs of log-concavity results and proportional transitivity
problems, (3) continued investigation of balancing pairs and the cross product
conjecture, and (4) understanding the boundary effects and the distinction
between finite and infinite posets in correlation and sorting problems.

A major fraction of all scientific and business computing deals with the issue
of sorting. Data must be aggregated according to some specified order, such as
an alphabetical listing or a listing according to social security numbers.
Updating records, locating files, and understanding the interplay between events
which influence the speed at which files can be manipulated are fundamentally
important research topics where advances will have immediate impact on a broad
range of applications in business, industry and government. The investigator and
his students are studying both the theoretical basis for research involving
correlation and sorting and the practical implementation of algorithms derived
from this research.
