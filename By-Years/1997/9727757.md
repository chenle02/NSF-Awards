Arabinogalactan-proteins (AGPs) are a family of hydroxyproline-rich
glycoproteins which are widely distributed in plants. AGPs are found in
intercellular spaces, cell walls, and plasma membranes and implicated to play
important roles in growth and development. This proposal focuses on a putative
plasma membrane AGP, LeAGP-1, deduced from tomato DNA clones which demonstrate
developmental and organ-specific regulation. The clones predict a novel, modular
AGP comprised of an N-terminal signal peptide, a central classical AGP domain
sandwiching a basic subdomain, and C-terminal putative transmembrane domain. Our
working hypotheses are that LeAGP-1 represents a plasma membrane AGP and that it
functions in establishing connections and mediating adhesion to the cell wall,
analogous to animal cell adhesion molecules. The PIs will test these hypotheses
and address structure and function of LeAGP-1 by: 1) isolating and biochemically
characterizing LeAGP-1 from tomato cell cultures to provide structural
information and material for functional characterization, 2) immunolocalizing
LeAGP-1 in cultured cells, stems, and flowers and in plasmolyzed cells
demonstrating zones of adhesion between the membrane and wall, and 3)
functionally characterizing LeAGP-1 at the molecular level (tests for
intermolecular crosslinking) and whole plant level (LeAGP-1 antisense
suppression/sense cosuppression in transgenic plants).
