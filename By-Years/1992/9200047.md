The purpose of this Research Experience for Undergraduates program at the
University of Southern California is to provide research experiences for
underrepresented groups within the interdisciplinary laser and photonics
research facility of the Center for Laser Studies. This Center has a
distinguished record, not only for world-renowned research, but also for
nurturing the careers of women and underrepresented ethnic groups. All the
undergraduates contribute substantially to the research at the Center for Laser
Studies, working on nonlinear optics, fiber optic systems, solid-state lasers,
laser processing, and quantum optics.
