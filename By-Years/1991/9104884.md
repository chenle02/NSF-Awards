This study is to determine the nature and causes of compositional variation in
lavas from the continuing eruption of Kilauea Volcano, Hawaii. Mineral, glass
and whole-rock compositions and Pb, Sr and Nd isotope ratios will be determined
and used to evaluate the relative importance of crystal fractionation, magma
mixing and mantle melting processes in controlling the composition of the lavas
erupted. It is also proposed to evaluate the temporal and spatial variations in
the composition of lavas erupted historically at the summit of Kilauea Volcano.
This study will evaluate the size and location of the summit reservoir (which
are still poorly known), and will be the first to determine modes, mineral and
glass major elements, whole-rock major, and trace elements, and O, Pb, Sr and Nd
isotope ratios, all on the same samples. Petrological and geochemical results
from this study will be integrated with field and geophysical measurements and
interpretation made by the staff of the U.S.G.S.
