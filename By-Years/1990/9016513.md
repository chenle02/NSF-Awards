This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program supports
the continued work of Dr. Clifford Kubiak of the Department of Chemistry, Purdue
University, on the design and synthesis of new compounds which will activate and
reduce carbon dioxide. In this project, Kubiak will study ways to form carbon-
carbon bonds by coupling carbon dioxide molecules. Binuclear transition metal
complexes will be tested as means to provide the electrons needed for the
coupling reaction. Single-bonded Ir, Rh, Ni and Pt complexes will be prepared
and photolyzed by laser transient absorbance techniques. The photoinduced
cleavage of the metal-metal bond will provide two electrons for bond formation.
The complexes are designed to form radical transients which are "tuned" for
carbon dioxide reduction. The photogenerated radicals will be characterized
using an infrared detector supported by this grant. The project is based on past
findings that structural changes in certain binuclear compounds make them
effective in photoinduced electron transfer reactions.
