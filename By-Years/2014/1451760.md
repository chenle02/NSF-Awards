Title: Student Travel Support for 42nd ACM SIGPLAN-SIGACT Symposium on
Principles of Programming Languages (POPL) 2015&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
will support student travel to the 2015 ACM SIGPLAN-SIGACT Symposium on
Principles of Programming Languages (POPL). The conference will be held in
Mumbai, India, in January 2015. POPL is a forum for the discussion of leading
work on all aspects of programming languages and programming systems. The
conference has a rich tradition of supporting ideas that have made enduring
contributions to the theory, design, implementation or application of
programming languages. Supporting student travel to attend professional
conferences and workshops is a very important mission of the NSF. The broader
significance and importance includes fostering the next generation of
researchers in this research area, as well as providing international
experiences to build a globally-aware workforce. In particular, students will
have the opportunity to learn state-of-the-art methodologies, be exposed to
novel techniques, and interact with senior researchers in their areas of
expertise.
