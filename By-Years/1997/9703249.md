Tailor Welded Blank (TWB) Forming is an important manufacturing process to
perform precision automotive assembly. Currently, the wide usage of TWB is
hampered by many difficulties on the control of the forming process. This
research project investigates a methodology to effectively control the welding
movement during the forming process and improve the formability. The
investigator will develop both undergraduate and graduate curricula and
integrate them with the research activities. In addition, this CAREER plan will
explore the teaching techniques and encourage women and minority students to
participate in engineering and research. This is a NSF CAREER award to support
multidisciplinary research and education activities for faculty in their early
academic career years.
