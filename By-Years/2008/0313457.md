ABSTRACT CTS-0313457 C. Hall, University of New Orleans The research proposal is
to investigate methods to capture airborne biological particles by dispersed
nanoparticles. The motivation for this work is based on the treat of accidental
or intentional release of hazardous bioaerosol elements in air. Methods to
quickly capture and identify these elements would be needed if such events
occur. The focus of the work is on investigating the mechanism for attachment of
bioaerosal particles to nanoparticles and the effect of electrostatic charge on
transport of airborne biological particles.
