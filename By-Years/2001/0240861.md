&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;OPP-
0240861&lt;br/&gt;Conway&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a collaborative proposal
by Principal Investigators at the Universities of Washington and Stockholm. The
Principal Investigators will investigate relationships between variations of
climate patterns in the North Atlantic and glaciers in Norway and Sweden. They
will focus on the west coast of Scandinavia for three reasons. First, the future
of the glaciers in relation to climate change has important consequences for
regional hydrology and global sea level. Second, historically, pronounced
glacial fluctuations suggest that the region is highly sensitive to climate
anomalies. Winter climate in the is dominated by a large-scale climate pattern
known as the Northern Hemisphere annular mode (NAM) that depends on the strength
of the polar night jet stream. Variations in the NAM have a particularly strong
effect along coastal Scandinavia; analysis of the glacial record has potential
to greatly improve understanding of present and past behavior of the NAM. Third,
an improved understanding of the climate of the region may also be key for
helping to resolve outstanding issues concerning the role of the thermohaline
circulation in natural climate variability. Their approach is to make use of the
existing suite of high-resolution measurements that have been made on the
glaciers of Scandinavia, and gridded atmospheric National Center for
Environmental Prediction/National Centers for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR)
reanalysis) data that are available for the last 50 years. Specifically, they
will 1) establish modern (past 50 years) relationships between climate and
glaciers by applying their well-proven models and the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis data;
2) use the statistics of climate-glacier response to derive possible climate
conditions that would produce glaciers of the extent known to exist in
Scandinavia during the Little Ice Age; and 3) use the statistics to investigate
potential glacier changes under future possible climate scenarios.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quantitative understanding of interactions between climate
and glaciers is important for two reasons. First, the record of past glacier
fluctuations can be used to help reconstruct past patterns of climate. Second,
the future of glaciers in the face of climate change has important and global
consequences for sea level and hydrology. This research involves collaboration
with Principal Investigators at the Universities of Washington and Stockholm, so
it will foster international co-operation. The research will also provide core
education for a graduate student in Earth and Space Sciences with an emphasis in
climate and glaciology and the student will benefit from exposure to the
international community.
