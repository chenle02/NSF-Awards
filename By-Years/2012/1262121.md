The planned research will take video analysis indexing and retrieval in a new
and promising direction. The research is driven by the need for intelligence
analysts to be able to express video queries more efficiently than traditional
relevance feedback and to be able to "provide more expressive queries that
include "nouns" and "verbs" as they would with human language. While still
constrained, the approach goes a long way toward bridging the gap between
traditional relevance feedback based only on assumed relationships in the image,
and full human language queries. The graduate students involved in the project
will be required to publish in international conferences and journals and will
likely use this research as a basis for their dissertations. Other impacts of
this work include the mentoring of graduate students and the inclusion of junior
personnel in the management of the project. Research will be disseminated
through local, national, and international meetings and journals. The team will
also install a server and public interface for demonstration on existing
datasets. The system will be accessible through the web on limited datasets and
on the full dataset by request.
