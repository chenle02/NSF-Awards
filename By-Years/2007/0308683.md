TSYGAN, 9970591&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The propsed research is devoted to various
questions of deformation quantization of smooth manifolds. Recently, Kontsevich
classified all such quantizations. This classification is a consequence of a
general formality theorem about Lie the algebra of Hochschild cochains. An
analog of this theorem is proposed. This analog, and its various
generalizations, are theorems about Hochschild and cyclic complexes. Among the
consequences of the proposed general formality theorems are: definition of an A^
class of a general Poisson manifold; general equivariant index theorems;
classification of deformations with trace. Another, related line of research
studies the links between deformation quantization of complex manifolds with
holomorphic symplectic structures and Rozansky-Witten invariants of
3-manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two related motives for studying
quantization. One come from quantum mechanics. The other motive from
differential equations. The proposed research will be devoted to the
applications of methods of Kontsevich and Tamarkin combined with deformation
methods to the theory noncommutative differential geometry, to obtain new
geometrical and topological invariants.&lt;br/&gt;
