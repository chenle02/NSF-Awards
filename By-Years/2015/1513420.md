This project addresses the development of statistical tools for the analysis of
complex data structures that arise with the use of modern technology. In many
applications, the observations naturally lie on a nonlinear space, such as a
sphere, and it is important to study the temporal and spatial behavior of these
processes. The research will impact several data-rich applications including
visual speech recognition, action/emotion recognition, and the analysis of
medical images. This project will use techniques from geometry, statistics, and
computer science to develop algorithms and tools that can help practitioners
derive much needed insight from these data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this
research, a comprehensive framework for estimation, registration and analysis of
manifold-valued processes is proposed. Functional data analysis in Euclidean
spaces has been explored extensively in the literature. In this project, the
functions that are studied take values on nonlinear manifolds, rather than in
vector spaces. The observed data are noisy and discrete, and observed at
random/arbitrary times. Two main problems are investigated: the first involves
estimation of smoothing trajectories using time-indexed points. The second
problem focuses on the development of a comprehensive framework for joint
registration and analysis of multiple manifold-valued processes. The approach
takes into account the temporal variability, derives a rate-invariant metric,
and generates statistical summaries (sample mean, covariance), which can be
subsequently used for registering and modeling multiple trajectories.
