9553345 Azadivar A comprehensive manufacturing learning center (the MLC) will be
developed. Just as teaching hospitals are full service medical facilities yet
provide a research and educational environment for medical students and other
health professionals to get hands-on training solving real-life medical
problems; this proposed center would have a fully actualized manufacturing
function integrated into manufacturing engineering education capabilities. The
center would utilize an existing research and technology transfer facility where
students and trainees can intern in actual manufacturing situations solving
real-life manufacturing problems. The MLC would enhance the manufacturing
engineering education and provide a research/education/ technology transfer
model for others to emulate. The manufacturing theme encompasses a wide range of
engineering activities. The theme allows training and education for a large
group of professionals in many engineering and other supporting disciplines. It
would also addresses a critical need for development of human resources in an
area of economic activity that has been suffering in recent years. The MLC will
utilize the existing full service "manufacturing processes prototyping" plant at
Kansas State University. This research/teaching/manufacturing facility would
bridge research and engineering education at Kansas State University and the
research and development needs of small to medium-sized industries. The MLC will
be managed and run by a partnership of KSU' s Advanced Manufacturing Institute
(AMI), faculty and students in the Engineering and other Colleges of the
University, technical and vocational schools in the state, two technical
assistance organizations in the region and managers and manufacturing experts
from private manufacturing firms.
