Software packages are being developed for an introductory linear algebra course.
These materials provide undergraduate science, engineering, and mathematics
students tools to understand linear algebra and its applications. Using the
materials, students investigate ideas and explore patterns to understand the
underlying mathematical concepts and applications. Manuals introduce the
students to important algorithms and to a broad range of models including, for
example, demography, traffic flow, and the Leontief model for analyzing the
interdependence of industries.
