This proposal examines the campaign finance advantages held by incumbent
Members of Congress. The disparity between incumbents' and challengers' campaign
resources is commonly thought to reflect incumbents' positions and activities
with the legislature. However, the sources of incumbents' campaign finance
advantages are poorly understood. Through a series of quasi-experiments, this
project ascertains the extent to which incumbents' financial advantages stem
from office-holding, from positions or activities in the legislature, or from
politicians' personal abilities and resources. By using turnover among members,
both within office and within specific positions in Congress, this proposal
isolates those factors that influence the distribution of campaign funds. The
project develops a twenty-year data base of all contributions and legislative
positions and activities. Data on contributions from specific Political Action
Committees and individuals to candidates are drawn from the files of the Federal
Election Commission. Data on the legislative positions of incumbents and
activities in Congress from the Library of Congress Information Service and
other public documents. The data set, with all the pairings of data, will be
made available to the wider political science community. This project will add
detailed information to debates over campaign finance.
