This project will develop new approaches that will unleash the potential of
Bayesian methods for extracting meaningful structure in the "big data" that are
of increasing interest and importance today. This will entail the creation of
rapidly computable methods that enhance or bypass the much slower simulation
methods upon which Bayesian methods have come to rely. By more efficiently
harnessing the power of high-performance computing, our methods will provide a
feasible vehicle for uncovering systematic associations in data across a variety
of scientific disciplines. Examples include (a) genomics, where identifying the
genetic determinants of diseases can substantially enhance targeted therapeutic
decisions, (b) neuroimaging, where efficient methods will greatly facilitate
understanding the complex brain architecture, and (c) environmental sciences,
where identifying the determinants of climate change can better inform policy
decisions.

The main thrust of this research will be the development of a broad framework
for fast deterministic search implementations for Bayesian model selection and
inference. Building on new directions recently opened up by EMVS, a fast new
alternative to stochastic search, this work will vastly increase the feasibility
of general Bayesian implementations for large high-dimensional problems. This
will entail the development of algorithms for classes of models that go beyond
the canonical normal linear model. The speed of these algorithms will enable the
broad application of new dynamic posterior exploration. Properties of the
implicit selective shrinkage selection will be studied and asymptotic theory
developed. New approaches to posterior reconstruction will provide new avenues
for inference. Effectively, this project will lay the groundwork for a new
paradigm for posterior exploration in large high-dimensional problems.
