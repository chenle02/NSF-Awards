9311904 Christou This project, supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and
Organometallic Chemistry Program, will continue studies of polynuclear
transition metal carboxylate complexes. Three areas will be emphasized: 1)
characterization and synthetic elaboration of a newly discovered cobalt cubane
complex, 2) high nuclearity manganese complexes with emphasis on elucidation of
the mechanism of magnetic interactions in high spin state species, and 3)
synthesis and spectroscopic characterization of dinuclear rhodium and molybdenum
carboxylate complexes of guanine and adenine bases. This work is expected to
impact several areas including biology and materials science. %%% This project
involves the design, synthesis, and physical and chemical characterization of
new transition metal complexes. Information obtained in these fundamental
studies is expected to ultimately impact a wide range of other disciplines
including biology and materials science. ***
