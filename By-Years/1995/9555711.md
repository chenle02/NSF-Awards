9555711 Todd This proposal describes a teacher enhancement project designed to
enhance a cohort of elementary level teachers to use a design and technology
approach to integrate science, mathematics, and technology. The project will
enhance an initial 40 cadre teachers to prepare a cohort of 400 second tier
teachers in ten schools in six states. Teachers participating in the enhancement
will be divided into ten teacher/leader teams. These teams will provide guidance
to the project's leadership in the development of design and technology
enhancement support materials including an Implementation Resource Guide and
videos. These materials will be specifically designed to combine contemporary
pedagogy with the delivery of technical content in the science, mathematics, and
technology areas. The teacher/leader teams will also assist with the delivery of
two graduate level courses, provide leadership at 10 demonstration sites, assist
with community outreach seminars, and participate in a one week, terminal year,
National Dissemination workshop. This project will extend and implement the
curriculum materials developed through a NSF funded instructional materials
development project (Project UPDATE - Upgrading Practice through Design and
Technology/Engineering Education).
