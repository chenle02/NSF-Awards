In the work supported by this award the principal investigator will extend some
of his work on the infinite-line Kaup-Newell perturbation theory for a single
soliton solution of a nonlinear Schroedinger system to the multiple soliton
case. This work has applications to the transmission of data in the form of wave
packets through nonlinear optical fibers, and so such it is highly relevant to
the design of modern communications' systems that utilize optical fiber
technology. The principal investigator will employ methods based upon
asymptotics in order to study the behavior of solutions of nonlinear systems of
partial differential equations. Every day, it seems, there are articles in the
newspapers about the use of fiber optics technologies in the design of modern
communications systems. Indeed, telephone companies and computer companies are
very much interested in designing "lossless" ways of transmitting data. One
possible solution is the emerging technologies based upon fiber optics, since
fiber optics affords the potential of transmitting data without significant
dispersion or distortion. With this award the principal investigator will study
solutions of the nonlinear system of equations that describes the propagation of
waves through optical fibers.
