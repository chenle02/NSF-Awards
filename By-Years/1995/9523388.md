9523388 Qi The objective of this research is to develop a neural network model
which is characterized by: (1) simple conventional neural operations, including
the summation and the nonlinear activation function, are involved in the neural
model; (2) the dynamic behavior of the structure is completely represented by
the trained neural model itself, namely, given the initial conditions and the
excitation force, the structural responses are predicted from only the trained
neural model.
