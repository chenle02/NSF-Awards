This research project, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
Program, explores the dynamics of adsorbate photofragmentation and photoreaction
on platinum single crystal surfaces. Both UHV surface science techniques as well
as laser spectroscopic methods will be used to provide detailed information
about the process of photoinduced reactions on solid surfaces. The restricted
geometry and energy range probed in these surface aligned photoreactions may
provide a general understanding of chemical reaction dynamics, and will
challenge our present understanding of reaction processes at solid surfaces. %%%
The reaction between adsorbed molecules initiated by the absorption of light
will be used as a general probe of the dynamics of chemical reactions. The
insight gained from these studies will increase our understanding of surface
reactions in particular, and molecular reaction chemistry in general. In
addition, there may be benefits to the understanding of important surface
catalyzed reaction processes.
