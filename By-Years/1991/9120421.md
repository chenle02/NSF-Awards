Dr. Eric Herbst at Ohio State University will continue a program of research in
the chemistry of interstellar clouds made up of gas and dust. Portions of these
clouds are in the process of collapsing to form new stars and probably planets
as well. The objectives of this research program are to understand the various
types of chemical processes that are occurring under the unusual physical
conditions present in interstellar clouds and to utilize these processes in
large scale simulations of the chemistry. Up to now Dr. Herbst's simulations
have utilized only chemical reactions occurring in the gas phase of interstellar
clouds; he will now include processes occurring on tiny dust particles as well.
Dr. Herbst also intends to study a variety of chemical processes that occur in
interstellar clouds that are poorly understood in the laboratory.
