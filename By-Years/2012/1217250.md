The proposed activity is the completion of the I-Corp program by the team of
Marshall Van Alstyne (PI), Dawei Shen (entrepreneurial lead), and Robert Lloyd
(mentor). Based on prior NSF grant 0925004, Van Alastyne and Shen have studied
effects of knowledge markets on information sharing and worker productivity
within firms. Empirical research suggests that provision of knowledge markets to
workers can have large positive effects on the productivity. They have also
created Barter, a prototype knowledge market that has been successfully used in
classroom settings at several universities to enhance student learning. The
intellectual contribution is to use economic theory to optimize crowdsourcing.
Over the course of the I-Corp program, Van Alstyne, Shen, and Lloyd will
validate the company business model in light of early customer feedback while
completing a prototype commercial product based on the successful academic
prototype. A prototype customer relationship with the Commonwealth Bank of
Australia has already been established and discussions are underway with other
potential enterprise customers.

Organizations have sought gains through knowledge sharing for more than 50
years, implementing suggestion boxes, intranets, share drives, and now social
wikis. Despite significant global investments, firms have had difficulty coaxing
participation, efficiently generating new ideas, and accurately valuing those
ideas. Techniques to successfully perform these tasks have the potential to
broadly increase information access and dramatically increase commercial
productivity. Based on an empirical study of a Japanese bank, the team found
that one standard deviation increase in use of a knowledge market improved
worker productivity by 10%. The National Bureau of Economic Research and
European Economic Association peer reviewed these results. The World Bank has
also asked to use the team's tools. Economists broadly argue that knowledge
production is a key factor in worker productivity, which in turn is a major
driver of wages and economic growth. If the team can replicate even a small
portion of these results on a large scale, it could have an enormous positive
impact on US and world economic welfare.
