The grant explores a combined experimental and modeling program that spans over
several length scales to advance our understanding of a new class of Fe-Mn-C-Al
alloys with nitrogen that have great potential in structural applications. The
main objective is to directly tie the deformation models with electronic
calculations facilitating design of multi component iron-manganese alloys
incorporating nitrogen and aluminum effects. Several model alloys involving Fe-
Mn-C-Al-N with various microstructural features (polycrystalline texture and
single crystals) will be deformed under compression and tension loadings. The
single crystals with specific orientations will be utilized to isolate twinning
versus slip effects. The electronic-structure calculations will establish
stacking fault energy and short-range order that will provide input to a micro-
mechanical visco-plastic self-consistent model to predict the deformation
response. Experimental studies using TEM will provide high-resolution
information on the dislocation interactions and these results will be used to
check the models at smaller length scales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant
represents a high priority in building a systems approach integrating structure
and properties for design of iron based materials that are critical to the US
economy. The success of this program will ultimately accelerate the design,
testing and adoption of new Fe-based material systems without the need for
lengthy trials of processing and testing to optimize the properties. The
outreach activities will include a short course on advanced steels for materials
scientists and engineers, as well as an advanced undergraduate course
development that will address the structure and mechanical properties of multi-
component alloys.
