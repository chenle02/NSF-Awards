With National Science Foundation support, Drs. David Grove, Susan Gillespie and
their colleagues will conduct archaeological research at the Olmec site of La
Isla which is located in Veracruz, Mexico. The name "La Isla" or "island"
reflects the fact that two streams bound the site which, unfortunately, is being
destroyed through lateral erosion by each stream bed. Material abundant on both
the surface as well as stream walls supports the attribution of this small site
to the Olmec. The investigators plan to conduct an intensive surface survey to
locate and plot object densities and distributions. This should provide clues to
the nature of individual activity areas and on this basis, limited excavations
will be conducted. With the stream wall materials to guide them, the team will
also conduct horizontal excavations. In addition to cultural materials such as
pottery, both plant and animal remains will constitute an important focus of the
research since the investigators wish to reconstruct subsistence practices. The
Olmec society developed and flourished in the tropical lowlands of Mexico's
southern Gulf coast between 1200 and 500 BC. Large Olmec sites contain Middle
America's first large public architecture and massive stone monuments. Olmec has
been termed the "America's first civilization." Surprisingly, however,
relatively little is known about them and is limited to old data from two large
sites. Very little is known about either Olmec social organization or
subsistence. Archaeologists have learned that to answer such questions it is
best to examine smaller sites where people lived rather than concentrate on
large ceremonial centers which served as focus for ritual events. This research
by Drs. Grove and Gillespie is the first to be conducted in such a situation.
This research is important for several reasons. It will shed light on the
factors which gave rise to the Olmec civilization. It will also provide data of
interest to a large group of archaeologists.
