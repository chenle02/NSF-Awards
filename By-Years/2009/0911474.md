Spiridoula Matsika of Temple University is supported by an award from the
Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program to develop and use theoretical
models to understand photo-initiated phenomena in biologically relevant systems.
In particular, she and her research group are studying the photo-initiated
processes of pi-stacked dimers of nucleobases, to establish how the pi stacking
changes the fluorescent properties of fluorescent analogs. The PI and coworkers
are developing new local multireference configuration interaction methods that
will allow efficient study of these relatively large systems. One primary
emphasis is on the role of nonadiabatic phenomena, such as conical
intersections, on the dynamics of biological systems.

Photo-initiated processes, the subject of this work, play an important role in
photosynthesis, vision, and photochemical damage and repair in DNA. These
processes are facilitated by conical intersections, one primary subject of this
study.
