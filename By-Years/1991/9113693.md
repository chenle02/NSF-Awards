The research proposed here is aimed at enhancing significantly the range of
chemical systems that can be studied by bringing together - in a single research
team - the most advanced quantum theoretical and computational scattering
methods with the most advanced numerical algorithms for solving the kinds of
mathematical problems that are at the core of these scattering methods. The goal
is to establish a working interface between recent advances in numerical
algorithms and corresponding breakthroughs in high-performance computing whereby
newly developed and efficient numerical methods are integrated with existing
scattering codes with the resulting programs tailored to be executed with
maximum efficiency on distributed memory MIMD- type supercomputers, such as a
Hypercube. The plan is to develop sufficiently powerful approaches that we will
be able to carry out benchmark studies on the role of long-lived complexes
(i.e., quantum resonances) in chemical reactions involving a high density of
state.
