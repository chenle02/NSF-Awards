ABSTRACT A conference on Non-Standard Case and Argument Structure will take
place at the Linguistic Institute to be held at the University of Arizona in the
summer of 1989. The conferees are actively engaged in work on the problems of
non-standard case, and a majority of them will be in residence at the Institute.
Issues concerning non-standard case have become increasingly pressing as work on
typological questions and universal grammar have come to rely on a larger data
base, and to focus on "exotic" or less familiar languages of the world.
