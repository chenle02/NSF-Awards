This three year renewal of a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site
Program, Interdisciplinary Water Science and Engineering, at Virginia Tech,
offers an interdisciplinary research experience to a diverse cohort of students
on projects leading to sustainable management of water resources in an
interdisciplinary environment. New features of this renewal program include an
international component in India and collaboration of some of the REU scholars
with VT RET Site participants. The Site will expand the pool of future
researchers in water science who will address one of the National Academy of
Engineering (NAE) Grand Challenges, (i.e. provide access to clean water).
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;VT will host 10 REU scholars over a 10-week summer program
where they will be provided with a high-quality learning environment that: 1)
stimulates their scientific curiosity in interdisciplinary water research and
motivates them to pursue advanced degrees in water sciences and engineering; 2)
trains them to communicate scientific information through research papers,
seminars, and presentations; and 3) facilitates their social, intellectual, and
professional growth. Twelve faculty mentors from diverse academic disciplines
will direct REU scholars research.
