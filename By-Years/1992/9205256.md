The principal investigator will develop experimental methods for the measurement
of photoconductivity of selected insulating and semiconducting minerals. The PI
will then relate photoconductivity spectra to energy level structure, and
extract information on transport properties such as carrier densities and degree
of delocalization of excited states. Ultimately he wishes to demonstrate the
value of these spectra for interpretation of electronic and transport properties
of minerals.
