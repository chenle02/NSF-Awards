The Triangle Coalition of Science and Technology Education held a conference on
Local Alliances for Science and Technology Education at the Wingspread
Conference Center, Racine, Wisconsin. One of the most important outcomes of this
conference will be a Handbook on Local Alliances, which will contain guidelines
and suggestions for the development and operation of local or regional support
groups. This Handbook will include descriptions of existing local organizations
which could provide nuclei for local alliances, lists of cooperating
professional organizations, examples of local alliance activities, budgets,
sources of funding, do's and don'ts for the formation of such alliances, and
suggestions for long-range alliance goals and strategies.
