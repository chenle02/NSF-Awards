Sara and Weyland, J. A. "Skill Summer Science Camp for American Indian Students"
The Skill Summer Science Camp Program of the South Dakota School of Mines and
Technology will be a 4-week residential math/science program for American Indian
students. Fifty American Indian students per summer will be selected from South
Dakota's nine Indian reservations to participate each summer. The goals of the
Skill Summer Science Camp are to provide a foundation for a lifelong interest in
science and mathematics for all participants and to encourage the consideration
of SEM as possible career choices. Students entering eighth grade will be
selected based on their application and teacher's recommendation/commitment to
assist with a Science Fair project. The curriculum uses a hands-on discovery
approach, collaborative learning work groups and interdisciplinary curriculum.
The disciplinary focus is on "Mathematical Problem Solving in Physics" with Dr.
Jack Weyland. Basic Skills Research Careers Mathematical Problem Science Fair
Robotics Solving in Physics Project Development Career Seminars Computer Labs
Geology/Paleontology Communications Math Applications In order to provide
intensive role model/mentor experiences, the program staff/faculty includes over
19 SDSM&T faculty and AISES students, and tribal school/college faculty to work
with the SSC students. Evening programs will include astronomy, Project Wild
(environmental activities from the Game, Fish and Parks Dept.), field trips and
cultural activities. parents will be invited to participate in the Family Math
programs each week as well as the geology field trip, science fair and
graduation. School year follow-up will include: bi-monthly newsletters,
