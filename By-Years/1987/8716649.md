Description: This project supports travel of Indian scientists to attend the
Second International Conference on Case Histories in Geotechnical Engineering,
in St. Louis, MO., June 1-5, 1988. The conference will address case histories in
geotechnical and hydrological management of solid, hazardous and radioactive
solids, geological engineering and rock mechanics, dams, embankments and slopes,
earthquake engineering and soil dynamics, and soil-structure interaction. Proper
documentation of case histories is planned to help bridge the gap between theory
and practice. In addition, areas of future research to meet existing needs will
be identified. Scope: Of some 345 papers from 46 countries submitted for
presentation at the conference, 35 are from Indian scientists and engineers. The
meeting should bring U.S. and Indian scientists to exchange important results of
research and experiences gained in the two countries, and to help plan useful
collaboration in this area.
