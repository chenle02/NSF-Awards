In this project in the Physical Chemistry program of the Chemistry Division,
Prof T. Darrah Thomas of the Oregon State University will engage in a study of
the inner-shell excitation and deexcitation of molecules by electron
spectroscopy. Of primary interest is the development of facilities to perform
Auger-photoelectron coincidence spectroscopy in the gas phase and on using zero-
kinetic energy spectroscopy to determine the lifetimes of core-ionized
molecules. In addition, the relationship between the inner-shell ionization
energies and other chemical properties will continue to be investigated. In
Auger-photoelectron spectroscopy the spectrum is measured in coincidence with
photoelectrons of selected energy. This technique makes it possible to study the
deexcitation pathways of a single, selected excited state and thereby it is an
important aid in the understanding of complex Auger spectra. This technique has
heretofore been applied only to solids. The aim of this project is to extend its
applicability to systems in the gaseous phase. Core-ionization energies can be
related directly to the factors that influence a number of chemical properties.
Research in the two areas of Auger photoelectron spectroscopy and core-
ionization energies will contribute to a better understanding of chemical
phenomena.
