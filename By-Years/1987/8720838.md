This grant supports a three-day workshop to assess the state of the art of
hydraulic fracturing stress measurements. It will bring together scientists and
engineers involved in theoretical, laboratory, and field aspects of the method,
and is particularly timely when use of in situ stress measurements is becoming
crucial for earthquake-related studies.
