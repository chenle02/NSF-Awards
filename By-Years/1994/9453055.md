9453055 Casjens The Utah Museum of Natural History at the University of Utah
will use this planning grant to plan an exhibit called "Canyon Through Time;
Reverse Archaeology in the Grand Gulch Region." They will use the knowledge and
viewpoint of the several living cultures concerned in telling this story looking
at the past, the present, and the future. Breaking from the tradition of
presenting only the archaeologist's "voice" in an exhibit, they will have
different "voices." Their goal is to give both the local Native Americans and
scientists the opportunity to tell the story as they see it. The planning grant
will give them the opportunity to bring together individuals representing this
diversity of viewpoint to establish the script of the exhibit. The project has
the potential for serving as a model for others developing exhibits and projects
on archaeological and anthropological themes where it is valuable to bring
together this diversity of perspectives.
