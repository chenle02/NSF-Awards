ABSTRACT CBET - 1264174 &lt;br/&gt;Ratner, Daniel &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
objective of this proposal is to advance silicon photonic biosensor technology
towards clinical use by dramatically reducing the size and cost of the optical
source while enhancing performance through (1) the combination of novel
integrated silicon nanophotonic devices designed for use with low-cost lasers
and (2) interfacial chemistries optimized for label-free detection in complex
biological media?including blood, plasma, and serum. Specifically, they will
develop highly sensitive slot-waveguide Bragg grating and ultrathin
interferometer waveguide sensors that are compatible with low-cost laser
sources. These devices will be designed to detect small analytes (e.g. proteins
and small molecules) and larger particles (e.g. cells, cell fragments, viruses),
providing the flexibility to support the diverse needs of biomedical researchers
and clinicians.
