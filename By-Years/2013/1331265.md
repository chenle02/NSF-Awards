The research team will work with agricultural extension agents, policy makers,
multilateral development agencies and organizations, and farmers, employing a
range of methods including document analysis, open-ended interviews, surveys,
participatory mapping, and ethnographic observation to explore relationship
between the professionalization of agricultural scientists and extension agents
and the spread of agro-industrial commodity production.

The results will contribute to understanding the complex factors affecting food
security. Results will include a doctoral dissertation, undergraduate course
materials, and multiple publications. The PI has a strong track record of
presenting to relevant agencies and meeting with high level staff and will seek
to present the results of the project in such venues.
