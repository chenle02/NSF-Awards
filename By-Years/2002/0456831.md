Abstract

Proposal Title: New Generation Tailored Adsorptive Membranes Proposal Number:
CTS-0456831 Principal Investigator: Ranil Wickramasinghe Institution: Colorado
State University

The objective of this project is to develop adsorptive membranes as a new, high
efficiency unit operation for the recovery and purification of the products of
modern molecular biology, such as plasmid DNA, large proteins, and viruses and
viral vectors. Novel, high-throughput membranes will be developed as alternative
chromatographic supports. Since the feed is pumped through the membrane pores,
pore diffusion can be eliminated, leading to binding capacities that are
independent of flow rate. As the capacities of adsorptive membranes are
equivalent to or greater than those of chromatographic resins, the membrane
volume required will be much less than current packed-bed volumes. The research
focuses on virus and viral vector purification for gene therapy and vaccine
production, as well as virus clearance, which is essential in the production of
antibodies and biopharmaceuticals from cell cultures. Five objectives will be
pursued: 1) Commercially available membranes and functionalized membranes will
be characterized to determine their porosities, pore-size distributions and
surface chemistries. Optimized conditions for virus adsorption and the elution
of bound viruses will be determined. 2) Non-track-etched membranes will be
modified by graft polymerization from the membrane surface. 3) Track-etched
membranes will be modified by graft polymerization from the membrane surface.
Comparing virus adsorption by track-etched and non-track-etched membranes will
provide useful information on the optimum membrane morphology for virus
adsorption. 4) Copolymer grafts comprising an ion-exchange monomer and a
"spacer" co-monomer will be grown from the membrane surfaces to examine how
spatial distribution of ion-exchange sites affects virus binding. 5) A
predictive model of practical value for virus clearance will be developed. This
model will provide insights into adsorption of viruses not tested here and will
include the effects of membrane pore-size distribution. In terms of the broader
impacts, the PIs will work with the directors of programs at their institutions
that focus on increasing participation in research by undergraduates from
underrepresented groups. NSF supplemental award mechanisms such as REU, RET, and
international supplements will be sought to support summer undergraduate
researchers and teachers in residence and to strengthen the international
collaboration. Applications of this research could benefit society by providing
breakthrough technologies in bio-purifications.
