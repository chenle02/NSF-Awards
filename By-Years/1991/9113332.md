Allegheny College is establishing a connection to NSFNET via a 56,000 bits per
second line through the PREPNET med-level network. The connection enhances
collaborations of campus scientists with colleagues at other institutions, and
allows access to libraries and other remote facilities throughout the internet.
This award funds part of the costs for two years.
