This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the
conference "Perspectives in Harmonic Analysis, Geometric Measure Theory, and
Partial Differential Equations, and Their Applications to Several Complex
Variables" that will be held from September 13-15, 2012, on the campus of Temple
University.

This conference brings together a diverse group of mathematicians specializing
in the fields of harmonic analysis, geometric measure theory, partial
differential equations, and several complex variables with the overall objective
of fostering collaborations between the participants on problems of common
interest and facilitating access to each other's expertise. The purpose of the
event is to present some of the recent significant theoretical advances in the
aforementioned areas to an audience comprising both experts and young analysts.
It is the hope of the organizers is that, as a by-product of the conference, a
plan will emerge for coordinating attacks on certain problems arising in physics
and engineering for which the lack of smoothness (caused by domains with
intricate/irregular geometry, including slits and fractures) is a natural
feature. The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate
students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.
