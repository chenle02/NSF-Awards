An applied microchemical facility will be supported to carry out DNA and protein
chemistry for biological and biochemical research. New instrumentation will be
provided, and a wide range of research projects will benefit. The
instrumentation will allow continued production of synthetic macromolecules and
sequence analysis of natural macromolecules. Among the projects are studies on
RNA splicing, immune regulation, protein folding, transposable elements and
molecular genetics, mitochondrial function, yeast transcription and splicing,
sea urchin development, DNA and protein chemistry and new reagents for site
directed cutting, plant molecular biology, regulation of fruit fly transcription
and development, membrane function, developmental neurobiology, and other areas
of neuroscience, cell biology, molecular biology, and biotechnology.
