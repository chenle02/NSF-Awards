This award supports a workshop to identify new challenges and future directions
of research in computing systems, to be held in St. Louis on July 31 and August
1,1997. The objective of this workshop is to explore new paradigms in computing
systems research by establishing synergy among different subareas of systems
such as operating systems, computer architecture, compilers, networking,
multimedia, and security. The goal of this workshop is to bring together leading
experts from these areas to identify grand challenge problems in systems
research, and identify potential quantum leaps that can be achieved by fostering
a closer and focused collaboration among different areas. The workshop also
plans to address the issue of building a national level infrastructure for
systems research.
