Mathias The investigator studies the accuracy of parallel algorithms for finding
the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of linear systems and develops efficient
parallel algorithms for eigenvalue problems, especially the nonsymmetric case.
The first part of the project focuses on analysing the accuracy of parallel
algorithms -- in particular 1. parallel prefix type algorithms 2. Jacobi
algorithms for the (possibly generalized) symmetric eigenvalue and singular
value problems 3. implementations of the Hessenberg QR algorithm. The question
of accuracy is important, though little work has been done on it, because some
parallel algorithms can be much less accurate than the corresponding serial
algorithm -- so much so that the results that they produce are meaningless. The
second part of the project seeks efficient parallel algorithms for the
nonsymmetric eigenvalue problem and to improve the efficiency of the parallel
algorithms for the symmetric eigenvalue problem. The nonsymmetric case is
especially important as there is no algorithm for this problem that can properly
exploit the capabilities of a parallel computer. Parallel algorithms are widely
used and studied because they allow one to solve a computational problem in much
less time than if one were to use a serial algorithm. As parallel computing
becomes increasing common it is important to have parallel algorithms that are
both accurate and efficient. The goal of this project is to provide such
algorithms for problems in numerical linear algebra. Eigenproblems arise
naturally in every area of science and technology, so effective algorithms to
solve them have broad impact.
