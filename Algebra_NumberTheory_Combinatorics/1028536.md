A conference on Compact Moduli and Vector Bundles, which will be held at the
University of Georgia during October 20-24, 2010, will allow an exchange of
ideas in these interrelated subjects. The topics will include the moduli space
of stable varieties and pairs, including stable curves but also with a special
emphasis on the higher-dimensional case, and the vector bundles on compact
moduli spaces, with a special emphasis on conformal block bundles.

The objective of the conference is to bring together and strengthen an
international community of algebraic geometers including many young people --
graduate students, postdocs and junior faculty -- as well as established
researchers for discussing the progress achieved during last few years and to
produce cross-fertilization between several major fields of study and spark new
ideas and cooperation.
