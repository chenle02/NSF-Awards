The economic model of network services, both services for basic connectivity as
well as application layer services delivered via the network, is undergoing a
period of unprecedented change. For instance, Internet Service Providers (ISPs)
that offer services such as voice over IP are deciding to use proprietary forms
of service differentiation to improve these service offerings over those of
competitors. As more ISPs implement service differentiation in a proprietary
way, there is a danger that the opportunity to have a coherent architectural
approach to service differentiation will be lost. This issue is tied to the net
neutrality debate, in which one core issue is how ISPs and content/application
service providers should share revenue. Some fundamental questions include the
following. What are the market effects of having only competition between
proprietary service stacks versus having competition at each layer? What
architectural principles should be established in law or standards to induce the
development of a market structure that results in higher welfare for all the
stakeholders? Should both standard interfaces and/or charging practices be
enforced between providers? This project investigates questions such as these in
order to achieve a more complete understanding of the coupling of architecture
and economics in network services. The project develops game theoretic models of
the interaction of selfish users and providers, and then uses these models to
understand the welfare effects of different architectural choices. The results
of this project will inform the development of both the architecture and market
structure of the network services industry.
