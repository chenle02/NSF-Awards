The Land Information Access Association seeks funds to support planning
activities related to "Listening to the River," a project that will ultimately
result in a new model for engaging teens and adults in environmental activities
that can be transferred to other community groups and institutions. This long-
term project focuses on an environmentally and regionally meaningful topic (i.e.
watersheds), brings together teens and adults in scientific discovery,
transforms these explorations into radio segments and creates a children's
museum exhibit. Planning grant activities include: (1) a program summit to build
new partnerships with informal-learning organizations and reinforce existing
community networks; (2) assessment of the potential for a scalable, model
project; and (3) focus and refinement of program goals and objectives.
