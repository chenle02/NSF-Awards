9523045 Gulliver A study of cavitation will be undertaken in cooperation with
the German Versuchsanstalt fur Wasserbau in Obernach. The goal of the study is
to identify the major physical characteristics of cavity detachment and to use
these results to improve existing models for cavitation erosion damage. The
formation of cloud cavitation at the trailing edge of a cavity will be studied
in two different water tunnels with different characteristics, one in Germany
and the other at the PI's institution, in order to eliminate any test rig-
related scale effects. Both 2-D and elliptic hydrofoils will be studied to
understand the relationship between cloud cavitation and unsteady sheet
cavitation. The hydrofoils will be instrumented with both ductile probes and
pressure sensitive piezoelectric film to obtain a direct correlation between
pitting rate and the statistics of impulsive pressure events in cloud
cavitation. The results will be correlated with similar studies in the
conventional vibratory cavitation apparatus. ***
