This is an award to support research on contaminant interactions with clays used
in containment of structures for storing hazardous wastes. The objectives of
this research include quantification of the structural changes in clays when
they are permeated by organic fluids, determination of the distribution pattern
of contaminants in these clays, and examination of the feasibility of removing
volatile organic compounds from these clays by a vapor extraction process. This
proposal was submitted in response to Program Announcement NSF 88-99, Research
Initiation Awards. Results are expected to improve the engineering design of
containment ponds, landfills, waste covers and slurry walls associated with
storage of hazardous solids and liquids. Results may also be applied in a
process for decontamination of contaminated soils by vapor extraction alone or
in combination with another physical process, and/or chemical and biologically-
based remediation systems.
