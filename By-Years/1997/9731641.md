AST-9731641 Shfter An observational program will be carried out to study the
spatial distribution and outburst properties of novae in nearby galaxies. The
long-range motivation of the study is to acquire a deeper understanding of the
effect the underlying stellar population has on the formation, evolution, and
properties of close binary systems. Among close binary systems, the study of
novae are ideally suited to this task because novae are luminous (Mv about -6 to
-9), readily identifiable (due to their eruptive nature), and reasonably
numerous (the Galactic nova rate is estimated to be several dozen per year).
Unfortunately, despite observations of Galactic novae spanning most of this
century, little is known about the spatial distribution and population of novae,
in particular, and close binaries, in general. Taken at face value, the
available Galactic data suggest that novae belong primarily to an old disk
population, but that there may exist a distinct Population II, or "bulge" nova
component as well. The existence of two distinct populations of novae is
difficult to establish from Galactic data, however, as it is clear that these
data are heavily biased by virtue of our position within the Galaxy. The major
source of bias results from interstellar absorption, which obscures most novae
from our view, and causes uncertainty in the distances and thus uncertainty in
the spatial distribution of the relatively small fraction of Galactic novae that
are observed. The best approach to studying the population of novae, and for
establishing whether population differences may affect their outburst
characteristics, is to measure the outburst frequency, fade rates, and spatial
distribution of novae in external galaxies. As part of the research to be
carried out, the frequencies and spatial distributions of novae will be measured
for the galaxies M33, M81, and the outer disk regions of M31. In addition to
measuring spatial distributions and nova rates, B-band light curves of novae in
th e disk of M31 will be measured and compared with published light curves of
bulge novae in order to study any differences that may exist due to the
variation in the underlying stellar population. There will be undergraduate
students and master's degree students involved in the observations and data
reduction of the observations in this project. ***
