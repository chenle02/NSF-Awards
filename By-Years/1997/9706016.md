ABSTRACT ATM 9706016 CHIDONG ZHANG U MIAMI TITLE: Large-Scale Variability of
Atmospheric Deep Convection in the Western Pacific Warm Pool The objective of
the study that this grant is supporting is to improve our understanding of large
scale variability of atmospheric deep convection and the role of atmospheric
deep convection in air sea interaction in the Western Pacific Warm Pool (WPWP).
The achievement of this research will provide observational evidence that is
needed for enhancing our knowledge of air sea interaction. The research proposed
will conduct diagnostic studies on the convection, MJO and ocean interaction.
Both COARE and TAO data sets will be analyzed for this purpose. This research
will enhance our understanding of the MJO and the physics of ocean atmosphere
coupling over the Pacific Warm Pool (PWP).
