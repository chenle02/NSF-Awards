This award partially supports a series of three national and international
Frontiers of Engineering (FOE) Symposia organized by the National Academy of
Engineering (NAE) for early career researchers: the German-American Frontiers of
Engineering (March 29-31, 2012, in Potsdam, Germany), the U.S. Frontiers of
Engineering (September 13-15, 2012, in Warren, Michigan), and the Japan-America
Frontiers of Engineering (October 29-31, 2012, in Irvine, California). Each
symposium focuses on four topical areas. The topics for the 2012 symposia are
the following: engineering materials for the biological interface, serious
games, climate engineering, vehicle electrification, robotics, smart grid, bio-
inspired materials, massive data management, engineering for natural disasters,
engineering for energy sustainability, engineering for agriculture, and image
management/video analytics. About 100 outstanding young engineers for the U.S.
symposium and 30 from each country for the bilateral symposia will participate.
Each two and one-half day symposium includes four formal sessions, technical
tours, break-out sessions, and opportunities for developing collaborative
research partnerships. Sessions consist of presentations on cutting-edge
research, innovations, and emerging research opportunities in engineering fields
relevant to the symposium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The FOE symposia provide early
career scientists and engineers the opportunity for sharing research insights
and techniques to foster new collaborations and, in the case of the bilateral
meetings, deepen technical and cultural understanding between the countries'
participants. The symposia foster interdisciplinary and international
collaborations and serve as a reference point for many of the emerging frontiers
in research and innovation in the United States. American innovative capacity is
strengthened through these exchanges. Papers from the U.S. FOE symposium will be
published in a volume available on the National Academies Press website at
