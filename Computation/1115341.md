Thermal fluctuations in non-equilibrium systems exhibit remarkable behavior
compared to equilibrium systems. Giant fluctuations in binary mixtures of
miscible fluids have been observed, including in recent experiments in
microgravity. Novel mathematical and computational challenges need to be
addressed in order to include thermal fluctuations in traditional computational
fluid dynamics in a way that is consistent with statistical mechanics. This
proposal is concerned with the design, mathematical analysis, and computer
implementation of finite-volume methods for fluctuating hydrodynamics of fluid
mixtures, as well as applications to diffusively mixing fluids in gravity. The
following research directions are proposed: (1) Multi-resolution numerical
schemes for solving the compressible stochastic continuum equations; (2)
Algorithms for incompressible, and (3) low Mach fluctuating hydrodynamics of
miscible mixtures on staggered and collocated grids; (4) Simulations of giant
fluctuations and comparisons to experiments; (5) Study of the contribution of
advection by velocity fluctuations to transport in finite non-equilibrium
systems.

Flows at micro and nano scales typical of new devices and biological systems are
affected by thermal fluctuations. These effects are often assumed small and are
not included in traditional computational fluid dynamics. However, giant
fluctuations in the concentration of a polymer solution have been observed in
recent experiments conducted in microgravity on a research space shuttle.
Computer simulations are ideally suited for studying the details of this
phenomenon and comparing the predictions of existing theory to the experimental
findings. However, our community still lacks the appropriate computational
tools, including both algorithms and large-scale parallel codes, to attack this
problem. The investigator and his colleagues will develop such tools and use
them to answer important scientific questions concerning fluctuations in fluids,
in close collaboration with experimentalists. The developed algorithms will be
implemented in a public domain code whose development is funded through a
Software Infrastructure for Sustained Innovation NSF grant.
