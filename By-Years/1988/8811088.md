The scientific secretary of the Committe on Climate Changes and the Ocean
(CCCO) will be responsible for assisting the CCCO in preparing scientific plans
for the oceanographic aspects of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) and
in designing plans for implementation of specific ocean research programs under
the WCRP. Planning efforts will focus on the World Ocean Circulation Experiment
(WOCE): the Ocean Carbon Dioxide Program; and the Ocean Observing Systems
Development Program. The scientific secretary also will assist in implementation
for the Study of Interannual Variability of the Tropical Oceans and Global
Atmosphere (TOGA). The secretary will work closely on the latter program with
the Intergovernmental TOGA Board (ITB) of the World Meterorological Organization
(WMO) and the international Scientific Steering Group for TOGA (SSG/TOGA). The
secretary will organize and arrange for meetings of the CCCO and its subsidiary
bodies; prepare advance documentation for these meetings; compile reports and
other results of these meetings and assure their wide dissemination to the
global ocean science community; provide other staff assistance as needed for
program planning; and serve as the CCCO's primary staff liaison with the WMO and
Unesco's Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) to assure appropriate
intergovernmental funding and related support for CCCO planning activities.
