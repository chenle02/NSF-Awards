Mayaguez, PR 709 ILI - Instrumentation Project: Engineering Title: Metal Forming
Equipment for Manufacturing Processes Laboratory The present proposal is aimed
at asking for funds in the form of equipment grant for adding the metal forming
section in the manufacturing processes laboratory. The Mechanical Engineering
Department of the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez offers two compulsory
courses, a lecture course (INME 4055) of 3 h/w and a laboratory course (INME
4056) of 3 h/w, to the senior undergraduate programs of Mechanical Engineering
as well as Industrial Engineering Departments. While the lecture course INME
4055 deals extensively with the theories and analyses of metalforming processes,
such as rolling, extrusion, forging, drawing, high energy rate forming, etc.,
the laboratory course INME 4056 offers no experiment on metalforming, that is
needed for complementing theory with laboratory practice. The laboratory offers
practice on machining, casting, welding and metrology. A total void of
laboratory in the area of metalforming, therefore, produces an extreme imbalance
of practical experience between material removal processes (machining, grinding
etc.) and material forming processes (bulk deformation, sheet metal forming
etc.). This proposal, if and when accepted, will serve the propose of filling
the void between theory and practice in INME 4055 and INME 4056.
