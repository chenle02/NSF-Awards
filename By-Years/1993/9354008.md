9354008 Inouye This workshop on plant reproductive ecology, one of the most
dynamic fields in ecology, emphasizes pollination biology. It will be conducted
at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory, a field station known well for its
facilities and its research on this topic. Participants will review basic
concepts in plant reproductive biology, learn new laboratory and field
techniques for pollination studies, and discuss how these experiences can be
incorporated into a variety of undergraduate biology courses at any institution.
Participants will conduct individual research projects and help prepare a lab
manual. ***
