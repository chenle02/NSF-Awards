9631830 Mou This GOALI/Faculty in Industry award will explore ways to increase
the precision and functionality of prismatic type machining centers. The
technical approach links analysis methods and the technology of on-machine and
post process measurements. In this way it is possible to enhance both
manufacturing and inspection accuracy and precision. This award will enable the
principal investigator to go to Ford Motor Company's labs and collaborate with
Ford on determining the most appropriate on-machine probing techniques, and
defining ways to use probing data to diagnose machine tool errors. The methods
for identifying and diagnosing errors include on machine probing and
compensation methods, post process inspection and analysis of systematic machine
errors, and adaptive sensor fusion for compensation and controlling precision
machining processes. This research will help approach closed loop control for
discrete parts manufacture. If selected production parts that are measured off-
line by coordinate measuring machines, and this data is fed to machine tools
with sensors and compensation algorithms on board, then it provides a way to
continuously and adaptively improve the precision and quality machined parts.
