Model-based object recognition is a popular and difficult subfield of computer
vision research. The problem of model-based recognition of free-form objects is
addressed in this project. This problem has many practical ramifications and
robust solutions will be applicable in areas including modern manufacturing and
autonomous navigation. Prior work in model-based recognition will be used to
develop representations for 3D objects which are suitable for use in
recognition, prototype recognition strategies with an explicit goal of
efficiency, and disseminate their research results in the standard forms,
including electronic archives available over the Internet. The project has the
following major components: (1) Development of an object representation strategy
for free-form objects suitable for both image synthesis and object recognition.
Point-based representations are considered along with surface triangulations.
(2) Development of a recognition and localization technique based on the
representation strategy chosen. An industrial collaboration will allow the PI to
obtain variable-resolution triangulation-based models of free-form objects from
real range data obtained from real sensors. A small tabletop three-axis mill
will be used to fabricate prototypes of free-form objects from CAD designs.
