The most important high-technology applications of poly (vinylidene fluoride)
PVF plastics are in the general category of transducers, where its toughness and
flexibility enables its use in the form of thin films in ultrasonic and
hydrophonic devices over wide frequency ranges as well as in medical
diagnostics. PVF crystallizes in at least four crystal forms, the form being of
primary technological interest because of its piezo- and pyrolectric properties.
The goal of this research is to apply a number of unique processing techniques,
with the potential of directly yielding the desired form crystal structure, and
to characterize the resulting properties and structure. Processing techniques to
be applied include flow-induced crystallization, suspension-gel spinning,
uniaxial and biaxial tensile deformation, rolling, thin film quenching, and
electric field induced orientation.
