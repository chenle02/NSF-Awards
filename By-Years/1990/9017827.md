This award is for support of a study to establish a quantitative nuclear method
for determination of Antarctic ablation and accumulation rates and to provide
correction factors for the carbon 14 ages of ice samples dated using trapped
carbon 14. Recent studies have established the presence of cosmogenic in-situ
produced carbon 14 in polar ice. In conjunction with estimated carbon 14
production rates, measured concentrations of carbon 14 per gram of ice yield,
ablation rates which are in good agreement with the values determined from stake
measurements. Similar studies to determine accumulation rates have been tested
and the estimates are consistent with previous studies. This study will expand
the preliminary work done to date in order to improve the 14CO and 14CO2 vacuum
extraction techniques, by lowering blank levels and by obtaining more complete
separation of 14CO and 14CO2.
