The primary objective of this U.S.-Hungary cooperative research project between
Dr. Thomas Kerlin and Dr. Janox Valko of the Central Research Institute for
Physics, Budapest, is to draw upon long-term output data from several hundred
instrument channels of a Hungarian Paks pressurized water reactor to determine
baseline behavior of the power plant. The researchers intend to consider these
data along with those of a reactor noise diagnostic system to further advance
signal processing techniques useful in monitoring plant subsystems and detecting
maloperation. The expected theoretical and implementable results of this
collaboration should yield new information on: 1) behavior of reactor process
signals; 2) cause of variations in plant signatures; 3) use of signal
fluctuating components for instrument fault monitoring; and 4) use of non-
invasive tests for component surveillance and preventive maintenance. This
project in engineering systems fulfills the program objective of advancing
scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States and
Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool research resources in
areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
