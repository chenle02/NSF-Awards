This Doctoral Dissertation Research Support investigation examines whether state
legislatures organize themselves such that they achieve a parallel structure
with the state executive branch's administrative agencies. The purpose for such
organizational change is to increase policy expertise, encourage more efficient
oversight, or minimize power asymmetries between the branches. The importance of
this question lies in the observation that both legislative and executive
reorganizations are empirical regularities in state government, and yet there is
a dearth of literature explaining why such reorganizations occur. In fact, the
majority of the literature on state executive reorganizations concludes that
these reorganizations do not meet stated goals, or, basically, that they do not
work. What the literature on both legislative and executive reorganizations has
missed is the relationship between the two branches of government. That which
happens in one branch of government will affect the actions of the other.

This research will demonstrate that legislatures react to reorganizations in the
executive branch by concomitantly changing their own structures, and, further,
that they do so in order to maintain a parallel structure with the executive.
Thus, at its conclusion, this research will fill the gap in the literature
regarding the rationale for government reorganizations. The tests of this theory
require an examination of the changes in the structure of committee systems and
the structure of executive agencies. Data concerning institutional changes in
U.S. state legislative committee systems and U.S. state executive agencies will
be collected from 1900-1960.
