9550541 Bonney Project BirdWatch is a program that allows elementary and middle-
school students to participate in real science. Observational data, collected by
children in the schools, is utilized by ornithologists at the Cornell Lab of
Ornithology to study bird migrations and populations. Furthermore, in school-
based research activities, the students learn to analyze and publish the data
themselves. The outcome of this collaboration between the Cornell Laboratory of
Ornithology and TERC is a curriculum that can be adopted by teachers who can
attract birds to the schoolyard. A BirdWatch Learning Guide, consisting of a
Teacher's Guide, Student Field Notebook, as well as software for data
collection, analysis and telecommunications are the various parts of the
projected curriculum. Students benefit from the project by learning science
content, developing skills in science process and data analysis, learning to
share data and communicate findings and learning to work cooperatively on
research with other students, scientists and their families.
