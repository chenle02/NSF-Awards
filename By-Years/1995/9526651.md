Everett 9526651 Constraints on the large-scale structure of Earth's upper mantle
from global seismic tomography, plate motion reconstructions, and regional
tomographic studies on the fate of subducting slabs influence our view of
convection in the planet. The evidence supports large-scale, volumetric lateral
heterogeneity in the upper mantle, in addition to internal discontinuities at
410 and 660 km. Long-period electromagnetic induction data from the worldwide
magnetic observatory network can resolve large-scale lateral variations in
mantle structure. The PI proposes to develop and apply a spherical 3-d inversion
scheme for imaging lateral variations in upper mantle conductivity of the earth.
The inversion will be based on the PI's recently developed spherical finite
element code. Using the inversion code, and constrains from other geophysical
techniques, the PI proposes to 1) test the hypothesis that long period global
induction data are consistent with upper mantle seismic tomographic results, 2)
develop a regularization algorithm and invert the global induction data set for
the three-dimensional electrical conductivity structure of the upper mantle, and
3) incorporate galvanic and oceanic effects into the existing forward model of
electromagnetic induction in a heterogeneous sphere. The proposed work is likely
to lead to useful progress on 3-d modeling and interpretation of mantle
conductivity variations and provide independent constraints on mantle dynamics.
