Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal was received in response to
NSF-0019. Research is planned in which phenacenes, which are ribbon-like
molecules of fused rings, are examined for their potential to reinforce polymer
matrices with unprecedented effectiveness. The research activities incl3de
synthesis of the desired phenacenes in monodisperse populations of selected
lengths, preparation of microscopic mechanical test specimens, and small-scale
mechanical testing to demonstrate the hypothesis that the strength and stiffness
of nanocomposites made with phenacenes are significantly higher than those of
the corresponding nanocomposites made with carbon nanotubes. The research is a
collaboration that combines fundamental chemistry with materials engineering and
that targets undergraduate women being trained in the basic physical sciences
for the field of post-graduate engineering.&lt;br/&gt;
