9413970 Karner This is an award to provide support for purchase of equipment to
be used in research, education and engineering design projects. These projects
all involve determination of the chemical quality of water. Projects on which
the equipment will be used include studies of groundwater denitrification, the
geochemistry of groundwater in lignite interactions, electrochemical remediation
of contaminated groundwater, biochemical indicators of persistent chemical
pollutants, anaerobic wastewater treatment processes and assessment of
groundwater pollution potential based on use of geographic information systems.
This proposal was submitted in response to the Instrumentation Development and
Acquisition Solicitation, NSF 93-172, Academic Research Infrastructure Program.
Results of this award are expected to improve the accessibility of modern
research instrumentation for use by this institution's faculty in educating
students and in conducting research on important topics of environmental
significance. ***
