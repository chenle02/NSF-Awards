This project, supported with a Small Grant for Exploratory Research, will
collect archival material and oral histories from behavioral scientists who were
central in the creation of `disasters research` for the Civil Defense
Administration during the years 1951-62. Disasters research is a category of
behavioral science that views disasters as opportunities for studying social
processes (e.g., leadership, role behavior, social perception) in extreme
circumstances. Its rise and development offer insight into the state of U.S.
behavioral science during the Cold War years. The main purpose of this award is
to gather archival material and conduct oral interviews with five principal
scientists involved in that effort, many of whom are now quite elderly. Unless
this effort is undertaken immediately, the material may be lost.
