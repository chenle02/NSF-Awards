9300976 Baer Dr. Baer's previous results indicate that improved forecast skill
with atmospheric prediction models can be achieved with appropriate distribution
of model levels in the vertical. The initial studies were done with a model
beginning with a basic state with the atmosphere at rest. While this
approximation makes the problem tractable numerically, it is not terribly
realistic. Under this award, the PI will consider a model in which more
realistic assumptions and explore optimum grid distributions with respect to
latitude and height. The results of this research should lead to numerical
representations for weather and climate prediction models which are more
efficient and accurate and remove significant numerical truncation errors. ***
