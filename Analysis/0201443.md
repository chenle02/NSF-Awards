Abstract:

The first part of this proposal is to study the dynamics and the stability of
topological singularities in several concrete cases including :magnetic vortices
in the Landau-Lefschitz equations(Schrodinger and wave maps coupled with
magnetic fields),vortices and vortex rings in the trapped dilute Bose-Einstein
condensates(certain nonlinear Schrodinger systems coupled with potentials).The
second part of the proposal is concerned with topological singularities of
Sobolev mappings.We shall examine the effects of singularities on the denisity
of smooth maps,the topology of mapping spaces,the regularity and singularity of
various energy minimizers.Of particular interest is the global structures of
singular sets and asymptotic behavior of energy minimizers near such topological
singularities. Many interesting natural phenomena contain some sort singular
behavior and they are often manifiested through energy
concentrations.Singularities of solutions of partial differential equations
which describe these phenomena are,therefore,an important part of facets.We
propose here to establish a rigourous mathematical theory concerning probabilly
a most important class of such singularities ,topological
singularity.Topological singularities arise in many physical problems and have
been an important subject of much study over past many years.Among known
examples are magnetic bubbles in a fereomagnetic(or anti-
ferromagnetic)continuum,vortices in Bose-Einstein condensates and
superconductivity,topological defects in liquid crystals,as well as
skyrminors,monopoles and instantons which are particle like solutions in generic
models of high energy physics.These singularities not only carry definite
topological informations but also quantified amount of energies.Because of this
they are often more observable and stable energitically and dynamically.Thus a
rigourous mathematical theory for such singularity would be not only
mathematically challenging and interesting but also of fundamental importance in
sciences.
