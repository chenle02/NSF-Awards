The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project is to accelerate the use of special molecules known as peptides. The
last twenty years have seen extensive academic research on bioactive and
structural peptides for applications ranging from antimicrobials, vaccines,
scaffolds for tissue engineering and drug delivery, growth factors for cell
culture media, and bioactives for medical nutrition or the control of chronic
diseases. However, despite their great potential, few have advanced to
translation at scale, due in part to the prohibitive cost of peptide synthesis.
This project advances a peptide production system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
proposed project aims to develop a recombinant technology platform that will
dramatically decrease the cost of manufacturing of peptides beyond what is
currently commercially feasible. It addresses peptide production from a
different perspective than that of current recombinant peptide production
technologies. Specifically, taking advantage of the fact that peptides can be
treated as polymers rather than as folded proteins with a complex structure,
novel microbial cell factories will enable the peptide production and
purification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
