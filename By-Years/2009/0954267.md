Project Abstract: CAREER Mechanism of Bacterial Mercury
Transport&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inorganic mercury is toxic because it reacts with
sulfur atoms in proteins interfering with their physiological function. Bacteria
avoid such toxicity by transporting mercury found in the periplasm to the
cytoplasm where toxic Hg(II) ions are reduced to a less toxic and volatile Hg(0)
form. Three proteins in the bacterial mer operon are directly involved in the
transport mechanism: a periplasmic mercury binding protein, a transporter and a
mercury reductase. The goal of this research project is to understand at an
atomic level how periplasmic mercury is transported across the membrane to the
cytoplasm to reach the mercury reductase active site without first reacting with
other proteins. Our experimental approach combines structural, biochemical and
physiological information. Detailed knowledge on bacterial mercury uptake will
facilitate the implementation of improved bioremediation schemes to
decontaminate waters and soils from pollution caused by
mercury.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the project is to expand our
undergraduate and graduate curriculum to integrate our research efforts in
Structural Biochemistry to the teaching of Biochemistry and to make a conscious
and concerted effort to increase the presence of underrepresented minorities in
the Biochemistry research community.
