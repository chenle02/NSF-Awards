9304459 Pessagno PIs will: 1) integrate radiolarian and other microfossils with
ammonite and Buchia biostratigraphy in order to place the Jurassic- Cretaceous
boundary in selected sections in North America (CA, Mexico); 2) establish
magnetostratigraphy and relate it to biostratigraphy in these sections; 3)
relate biozones to geochronometric data; and 4) examine Sr isotope values in
these sections. Samples will be collected from Kimmeridgian to Valanginian
strata and farmed out to experts on ammonites and microfossils other than
radiolarians and forams. This work will aid in defining the J/K boundary, and
contribute to a more accurate ammonite-based chronostratigraphic calibration of
North American radiolarian zonation.
