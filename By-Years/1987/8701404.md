The Principal Investigator will study a number of questions concerning maps of
surfaces into a compact manifold. The maps under consideration will satisfy an
elliptic partial differential equation. In particular he plans to study the
structure of the moduli space of harmonic maps of the two-sphere into a
homogeneous Kaehler manifold. He will also investigate minimal surfaces in the
complex projective plane and study pseudo holomorphic curves with a view to
applications in symplectic and other geometries. Jon Wolfson has established
himself as one of the world leaders in the theory of harmonic maps. He has
accumulated a vast repertory of techniques, such as the structure of semi-simple
Lie groups, complex algebraic geometry and partial differential equations. The
subject of harmonic maps has recently acquired prominence following the
discovery of interesting global structure theorems on their moduli spaces. In
addition the connections with minimal surface theory in low dimensional topology
and with sigma-models in mathematical physics have led to a spectacular growth
in the number of researchers in this area.
