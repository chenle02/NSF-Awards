9520255 Dagenais This five-year continuing award provides funding to establish
an Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Optoelectronic Devices,
Interconnects, and Packaging at the University of Arizona/University of
Maryland. Fourteen companies and Government Agencies are becoming members of
this joint university Center. The initial research agenda at the two research
sites will address: 1) Optic Interconnect Development for Advanced Processing
and Network Systems; 2) Holographic Interconnects for Optical Neural Networks
and Other Applications; 3) Theory of Semiconductor Nonlinearities; 4)
Semiconductor Lasers and All-Optical Switches; 5) Near to Mid-Infrared Optical
Parametric Oscillators; 6) Novel Optoelectronic Devices; 7) Waveguide Waferboard
Project; 8) Semiconductor Laser Amplifiers: Packaging and Applications; 9)
Characterization and Modeling of Acousto-Optic Correlators; 10) Process and
Device Characterization. The Co-Directors and their colleagues are well known
researchers and are qualified to run this Center. This project has been
coordinated with Dr. Deborah Crawford, Division of Electrical and Communications
Systems. The Program Manager recommends the University of Maryland be awarded
$50,000 for the first year of a five-year continuing award. All subsequent years
will be funded at the $50,000 per year level. Near the end of each 12-month
period, the Program Manager and/or the Division Director of the of the
Engineering Education and Centers Division will review the progress of the
Center on a number of renewal criteria, including the following: 1) the extent
to which the industry/university interaction is developing; 2) the extent to
which the support base is developing; and 3) the extent to which a robust
research program is developing. If the review is satisfactory, the Program
Manager will recommends support for the next period of this continuing award.
