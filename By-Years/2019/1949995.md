This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site award to the University
of Wisconsin-Madison, located in Madison, WI, supports a total of 27 students
for 10 weeks of professional development during the summers of 2020-2022. Funded
by the Divisions of Chemistry and Materials Research in the Mathematical and
Physical Sciences Directorate, and led by Dr. Andrew Greenberg and Professor
Robert Hamers, students engage in independent research projects focused on
chemistry and materials applied to problems in renewable energy. Additionally,
students participate in professional development workshops and seminars,
including communication of science and engineering concepts. The diverse student
cohort participating at this site are well-prepared for graduate school and
eventual employment in the U.S. technical
workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through this project, students conduct
individual research projects to develop new catalysts and materials for the
conversion of light or chemical energy into usable electrical or mechanical
energy. The program helps students to strengthen their written and oral
communication skills through communication training, proposal presentations,
mid-experience report writing, and poster presentations. To ensure proper
mentoring and development of students, this project includes a mentoring
workshop for graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and faculty working
directly with the REU Program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
