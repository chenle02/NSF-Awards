The broad objective is to understand how organims can manipulate their DNA. The
model system is hypotrichous ciliated protozoa, which manipulate their DNA
extensively during development of the macronucleus from a micronucleus after
cell mating. During macornuclear development all genes are excised from the
chromosomes and exist in the mature macronucleus as 20,000 different and
separate DNA molecules ranging in size from 400 pairs (bp) to 12,000 bp. An
example of cutting and joining of DNA is the chromosomal actin gene, which
contains nine exons in the order 1- 2-4-5-6-7-8-9 separated by eight intronlike
sequences. The intronlike sequences are eliminated and the nine exons are
rearranged and joined in the order 8-7-1-2-4-3-5-9-6. Reordering and removal of
intronlike sequences is necessary to yield a functional actin gene. The specific
aims are: (1) to identify other genes in which removal of intronlike sequences
is accompanied by reordering of exons; (2) to track the temporal order of steps
in removal of intronlike sequences and joining of exons in the micronuclear
acting gene, followed by telomere addition, during maconuclear development using
primarily the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique.
