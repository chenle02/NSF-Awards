This project represents a collaboration between TERC and IntuVision to develop a
video recording and analysis system called VideoReView (VRV) that allows grade
four science teachers to record, tag, and analyze video in their classroom in
real time. The system will contain a number of features---such as a
sophisticated system of tagging and the automatic detection of important video
segments---designed to speed and assist the teacher in its use. The
investigators will then study and enhance the system in the context of
professional learning communities of teachers. The system is expected to enable
teachers to examine their own teaching, and that of others, in a much more
dynamic and specific way and to integrate video into their ongoing structures of
professional learning. To date, video analysis of teaching is out of the reach
of ordinary teachers. If successful, this research could change the way teachers
engage in their own profession and their understanding of, for example, student
thinking and argumentation in science---something emphasized in the Next
Generation Science Standards---but previously more difficult to do without being
able to replay and refine teaching episodes.

The complete VRV System will be tested with 18 Grade four teachers and
approximately 400 students from six schools in the Newton Public School System
in a Boston suburb. The emphasis of the study will be on the ability of teachers
to use the system with little outside assistance, means of enhancing its
features and usability, and its integration into professional learning
communities. A mixed methods research design will be used that includes surveys
and interviews. The study outcomes will be disseminated through publications and
conference presentations.
