The PI's will measure electric field gradients (efgs) in high- critical-
temperature superconducting ceramic materials such as YBa2Cu3O9-x(x=2) using
Perturbed Angular Correlation (PAC) Spectroscopy. The PAC technique measures the
electric quadrupole interactions of radioactive probe nuclei, which have been
substituted into specific lattice sites. The results may provide either evidence
in support of the BCS theory or evidence of different mechanism of
superconductivity.
