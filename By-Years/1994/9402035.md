provide a forum for presentation and thorough discussion of the most recent
developments in the study of prolactin (PRL) and other hormones of the PRL

expression, PRL and GH receptors, local synthesis and actions of PRL in the
brain, novel effects of PRL and mechanisms of PRL action, placental lactogens,
conditions of PRL excess and PRL deficiency as well as novel findings on
regulation of PRL release. Data obtained in different species ranging from non
