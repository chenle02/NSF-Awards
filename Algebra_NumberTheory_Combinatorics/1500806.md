Historically, the study of "special functions" originated in the fact that quite
a few functions of interest in applications turned out to be members of a single
family, the hypergeometric functions; more recently, the Painleve transcendents
have also begun to play a significant role in applications. Under previous
grants, the investigator constructed and studied so-called "elliptic" analogues
of these functions (a significant generalization that includes most of the
generalized hypergeometric functions and generalized Painleve transcendents in
the literature), as well as their implications for the more classical special
functions. The current project continues this work, and aims to provide a more
solid conceptual framework by relating elliptic special functions to
noncommutative algebraic geometry, which is a relatively recent variant of
algebraic geometry, one of the fundamental disciplines within mathematics.

This connection is based on a new construction of noncommutative rational
surfaces in terms of difference operators on elliptic curves (giving a discrete
analogue of D-module theory), giving rise to a (functorial) relation between
linear elliptic difference equations and sheaves on the noncommutative surfaces.
The Painleve equations (and generalizations) are most naturally interpreted as
flows in moduli spaces of differential equations, so one expects their elliptic
analogues to be related to moduli spaces of difference equations, and thus to
moduli spaces of sheaves. In particular, the investigator expects to be able to
leverage the existing literature on noncommutative algebraic geometry to
understand the structure of such moduli spaces, as well as various natural maps
between them (e.g., twisting by line bundles). In addition, since the new
construction of highly-blown-up noncommutative rational surfaces is considerably
more concrete than the previously existing constructions, the investigator
expects the project to contribute significantly to our understanding of such
surfaces in their own right (as well as their derived categories). Finally,
several of the difference operators that arise in the construction are
univariate analogues of operators that appeared in earlier work of the
investigator on elliptic analogues of Macdonald-Koornwinder polynomials; this
leads to a multivariate analogue of the construction with connections not just
to those elliptic analogues but also to certain integrable systems and to an
elliptic analogue of the "double affine Hecke algebras" of Cherednik.
