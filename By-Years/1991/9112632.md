Additional equipment to supplement the existing scanning tunnelling microscope
(STM) facilities at Notre Dame is acquired. The new instruments are an atomic
force microscope (AFM) and a STM designed for operation under ultrahigh vacuum
(UHV) conditions. Both instruments will use the existing control/analysis
system. The instruments will be used to correlate catalytic activity with
structural and morphological features such as size and crystal phases in model
supported catalysts and platinum single crystals. The new instruments will
permit the observation of structure and morphology at atomic scale.
