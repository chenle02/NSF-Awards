The overall goal of this research award will be to further develop an
interdisciplinary program in mammalian cell engineering. Specific topic areas
include: - Mass transfer and reaction in membrane bioreactors. - The effects of
cell density and immobilization on cellular metabolism. - Positive and negative
isolation of cell subpopulations using magnetic immunobeads. - Culture of
tissues.
