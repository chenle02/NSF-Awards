"Coastal Communities for Science: A Bering Sea Partnership" is a 3-year program
of collaboration among the WWF-US, four Alaska native rural communities and
regional scientists investigating the ecology of the Bering Strait. Its primary
purpose is to advance youth interaction with science and it proposes to achieve
this by engaging young people from high school and beyond to conduct research
with scientists. The project which involves training community youth on science
and research methods, capacity building of informal educators in these rural
communities to lead and encourage field-based programs, inclusion of community
elders in the overall learning and communication of science concepts and the
creation of a model of collaboration. The science content, an amalgam of
community interest and researcher interest, is grounded in local environmental
and economic issues. With WWF's support and electronic technology, this has the
potential of being a model project that is broadly disseminated at local,
regional and national levels.
