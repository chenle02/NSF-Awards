This grant permits Dr. Hylander and his colleagues to study the effect of canine
size on how animals chew. A detailed analysis of jaw movements and loading
patterns will be conducted on 4 adult male and 4 adult female baboons to answer
three related questions. During mastication, what is: (1) the influence of
canine size (males vs. females) on jaw movements, (2) the influence of the
mechanical properties of food on jaw movements, and (3) the relationship between
loading and jaw movements. The investigators wish to focus particularly on the
interaction of the three questions. To accomplish this they will analyze
vertical, lateral and front.to.back jaw movements with a magnet sensing
jaw.tracking system originally designed for humans. Loading patterns of the
mandible will be analyzed by both strain gage and electromyograplhic techniques.
One tgait which distinguishes human from other primates is the reduced size of
our canine teeth and the functional significance of this, which is evident in
the earliest humans, continues to be a crucial and much debated topic in
paleoanthropology. This research is designed to test the hypothesis that canine
reduction eliminates mechanical constraints on mandibular movements during
mastication. The elimination of these constraints supposedly allows an increase
in the sideway movement of the mandible during biting and thus increases the
overall efficiency of mastication. This project will help to answer this
question. The research is important because it will help to explicate the
factors which underlie human development and led to the appearance of our own
species.
