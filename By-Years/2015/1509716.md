Continuing a close cooperation between the Rochester Institute of Technology
Center for Detectors and Raytheon Vision Systems, the PI will develop new
infrared array detectors technology. They plan to reduce the number of material
defects (which is the major remaining barrier to using these devices in low
light level applications required for astronomical instruments). If successful,
this will enhance the capabilities of infrared instrumentation in astronomy by
dramatically reducing cost, allowing for larger detectors, and potentially
improving performance when compared to what is available with existing
technology. Beyond the astronomical community, this project could have positive
impact on US technological competitiveness. The PI will actively involve
undergraduate and graduate students in all phases of this program at the
interface of science and technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI and his team
will continue development of a new material system for use in astronomical
infrared array detectors. The devices use HgCdTe grown on Silicon using
Molecular Beam Epitaxy. Preliminary results indicate that the technology will be
successful for astronomy requirements pending further development. In this
second phase, a series of devices with improved design will be manufactured and
tested. The approach is to reduce the number of material defects while
maintaining high short-wavelength quantum efficiency. The proposed work
includes: growth of new material using a thick buffer layer design, fabrication
of twelve focal plane arrays in two designs, and extensive testing between the
fabrication of the two designs. This should enhance the capabilities of infrared
instrumentation in astronomy by reducing cost and potentially improving
performance when compared to what is available with existing technology. The
proposed plan features a tight connection between design at Raytheon Vision
Systems and testing in the Center for Detectors at the Rochester Institute of
Technology.
