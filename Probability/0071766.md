0071766 Schonmann Schonmann plans to work on various projects in the areas of
interacting particle systems, statistical mechanics, percolation, and other
related subjects in Probability Theory. The main objects of interest in this
research are the ergodic behavior and the relaxation patterns of several
interacting particle systems, including Ising models, contact processes and
other lattice spin systems. Percolation theory is also a major object of concern
in this proposal, because of its strong relations to these processes and its
simplicity, which makes it a paradigm in the study of probabilistic models with
many components. A substantial part of the proposal refers to the study of the
above mentioned processes on arbitrary graphs -- an important current trend in
the area. Several of the proposed problems have their motivation in phenomena
observed in nature as, for example, phase transitions, critical behavior,
metastable behavior of systems in the vicinity of phase transition regions and
domain formation and growth.

On a more informal and broad level one can see the objects of interest in this
research in the following fashion. A system contains a large number of similar
components and each component interacts in a simple way with a few other ones,
which are near to it in some sense. For instance one can think of the atoms in a
crystal interacting when they are close enough, or individuals in a large
population which may suffer or not from some infection with contamination
occurring between neighbors. The local interaction may involve a substantial
amount of randomness, but since the system as a whole is large, one expects and
indeed observes a much more predictable behavior at the global level. A great
deal of interest in such systems stems from the fact that the qualitative
behavior of the whole system may depend in non-trivial ways on parameters which
are built into the local interactions, but which only affect those in a smooth
way (e.g., the rate of infection between neighboring individuals in our second
example above). The general issues of interest are then the understanding of
which sort of equilibria can be reached by such types of stochastic dynamics,
how an equilibrium state is reached, and how the parameters which affect the
local rules may affect the answers to these questions.
