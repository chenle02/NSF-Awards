MCB9728324 Segall, Jeffrey This project is to understand the role of mitogen-
activated protein kinases (MAP kinases) in chemotaxis and signaling responses of
the amoeboid cells of the slime mold, Dictyostelium discoideum. This organism
will be used as a biochemically and genetically accessible model system to
delineate the molecular events by which MAP kinases activate adenylyl cyclase
and give rise to changes in cell motility. The project will focus on the role of
one kinase, designated DdERK2, which the principal investigator has already
partially characterized. The project will now identify and characterize
potential target proteins that DdERK2 phosphorylates. Approaches will include
both an in vitro biochemical kinase assay and a yeast two-hybrid genetic assay.
The functions of the target proteins identified by either approach will be
tested by analysis of the phenotypes that result when the genes encoding the
proteins are disrupted. Identification and detailed analysis of the proteins
should provide an understanding of the sequential events in this signaling
pathway, both in Dictyostelium and presumably other organisms.
