This objective of this project is to assess the field of "Epitaxy, Interfaces,
Defects, and Processing of Electronic and Photonic Materials." A workshop will
be held with presentations by prominent scientists actively working in the
field. The workshop will encompass the following topics: Fundamental aspects of
two- and three-dimensional growth; Atomic structure of interfaces and defects;
Growth and processing of electronic and photonic materials using novel concepts.
The basic idea of the workshop is to delineate the critical scientific issues
pertaining to these topics, and to discuss approaches or techniques needed to
address them. A written report will be prepared and disseminated.
