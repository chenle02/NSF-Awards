As much as 50% of the typical mammalian genome consists of retrotransposed
sequences, dominated by LINE-1 and various types of SINE retrotransposons.
LINE-1 encodes genes for its own retrotransposition, but is also parasitized by
SINEs for their movement. LINE-1 has been co-evolving with its mammalian hosts
for at least 170 million years and has had major impacts on their evolution.
However, two LINE-1 extinction events have been documented, affecting 9% of
mammalian species. Shutting down LINE-1 activity should result in a simultaneous
silencing of SINEs. However, in a LINE-1 extinction event in South American
rodents, the extinction of the B1 family of SINEs was unexpectedly found to
precede the extinction of LINE-1. Reconstruction of the common ancestor of the
extinct LINE-1 and B1 and analysis of their interactions in a tissue culture
assay will be used to explore the mechanism underlying their
extinction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although retrotransposons like LINEs and SINEs
have had large impacts on mammalian evolution, our knowledge of them is limited
to the study of sequenced genomes and work in model organisms. The arms race
between LINE-1 and B1, or autonomous and the corresponding non-autonomous
transposons in a broader sense, has been investigated by computational
simulations, but empirical data are scarce. Tools developed to understand the
mechanism of transpositions in humans and model organisms will be extended to a
non-model system with a unique evolutionary history. This proposal will
contribute to the larger picture of mammalian genome evolution and transposable
element regulation.&lt;br/&gt;
