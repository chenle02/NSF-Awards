SOIFER, Baruch AST 96-16924 Dr. Soifer will study infrared luminous galaxies.
The goals of this project will be to understand how the strongest starbursts
evolve by studying the closest high luminosity starburst systems, also to
explore the relationship between starbursts and non-stellar power sources in the
most luminous of these systems and to probe the evolutionary connection between
interacting galaxies and AGNs. The projects will be based on infrared
observations using the Palomar and Keck telescopes for spectroscopy and for
imaging selected samples of infrared luminous galaxies.
