9603187 Josephson Muscles which are capable of high-frequency operation use one
of two fundamentally different modes for controlling connection. Muscles of the
two modes are termed synchronous or asynchronous, depending on whether there is
or is not a 1:1 correspondence between muscle electrical activity and muscle
contraction. In synchronous muscles brief contraction, and therefore the
potential for high frequency operation, is achieved through the elaboration of
the components within muscle fibers (the T-tubules and sarcoplasmic reticulum)
which are involved in contractile activation through calcium release and
rebinding. The asynchronous approach to high-frequency operation is built on
shortening deactivation and sketch activation, features which are found in many
muscles but which are particularly elaborated in high-frequency muscles of some
insects. If one of these muscles is tetanically stimulated and subjected to
cyclic shortening and lengthening at an appropriate frequency, the force at any
given length during shortening is greater than the force at that length during
reextension, a consequence of shortening deactivation. Thus more work is done
during shortening than is required to relengthen the muscle, and there is net
work output, work which allows the muscle to contract repetitively at high
frequency when it is attached to an appropriate resonant load. It has been
proposed that asynchronous muscles should have higher mass-specific power output
and be more efficient than synchronous counterparts. They are expected to have
greater power output because less space need be devoted to control components
(sarcoplasmic reticulum and T-tubules) in asynchronous muscles than in
synchronous ones; more efficient because calcium cycling costs are substantially
less in the asynchronous muscles. Unfortunately, available information on power
output and efficiency of asynchronous muscle is insufficient to know if the
hypotheses are correct. These hypotheses will be tested by directly m easuring
power output and efficiency of an asynchronous muscle. The muscle to be used are
beetle flight muscles, chosen for being of convenient size and shape for
mechanical studies. Power output will be determined using the work loop
approach, in which a repetitive length change is imposed on the muscle and work
output per cycle is measured as the area of the figure formed when muscle force
is plotted against muscle length. Measurements will be made at a contraction
frequency and muscle temperature characteristic of those during normal flight.
Power measurements will be combined with measurements of energy expenditure,
judged by oxygen consumption or carbon dioxide production, to determine the
efficiency of the muscle in converting metabolic to mechanical energy. ***
