Videomicroscopy equipment is used for a variety of purposes in an upper level
cell biology laboratory and for enhanced student research projects: fluorescent
microscopy is used for immunofluorescent localization of proteins in cells and
fluorescent staining of membranes; phase contrast and DIC microscopy is used for
observations on living cells; while a high resolution video system linked to a
color thermal printer provides a rapid and relatively inexpensive documentation
of microscopic images. The videomicroscope system facilitates curricular changes
which emphasize understanding science as a process.
