This project represents a comprehensive petrologic study of more than two
hundred samples of basaltic rock collected from Kahoolawe Island, Hawaii.
Examination of geochemically anomalous samples along with those representing the
full stratigraphy and structure of Kahoolawe will provide a new perspective on
Hawaiian petrology and rare-earth element transport , in than no such features
have yet been examined within the context of Hawaiian volcanic stratigraphy.
These basalts will be analyzed for major- and trace-elements including REE.
Phase compositions will be determined and K-Ar ages obtained. The plan is to
characterize the island, interpret and establish the origins of its varied
petrologic features, and use the anomalous characteristics to model new aspects
of Hawaiian magmatism and igneous processes. These data will then be used to
modify and more fully develop existing petrogenetic models for basaltic
magmatism.
