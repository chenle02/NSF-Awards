Because we can not resolve stars up close, the need for masses and radii of
stars remains a key to a wide variety of astrophysical problems. The most
accurate way of determining these quantities is by spectroscopic measurements of
the line-of-sight ("radial") velocities of eclipsing binary stars with time as
they revolve around one another in orbit alternately blocking the light from one
another. The Principal Investigator (PI) has devoted his career to these
measurements, particularly to the measurement of orbits around massive stars.
The PI will extend this work for the next two years to stars with masses just
less than the Sun's and will use modern Charge Coupled Device detectors to
measure their orbital velocities more accurately than from photographic spectra
and for fainter stars. This work is expected to help place the Sun in the
context of the physical parameters of similar stars.
