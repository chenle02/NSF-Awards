Exact combinatorial solutions to the motion planning problem in robotics, which
use precise computational geometry techniques, especially for systems with few
degrees of freedom, tend to be more robust than heuristic or approximating
solutions; they can achieve performance that is theoretically faster than that
of naive solutions by an order of magnitude or more, and it is therefore
desirable to test their pragmatic feasibility in real systems context, both to
complete the somewhat abstract algorithm variants typical of theoretical
developments in computational geometry, and to show that they indeed perform
well in practice. This project undertakes the development of an `industrial-
strength' motion planning system for bodies translating in 3-dimensional
polyhedral environments. This system utilizes efficient and precise geometric
algorithms obtained through ongoing theoretical work, whose worst-case
complexity attains the best theoretical bounds known for the problem, and also
turn out to be very efficient in practice.
