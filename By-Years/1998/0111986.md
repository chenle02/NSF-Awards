This Doctoral Dissertation Research Support investigation examines the process
of representation in American legislatures by focusing on the effect of
political party system upon legislator roll call decisions. Poole and Rosenthal
(1997) found that most roll call vote can be explained by a simple one or two
dimensional model, in which the primary dimension is political ideology.
However, recent work suggests that this low-dimensional structure tends to break
down when two-party electoral competition declines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
dissertation explores this apparent linkage between party system and the level
of structure found in roll call votes by looking at three state legislative
chambers. Each chamber is characterized by a different party system. Roll call
data collected from these three states permits the evaluation of hypotheses
regarding the impact of party electoral competition on the dimensionality of
roll call voting and the distribution of member ideal points along those
dimensions.&lt;br/&gt;
