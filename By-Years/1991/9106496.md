Investigation will be continued for building more powerful computer programs for
proving theorems in mathematics. The work can be divided into subareas: building
provers with large-step capacity; using analogy to aid in proof discovery;
combining known methods for new proofs in higher order logic; and mechanical
methods for streamlining proofs.
