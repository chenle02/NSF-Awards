The investigators in this project will conduct laboratory and theoretical
research to advance our understanding of the atmospheric chemistry of isoprene,
which is emitted by plants and can lead to the formation of atmospheric ozone
and aerosol. This work seeks to specifically study the pathways that cause
isoprene to form secondary aerosol in order to improve atmospheric chemistry
models and allow us to better address pressing air quality issues. The research
will expand our understanding of atmospheric chemistry and train new
undergraduate and graduate students.

The research team seeks to determine the structure of yet-to-be verified early-
generation oxidation products of isoprene, the secondary organic aerosol
compounds that subsequently form, and to characterize these oxidation products
and their ultimate chemical fate. To address these challenges, this project team
has identified three specific research aims: (1) the refinement of protocols for
the analysis of isoprene secondary organic aerosols; (2) the characterization of
gas-phase oxidation products of re-volatilized multiphase chemical products; and
(3) the confirmation of these early-generation gas-phase oxidation products and
their secondary organic aerosol forming potentials. This work will support and
train undergraduate and graduate students and could potentially advance
atmospheric chemistry and climate models, which could subsequently be used to
inform pollution control strategies and air quality policies.
