This Research Planning Grant will be used to examine beliefs about gender
inequality in various domains such as employment, family, reproduction, and
beauty. The planning activities consist of development and pre-testing of items
to measure gender ideology, and further development of theoretical ideas about
the relationship between elements of ideology and social group membership. The
planning grant will provide resources and time for the investigator to refine
her theoretical model and her research instrument. This will greatly improve the
quality of the research proposal which is the expected main outcome of the
grant.
