Theoretical models of motion transfer from the ductile lower lithosphere and
mantle upward through the brittle-ductile transition and the brittle upper crust
are as yet inadequate to account for many phenomena, partly because of lack of
access to intact crust sections that represent deformation results from the same
overall tectonic environment. This project utilizes the Caribbean-South America
plate boundary, which has been the locus of oblique convergence for the past 50
million years to address this problem. This system has brought a sequence of
rocks to the surface that represent a continuous vertical section of the crust
exposed from west to east along the contact between the two plates from
Venezuela to Trinidad. Structural and thermochronologic data will be collected
and used to develop, refine and test models for the origin, response
partitioning, and exhumation of this sequence. Results have the potential to
place significant constraints on rheological differences within the lithosphere,
which is of fundamental importance in understanding tectonic systems and plate
interactions.
