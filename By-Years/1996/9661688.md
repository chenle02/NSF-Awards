This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will evaluate the
feasibility of pulsed-waterjet soil densification to mitigate against earthquake
liquefaction. Present methods to prevent liquefaction include various types of
ground modification techniques that are generally high in cost. The objective of
the proposed work is to determine operating parameters required for deep
compaction using pulsed waterjets and to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of this
approach in comparison with existing methods. A model of pulsed-waterjet soil
densification will be developed based on the test results and a theoretical
examination of densification mechanisms. The model will be used to estimate the
time and equipment required for ground compaction as a function of soil type and
depth. A comparison of the costs of the proposed technique with conventional
ground compaction will be prepared as the basis for a full-scale demonstration.
Thousands of square miles of prime industrial zoned land in the United States
lie unused because of poor soil foundations while the construction of industrial
facilities on reclaimed coastal land is becoming more common as port and
waterfront areas become more congested. With billions of dollars in
liquefaction-related damage during recent earthquakes in California and Japan,
developers and others are looking for new ways to improve the performance of
soils and structures under seismic conditions. If proven feasible and cost
effective, the proposed technique will have immediate application for new
construction on loose soils and dredged fill worldwide.
