IRI-9613737 University of Illinois-Champaign Hutchinson, Seth (Jointly funded
with the Office of Cross Disciplinary Activities $50,025 - 36 mos Total
award--$100,025) CONACyT: Visual Servo Control of Robotic Systems This award,
under the NSF-CONACyT initiative, funds a collaboration with researchers at the
Centro de Investigacion Cientifica y de Educacion Superior de Ensenada (CICESE)
in Ensenada, Mexico. The goal of the collaboration is to combine expanded
research in visual servo control of robotic manipulators at the University of
Illinois with research on dynamics and control at CICSE. This should enable
consideration of robot dynamics in the design and evaluation of visual servo
controllers, thereby yielding active visual systems of more robust design. The
research, which has previously focused on geometric aspects, will be expanded to
include the system dynamics. The research at CICSE will develop a framework for
evaluating a class of visual servo controllers and will also yield a basis for
performing rigorous stability analyses. This should lead to new capabilities for
engineering robotic systems in which the camera placement and the robot
configuration for manipulability can be optimized simultaneously. That could
expand the range of potential applications of visual servoing, especially to
situations involving moving obstacles and target objects that are moving in the
scene.
