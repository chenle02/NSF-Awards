Soil food webs are complex assemblages of diverse species that couple mineral
nutrient cycles in the soil to primary productivity of plants in root-zone
ecosystems known as rhizospheres. These interactions link carbon from plant root
exudates to a variety of predator-prey relationships that return excess nitrogen
through mineralization to the growing plant. Previous work shows that the
presence of predators in the rhizosphere food web can increase plant growth 50
to 150%. This project will use mass-isotope and molecular genetic techniques to
identify processes involved in regulating these interactions. Work will be
guided by a hierarchical mathematical model designed to predict how increases in
atmospheric carbon dioxide and temperature influence carbon storage in the
rhizosphere. Linkages between the carbon and nitrogen cycles in soil will be
clarified by experiments under different levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide
and temperature that move the ecosystem to new equilibria. One importance of
this project lies in its contribution to the debate over whether additional
carbon from increasing levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide can be stored in
soil. Other aspects of the work will identify mechanisms that promote plant
growth while sustaining beneficial interactions among bacteria, nematodes and
mites that prey on nematodes.
