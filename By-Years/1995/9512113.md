IBN-9512113 Roberts, James L. Classical chemical messengers in the central
nervous system are simple molecules which upon release are rapidly removed from
the site where their actions are exerted. The brain and other bodily tissues
also use small protein molecules called peptides as messenger molecules, but the
mechanisms in place to terminate their effects are relative unknown. Dr. Roberts
and Dr. Glucksman identified a soluble peptide processing and degrading enzyme
known as EP 24.15 and established its potential role in modifying peptide
actions. However, this enzyme has several unique features, notably that it does
not contain a sequence that will allow it to be secreted by classical pathways,
and it is located in the nucleus of the cell as well as on the cell surface.
These unusual features form the basis for the investigations to be performed by
Drs. Roberts and Glucksman. They will examine the intercellular pathway involved
in the secretion of EP 24.15 and the mechanisms used by a protein lacking a
sequence involved in secretion, to be targeted for secretion. Multiple forms of
this enzyme have been identified and the relationship of these forms will be
investigated. These exciting studies will reveal novel mechanisms involved in
peptide processing and secretion within neuroendocrine cells and have
implications for secretory biology, in general.
