Green, Elizabeth AST 97-31655 In a collaborative effort, PIs Green and Liebert
of the University of Arizona and PI Saffer of Villanova University will
investigate the characteristics of binary systems among subdwarf B stars, the
field counterparts to the extended and blue horizontal branch stars found in
clusters. Using precise new radial velocity observations, they will investigate
the frequency of binaries and the distribution of orbital parameters and masses
of components of the binary systems. The ultimate goals of the research are to
understand better the origin of subdwarf B stars, which make up the majority of
very blue objects found in sky surveys and are an important contributor to the
UV excesses observed in external galaxies, and, by analogy, the origin of the
blue and extended horizontal branch stars seen in clusters. ***
