9528238 Howell This proposal describes research in Microelectronical Systems
(MEMS) with particular emphasis on the development of an approach to perform
computer simulation of complex MEMS systems. The object of the research is to
investigate the concept of applying a generalized complaint mechanism design
theory of MEMS. The basic idea is to develop a "computationally compact" method
to model MEMS structures using the theory of complaint mechanisms to simplify
the description of MEMS structures. The idea is in contrast to several existing
approaches: (1) a finite-element technique which requires extensive computation
time and (2) a solid-mechanics equation method based upon the assumption of
linear systems. In the complaint mechanism approach a pseudo-rigid body model is
constructed which embodies the nonlinear features of the system in a compact
formalism. In this proposal the compliant mechanism theory is verified
experimentally with the fabrication of test MEMS structures. These structures
will use a 3 polysilicon process with micromachining at Brigham Young University
and MCNC. A simplified theory which allows the design of MEMS will be of great
importance to the scientific and engineering community working in these areas.
