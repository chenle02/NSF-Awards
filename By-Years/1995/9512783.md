9512783 Hanlin This Americas Program award will support collaborative research
between Dr. Richard Hanlin of the University of Georgia, and Dr. Miguel Ulloa
Sosa of the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM), to conduct studies
on the taxonomy and distribution of Mexican ascomycetes. The ascomycetes
constitute the largest of the major group of fungi and are important
ecologically as primary decomposers of plant debris, and economically as the
causal agents of serious crop and human diseases. It is proposed to study the
distribution and occurrence of ascomycetes in tropical forests of southern
Mexico, with emphasis on species associated with higher plants. These studies
are of great urgency in view of the rapid destruction of tropical habitats. The
data obtained from this project will add to our knowledge of the distribution
and identity of tropical ascomycetes, and will permit comparison of the Mexican
forest mycobiota with that of other tropical areas similarly studied. In
addition to contributions to mycology, ecology, and plant pathology, the results
from this work will help to increase our understanding of the biodiversity of
tropical forests. ***
