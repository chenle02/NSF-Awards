This proposal requests funding to upgrade four spectrometers of the shared
campus NMR Facility at the University of California, Davis. The upgrades will
consist of replacing the console, shims, probes, probe interface, and gradients
(when present) of the current spectrometers, retaining only the magnets. The
upgraded systems will constitute four state-of-the-art spectrometers for NMR
spectroscopy and NMR imaging (MRI): a narrow bore vertical magnet 500 MHz, a
wide bore vertical 400 MHz, a wide bore vertical 300 MHz, and a horizontal bore
(183 mm) 300 MHz. The instruments will be used for a wide variety of studies in
the fields of chemistry, biology, materials science, and engineering. The NMR
Facility instrumentation is utilized annually by over 40 faculty members from 22
departments of the Davis campus with $3,239,000 in annual direct costs of
extramural funding directed wholly or in part to NMR research, including nine
NSF grants. This proposal describes research plans of 19 of the most intensive
Major Users of the Facility, documents the inadequacies of the present
equipment, and details the benefits the new instruments will convey. The
proposed instrumentation is shown herein to be essential to the Major Users'
research plans, and will also play a major role in education and professional
training on the Davis campus.
