Newman 0109086 The principal investigator and his colleagues study the structure
and function of real-world networked systems, particularly but not exclusively
social networks. An empirical component is concerned with the discovery and
analysis of the structure of networks, including networks of collaboration
between scientists, networks of company directors, networks of personal
preferences, and networks of citations between academic publications. Studied
quantities include local observables such as transitivity and degree
distribution, and nonlocal ones such as centrality and community structure. The
investigator develops models to aid in the understanding of the effects of
network structure. Of particular interest are random graph models of networks,
percolation models of network resilience, and models of epidemics taking place
on social networks. The investigator develops new algorithms for extracting and
visualizing network structure, particularly the existence of communities in
networks and structural properties related to network resilience, such as path
counts and centrality measures. A knowledge of the structure of networks of
acquaintance is crucial to the understanding of how information, such as news,
rumors, consumer trends, etc., spreads through society. Similarly, networks of
physical contact between people govern the way in which diseases spread. A
proper understanding of the nature and progress of epidemics is impossible
without good network models. In this project the investigator determines what
the structure of the networks in question is, and also models the effect of that
structure on, among other things, the spread of information and disease. As well
as enhancing basic understanding of these problems, the project points to ways
in which network structure or dynamics can be changed in order to either improve
network transmission (in the case of information) or slow it down (in the case
of epidemics). For disease transmission, for instance, it may be able to suggest
effective targets for immunization or education campaigns to slow disease
spread. The new data resources and analysis techniques developed can be used to
study other problems in which network-structured processes arise.
