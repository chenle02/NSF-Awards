9453407 Nwankpa The research will focus on two fundamental issues in the area of
large-scale power systems: 1. Stochastic-Process Theory for Stability Assessment
of Power Systems The main objective is to provide a more realistic set of
assessment and control tools, through the use of indices and models for
stochastic robustness and dynamic uncertainty of power systems. These tools seem
to have two fundamental advantages over existing deterministic analysis: (i)
they are more realistic, and more appropriate for the existing motor loads,
bang-bang controlled heating devices, air conditioners and modern power
switching devices; and (ii) they take full advantages of advances in the study
of stochastic robustness that is yet to be used in power systems. 2. Improving
Electric Power Quality The plan is to work on a high-speed high-power switching
for custom power applications, which will provide a partial solution to
increased number of disturbances in power distribution systems. The system is a
distribution system controller, based on an optically-controlled high-power
switch. This research effort will closely follow a teaching plan which consists
of developing two new facilities to supplant existing laboratories. They are:
The Interconnected Power System Laboratory - For the study of power
generation/transmission. The Distribution Automation and Custom Power Laboratory
- For the study of power distribution/consumption. ***
