This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop an
innovative carbon- polymer-matrix material for gas separation applications.
Synthesized with a unique method, the material possesses unique chemical-
physical properties, such as liquid expelling and catalytic reactivity. These
unique properties, plus a suitable chemical modification, will render the
material capable of removing sulfur dioxide and mercury vapor simultaneously
from coal-fired power plant flue gases. During this Phase I program, the
feasibility to synthesize the proposed material and to use the material for
SO2/Hg removal will be established. The different synthesis methods will be
tested to optimize the material's liquid expelling property; different chemical
modification routes will be tried out to optimize the Hg capture capability; and
the material's SO2 and Hg removal performance will be evaluated.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will provide a path-breaking new technology
for flue gas pollution abatement, which is simple, low cost, and environment
friendly. The technology will greatly benefit coal-fired electrical generation
industry, which currently generates more than 50% of the electricity in the
United States. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
