Integrable Dynamics of Knotted Vortex
Filaments&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;0204557
Calini&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this continuing project we explore the
implications of integrability for the Vortex Filament Equation, which is the
simplest model of the self-induced motion of a slender vortex filament in an
ideal fluid, and which is known to be equivalent to the focusing nonlinear
Schrodinger equation (NLS). The goals of our research are to relate geometric
and topological properties -- in particular, knot types -- of large classes of
closed filaments to the Floquet spectra of the corresponding periodic NLS
solutions, and to understand how the knot type of a filament can change as it
evolves. The methods we employ include algebro-geometric constructions of multi-
phase solutions, Backlund transformations, isoperiodic deformations, and
perturbation theory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our work is part of a larger trend of
making connections between differential equations, which usually model physical
phenomena, and knot theory, which is traditionally a part of pure mathematics.
Here, we study a simplified model of vortex motion, which possesses a rich class
of knotted loops among its solutions, and whose mathematical structure is well
understood, in order to develop the mathematical tools necessary to effectively
address questions such as knot formation, stability of knotted structures, and
knot classification. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
