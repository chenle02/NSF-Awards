Interdisciplinary (99) A GC/MS instrument is being vertically integrated into
the undergraduate biology and chemistry curriculum, from freshman courses
through senior level classes. Project-based and inquiry laboratory experiments
using GC/MS are being introduced in a total of nine courses thereby serving to
modernize the biology and chemistry curriculum. Student understanding of and
ability to utilize technology to address scientific questions is enhanced
through early exposure to the GC/MS instrumentation. Additionally, the
instrument provides new opportunities for joint undergraduate student-faculty
research, including interdisciplinary collaborative research.

The laboratory improvements are being evaluated for their effectiveness in
improving student attitudes and student learning. In each course, evaluations
are determining the effectiveness of laboratories on overall learning of
concepts, and examining the effectiveness of using GC/MS to elucidate a concept
as compared with previous laboratory activities. These assessments are adding to
the body of data on the effectiveness of project-based laboratories as teaching
tools at all levels of undergraduate education.
