Theoretical methods will be developed to treat one and two dimensional fermionic
and bosonic gases at ultralow temperature. The approach taken is a combination
of the renormalization group method, well known in condensed matter physics and
the principal investigators lambda freedom technique used to remove ultra-violet
divergences.
