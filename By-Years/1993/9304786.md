9304786 Goelman The proposed work aims to improve the Hadamard spectroscopic
imaging technique to permit spatial imaging of metabolic intermediates and pH in
intact cells and tissues. The specific aims are to: (1) develop a technique to
minimize rf peak amplitude in the multiple inversion band pulses, (2) correct
for chemical shift localization errors, (3) extend the formalism used to
describe and develop the multiple inversion pulses, and (4) to write software to
run the Hadamard experiment. %%% The proposed research is aimed at improving
magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging. Current progress in imaging has been
based on water imaging. The proposed research involves other nuclei, principally
phosphorous, of importance to cellular metabolism. Obtaining spatial information
about metabolites will broaden the applicability and specificity of magnetic
resonance imaging. The main problems with imaging molecules other than water
have been technical. The proposed work will contribute significantly towards the
goal of solving theses technical difficulties. ***
