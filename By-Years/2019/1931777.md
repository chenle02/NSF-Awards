Chiral molecules are asymmetric molecules with left- and right-handed mirror
images (called enantiomers) that cannot be superimposed. The principal
investigator will use rationally engineered metallic and dielectric
nanostructures and structured light beams to substantially enhance sensing and
sorting of chiral molecules via an entirely optical approach. This could lead to
vastly improved particle and single molecule level detection over current
methods. The development of a new class of novel chiral sensors can
significantly improve the limit of detection and sorting of biomarkers of
diseases and/or single molecules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed development
includes, 1) use of chirality of optical fields to synergistically sense and
manipulate chiral molecules, 2) fabrication of planar nanostructures using
precision lithography techniques to create unique effects, 3) Potential use of
nanocubes yielding highly unique sensing capability for sorting of chiral
molecules as well as preferentially trapping molecules by chirality and 4) use
of nanostructures for the development of ultrasensitive chiroptical spectroscopy
using state of the art micro-/nano-manipulation techniques can lead to the
development of new class of sensors for molecular sorting.
