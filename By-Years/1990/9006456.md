This Engineering Research Equipment award will permit the purchase of various
pieces of video equipment to be utilized in a research program focused on
interfacial phenomena in multiphase flows and in materials processing. Two
thrust areas are the interaction of bubbles and fluid interfaces, where
experiments are to be carried out to complement existing numerical modeling, and
direct observations of the spin- casting process where theoretical predictions
are also available but in conflict with indirect experimental observations.
