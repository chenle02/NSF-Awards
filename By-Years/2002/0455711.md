This proposal acknowledges the fact that despite curriculum developers' best
efforts to ensure faithful implementation, teachers often make modifications;
reordering, skipping or adding lessons, changing an "exploration" into a
lecture, and so on. This project pursues three related research questions: What
types of modifications do teachers make (and why), which types of modifications
best help students learn, and how do teachers' modifications change in response
to professional development activities designed to help them become more attuned
to students' thinking? To pursue this research in collaboration with teachers,
the project will conduct professional development activities based on a
successful model from a previous project. Three teams, each consisting of nine
high-school physics, biology or ecosystems teachers of diverse student
populations (Montgomery and Baltimore Counties in Maryland), will meet twice a
month to discuss video snippets from their classes, collected with the help of
project staff. Discussions will focus on students' thinking and on how and why
teachers modified curricula. Data to be collected and methods used to address
the research questions include triangulating between data sources that include
videotapes of teachers' classes and team meetings, interviews with teachers and
test results from their students.
