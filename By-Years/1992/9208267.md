Ciesielski Wave-pipelining is a method of high-performance circuit design which
implements pipelining in logic without the use of intermediate latches. As a
result, several computation waves (signals) related to different clock cycles
can propagate through the logic simultaneously. This research extends previous
implementations of wave-pipelining in static logic to include dynamic CMOS logic
which is known for its smaller area and higher-performance. Previous work in
wave-pipelining uses the insertion of delay elements on signal and clock lines
to equalize path delays. These delays are often imprecise and can require a
significant amount of VLSI area. To avoid these problems, we equalize the paths
by restructuring the computation within the logic block. The restructuring at
the logic level, using tools of modern logic synthesis, is targeted towards
highly structured computations and regular arrays. The new methods are
implemented in a suite of CAD tools to make wave pipelining accessible in
automatic VLSI synthesis systems. Several VLSI test chips are being designed,
fabricated and tested to verify the feasibility of our methods and CAD tools.
