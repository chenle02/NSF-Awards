Research in Particulate Systems Engineering is crucial to advances in
combustion, atmospheric and environmental sciences, indoor air quality, nuclear
reactor safety, and materials manufacturing. The purpose of this program is to
provide research experiences for 12 undergraduate students each year in this
area at the University of Missouri-Columbia (UMC) during the summers of 1993,
1994, and 1995. At least half of the students each year will be selected from
institutions other than UMC, with several recruited from Stephen's College (a
women's college), Lincoln University (HBCU), and other undergraduate schools in
the state. Each student will undertake a specific research project, and a
faculty advisor will work with the student to develop his/her research skills.
An essential element of the program will be its emphasis on professional
development of the students. The purpose is to infuse bright undergraduate
students with an enthusiasm towards research careers, including graduate level
education.
