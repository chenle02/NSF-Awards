This study will investigate radar techniques and low-latitude ionospheric
instability and drift processes using the Jicamarca Radio Observatory in Peru.
The studies will focus on the origins of equatorial spread-F, long and short
period fluctuations in ionospheric plasma drifts and their implications on the
coupling of the low-latitude ionosphere to higher latitudes, generation
mechanisms of the equatorial irregularities at 150 km altitude and remote
sensing of those echoes, broadband measurements of the absolute scattering cross
section of equatorial electrojet and 150 km irregularities, and interferometric
imaging of ionospheric plasma irregularity structures. Additional research
efforts will be directed toward the analysis, modeling, and development of
atmospheric/ionospheric radar remote sensing techniques. ***
