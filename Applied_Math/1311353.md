Despite recent progress in the analysis of non-linear evolutionary problems we
lack a good mathematical understanding of wave motion in compressible fluids far
from equilibrium. This is a regime of obvious relevance in many applications.
Even for basic models frustratingly little is known rigorously about their range
of validity. A first step in a mathematical approach is to pursue a theory of
existence of solutions for a reasonable class of initial data. A key concern is
to develop methods that provide quantitative and qualitative predictions as
well. By pursing methods that give information beyond abstract existence results
we seek to assess the relevance and limits of models that are routinely used for
practical applications, such as compressible Euler flow. The models we consider
are formulated as hyperbolic systems of conservation laws. As a complement to
existence results for initial value problems we also seek general structural
properties of such systems. The aim is an understanding of how the "geometry" of
a system, as encoded in its characteristic values, eigen-frame, entropies, etc.,
impact the properties of solutions. This part of the project leads to questions
of independent interest in geometry, and also clarifies the role of underlying
structures in physical models.

Consider the following scenario: a perfectly spherical shock wave propagates
inward in a gas which is at rest within the converging shock. From experiments
and basic considerations it is clear that the shock will typically accelerate
and strengthen as it approaches the center of motion. Very close to the center
the gas will experience enormous densities, velocities and temperatures. This
and similar physical situations are of great interest in applications such as
high-speed flight, meteorology, combustion, etc. However, we currently lack a
good understanding of this type of fluid flow, and the reason for this is a lack
of mathematical insight. The basic models for describing the physical processes
have been known for more than 150 years. Nonetheless, we are still searching for
answers to even fundamental questions. These models are typically formulated as
systems of non-linear equations. Such systems are ubiquitous in modeling of
natural phenomena, and above all in connection with fluid flow - they demand a
good understanding. The mathematical aspect of such understanding is provided by
rigorous results pertaining to existence of solutions, their uniqueness and
stability, and their qualitative properties. The proposal addresses these types
of fundamental issues for non-linear phenomena that originate in models for
compressible gas flow. The problems we consider appear to be essential road
blocks that must be overcome in order to gain a proper understanding of non-
linear phenomena in fluid flow.
