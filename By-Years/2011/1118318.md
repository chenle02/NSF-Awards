ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;10 August 2011&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:
1118318&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution&lt;br/&gt;PI: A. Suchy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal requests
one Shipboard Scientific Support item for Woods Hole vessels; namely replacement
portable overboarding blocks. These blocks will enhance safety and keep WHOI
vessels in compliance with current wire and cable Safe Working Load standards
(RVSS, Appendix A) as well as improve science support
capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Woods Hole vessels support
federally funded scientific research throughout the world?s oceans and routinely
expose graduate and undergraduate students to seagoing oceanography. All told,
the KNORR, ATLANTIS and OCEANUS are scheduled to complete over 580 NSF sponsored
days in 2011.
