The proposed technology is based on the discovery of a class of polymeric
protein transduction domain mimics (PTDMs) with the unique ability to intra-
cellularly deliver a large variety of biomolecules (small molecules, nucleic
acids, proteins and even whole, intact antibodies). Both in vitro and in vivo
(with mouse models) experiments have been successfully performed demonstrating
the efficacy of this technology. These molecules are synthesized via Ring-
Opening Metathesis Polymerization (ROMP), which allows high fidelity over the
chemical composition and structure. These PTDMs do not require covalent attached
of the cargo, making this innovation applicable to various biomolecules and
extremely easy to use. This innovation gives potential access to many
intracellular compartments and functions thus offering new research and
therapeutic opportunities.

Accessibility to the human body and its highly regulated functions has always
been one of the biggest challenges for biomedical sciences. The human genome and
proteome projects have greatly contributed to elucidate many biological and
molecular functions of the human body and to advance treatment of diseases by
discovering new cellular targets. Unfortunately, this important knowledge cannot
yet been fully applied because of the lack of permeability and the high
selectivity of the cell membrane which makes these targets inaccessible. The
delivery described in this proposal has the potential to enable many new
research and application opportunities, especially, but not exclusively, in the
immunology field where it will finally become possible to manipulate the so far
impenetrable T-cells. T-cells play a critical role in cell-mediated immune
response, for example against infections, cancer and HIV. The ability to control
their activation, in a more efficient and safer way than the traditional
electroporation and virus infection, will have a big societal and commercial
impact.
