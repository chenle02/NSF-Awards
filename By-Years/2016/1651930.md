The broader impact/commercial application of this I-Corps project is faster and
less painful bone grafting experiences for patients world-wide. Patients undergo
millions of bone grafting procedures every year prior to dental implant
placement, to fuse spinal vertebrae and following traumatic injuries such as
combat blasts and motor vehicle accidents. Currently used bone grafting
materials provide unreliable outcomes requiring repeat bone grafting procedures
at substantial added costs to patients and the healthcare system. Development of
improved bone grafting materials represents a significant commercial
differentiation by enhancing the bone grafting patient
experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is focused on better
defining the commercial opportunity for a degradable magnesium-based barrier
membrane for primary use in dental bone grafting procedures. Previously
conducted NSF-funded research demonstrated that degradable magnesium devices
enhanced bone regeneration following injury. This finding led to the assessment
of a degradable magnesium-based barrier membrane in a dental defect which
regenerated more bone than currently used materials. The current focus of the
research is defining the economics surrounding the use of barrier membranes in
dental bone grafting procedures and the key design criteria for developing such
devices.
