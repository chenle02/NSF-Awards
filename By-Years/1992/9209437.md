The mammalian suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus is the anatomical
substrate for a circadian biological clock that controls many overt rhythms in
physiology and behavior. The mechanism(s) responsible for the generation of
circadian rhythmicity by the suprachiasmatic nucleus is (are) unknown. It is
known, however, that the ability to generate action potentials is not necessary
for the workings of the circadian clock. Therefore, other forms of intercellular
communications must mediate circadian-rhythm generation. Dr. Nunez will examine
the possibility that the interaction between neurons and glial cells of the
suprachiasmatic nucleus is critical. Using electronmicroscopy, he will determine
whether plasticity in glial cell morphology over the circadian cycle impacts on
inter-neuronal communications and, thus, impose circadian rhythmicity on the
neural outputs of the suprachiasmatic nucleus. The concept of biological timing
rivals that of homeostasis as an organizing principle in contemporary biology.
Understanding the basic neural mechanisms may lead to treatments that could help
solve problems caused by jet lag, shift work and sleep disorders in the elderly.
Indeed, in so far as circadian rhythm studies will ultimately have an impact on
virtually all areas of human endeavor distributed across the seasons and phases
of the day, this work may have a direct effect on the nation's scientific and
engineering research, education and human resources bases.
