This project is allowing freshman chemistry students to use IBM and Macintosh
computers as an integral part of the laboratory program. The use of computers in
the laboratory program includes: direct data acquisition, analysis of data,
graphical presentation, report generation, simulation of chemical model, and
interactive video models for laboratory work. Six IBM PS/2 Model 50Z's are
interfaced to laboratory equipment such as temperature and pH probes and
spectrophotometers. The data collected by the instruments are stored in files
for further analysis. Six Macintosh SE's are used for data analysis, report
generation, and simulation, including interactive video development which takes
advantage of the unique graphics environment of the machine. The use of both
IBM's and MAC's insure that students are literate in the two major operating
systems available for scientific laboratory work. The institution is matching
the NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.
