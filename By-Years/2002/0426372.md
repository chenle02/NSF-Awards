Seafloor compliance will be measured at more than 50 sites on the axis and
flanks of the East Pacific Rise between 9 20 north and 10 20 north. The melt
distribution in the lower crust and uppermost mantle will be mapped. The primary
scientific problems to be addressed include: How and why do morphological melt
starved segments differ from robust segments ? Does melt pool at the crust-
mantle boundary before percolating through the lower crust ? How does lower
crustal melt decrease toward segment ends ?
