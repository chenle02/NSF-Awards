The principal investigator's research explores the connections between three of
the central concepts in algebra: groups, fields, and varieties. Groups are
symmetry types; for instance, all bilaterally symmetric animals share a symmetry
group, which is different from the symmetry group of a starfish. Fields are
systems of numbers which can be added, subtracted, multiplied, or divided; for
instance, the usual real numbers form a field, but the rational numbers, which
can be expressed as fractions, form a smaller field of particular interest to
number theorists. Varieties are systems of simultaneous equations in a number of
variables. The PI is trying to understand the deep connections between these
three concepts. For instance, simple groups, the building blocks for all finite
groups, can almost always be expressed essentially as the points of a variety
over a finite field. Varieties determine fields whose symmetry groups have been
of interest in mathematics for more than 200 years, when Gauss gave a compass
and straightedge construction for the regular 17-gon. This project also provides
research training opportunities for graduate students working with the PI on
these questions.

More specifically, this project involves using group theory to describe the
images of Galois representations arising either from varieties or from
automorphic forms. Problems of this kind can often be approached via by what
might be termed the "inverse problem" in invariant theory, recognizing an
algebraic group from data about its representation category. Group theory and
algebraic geometry can be applied together to analyze the Galois action on
Mordell-Weil groups of abelian varieties over Galois extensions. In a different
direction, the project involves using algebraic geometry, alone or in
combination with character-theoretic methods, to solve problems about finite
simple groups. In particular, these tools can be applied to investigate word
maps, defined by elements in free groups or related objects such as surface
groups.
