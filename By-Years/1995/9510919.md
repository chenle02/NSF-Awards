SBR-9510919 This proposal is to continue current experimental work designed to
discover what factors lead subjects to play more cooperatively and to punish
more aggressively than game theory and economic theory predict. The experiments
the P.I.s propose to conduct will test a conjecture from evolutionary psychology
that humans have evolved a predisposition to learn and use reciprocity in order
to help foster cooperation. In certain situations, people behave according to
learned rules of thumb that are not necessarily payoff-maximizing. The goal of
these experiments is to find the environmental factors that trigger this
behavior.
