9713327 Ettinger NSF has been charged by Congress to coordinate the Federal
EPSCoR effort, which is distributed across 7 Federal agencies. Argonne, a
federal laboratory sponsored by the Department of Energy, is proposing to
conduct a workshop and roundtable for faculty from EPSCoR states. The workshop
and roundtable would allow representatives from the EPSCoR states to interact
with Federal laboratory researchers for the purpose of developing long-term
research collaborations. The workshop and roundtable would also serve as a model
for similar endeavors which would be funded by other EPSCoR agencies. The EPSCoR
Interagency Coordinating Committee, agencies with EPSCoR-like programs, has
voiced its support of this activity to the NSF EPSCoR staff.
