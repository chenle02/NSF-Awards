9706677 Lesher Breakup of the supercontinent Pangaea in the North Atlantic
region during late Paleocene-early Eocene time was associated with widespread
volcanism and formation of the North Atlantic Large Igneous Province (NA-LIP).
The aim of this project is to establish a high resolution petrographic and
geochemical stratigraphy of subaerial portions of this volcanic province exposed
along the Blosseville Coast of central East Greenland. The new compositional
stratigraphy will span the period of continental rifting and the start of
seafloor spreading in the NA-LIP. The results of this study will provide
constraints for models of plume-initiated continental breakup and crustal
architecture of the continent to ocean transition, and will increase our
understanding of magma genesis, crustal evolution and the interplay between
volcanic and tectonic activity during the emplacement of LIPs. Methods to be
employed in this study include optical and electron microscopy, X-ray
fluorescence spectrometry, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, and
solid-source mass spectrometry.
