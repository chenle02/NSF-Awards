This project has two components. The first involves the structural and
functional properties of the 1:1 complex between cytochrome b5 and other redox
partner proteins and the second, the characterization by NMR of dynamic
properties of selected heme proteins. The research will continue to explore and
elucidate, using diverse NMR methods, a wide range of dynamic properties of heme
proteins which are likely the key to understanding both their biophysical
properties as well as their functions. Biological electron transport is
currently one of the most intensely studied of biological processes in which
heme proteins play a major role. Knowledge of the structures and dynamic motions
of these important molecules is essential in understanding the processes so
essential to life.
