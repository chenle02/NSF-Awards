This award provides partial funding for the purchase of components and the
assembling of a materials testing apparatus that will be operated and maintained
in the Department of Geology and Geophysics at the University of Minnesota. The
University of Minnesota is committed to providing the remaining funds required.
The materials testing system will operate at high-pressure and high-temperature
(up to 1700K and 7 kilobars of hydrostatic confining pressure). A variety of
physical properties are to be investigated under the conditions attainable with
this instrument. They include systematic studies of (1) plastic flow of
crystalline and partially molten mantle rocks, (2) migration of melt in
partially melted rocks and ceramics, (3) diffusion of water-derived species in
silicates, (4) development of preferred orientation during deformation in simple
shear, (5) the role of fluids in ductile deformation of crustal rocks, (6) the
effect of pressure on diffusion and electrical conductivity in transition- metal
oxides, (7) the effect of pressure on diffusion and on the kinetics of the
amorphous-to-crystalline phase transformation in silicon, and (8) synthesis of
zeolites.
