This 1 1/2 hour documentary film portrays the famous anthropologist's life
history, her work, and her audience against the background of 20th century
American history. The proposed work, a blend of never-before-seen archival
footage and stills, on-location footage, live interviews, and three newly
created impressionistic vignettes, is intended for general and scholarly
audiences. It is based completely upon original historical research.
