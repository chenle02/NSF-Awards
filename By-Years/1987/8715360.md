The objective of the research proposed here is to describe the annual cycle of
convective rainfall in the vicinity of tropical South America and to elucidate
the factors which are responsible for producing it. Description of the annual
cycle of convective patterns will be accomplished using outgoing infrared
radiation measured from polar orbiting satellites for the period from 1979-1985.
Accompanying changes in tropical circulation patterns will be derived from
objective analyses of wind and other parameters at 6 levels in the vertical.
Intraseasonal and interannual variations in the convection and atmospheric
circulation over tropical South America during this 7 year period will also be
investigated. A further objective of the proposed research is the development
and use of a relatively simple numerical model for studying the dynamical
response to convective heating sources of various shapes and locations relative
to the equator. This work is important because it will enhance our understanding
of the role of tropical continental convection in maintaining large scale
atmospheric circulation.
