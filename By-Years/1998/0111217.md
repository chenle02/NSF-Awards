This grant will support the coding of data in the archives of the Lemberg Center
for the Study of Violence. The Lemberg Center operated at Brandeis University
from 1966-1974 and was a key site of research on the race-related civil
disturbances of the 1960s. Since the center closed its doors and the prior
director, John Spiegel, passed away, the archives of the center was presumed by
many to have been discarded or lost. In early 1998, the main elements of the
archive were re-discovered and other components have been located since then.
The archive contains a wealth of previously unanalyzed data about the riots and
promises greater understanding of the riots from a historical perspective and of
collective violence and race relations more generally. In particular, the
archives contain newspaper-based documentation of civil disorder events and
interview tapes and transcripts.

The archival data could potentially inform and significantly modify prior
understandings of these particular riots and collective violence more generally.
In particular, the more extensive data will provide for more accurate modeling
of the economic and structural causal mechanisms that lead to rioting, a better
understanding of the spread of collective violence via social diffusion
processes, additional information about the methodological and substantive
implications of media selection processes and media description bias, and more
direct documentation of changing racial attitudes in response to the rioting. To
lay the foundation for that research, it will be necessary to translate the
newspaper event record into machine-readable format.
