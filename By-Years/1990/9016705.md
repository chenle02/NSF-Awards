This Grant for Exploratory Research is in the general area of inorganic
chemistry. Dr. Kenneth J. Balkus of the Chemistry Department of the University
of Texas at Dallas will explore the use of metal complexes as templates for the
synthesis of new zeolites. Zeolites are used as catalyst supports and their
shape selectivity, polarizability, and acid/base properties are important
factors in catalytic activity. The goals of the research are to establish which
metal complexes will serve as templates for crystalline zeolites, the types of
zeolites that can be prepared under certain conditions of temperature and
solvent, and the advantages of the zeolite encapsulated complexes as
hydrogenation catalysts. The ligands to be used are polyaza macrocycles, such as
tridentate bis(pyridylimino)isoindoline, and the metals include rhodium and
platinum.
