This project will collect and analyse dissolved freons in the North Atlantic
Ocean to use as tracers of the ocean circulation. A cruise along 20 degrees West
from Iceland to 28 degrees North will be made by oceanographers from the Woods
Hole Oceanographic Institution to describe the large scale circulation,
including the formation and motion of the North Atlantic Deep Water. This
project will provide an important tracer field for the interpretation of the
data.
