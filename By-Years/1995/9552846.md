Center of New Hampshire and the 15 participating school districts is planning to
write a proposal designed to "increase the scientific content and further the
development of science process skills for teachers of students in grades K-8 in
Central New Hampshire. The proposed planning grant will establish a leadership
team with representation from each of the participating school districts, plan a
five-year professional growth program based on teacher input from needs
assessment surveys and the expertise developed by the leadership team, establish
an assessment team and procedures for assessing the planning grant and the long-
term systemic project, plan a program that will provide strategies necessary to
conduct classroom-based research and reflective teaching research practices,
initiate an effort to establish a telecommunications network with participating
schools and Plymouth State College, establish an administrative and support
structure to sustain professional development over time, and prepare a full
proposal to submit to NSF for long-term funding of a professional development
program. The 15 participating administrative Units serve 1623 K-8 teachers and
22,351 K-8 students in 73 schools.
