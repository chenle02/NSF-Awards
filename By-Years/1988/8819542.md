The increasingly competitive nature of world markets and producers has placed a
considerable burden on semiconductor manufacturing companies within the United
States. There are many factors which have forced semiconductor manufacturing
companies to evaluate their strategies carefully. In the examination of how new
manufacturing technologies and processes will perform, the following questions
often arise: Is there sufficient capacity in the proposed system? What will
happen if the product mix changes? Will the new technology really reduce
manufacturing lead times? Will inventory levels go down, or will they actually
increase? What will resource utilization rates be over a range of market
forecasts? Will the rules we are considering for controlling inventories and
dispatching jobs really work? Models and a prototype decision support
environment will be developed that can be used in answering these and other
questions related to the design and operation of their material logistics
systems. Primary goals are to develop models and software to plan and schedule
production and to understand and control stochastic variability, and to use
previously developed computer graphics modeling and simulation software to
evaluate planning methods, scheduling rules, and dispatching rules for
manufacturing resources. Work shall be closely coordinated with IBM's East
Fishkill semiconductor fabrication plant to develop and test these models and
software.
