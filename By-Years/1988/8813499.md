This award will support collaborative research between Prof. Nancy Gordon of
American University and Dr. Garfield Sadler of the University of the West Indies
in Jamaica. The investigators intend to work on the synthesis of a class of bis
(bipyridine) ruthenium dimers bridged by novel chelating ligands and the
characterization of their spectroscopic and electrochemical properties. In
addition, they plan to examine the DNA binding and cleaving potential of the
various stereoisomers of these complexes. The project combines the expertise of
the two investigators, one in inorganic electrochemistry and mixed valence
dimers, and the other in transition metal complexes of anthraquinones and bio-
organic chemistry. The work has the potential to generate important findings iln
electron transfer and contribute significantly to a variety of areas in
inorganic chemistry. Furthermore, the biochemical aspects of the research may
lead to a better understanding of the process of DNA scission. By combining the
skills of the two investigators, this award advances the goal of the Science in
Developing Countries Program of increasing scientific understanding and
strengthening research in a developing country such as Jamaica.
