This project investigates basic research in computational geometry that is well-
motivated by applications in geometric computing. Specific focus is given to the
construction and maintenance of geometric structures, as well as methods for
efficiently searching in such structures, with principle motivating applications
coming from computational metrology, computational graph drawing, and geometric
information retrieval. Emphasis is placed upon the design of algorithms for
single processors as well as methods for exploiting coarse-grain parallelism
such as exists in systems with parallel disk arrays or clusters of workstations.
