Three groups of open questions concerning sorting, searching, and related
problems in computational geometry and database management are considered from
both a pragmatic and theoretical perspective. (1) The first group of questions
concerns the recently introduced fusion tree data structure. Fusion trees can
perform dynamic tree search-and-update operations in O( logN / log logN ) worst-
case time, and they support a worst- case time O(NxlogN/loglogN) for sorting.
These results circumvent the Information Theoretic Lower Bound by utilizing the
power of a digital computer for performing arithmetic and bitwise logical
operations in constant time. Numerous open questions arise about upper and lower
bounds for sorting, searching, balance tree operations, and hashing in this
mathematical model. The second goal is to examine algorithms in order to improve
the performance of relational calculus, LDL and SETL queries. Its goal is to
study both theoretical and pragmatic issues related to data base performance.
This study examines both the methods for decomposing a general query into
component parts, and the underlying search algorithms to process these
individual parts. The research also includes an examination of the implications
of statistical sampling to improve algorithmic performance. (3) The third
research area is in the domain of computational geometry. The implications of
this subject for relational databases are considered. Also investigated are the
implications that fusion trees have for geometric search algorithms. This study
of computational geometry includes a continuation of a prior investigation into
range query algorithms, and special attention is given to the problem of lower
bounding the number of addition-subtraction operations for an aggregate range
query.
