9451602 Browne Phase I of this proposal envisions the introduction of modern
technology into the General Biology and Microbiology laboratories in the form of
horizontal agarose gel electrophoresis. This technique will be used to: 1)
separate and compare DNA fragments resulting from digestion with different
endonucleases 2) bacterial transformation by uptake of exogenous DNA 3) protein
electrophoresis to illustrate molecular mass determination, separation, and
identification of proteins from different sources. Phase II of this proposal
will be to sponsor workshops for college and precollege teachers in the use and
implementation of this technology in the laboratory.
