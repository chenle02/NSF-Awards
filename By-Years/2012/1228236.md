The popularity of personal gadgets opens up many new services for ordinary
users. Many everyday usage scenarios involve two or more devices "working
together". (Emerging scenarios are beginning to involve sensors and personal
RFID tags.) Before working together, devices must be securely "paired" to enable
secure and private communication.

However, the human-imperceptible nature of wireless communication prompts the
very real threat of Man-in-the-Middle (MiTM) attacks. Another challenge arises
due to the lack of a global security infrastructure. Consequently, traditional
cryptographic means alone are unsuitable, since unfamiliar devices have no prior
security context and no common point of trust. Therefore, some human involvement
in secure device pairing is unavoidable. At the same time, most devices have
limited hardware and/or user interfaces, thus complicating human involvement.

This project?s goals are three-fold: (1) design a set of pairing methods
suitable for most common devices and a general user population, based on
comprehensive and comparative usability studies, (2) develop secure pairing
techniques for personal RFID tags, and (3) construct a set of user-friendly,
scalable and secure methods for sensor initialization.

Benefits of this project will include accumulation of valuable expertise in
designing truly usable security methods. Notably, the project expects to
experimentally assess the value of usable security with respect to the general
population. Furthermore, the need for, and the utility of, user-centric secure
control of personal RFID tags and sensors will be demonstrated. Since device
pairing is one of the very few areas where security directly involves and
affects the average user, the greatest impact of proposed research is expected
to be the broader participation in security practices and better appreciation of
security and its benefits. The project also emphasizes industry outreach and
technology transfer by working with manufacturers and industrial consortia.

In addition, students taking part in the project are expected to acquire
currently uncommon skills at the cusp of Human-Computer Interaction, Usability
and Cyber Trust.
