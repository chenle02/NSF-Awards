Abstract: The goal of the proposed research is to develop new tools for
understanding complex differential equations. Steinbart will explore how one can
infer fundamental qualitative properties of the solutions of certain linear and
nonlinear complex differential equations directly from the data (e.g., the
coefficients) of the equations. The properties on which she will focus are the
growth of the solutions, and the location and distribution of the zeros of the
solutions. Steinbart is interested in developing and refining analytical tools
which can be applied to both linear and nonlinear complex differential
equations. In the case of linear differential equations, she will address some
fundamental open questions regarding the location of the zeros of solutions for
a class of second order homogeneous equations that includes Airy's equation and
Titchmarsh's equation. She will also consider nonhomogeneous linear differential
equations, the global theory of which has not been thoroughly explored. Finally,
she will study specific nonlinear equations (e.g., the second order equations
which define Painleve transcendents) with the intent of uncovering relationships
between the structure of the equations and the qualitative behavior of their
solutions. Progress in this direction would allow her to take a novel approach
to certain problems of great current interest, such as a deeper understanding of
the relationship between the complex nonlinear Painleve equations and completely
integrable nonlinear partial differential equations.

In this project, Steinbart will apply her unique mathematical background to
study an important class of differential equations in the complex plane.
Differential equations are widely used to model physical, chemical, and
biological systems. In many cases, the model and/or the equations which describe
the model are so complicated that one cannot determine the solution of the
equation explicitly. Instead, one tries to approximate the solution or else
deduce important properties of the solution without actually solving the
equation. The goal of this research is to contribute to the theory of
differential equations by uncovering information regarding the behavior of the
solutions of the equations based on the data included in the differential
equations themselves. If mathematicians can obtain a deeper understanding of the
behavior of the solutions of the equations, then applied scientists who
routinely use them will be able to construct their models more effectively.
Steinbart will use techniques from complex analysis and from differential
equations in this project.
