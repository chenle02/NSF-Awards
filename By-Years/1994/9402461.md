9402461 Thaddeus Drs. Thaddeus and Gottlieb, at Harvard University, will
continue a program of laboratory millimeter-wave spectroscopy of reactive
molecules of astrophysical interest. The emphasis of the investigation will be
on detection of key reactive species believed by astrochemists to be involved in
molecular formation in space. Two complementary methods of reactive molecule
production -- gas discharge and H abstraction -- will be used. Several small
three-membered carbene rings are excellent candidates for detection, and
specific five-membered carbene rings will be sought.
