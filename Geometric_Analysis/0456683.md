Algebraic Geometry Summer Institute (Proposal DMS-0456683.)

A large scale summer institute in algebraic geometry, three weeks in duration,
will be held during July-August 2005 at the University of Washington, Seattle.
Organizational support will be provided by the American Mathematical Society and
the Clay Mathematics Institute. Each week will have a general topic as a focus
and at the same time will include a component of core "classical" algebraic
geometry. The foci will be: Mathematical Physics in Algebraic Geometry;
Combinatorics, Commutative Algebra and Classical Algebraic Geometry; and
Arithmetic Algebraic Geometry. Three plenary morning lecture series will be held
in each week, lecturers having been selected as leading researchers who are at
the same time exemplary expositors. In addition, leading specialists will be
invited to serve as seminar leaders, and will select high impact lectures given
by the best lecturers for afternoon seminars. Additional activities will include
the CMI distinguished lectures and an evening graduate program.

Algebraic geometry, the study of geometric shapes defined by polynomial
equations, is a vast generalization of the high-school topic "analytic
geometry". It has enjoyed much cross-fertilization in past decades with areas in
pure mathematics, applied mathematics, computing and theoretical physics. One
way American algebraic geometers have maintained the vibrancy of the field is by
holding a large scale, NSF-funded summer institute about every decade, an
institute which aims to bring participants up to the forefront of research in
the salient direction the field has taken in the previous years, and to project
directions which the field is expected to take in the following years. These
institutes have had a crucial formative role on the subject, with enormous
impact especially on the emerging careers of young researchers. This summer
institute project aims to follow in their footsteps.
