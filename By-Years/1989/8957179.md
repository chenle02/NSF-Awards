Molecular gas plasmas are currently widely used in the micreelectronics industry
for the deposition and etching of thin solid films. Plasma chemical reactor
design is largely empirical at this time because the many processes occurring
during deposition and etching are not well understood. These processes include:
creating an electric field which accelaerates electrons to very high energies,
reaction of these electrons with neutral molecules to create free radicals, and
reaction of the free radicals with the solid surfaces on which a new surface is
deposited or from which one or more solid layers is removed (etched). This
project is aimed at elucidating these mechanisms, the information to be
ultimately used in the design of plasma reactors. Dr. Graves has already
established an active research program in the area of plasma chemical reactors.
He plans to implement the following projects under this grant: (1) Laser
ablation of materials is used, for example, for high temperature superconducting
film deposition. He plans a combination of laser spectroscopy, optical emission
spectroscopy and mass spectrometry to detect ablated species and their
temperatures. (2) Computer simulation of plasma surface interactions will be
used to resolve effects that occur at surfaces exposed to low temperature
plasmas. (3) A study of particle formation in fluorocarbon and chlorocarbon
plasmas etching silicon and gallium arsenide. (4) Simulation of microwave-
sustained and magnetically enhanced plasmas used as a replacement for
conventional radio frequency, capacitively coupled plasma reactors. The work
will be used to elucidate how and why they show improved etch and deposition
characteristics. (5) Study of surface composition and structure in a plasma
chamber by using surface analytical tools. This grant is to provide research
support for Dr. David B. Graves under the National Science Foundation's Young
Investigator Awards Program.
