The Department of Physics at Indiana University of Pennsylvania (IUP) has
historically placed great emphasis upon undergraduate teaching and the education
of teachers. In addition to the standard curriculum for these students, many
faculty members have individually used research as a tool to broaden and enhance
the educational process. The Physics department is committed to providing a
strong applied research experience for students and has done so by involving
undergraduate and graduate students in research activities. In the Fall of 1991,
the department implemented the undergraduate Applied Physics program, and when
coupled with the masters program, students have many opportunities to
participate in science. To sustain this momentum, and ensure that research
remains an integral part of the undergraduate experience, the National Science
Foundation and IUP will provide funds to renovate a central laboratory and
support facility in Weyandt Hall. Constructed in 1965, this space is used to
house investigations involving experimental nuclear and solid state physics, and
is used for sample preparation in the study of electrical properties of
semiconductor materials and the effects of ion bombardment damage on such
materials. Renovations will encompass modifying rooms into four separate spaces
to create a non-classified clean room, a clean area, and mechanical room, and a
room for maintenance and storage. The clean areas will be used for the purpose
of sample and test device fabrications associated with semiconductor material
research. Seven of nine research faculty members and their students will benefit
from the renovations which will provide a state of the art clean room, and a
stimulating environment to work and learn. It is anticipated that this project
will aid in the recruitment of highly qualified students and help enhance the
overall diversity of the department.
