Birkeland, Karl W Arizona State University This project will investigate the
variability of snowpack properties as a function of terrain and will examine
also the relationship between snowpack data and snow stability throughout a
mountain range. The study site is the Bridger Mountains, Montana. Sampling teams
will collect data three times during the season. Data on snowpack stability,
strength, depth, and temperature will be compared with terrain features such as
aspect, elevation, slope angle, and location within the mountain range. In
addition weekly data will be collected at a study plot in order to assess the
evolution of the snowpack. A variety of multivariate statistical methods will be
used to test hypotheses. Snowpack variations are hypothesized to occur in
patterns that can be correlated to terrain. In addition it is hypothesized that
detailed data from a point can be used to approximate the condition of nearby
slopes. Results will show the association between snowpack and terrain at a
scale that has yet to be examined. The product will contribute to a more general
knowledge of avalanche events and their causes. In addition the results will
have practical utility for avalanche professionals.
