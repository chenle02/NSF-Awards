Smith This research addresses the general problem of coding images and video
signals at low bit rates using a multirate analysis/synthesis filter bank (or
subband coding) framework. Thus far, analysis/synthesis filter banks for subband
image/video coding have been static with respect to the input. This research
explores new classes of multirate filter banks that: 1. dynamically change with
the input signal to enable higher quality representations; and 2. simultaneously
preserve all of the aliasing cancellation and high quality reconstruction
properties achievable with conventional filter banks. New methods for
quantization and coding based on image modeling and vector quantization are also
being studied. These are intended to operate in synchrony with the adaptive
multirate filter banks. While this work focuses primarily on achieving high
quality compression at low bit rates, extensions of these concepts to higher
rates are also being considered.
