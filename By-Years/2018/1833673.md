This proposal seeks support for the participation of graduate students and
postdoctoral researchers in the 2018 Gordon Conference on Correlated Electron
Systems: Entanglement and Coherence in Quantum Materials, which will take place
June 24-June 29, 2018 at Mount Holyoke College, South Hadley, MA. Supported
participants shall also have the opportunity to attend the associated Gordon
Research Seminar, to take place June 23-June 24 in the same location. The Gordon
Research Conference (GRC) on Correlated Electron Systems is a long-running
series whose objective is to explore and understand the physics of strongly
correlated electron systems (SCES). This GRC meets biennially and covers the
most active research topics in this profoundly important subfield of Condensed
Matter Physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
