This funding supports implementation of modern computer interfaced equipment
into five undergraduate courses covering structural concrete and steel design,
mechanics of materials, vibration and advanced mechanics of materials. This
project specifically makes structural testing equipment and analysis software
available to undergraduate students for use in class assignments and semester
projects. This modern equipment helps to improve the student's understanding of
real behavior of the engineering materials as well as "hands-on" practical
experience. This award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal
investigator's institution.
