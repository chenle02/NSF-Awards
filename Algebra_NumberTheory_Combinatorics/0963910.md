Representation theory of Lie algebras, quantum groups and algebraic groups
represent a major area of mathematical research in the twenty-first century with
numerous applications in other areas of mathematics (such as: geometry, number
theory, combinatorics, finite and infinite groups, etc.) and mathematical
physics (such as: conformal field theory, statistical mechanics, integrable
systems, etc.). A conference on Algebraic and Combinatorial approaches to
Representation Theory is proposed to be held at Bangalore, India during August
12-16, 2010. This conference will precede the International Congress of
Mathematicians 2010 held at Hyderabad, India. It will provide a unique
opportunity for specialists in representation theory from Asia, Europe and
United States to interact, share ideas, and report on recent developments in
this important area of research.

This grant will provide support for airfare of about seventeen mathematicians
from US Universities and full support for about nine US graduate students to
participate in this conference at Bangalore. Local support (room and board) for
US mathematicians will be provided through a grant from International Center for
Theoretical Sciences (ICTS), India. The conference will provide an excellent
opportunity for mathematicians and graduate students from the United States to
interact with researchers around the world. In particular, it would provide an
opportunity to develop cooperation and collaboration with many well-established
research institutes in India. These interactions should help US universities to
attract strong international graduate students and ultimately strengthen the
pool of mathematicians in the United States.
