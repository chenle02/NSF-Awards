The combined effects of chemical reactions, turbulent mixing, and molecular
diffusion will be studied by developing and applying a numerical computation
scheme intended to be more realistic than present models, but still
computationally affordable. The model will be an extension of prior work by the
investigator which was restricted to only a few chemically reacting species.
Here, many more will be included to simulate realistic multi-component reacting
systems such as combustion. The model will enable the determination of the
relative importance of simultaneous and competing chemical reactions in complex
systems, and thereby point the way to the controlling parameters.
