COVID-19 outbreak is currently a pandemic disease and public health emergency in
many countries. Population-wide testing is critical for controlling the outbreak
and periodic retesting will be important to prevent future spikes in
transmission. The research team of Prof. Chilkoti at Duke University aims to
develop a rapid and sensitive test that detects coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) for
infection diagnosis and patient-derived antibodies for immunity assessment. The
benefit of this combined format is that if the test results are negative for
SARS-CoV-2 on symptomatic patients, serology results will indicate if a previous
infection existed. For asymptomatic patients, hidden active infections can also
be detected. The sensing method is designed to enable sample handling and
testing to be easily performed by personnel who have minimal medical training.
This project on developing a simple to use and widely deployable biosensor
provides research training opportunities to graduate students and helps to
prepare a skilled workforce for the biosensing and biomedical engineering
fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The multiplex point-of-care test is designed for
detecting the viral nucleocapsid protein (N) from nasal swabs and patient-
derived antibodies against the viral S1 spike protein (S1) from a few drops of
blood. It uses a single, standardized microfluidic chip that allows testing of
both swab buffers and whole blood. Upon addition of a patient's samples, the
assay automatically advances to completion without user intervention. It employs
a highly sensitive and inexpensive handheld detector, the D4Scope, that does not
require an external power source or laboratory infrastructure. The results can
be wirelessly transmitted to a remote server.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
