This project will develop a sustained collaboration between the mathematics
education research and professional teaching communities for the purpose of
interpreting and disseminating knowledge about effective mathematics instruction
in the elementary and middle school grades. A major goal of the project is to
develop and communicate usable knowledge to career teachers about how
mathematics in elementary and middle school is learned and how it may be taught
more effectively. A parallel goal is the development of a form of communication
between researches and teachers that will support thoughtful and continuing use
of research in improving instructional practice. Two types of products will
emerge from this project, specific written materials and a model for the
dissemination of research findings that should effect teaching. The written
materials will include: Synthesis chapters, written by teams of mathematics
educators and cognitive researchers, that will summarize current research
knowledge about mathematics topics relevant to grades 3-8; Research
translations, written by expert teachers, that will be used as resources for
teachers to learn elementary mathematics in a form tied directly to the school
curriculum and to problems and opportunities for teaching; Training materials,
developed by expert teachers, that will apply the research findings to actual
classroom practice, by providing material for reflection, discussion, and
teacher planning of instruction. The model developed by the project will
demonstrate a means of bringing research findings to practicing educators via a
professional development network supported by a major teachers' union. The
channels of communication opened and developed by this project can be
effectively used to bring instructional research to the classroom, while at the
same time bringing the knowledge and experience of teaching professions to the
attention of mathematics researchers and educators.
