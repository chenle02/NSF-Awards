Proposal DMS 0070607 Harmonic Analysis on Lie Groups and Spectral Symmetry PI:
G. Olafsson, LSU Abstract

Tis project deals with a variety of problems in modern analysis and science
relating the interplay between geometry, symmetries in the form of group
actions, and harmonic analysis on Lie groups and symmetric spaces. The program
is motivated in part by questions in mathematical physics and quantum field
theory involving generalized causality and reflection positivity. The proposal
combines different branches of mathematics. This includes complex analysis
through Hardy spaces, analytic continuation of representations, and the
generalized Bargmann-Segal transform; geometry in form of symmetric spaces,
duality and compactification; integral transforms and representations of Lie
groups. Several parts of the program are to be done collaboratively with
colleagues in the USA and Europe.
