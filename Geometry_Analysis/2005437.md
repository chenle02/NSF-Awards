This NSF award provides funding for a project to study certain questions in
dynamical systems in symplectic geometry. These dynamical systems are
mathematical models for physical processes such as the motion of the planets in
the solar system. One basic goal is to understand periodic orbits; these
correspond to repeating behavior such as a single planet revolving around a
star. In particular, for a given dynamical system, it is important to understand
how many periodic orbits exist, and whether or not a random configuration is
close to a periodic one. The principal investigator will also study related
questions about the existence of symplectic embeddings; these are mathematical
transformations that can be used to relate different dynamical systems to each
other.

In order to study these kinds of dynamical questions, mathematical tools will be
developed in the theory of embedded contact homology (ECH) of three-manifolds,
and other kinds of contact homology in higher dimensions. The foundations of ECH
will be extended to the case of Morse-Bott contact forms. ECH of unit cotangent
bundles will be studied and related to string topology. Spectral invariants in
periodic Floer homology (a variant of ECH) will be developed and used to study
whether or not generic area-preserving maps of surfaces have dense periodic
orbits. Cobordism maps on ECH will be used to study Lagrangian embeddings in
four-manifolds, and to investigate generalizations of the Arnold chord
conjecture on the existence of Reeb trajectories with ends on a given Legendrian
knot. Nonequivariant and equivariant contact homology will be studied in three
and higher dimensions. Symplectic capacities arising from these different kinds
of contact homologies will be compared. Combinatorial Reeb dynamics on polytopes
will be developed and used to perform computer experiments to test Viterbo's
conjecture and other related conjectures about Reeb dynamics.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
