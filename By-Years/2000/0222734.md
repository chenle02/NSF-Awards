In response to an Announcement of Opportunity for the Global Learning and
Observations to Benefit the Environment Program (GLOBE) this project is designed
to meet GLOBE goals and objectives of linking scientists and schoolchildren in a
global information network with the ultimate goal of better understanding
Earth's environment and changes that take place within it. This project will
design a new observation protocol for use at GLOBE schools in order to detect
annual changes in migration of the ruby throated hummingbird (Archilocus
colubris), the widest ranging hummingbird commonly observed in 38 Eastern U.S.
states and 7 Canadian provinces, and in their wintering grounds in Mexico and
Central America. Little is known about the drivers for migration, nesting and
re-nesting activity, primarily because a systematic set of observations across
the species range is absent, and because recapture of banded specimens is
exceedingly rare. Trends in current data cannot be attributed to actual changes
in the population because they simply may be due to an increased amount of
reporting. This observation-only program will gather data on first appearance,
flower species visited, sex and/or age, and duration of feeding at participating
schools. These observations will be taken in concert with other GLOBE
measurements of atmospheric condition and phenology, giving the potential for
correlating the humming bird's behavior with environmental factors such as time
of year, location, and weather.
