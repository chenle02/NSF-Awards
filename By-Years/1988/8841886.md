This award is part of the SUPER - Subarctic Pacific Ecosystem Research Program.
The Principal Investigator, Landry, has moved from the University of Washington
to the University of Hawaii. This is a change-of-institution action for the
Principal Investigator's award. The project focuses on understanding the food
web relationships and other upper ocean processes leading to the population
dynamics of phytoplankton and zooplankton in the Subarctic Pacific, for
comparison with the North Atlantic in which similar work had been done.
Initially, work in the Subarctic Pacific centered on the larger size fractions
of both phytoplankton and zooplankton and on the notion that phytoplankton
growth was continuously balanced by zooplankton feeding (the Major Grazer
Hypothesis). Unusual characteristics of the surface water mass allowed the
maintenance of higher zooplankton abundance in the euphotic zone, thus allowing
zooplankton to closely track any phytoplankton increases. The lag seen in the
North Atlantic System is not seen. The results of the initial SUPER Program,
indicate that zooplankton numbers/feeding capabilities are 10X too low to
account for the balance of populations, and that the copepods must have a direct
feeding connection to microzooplankton (heterotrophic flagellates and ciliates).
The Major Grazer Hypothesis is not an accurate paradigm of the ecosystem
dynamics; an alternative Limited Mixing/Micrograzer Hypothesis has been
forwarded and tests of this new hypothesis are now underway. This involves
comparisons of phytoplankton (all sizes) production rates with zooplankton (all
sizes) grazing rates, and a quantitative assessment of nitrogen dynamics as a
basis for estimates of phytoplankton production capabilities.
