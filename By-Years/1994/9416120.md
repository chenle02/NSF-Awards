9416120 Kanamori This research is to investigate the relationship between the
3-D crustal structure, the fault geometry and the dynamic characteristics of the
Northridge earthquake sequence. The 1994 Northridge earthquake occurred on a
south-dipping fault beneath the Transverse Ranges, in striking contrast to the
1971 San Fernando earthquake which occurred on a north-dipping fault. This will
investigate why the two faults are segmented like this (north vs. south), and
what prevented the rupture of the Northridge earthquake from extending further
to the west. Since the Transverse Ranges involve many active structures formed
under a regional north-south compressional stress system, a much larger
earthquake than the Northridge earthquake could occur if the system, a much
larger earthquake than the Northridge earthquake could occur if the rupture
extended over many segments of faults. The work will also involve investigation
of the variation of dynamic characteristics (waveform, stress drop, energy-
moment ratio) of the major aftershocks in relation to the 3-D structure. This
project is a contribution to the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program
and is supported by the Northridge Earthquake Emergency Appropriation. ***
