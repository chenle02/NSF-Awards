Number theory, with its long and rich history, has always been, and continues to
be, a vibrant area of research. There is a wealth of important results and
problems in number theory, and the study of these over the years have led to
major developments in several areas both within and outside of mathematics. A
fine example is the beautiful theorem that every positive integer is a sum of at
most four squares. Similarly, there are important results on the representation
of integers as sums of cubes, fourth powers, etc. This motivated the more
general study of quadratic and higher degree forms which has had deep impact in
many parts of algebra, number theory and combinatorics.

During the academic year 2008-09, two international conferences will be
conducted at the University of Florida: (i) Conference on higher degree forms in
Fall 2008, and (ii) Conference on quadratic forms, sums of squares, theta
functions, and integral lattices (and Student Workshop), in Spring 2009. The two
conferences would be the first to have focus on quadratic and higher degree
forms, areas that have seen dramatic progress in recent years. Most notably, in
the last few years, Manjul Bhargava (Princeton) has extended the celebrated
Gauss composition law for quadratic forms, to forms of higher degree. There was
no progress of this nature on higher degree forms since Gauss' pioneering work
on quadratic forms in the nineteenth century! Also, within the last two years,
Bhargava and Jonathan Hanke have solved a conjecture of John Conway concerning
the determination of all universal quadratic forms, namely quadratic forms like
the sum of four squares that would represent all positive integers; the origins
of the problem on universal quadratic forms can be traced to the writings of the
Indian genius Srinivasa Ramanujan, who astounded the mathematical world in the
early twentieth century with his remarkable discoveries. The conference on
quadratic forms and related topics will be preceded by a Student Workshop which
will prepare the students for the advanced topics presented at the conference.
The two conferences are the highlights of a year long comprehensive program on
Algebra, Number Theory and Combinatorics (ANTC) and tie in with the strength and
tradition at the University of Florida in ANTC and areas related to the work of
Ramanujan.

The conferences will provide an opportunity for students and young researchers
to interact with eminent mathematicians who are making major advances on areas
related to quadratic and higher degree forms. The entire program consisting of
an appropriate mix of hour lectures and shorter presentations, has been planned
for the benefit of students and young researchers, as well as researchers in
allied disciplines like physics and computer science. Thus the broader impact
achieved will be significant.
