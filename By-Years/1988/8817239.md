This award provides partial (50%) funding to acquire a high- temperature
deformation system with a servo-controlled actuator. The apparatus will be
installed and operated in the Department of Geology and Geophysics at the
University of Minnesota. The University is committed to providing the remaining
50% of the acquisition cost for this equipment. The equipment will be
incorporated in a new mineral and rock deformation laboratory at the University
of Minnesota. Fundamental materials science studies on ductile deformation and
deformation microstructures of rocks and minerals will be studied. Specific
subjects of research will include the plastic flow properties of dense oxides of
the mantle, including perovskites and garnets and the very low strain transient
creep in olivines and perovskite. Such experiments serve to provide laboratory
analogs to plastic flow of the Earth's mantle.
