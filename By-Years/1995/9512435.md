With partial support from the National Science Foundation, the University of
California, Berkeley will upgrade its Econometrics Laboratory Scientific
Workstation Facility (EML/SWF). Its UNIX network was established in 1991 and
designed to support research and instruction in computationally intensive
methods in economics, as well as applied research using these methods. Given the
number and complexity of the software it supports, the very large size of many
economics data bases and the number of users, the present system in inadequate
and prone to failure. Under this grant, three compute servers and one file
server will be upgraded. Disks will be added that free storage for a planned
network gopher server for econometric software and data. The EML/SWF is a
facility used by a worldwide network of econometricians who are engaged in
research on computer-intensive methods. In addition, the facility is used by 34
members of the Berkeley economics faculty who are conducting 22 organized
research projects, and by other economists at Berkeley who need specialized
software the facility supports. The EML/SWF provides a broad spectrum of
software for algorithm development and econometric applications, in a framework
designed for economic research, particularly in computer intensive methods. The
facility also supports instruction in the graduate program of the Department of
Economics. In addition to a sequence of four semester-long econometrics courses,
courses in macroeconomics, labor economics and public finance use the facility
to teach technique and to expose students to large economic data sets.
Approximately 265 graduate students use the EML/SWF for course work and
dissertation research. The upgrade therefore will have a significant positive
impact on both research and teaching.
