The emerging epidemic known as Sudden Oak Death (SOD) has grown rapidly in the
few years since it was discovered in coastal northern California. Due to current
climatic conditions, a large range expansion is predicted to begin this year.
Very little is known about mechanisms that might limit the spread of SOD or why
past fire history appears to constrain the disease. These investigators have
identified what may be the only landscape-level mechanism that appears to limit
the spread of the disease, fire. This project will undertake a time-sensitive
and exploratory set of preliminary experiments to gain further insight into the
relationship between fire and the disease. It will contribute to a basic
understanding of SOD spread dynamics in space and time at the landscape
scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SOD epidemic could result in catastrophic
losses, both economically and ecologically, given the large number of important
plant species that are susceptible to the disease. Any insights into a treatment
that could limit its spread are therefore of widespread importance. &lt;br/&gt;
