OCE-0220978&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A PI from the University of Alaska plans to
measure concentrations of Fe and Fe-binding ligands in the soluble (&lt;0.02 um)
and the colloidal phase (0.02-0.4 um) of surface waters from the BATS and HOT
regions to understand the chemical and physical speciation of Fe. Samples will
be separated into the soluble and colloidal phase using a new microfiltration
technique developed by the PI. Iron concentrations will be measured by an
isotope dilution-high resolution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry
microanalytical method. The thermodynamic stability constants and kinetic rate
constants of Fe-complexing natural ligands in the soluble and colloidal phases
will be determined by the competitive ligand equilibration/cathodic stripping
voltammetric method. The PI also plans to assess the spatial and temporal
variability of these parameters at these two sites. Results from this study will
provide useful constraints for models to determine the biological availability
of soluble and colloidal Fe, the fate of Fe from dust inputs to the surface
ocean and the Fe limitation on nitrogen fixation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
