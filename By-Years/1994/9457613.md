This project covers theoretical and implementation work on both deductive
databases and on a declarative object-oriented database language. In the area of
deductive databases, foundational work on the semantics and optimization of
rules with recursive aggregation and negation is being pursed. Efficient
techniques for incremental computation of aggregation functions are being
developed. Syntactically checkable stratification conditions that are more
general than past proposal are also being investigated. In the area of
declarative object-oriented databases, a language called Noodle has been
designed, and is being implemented as part of the SWORD/Oda database systems.
Once implemented, the system will be tested on realistic applications.
