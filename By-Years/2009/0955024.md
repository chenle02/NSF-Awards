Intellectual Merits: The main objective of the proposed career research is the
realization of nanoelectrochemical systems through a marriage of
microelectronics and electrochemistry for low-cost, high-throughput bench-top
nanofabrication. The PI proposes a highly unconventional yet powerful candidate
to realize such nanoelectrochemical devices ? that of top-down fabricated
silicon CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor) die as functional
substrate for controlled nanofabrication. This new paradigm extends the role of
CMOS technology beyond conventional areas of computation, signal processing and
communication towards directed nanoassembly and nanofabrication. The proposed
research will develop two approaches: (1) CMOS for Nanoassembly: Electric field
manipulation and assembly of already synthesized nanostructures and (2) CMOS for
Nanofabrication: Controlled electrochemical growth of different types of
nanowires directly on CMOS. Built-in integrated circuits will facilitate real-
time feedback control for assembly and growth, and can be reused as front-end
circuits for sensing. The research provides a direct path for heterogeneous
integration of multiple nanomaterials on same silicon chip. As a proof of
concept, the PI plans to implement a nanoelectrochemical sensor for bioanalysis,
primarily detection of neurotransmitters, and environmental sensing of trace
heavy metal ions in actual samples. Broader impacts: The research, if
successful, will have tremendous economic and societal impact through innovation
and product development in areas of chemical and biological sensing, high-speed
electronics, and devices for energy generation and storage. The PI will
implement four key initiatives as part of the integrated education and outreach
plan: (i) Project-based learning initiatives in undergraduate courses (ii)
Graduate level course on Bottom-up nanomanufacturing, (iii) Interdisciplinary
research experience for undergraduates, and (iv) Web based modules for public
audience. Plans for participation of minorities and under-represented groupa
include: (i) Summer and semester long research opportunities for women students
from Tufts University and Simmons College, an all-women undergraduate
institution (ii) Summer internship opportunities for under-represented groups
advertised through the Center for STEM Diversity at Tufts University and (iii)
K-12 and community outreach through student teacher mentorship programs and
seminars at local high-schools in the Medford and Malden areas.
