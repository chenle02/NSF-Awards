Atomic clocks are the most accurate devices ever made by mankind, and they have
many important technological applications. This project aims to significantly
improve the precision of atomic clocks and other quantum devices such as atom
interferometers. It will promote the progress of science by advancing the
understanding of quantum mechanics and its potential technological applications.
In this project, research and educational goals will be united by training
undergraduate and graduate students in atomic physics research methods. This
project will also help to increase the participation in physics; in particular,
three students from underrepresented backgrounds in science will complete their
Ph.D.s working on this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A major frontier of physics
is the control of non-classical states of many-body systems. Such control will
enable novel quantum devices, and improve atomic precision measurements beyond
the standard quantum limit through entanglement. The present project focusses on
using light to manipulate and entangle atomic systems consisting of thousands to
millions of atoms. The major goals are to create quantum degenerate Bose and
Fermi gases purely by optical cooling, to generate highly entangled states of
many atoms using light, and to demonstrate atom interferometers operating well
beyond the standard quantum limit, and close to the Heisenberg
limit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
