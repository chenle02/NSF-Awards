ABSTRACT This project is concerned with the study of visual gestural languages,
primary linguistic systems that are not derivative from spoken language. The
existence of such fully expressive systems arising outside the mainstream of
spoken languages affords a new vantage point for investigating biological
constraints on linguistic form. The research centers around the structured use
of space and movement in the grammatical processes of signed languages. The
investigator couples new linguistic analyses with powerful techniques for three
dimensional computergraphic analysis in a series of experiments on the
neurological control of language and movement. The experiments probe signers
with deficits at different levels of linguistic representation and motor
control, examining the neurological control of language and movement through the
quantitative analysis of the breakdown of both. The convergence of formal
linguistic, objective three- dimensional measurement, and neurological
approaches will provide unique information about the functional anatomy of
language itself.
