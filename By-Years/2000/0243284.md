University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will make contributions to the area
of component and object oriented languages and programming. The goal is to
design, implement, and evaluate class overriding - a new code adaptation
language mechanism that is intended to overcome the subclassing anomaly in
evolving software components. An in-depth analysis of the subclassing anomaly
will reveal and systematize its linguistic roots as found in compiled object-
oriented languages. Class overriding will be designed to serve as a generic,
language-independent method for anomaly-free component adaptation. Translation
patterns for class overriding will define an implementation model with low run-
time overhead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is expected to have impact on
the language design community and on the software architecture community. For
the language design community, class overriding will be a linguistic mechanism
that can be adapted to either new component-oriented languages, or to existing
object-oriented languages, in order to enhance software component adaptability.
The software architecture community will be able to employ the analysis of the
subclassing anomaly to foresee and avoid possible adaptation anomalies in
evolving object-oriented software components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
