The Center for Education and the Board on Science Education at the National
Research Council explore the components of fluency in information and
communications technology (ICT) that all high school students should know and be
able to do. The study builds upon an earlier NRC report published in 1999,
"Being Fluent with Information Technology," in which ICT competencies for
undergraduate students were presented. The exploration, guided by a planning
committee with expertise in a variety of related areas, takes place within a
workshop discussing commissioned papers and workshop presentations. The
commissioned papers consider the ICT competencies required in the workplace and
in day-to-day functioning of all people, now and in the foreseeable future. The
workshop considers how to update the earlier report and identifies the most
promising current efforts to develop ICT competencies in high schools. The
report not only considers current skill acquisition, but also the underlying ICT
competencies and intellectual capabilities that can be developed to manage
complexity, solve problems, and think critically, creatively and systematically.
The report provides a roadmap to connect academic content and information with
communications technology. By exploring what is known and what remains to be
known about ICT literacy for high school students, the workshop report informs
educational policy makers and faculty in high schools, community colleges and
undergraduate settings as they consider instructional priorities.
