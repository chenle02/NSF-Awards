Diamond films are contemplated for use in optical systems due to their inert
nature and hence their ability to protect the vital optical systems from the
harsh environments. Polycrystalline diamond films produce scattering centers due
to the different impurities, grain sizes and orientations that are produced by
the different deposition techniques. A novel polishing method is proposed for
providing smooth surfaces. This techniques has the capability to be adapted for
contoured surfaces and can also be used in combination with intelligent
manufacturing systems. Phase I effort will establish the feasibility; however
the follow on effort will coat large complex geometries that can be
characterized and field tested in several optical applications.
