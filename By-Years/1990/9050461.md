New equipment is improving the student learning experience in physiology-
oriented laboratory sections in a number of biology courses, by providing the
opportunity to experiment in areas of contemporary biology. Equipment that is
"user friendly" and provides rapid set-up and response time permits new
experiments to be performed in limited time constraints. A refrigerated
centrifuge and oxygen monitoring system provide for experiments on the
photosynthetic response of isolated chloroplasts and the respiratory response of
isolated mitochondria, ranging from basic analyses in introductory courses to
more advanced studies in plant physiology and biochemistry. The oxygen
monitoring system also allows for the exploration of the respiratory response of
aquatic invertebrates and microorganisms as a bioassay in a variety of
experiments in ecology and microbiology courses. The equipment is used in a
large variety of applications in different courses, and affects many students.
The equipment also allows students to do more experimentation in independent
research projects. The college will contribute an amount equal to the award.
