The mathematical concept of a group, a set together with an operation for
combining two elements to produce another element, plays a central role in
mathematics and its applications because it encodes intuitive notions of
symmetry in a precise manner. The classification of the collection of finite
groups known as finite simple groups is a monumental achievement of modern
mathematics that has led to a revolution in using group theory to study other
fields. The utility of group theory has been greatly expanded by advances in
computation. One goal of the project is to describe useful presentations of
finite simple groups that lead to more computational efficiency. This will lead
to solutions of fundamental problems in number theory. Another goal of the
project is to study a group-theoretical problem that will lead will lead to
results showing the existence and construction of expander graphs, which have
been of great importance in computer science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In more
detail, one goal of the project is to prove a generalization of the fact that if
H is a finitely generated Zariski dense subgroup of a semisimple algebraic
group, then H contains a strongly dense subgroup. This will give some new
results about superstrong approximation in number theory and results on expander
graphs. A second goal of the project is to prove the conjecture that every
finite simple group has a presentation with two generations and at most four
relations. This will lead to advances in computational number theory. A third
goal of the project is to classify generic stabilizers for simple algebraic
groups in irreducible linear representations. This will fit into the program of
Bhargava to solve classification problems of algebraic families. A fourth goal
of the project is to classify monodromy groups of coverings of low genus Riemann
surfaces.
