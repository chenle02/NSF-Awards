9407763 Kende Deepwater rice (Oryza sativa L.) is a subsistence crop in large
areas of Southeast Asia and West Africa which are flooded during the rainy
season. Survival of this rice depends on its capacity to elongate rapidly when
it becomes partially submerged and to keep part of its foliage above the rising
waters. In previous work, these investigators have reconstructed the chain of
events that leads from submergence to accelerated growth. They have shown that
the initial signal for elongation is the reduced partial pressure of oxygen in
the submerged internode and that three plant hormones -- ethylene, abscisic
acid, and gibberellin -- participate in regulating growth. Reduced oxygen
tensions promotes ethylene synthesis; ethylene causes a reduction in the level
of a growth inhibitor, abscisic acid; gibberellin is the immediate growth-
promoting hormone; the rate of growth may be determined by the balance of
endogenous abscisic acid and gibberellin. Internodal elongation is based on
increased production of new cells in the intercalary meristem and on enhanced
elongation of these newly formed cells. Experiments outlined in this proposal
aim at investigating further the mode of action of ethylene and gibberellin and
at studying biochemical and molecular reactions that underlie enhanced cell
elongation and increased cell division activity. This research may advance our
understanding of plant growth in general and may be important for the eventual
transfer of elongation capacity from low-yielding deepwater rice to high-
yielding rice cultivars. ***
