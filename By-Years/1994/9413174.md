9413174 Chereskin In this project, the PI will use a shipboard Acoustic Doppler
Current Profiler (ADCP) to measure vertical profiles of currents beneath the
ship as it collects hydrographic and tracer data along a zonal section at
latitude 8 degrees North, and on a second line between Indonesia and Australia.
These lines are designated as lines I-1 and I-10, respectively, and are
components of the U.S. contribution to the World Ocean Circulation Experiment
(WOCE) Indian Ocean Expedition (IOE). The focus of these observations will be on
general circulation and property fluxes in the Indian Ocean and through its
connections to the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.
