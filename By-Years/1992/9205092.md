theories of the evolution of sex can be divided into those concerned with the
origin of the sexual process and those concerned with its maintenance once it
has arisen. Here we propose an experimental test of both types of the theory.
Maintenance theories that assume a role for recombination in generating rare
useful genotypes will be tested by competing diploid yeast strains with each
other, strains that differ only in their ability to undergo recombination. The
experimental design will permit two classes of these models to be examined,
those that assume selection coefficients are constant (the Fisher-Muller models
of Felsenstein's classification (Felsenstein, 1988)) and those that assume they
are variable or cyclic (Felsenstein's Sturtevant-Mather models). Both processes
are likely to be important; we will attempt to determine which is more powerful
in our experimental system. Asexual strains will be competed directly with
isogenic sexual one, to determine the range of conditions under which strains
what are capable of recombining sexually prevail. The type of genetic
variability that accumulates under these conditions, and the rate at which it
accumulates, will also be measured. The origin of sex theory that will be tested
is the DNA repair hypothesis of Bernstein and Michod. We will test to see
whether the ability to recombine meiotically confers a competitive advantage
upon sexual strains to ionizing radiation, which induces double strands and
breaks. Double stranded breaks are essential to the DNA repair hypothesis, which
postulates that in early biotic environments, double stranded breaks imposed
sever selection pressures upon organisms. The only way to repair such breaks was
in certain lineages. We will also examine whether, and how quickly, increased
rates of recombination can be selected for in heavily mutagenized populations
that either do or do not exhibit an alternation of generations, and whether this
selection can affect both mitotic and meiotic recombination.
