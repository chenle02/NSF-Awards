Large scientific applications have complex communication needs, including intra-
machine point-to-point and global communications, cross-machine checkpointing,
and data outputs for online validation and remote data display. Coupled
scientific models for multidisciplinary investigations further add to this
complexity. This multi-purpose, rich, and dynamic nature of data communications
in future exascale codes presents the first challenge addressed by this
research.&lt;br/&gt;Further, given the many-core nature of future computer chips
and the likely presence of specialized hardware accelerator cores, application-
level communications and I/O face an increasingly complex set of on-chip, cross-
node, and cross-machine interconnects. The complex nature of the physical
communication infrastructures present in future exascale machines is the second
challenge addressed by this research. In summary, the problem facing developers
of future exascale applications for scientific discovery is how to effectively
manage the complexity of their communication needs while protecting their most
critical `core' communications from perturbation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project will develop higher level, explicit models for the data communications
performed in future exascale codes. These models, called C-Models, will describe
and implement the communications performed for I/O for purposes of online
analysis, storage, and visualization, and for data movements across coupled
application codes, and will also capture the interaction of the data movements
implied by all of the above with the internal data communications inherent to
each single application. This abstraction and encapsulation of communication
complexity is key to taming the complexity of future exascale applications. The
C-Model infrastructure will also help protect the critical core communication
component of these applications from perturbation, helping to maximize the
performance of these applications on leadership-class machines.&lt;br/&gt;
