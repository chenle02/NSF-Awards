This award provides support for the 28th meeting in the series of Southeastern-
Atlantic Regional Conferences on Differential Equations (SEARCDE), held 10-11
October 2008 at the University of Arkansas, Little Rock. The conference
encourages and financially supports participation by students and recent Ph.D.
recipients.

The meeting includes plenary lectures on topics of current research interest and
also especially encourages lectures by students and recent Ph.D. recipients. The
conference brings together workers in a variety of different areas of research
in differential equations, with emphasis on providing opportunities for new
researchers to present their work.
