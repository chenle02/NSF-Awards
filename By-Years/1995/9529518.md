University of Iowa Instrumentation for Virtual Environments Integrating Dynamics
and Real-Time Interactivity The equipment for high-speed computation and real-
time image generation is used for a coordinated set of research projects
attacking the computational requirements of interactive, real-time simulation
with rich physical and behavioral interactions. The research focuses on four
related areas: (1) Merging geometric analysis, dynamic analysis, and control
programming for interactive, real-time multibody simulation; (2) Numerical
methods for fast, accurate solution and integration of motion equations; (3)
Scenario authoring and behavior modeling for semiautonomous agents; and (4)
Distributed, real-time systems. building on existing facilities, the
instrumentation provides a combination of compute power, graphics power,
interaction hardware, and workstations to support real-time simulation and
virtual environments research.
