Behavior has often been argued to be the first level of response of animal
populations to new environments, changing before other traits. A great deal of
previous research has documented existing geographic and environmental variation
in behavior, but there have been relatively few opportunities to examine the
role of behavior changes during contemporary shifts of populations to new
environments. This project will take advantage of an unprecedented opportunity
to monitor changes in reproductive behavior during an experimental introduction
of Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata) from one ecological environment
where predation pressure is relatively high to another environment where
predation pressure is relatively low. There is a deep comparative literature
exploring the way that reproductive traits of guppies, such as male color
patterns, male mating tactics and female preferences for male traits, vary with
predation pressure across streams, setting up a predictive framework for this
work. The results of this project are expected to highlight the way that
behavioral changes, through both flexible modification and genetic evolution,
allow animals to adapt to new environmental conditions. The findings of this
research will have implications for biological invasions and conservation
biology as animal populations respond behaviorally to increasingly modified
environments caused by human disturbance and global change. This work will have
broader implications for the participation of minorities in science, not only
through the involvement of a Hispanic principle investigator, but more
importantly through graduate advising, undergraduate mentoring and education at
the K-12 level. This project will help to increase the participation of minority
students in the biological sciences at Colorado State University and will
include the development of a workshop program to bring guppy behavior and
experimental biology to K-12 classrooms in Colorado.
