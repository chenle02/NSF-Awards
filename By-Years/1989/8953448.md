This is a joint agreement between the Office of Studies and Program Assessment
and the Office of Research and the Office of Educational Research and
Improvement in the U.S. Department of Education. The purpose of the joint
agreement is to provide funds for the data analysis of college course taking in
the National Longitudinal Study of the high school class of '72 along with the
follow-up of their activities over a sixteen-year period. The work will be
conducted by Clifford Adelman and his assistant in the higher education branch
of the Office of Research in the Department of Education. A report will be
prepared on course-taking activities in the following areas -- life sciences,
chemistry, physics, and engineering. The data and analysis files resulting from
this work will be placed in the public domain as soon as possible following a
release of the final report. The final report will be a joint report issued by
the National Science Foundation and the Department of Education.
