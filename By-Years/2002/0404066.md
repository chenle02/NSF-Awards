The objective of this project is to develop a simple and generic method to
fabricate three-dimensional heterogeneous nanorod (10 - 100 nm in diameter)
structures by multilayer glancing angle deposition. This method is a low
temperature multilayer physical vapor deposition process, and can form
heterogeneous nanorods from a large variety of materials, including metals,
semiconductors, insulators, composites, and ceramics. In this project, two
different kinds of structures will be demonstrated: metal A/metal B and
superconductor/insulator nanorod structures. The growth mechanism of nanorod
formation, and how different growth conditions affect the size, shape, and the
uniformity of nanorods, will be investigated. The quality of the nanorod array
will also be controlled by two dimensional regular template arrays using either
colloid monolayer or electron beam lithographic methods. &lt;br/&gt;The proposed
method, if successful, will open a door for the researchers to access and design
different novel multilayered nanostructures by simply changing the evaporation
materials, and will catalyze rapid and innovative advances not only in
fabricating novel nanoelectronics devices, but also in designing novel
functionalized materials. Those novel devices could be used to make faster
computers, higher density storage medium, more reliable and higher sensitivity
chemical biological sensors, etc. The novel functionalized multilayer materials
can be used for targeted drug delivery and tumor therapy, energy conservation
coating, etc. These applications will help to restore a strong economy, improve
public healthcare, and fight terrorists with better weapons, which are current
concerns of every American. &lt;br/&gt;
