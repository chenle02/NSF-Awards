Abstract OPP-9614368 Kane, Douglas University of Alaska The project is to
provide partial support for the Eleventh International Symposium and Workshop of
the Northern Research Basins. Hydrologic researchers from the US, Canada,
Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, and Sweden. The workshop will be held
in Prudhoe Bay and Fairbanks, Alaska in August 1997. The participants will
examine the global scale climate dynamics responsible for the regional
interactions and variability of Arctic hydrologic systems. Spatial patterns
throughout the Arctic will be used to provide a comprehensive picture of the
water and energy budgets that are driven by global change factors.
