The aim of this project is to study mathematical problems associated with
controlling and analyzing the performance of stochastic networks. Since the
complexity and heterogeneity of these networks usually preclude exact analysis,
the focus here is on approximate models. Two levels of approximation are
considered: first order (functional law of large numbers) approximations called
fluid models, and second order (functional central limit theorem)
approximations, which are frequently diffusion models. The interplay between
these two levels is an important subtheme throughout. Three main topics are
addressed: (i) Dynamic scheduling for stochastic processing networks, (ii)
Analysis of processor sharing networks, (iii) Congestion control for modern
communication networks. The stochastic network models considered under these
topics are considerably more general than conventional multiclass queueing
networks operating under a head-of-the-line (HL) service discipline. Although
there is a fairly well developed theory of stability and heavy traffic diffusion
approximation for the latter, there are many challenging open problems
associated with the control and analysis of the more general stochastic network
models being studied here. Some of the stochastic process aspects are that topic
(i) involves the analysis and interpretation of the solution of an approximating
constrained diffusion control problem, topic (ii) uses measure-valued processes
to keep track of residual service times of all jobs in the network, and topic
(iii) involves reflected Levy processes when document sizes have heavy tails.
This grant funds research on mathematical problems motivated by applications in
the disciplines of operations research, computer science and electrical
engineering. Specifically, problems associated with the control and analysis of
stochastic networks are being studied. Such networks are used as models for
complex manufacturing, telecommunications and computer systems. Two fundamental
problems for such networks are (a) to understand the effects of common policies
on congestion and delay, and (b) to design 'good' controllers for these systems.
The networks under study are substantially more general than those that have
been rigorously studied to date. Through their complexity and heterogeneity,
these networks present challenging mathematical problems. The project involves
the development of new theory for stochastic processes and uses techniques from
a variety of mathematical disciplines. Collaborations with researchers familiar
with areas of application and the training of graduate student researchers are
integral parts of the project.
