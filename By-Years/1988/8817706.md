In this project, data from a profiling current meter will be added to 27
sections of upper-ocean Acoustic Doppler Current profiles collected during the
NORPAX shuttle between Hawaii and Tahiti during 1979-1980. Earlier restrictive
hypotheses will be relaxed to provide more realistic assessments of the
instability of the equatorial current system. The data will also allow extension
of the calculations from a 14 degree band to a 36 degree band about the equator.
