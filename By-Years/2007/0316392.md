The government of Argentina has actively promoted establishment of forest
plantations since 1999. The climate of the regions suitable for plantation
forestry in Patagonia (southwest Argentina) is similar to the Pacific Northwest
(PNW) of the United States; conifers from the PNW grow very well in Patagonia,
and several PNW species, most notably ponderosa pine, are widely used in these
plantations. These plantations offer many potential benefits to a country with a
brutally damaged economy; at the same time they have the potential to cause
profound environmental impacts. Research is urgently needed to maximize benefits
and to understand, and hopefully mitigate, potential problems. This project will
examine the potential impact of ponderosa pine plantations on water resources.
This is critical in Patagonia, where water is a crucially limiting resource.
Over a three-year period we will compare water utilization and water-use
efficiency (the ratio of growth to water use) in exotic plantations and native
vegetation by measuring sapflow (water movement through stems) and soil water
depletion. We will also use hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in water of soils and
plant stems to evaluate where water is extracted within the soil profile by
exotic plantations and native vegetation. The project will develop a cooperative
effort between scientists in Argentina and the U.S. in teaching and training
students in environmental science. Support for this project also comes from
CONICET, Argentina's equivalent of NSF.
