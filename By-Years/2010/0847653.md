(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding how humans comprehend
speech is an unsolved and challenging problem, in part because of the many-to-
many mapping between the acoustical properties of the speech signal (i.e.,
frequency, timing, and amplitude) and the words perceived by the listener. The
focus of this research is on the contributions of voice pitch, loudness, and
speech rate (collectively termed prosody) to understanding spoken words.
Previously, these prosodic aspects of the speech signal have been assumed to
play a minor role in spoken word recognition, word segmentation, and lexical
access. However, recent results suggest that speech prosody can have very
significant effects on how words are understood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
research holds potential for significant advancements in human health,
technology, and science. For example, perception or production of voice pitch,
loudness, and/or speech timing are often highly disrupted in many disorders
affecting speech and language, including dyslexia, autism, stuttering,
Parkinsons disease, aphasia, and dysarthria. The proposed research may lead to
new insights regarding mechanisms underlying these disorders, which will inform
the development of better treatments for those afflicted. In addition, the
research has potential to lead to improved speech technology applications, from
enhanced automatic speech recognition by computer, to more natural-sounding
computer-generated speech. The work provides research experiences for students
at the high school, undergraduate and graduate levels.
