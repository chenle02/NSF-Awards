9730430 Godbold The Consortium for Mathematics and Its Applications is
developing instructional materials for a fourth year high school mathematics
course that complements the materials for the first three years of the
Applications Reform in Secondary Education (ARISE) project and, thus, completes
the materials for a high school curriculum. The materials are field-tested and
are complemented by a teacher'' edition, a teacher's resource guide, a solutions
manual, and a CD-ROM containing relevant calculator and computer programs. The
entire series of instructional materials is being marketed under the title,
Mathematics: Modeling Our World. Additionally, a study is being conducted to
learn how students perform in college when they have had four years of a reform
curriculum.
