EXPRESSION OF SPINACH FRUCTOSE 1,6 BISPHOSPHATASES Starch and sucrose are the
principal stable products formed in the leaf tissue from the carbon fixed during
photosynthesis. Starch is synthesized and stored in the chloroplast during the
day, and degraded at night when the plant cell needs carbon fragments for
respiration and other metabolic processes. Sucrose is the major transport form
of reduced carbon and is exported from leaves to other parts of the plant. It is
synthesized in the cytosol from triose phosphate, which is the main form of
reduced carbon exported from the chloroplast during active photosynthesizing
periods. These processes require fructose 1,6 bisphosphatase; in both cases the
enzyme catalyses the hydrolysis of fructose 1,6 bisphosphate to fructose 6
phosphate and inorganic phosphate. These isozymes are localized in different
compartments of the plant cell, differ in molecular structure, kinetics and
regulation and are thought to be coded by nuclear genes. The aims of this
research project are: (1) to isolate and characterize cDNA clones encoding
cytoplasmic and chloroplast fructose 1,6 bisphosphatases from spinach; (2) to
study the differential light regulated expression characteristics of the genes;
(3) to utilize fructose 1,6, bisphosphatase recombinant DNA and antibody probes
to study the expression of fructose 1,6 bisphosphatase mRNAs and polypeptides
during the photosynthetic process. The results of these studies will provide
understanding of the different structural and expression characteristics of two
forms of an enzyme which plays a role in photosynthetic carbon fixation and
partitioning in higher plants, the determinants of plant productivity.
