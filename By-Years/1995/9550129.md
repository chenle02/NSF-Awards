9550129 Hug For more than 50 years, Ohio has had a program of environmental
education and the Ohio Department of Education has had a staff member assigned
to this program. In 1994, the State adopted a competency-based science education
program and in 1995 they will publish instructional objectives for social
studies that will allow for school curriculum development committees to design
interdisciplinary Global Chang Education curriculum. Selected science and social
studies objectives can be achieved simultaneously. Global change topics that can
be included in the curriculum include decline of songbird populations in Central
and North America, destruction of rainforests, pressure on natural resources of
population growth, destructive effects of acid rain, the consequences of
desertification or desertization, depletion of upper atmospheric ozone, among
others. By means of this planning grant, they will address the need for a
systematic, comprehensive implementation of these global issues as they relate
to and accomplish the instructional objectives of science in the elementary and
secondary curricula. The goals of the planning project are to 1) carry out an
awareness program to spread the information about this effort to elementary and
secondary school educators, 2) to compile a status report of Global Change
Education activities which currently exist in Ohio, 3) to develop a Global
Change Education Model that will become one of ten educational reform models
that are available to individual schools as the basis for their Venture Capital
program (this is a special instate program from which school can receive up to
$25,000 for five years to institutionalize reform programs), and 4) to file a
final report to NSF which will also serve as the guide to implementing the
Global Change Education Model. Cost sharing is 52% and comes from in-kind
contributions made by the Ohio Department of Education.
