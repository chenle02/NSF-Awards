DMS-0349019 Harm Derksen

This is a CAREER award investigating Invariant Theory, Algorithms, and
Applications. The PI will build up a research group working on algorithms in
algebra. He will work on algorithms for various difficult problems in algebra
and the connection between complexity theory and Invariant Theory. The PI will
work with Jessica Sidman on Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity and applications to
various conjectures. The PI will work with Jerzy Weyman on quiver
representations, invariant theory and applications. They also plan to write an
introductory book on quiver representations. A graduate student will work on the
connection between semi-invariants for quivers, combinatorics and exact
sequences of abelian p-groups. In addition, the PI will also work on the new
notion of "black box algebras". These algebras can be used to describe classical
invariant theory. There are many interesting applications, such as PI-theory,
and universal formulas for decompositions of tensor products of representations
of simple lie algebras. Courses will be developed in the area of algorithms in
algebra.

In Invariant Theory one studies algebraic quantities which remain unchanged
after certain transformations. For example, consider a 3-dimensional space.
Consider a point (x,y,z) under rotation around the z-axis. Two fundamental
invariants are the distance to the z-axis, and the z-coordinate. These
quantities remain unchanged after any rotation around the z-axis. Every
algebraic invariant can be expressed in terms of these two fundamental
invariants. A famous theorem of Hilbert from 1890 tells us that given a
collection of transformations (satisfying certain hypotheses) of a space of
arbitrary dimension, there exists a finite set of fundamental invariants such
that every invariant can be expressed in these fundamental invariants. This
proposal supports the study of applications of Invariant Theory to several areas
in mathematics. It also supports research on algorithms for various problems in
Invariant Theory.
