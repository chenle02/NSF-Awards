Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium (LUMCON) proposes to support technical
services on R/V Pelican, a 105? general purpose research vessel operated by the
consortium as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System
research fleet. They request support only for basic services; they will provide
one technician on each seagoing research project. In addition, the technical
services group will maintain, calibrate and provide for qualified users items
from their pool of shared-use research instrumentation. The budget in this
proposal is for the first year of a 3-year continuing grant.
