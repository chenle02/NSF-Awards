This project will identify, catalogue, photocopy, translate and archive
correspondence among Schroedinger, Einstein, Born, Pauli, von Neumann, Teller
and possibly others concerning the Einstein-Podolski-Rosen paradox. The Pi will
also seek missing correspondence between Schroedinger and others on this matter
and will publish the translated materials, with annotations that place the
problem in the context of contemporary science. Finally, the project will
compile, catalog, translate and annotate Schroedinger's manuscripts on this
topic.
