9528919 Krasucki This (i) Research at Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) and (ii)
cooperative US-India research project investigates distributed systems, using
reasoning about knowledge: * During the run of the distributed system, processes
acquire knowledge about the state of the system through messages. The goals in
this area are to (a) characterize changes in the state of knowledge of processes
due to communications and (b) relate knowledge structure of the system to the
temporal structure on event occurrences in the system; * The third research goal
of this project is to (c) attempt to modify a model, created by economists to
reason about rational agents communicating values of certain agreed- upon
function, so that it can be used to design and analyze protocols leading to
distributed consensus. ***
