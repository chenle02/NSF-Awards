9503895 A study of key aspects of the hydrodynamics and thermodynamics of the
large scale ocean circulation will be conducted in the theoretical framework
provided by the flux form of the potential vorticity (PV) equation and the
associated theorems of 'invertibility' and 'impermeability'. The geographical
distribution of PV and PV flux lines will be mapped, to the extent that models
and climatological data allow it, and the resulting patterns studied and
interpreted. Using a hierarchy of models and theory, the physics of, and the
global connections between, the 'entry' and 'exit' points of potential vorticity
will be exposed and their dependence on the interplay of mechanical and
thermodynamical forcing at the boundary of the ocean elucidated.
