Farquhar&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0348382&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI proposes to use
multiple sulfur isotopes to study the evolution of Earth's sulfur cycle. The
research includes investigation of mass-dependent sulfur isotope fractionations
in the Proterozoic geologic record, investigation of mass-independent sulfur
isotope fractionations of sulfide inclusions in diamond, and investigation of
mass-independent sulfur isotope fractionations in Archean and Proterozoic
carbonates. The first investigation will work to identify whether there is
multiple isotope evidence for proposed evolutionary events in the Proterozoic
that effected changes in the sulfur cycle. The second investigation will focus
on providing constraints on material transfer of sulfur between Earth's early
mantle and crust, and the third investigation will seek to understand the
nature, size, and evolution of Earths early oceanic sulfate reservoirs.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal also integrates research and education by
formalizing an ongoing program in which the PI works with graduate students and
postdoctoral researchers who mentor undergraduate students. It also contributes
to the development of a new pair of courses focused on Revolutions of the Earth
System that will be directed toward freshman and sophomore level undergraduates
in the University of Maryland general core and, in alternate years, for the
University of Maryland Honors program that will be an essential part of a new
interdisciplinary Earth System Science curriculum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
