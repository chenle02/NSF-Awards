The purpose of the Polar Research Board (PRB) is to provide independent
assistance to federal agencies and the nation on science issues of importance in
the Arctic, Antarctic, and cold regions broadly. The PRB is a forum for high
level discussion as well as an oversight body that designs studies, workshops,
and other activities that use volunteer experts to provide objective advice.
Activities include program reviews, assessment of priorities, and analyses of
controversial and nationally important topics. The PRB serves as US National
Committee to the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR),
International Arctic Science Committee (IASC), and International Polar Year
2007-2008 and thus facilitates US leadership in these international groups. For
2009-2010, PRB will continue to plan activities where objective, independent
discussion and analysis are needed. IPY 2007-2008 will remain a top focus,
especially the final activities needed to ensure synthesis and integration of
the results.
