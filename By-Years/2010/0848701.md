Professor Chuan-Jian Zhong of SUNY at Binghamton is supported by the Analytical
and Surface Chemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry to study the
interparticle structures and properties of magnetic core-shell nanoparticles and
assemblies. Methods for the synthesis of magnetic nanoparticle cores of
controlled sizes, and for the subsequent coating of the particles with Au and Ag
shells of controlled thickness will be developed. The particles will be used as
SERS nanoprobes for application in bio-recognition. Functional ligands will be
employed to assemble the particles into organized structures to investigate the
effects of particle core size, shell composition, core-shell structure, surface
ligands, and interparticle interactions on SERS activity. This research
addresses the need for core-shell magnetic particles with nanoscale size and
surface biocompatibility for applications in biomolecular separations, drug
targeting, medical diagnostics, and biosensing. This research will be integrated
with educational activities including training of graduate and undergraduate
students, and outreach efforts directed at high school students.
