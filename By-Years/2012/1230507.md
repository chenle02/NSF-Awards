Considerable research in the field has been focused on developing new
technologies to enhance privacy; encryption of personal data is often presented
as a potential solution. Many of the technologies resulting from this research
are not being effectively utilized because of issues rooted in human judgment
under risk and uncertainty. The majority of existing models and products related
to human judgement are based on a limited number of documented incidents and on
questionable assumptions about user intent and behavior. To better develop and
apply privacy technologies requires better methods of understanding and
measuring human perceptions of privacy.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;In this project we
are investigating the underlying neurobiological manifestations of privacy, and
seeing to understand -- and measure -- variations of uncertainty in online
privacy decisions. The outcomes of this proposed project will contribute to
answering fundamental questions about human behavior in online
environments?e.g., under what circumstances do systems in the mind cooperate or
compete in privacy decisions? When there is competition, how and where is it
adjudicated? Do higher-level deliberative processes rely similarly on multiple
mechanisms, or a single, unitary set of mechanisms? We anticipate these results
being used to further refine and develop useful privacy policies and
technologies.
