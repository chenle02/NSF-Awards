U.S. agricultural crop production faces the challenge of growing more food on
increasingly limited land area and under increasingly harsh environmental
conditions. Meeting this production challenge requires new innovations and the
identification of new areas to target for increasing plant resilience. One of
these overlooked target areas is optimization of aerial root function. Given
their central role in water uptake, nutrient use, and anchorage, aerial roots
are an important, yet poorly understood area for crop improvement. This proposal
focuses on maize (corn), the number one commodity crop in the US, and how
targeted changes in aerial root development can lead to functional outcomes.
Specifically, this research will identify which root developmental programs can
be altered to generate beneficial agronomic results. The outcomes of this basic
research will help develop sustainable crop systems, which will enhance
scientific knowledge and help secure our food supply. Undergraduate and graduate
students will gain interdisciplinary training through research opportunities in
the lab, attendance at national conferences, and engagement with the
agricultural community through participation in the annual University of
Delaware Ag Day event.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal aims to define the
fundamental link between root development and function using maize nodal roots
as a model system. There are only a few genes known to alter nodal root
development and they have not been placed in a larger genetic context that will
allow an understanding of root functional consequences. In this proposal,
squamosa promoter binding protein (SBP) transcription factors, known regulators
of the juvenile-to-adult phase transition, will be used to alter and regulate
nodal root development and the functional outcomes will be analyzed. This
proposal specifically tests the hypothesis that “SBP genes directly regulate
nodal root development to determine nodal root number and alter root function.”
Using brace roots as a model for nodal root development, the researchers will
test this hypothesis by quantifying the root phenotypic outcomes of modulating
sbp expression, defining the genetic mechanisms underlying SBP-regulation of
nodal root development, and determining the functional consequences of these
root phenotypic changes. The results from this proposal will provide a
foundational understanding of how modulating root development can elicit
targeted root functional outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
