Growth, molting and regeneration in crustaceans is controlled by steroid
hormones (ecdysteroids) from a pair of glands (Y-organs) in the body cavity. The
Y-organs in turn are regulated by a protein hormone (MIH) from the brain. This
system is comparable to human glands (testis, ovary, adrenal) that secrete
steroid hormones (testosterone, estrogen, cortisone) and are controlled by
protein hormones from pituitary and brain. We have found that crustaceans, like
humans, make steroid hormones from cholesterol. Accordingly, we use crustacean
glands as a simplified model to study how cholesterol enters cells and is
converted to hormones, and how the process is regulated by the external
proteins. We already know that all cholesterol in crustacean blood is bound to
high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and that there are receptors on the surface of
Y-organ that recognize and bind the HDL. Using radioactively labeled cholesterol
and HDL, the electron microscope and the ultracentrifuge, we now will find how
cholesterol enters the cells, how it is processed if still bound to HDL and
where in the cells the processing takes place. Part of the study is to determine
how MIH controls cholesterol entry; e.g., does MIH change the number of
receptors for HDL? We will also attempt to work out the details of the
biosynthesis of ecdysteroids, by using the mass spectrograph to identify the
individual steps in the conversion of cholesterol to the hormones. This project
embraces the fields of neurobiology, endocrinology and development in addressing
basic questions on neuroendocrine coordination of functions.
