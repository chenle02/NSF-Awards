9423688 Kareem The award is to support the travel of a United States team of
researchers and experts to attend the Ninth International Conference on Wind
Engineering which takes place every four years. The conference will be held in
New Delhi, India, on January 9-13, 1995. The United States attendees will
present papers and chair sessions. The exchange of information among the
participants and their exposure to the up-to-date scientific and engineering
knowledge about extreme wind hazards, especially in the area of mitigation, will
be of great benefit to the research community. The wind Engineering Research
Council, under the direction of the P.I., will have the responsibility of making
available travel funds to participants presenting papers and chairing sessions.
