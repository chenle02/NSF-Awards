Many minerals that are nominally anhydrous contain low concentrations of water
or hydroxide ion bound in distinct sites in their structure. These components
influence the physical and chemical properties of the host phase to an extent
far disproportionate to their actual concentrations and constitute a globally
significant reservoir of bound water in planet Earth. Research in this award
will be directed at characterizing the chemical form and concentrations of these
components in natural minerals and related synthetic materials, relating the
hydrous components to the physical and chemical properties of the host phases,
and investigating the significance of the hydrous components to the terrestrial
geologic system. An additional specific focus of the current research period
will be the analyses of sub-microscopic inclusions of liquid water that occur in
minerals and determining their role in the inventory of total hydrous components
in minerals and the conditions under which they form in natural systems. Broader
impacts of this project will be in the training of a female graduate student;
the development of new methodology for hydrogen isotope analysis that could be
used for other applications; support for undergraduates during the summer and in
the academic year; continuation of the maintenance of the mineral spectroscopy
