9633802 Moore These investigators from University of Michigan and Boise State
University in Idaho will undertake a research cruise in the eastern Pacific
Ocean to investigate detailed climatic and oceanographic conditions during the
Paleogene period, a time of exceptional worldwide warmth compared to modern
times. They will examine sediments deposited in a N-S transect across the
Paleogene equator to determine the source (North America vs Asia) of wind-borne
clay and silt, which will provide direct evidence of the location of the Inter-
Tropical Convergence Zone in the ancient atmosphere. They will also examine
fossils in the sediments to evaluate oceanographic conditions, and these data
will be used to constrain models of the "Eocene hot house" conditions of
worldwide warmth. In addition to these research topics, the seismic reflection
and sediment core data collected during this cruise will be used to guide
selection of specific sites for future deep ocean drilling to study this problem
in more detail on a proposed cruise of D/V JOIDES Resolution, a vessel which
conducts deep-ocean drilling for an international consortium of member nations
coordinated by the National Science Foundation through the NSF Ocean Drilling
Program. ***
