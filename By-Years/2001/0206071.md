Title: Multiple Carbon Sources for Isoprene
Production&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Investigators: Manuel T. Lerdau and Jennifer L.
Funk&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Isoprene (2-methyl 1,3-butadiene) is the most abundant
volatile organic compound emitted from many temperate and tropical forests. The
production of isoprene in plants has important implications for both plant
metabolism and the chemistry of the lower atmosphere. Predicting patterns of
isoprene emission from individual plants, forest canopies and larger regions
involves the integration of regulatory factors operating on both short- and
long-time scales. While the regulation of isoprene production on very short-time
scales is dominated by changes in light and temperature, our knowledge of the
mechanisms by which physiological and environmental factors regulate isoprene
emission over larger temporal and spatial scales is limited.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is believed that the carbon used in isoprene production
is derived primarily from recently assimilated precursors via photosynthesis.
However, it has been proposed that stored carbon (carbohydrate) can contribute
to isoprene production when low photosynthetic rates limit the supply of
recently assimilated precursors. This research will examine the importance of
stored carbon in isoprene production. This will be accomplished by (1) exploring
the role of stored carbon in isoprene production and its importance under
specific environmental conditions and (2) evaluating existing leaf-level models
based on these findings. Understanding the role of stored carbon in isoprene
production will help to elucidate the fundamental environmental physiology of
isoprene production and improve efforts to model emission to the
atmosphere.&lt;br/&gt;
