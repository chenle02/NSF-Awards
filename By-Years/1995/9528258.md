This research explores the relationships between models used to refine the
system design, to assess the real-time behavior of the system, and to assess the
fault tolerance. these relationships are being combined to develop tools for
system- level modeling with dependability analysis of the design. The approach
builds on two recently developed tools, ADEPT (Advanced Design Environment
Prototype Tool) and DREDD (Dependability and Risk Evaluation using Decision
Diagrams). Advanced techniques for dependability analysis of embedded computer
systems are being put into the ADEPT design environment. There, a dynamic fault
tree model is automatically generated from the ADEPT system design model. The
fault tree models uses a combination of Markov techniques, combinatorial
approaches and binary decision diagrams. It can model permanent and transient
hardware faults, unrelated and related software, automatic recovery and
reconfiguration management, sequence dependencies and other dynamic behavior.
