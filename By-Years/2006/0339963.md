This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
develop a new class of advanced polymeric dielectrics based on polyphenylene
Self-Reinforced Polymers (SRPs). Polymers with superior electrical, thermal and
mechanical performance are critical for a variety of advanced electronics
packaging and on-the-chip applications. A number of polymers have been proposed
as an answer to this problem. All current organic dielectrics, however, have a
fatal flaw: they all feature polar moieties that promote high dielectric
constants and high moisture uptake. To overcome this problem this project will
develop a new type of processable, high temperature, very low dielectric, very
low moisture absorbing and low cost dielectrics containing no polar groups for
usage in a wide variety of electronic packaging and interlayer dielectric
applications.

The commercial application of this project is in the broad area of electronic
and on-the-chip type products. The absence of low dielectric constant polymers
is limiting the development of the next generation of electronic devices. As
architectures continue to decrease in size, demands for insulative properties
cannot be met by existing materials and consequently emergence of the proposed
material will have a significant impact on the industry.
