Bucks County Community College (Bucks) is creating a high-throughput science
research network to support Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM)
faculty and students. This cyber infrastructure (CI) upgrade will coincide with
their construction of a new STEM building and future renovation of the current
STEM facilities at Newtown (main) campus. This initiative upgrades Bucks CI to
support research with a science DMZ to prioritize data transfers among systems
located at Bucks, offers an outdoor high performance Wi-Fi network as a science
DMZ extension, and provides Internet2 to support faculty and student research
through the statewide education network. The dedicated, advanced network allows
for the speeds, packet integrity, and lack of interference from competing
applications for research-based data transfer, enabling the faculty and their
students to conduct their activities. Bucks' lead institution partner, the
University of Pennsylvania, is aiding with design and technical services to
ensure the science DMZ meets current and future needs and is sustainable by
Bucks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This next-generation infrastructure establishes a
dedicated network and provides data transfer services to support broader
scientific research and applications. This benefits projects investigating
improved forms of image recognition, applied engineering, and other
computational sciences. With the bounty of research at the University of
Pennsylvania, faculty and students at Bucks have access to scientific domains at
a level not previously available, extending our intellectual opportunities.
Additionally, with advanced manufacturing, nursing and other science-related
activity in the county and surrounding area, the science DMZ indirectly benefits
the people, educational institutions, and businesses of the region.
