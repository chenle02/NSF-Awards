The research objective is to investigate methods to recover geometry and perform
spatial reasoning in rooms. This project aims to recover the room space,
illumination, and object layout from an image. Together, these elements capture
the layout of the room walls, the location of objects in the image and the 3D
space, and a lighting representation that allows illumination artifacts to be
explained and rooms to be relit with inserted objects. The work takes an
integrated approach, exploiting constraints within and between spatial
representations. The project also aims to leverage knowledge of room geometry to
better reason about surface utility, enabling advanced spatial analysis of
indoor scenes.

This research unifies ideas from geometry, multiple view computer vision,
shading, and statistics to recover complex spatial representations from single
views. The work further aims to create tools for object insertion and removal
and scene completion, allowing the average person to more easily create the
photograph that she wants or an interior designer to quickly sketch a
photorealistic prototype of a new concept. The recovered spatial information
also enables mobile robots to find walkable paths through cluttered rooms and to
understand how objects can be physically manipulated and placed, which is
essential for assistive household robotics. Other anticipated applications
include surveillance, security, and transportation safety. The project
contributes to education through student projects, course development, and
workshops and tutorials involving a broader audience.
