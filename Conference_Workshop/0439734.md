Abstract

Award: DMS-0439734 Principal Investigator: Douglas N. Arnold, Fadil Santosa,
Arnd Scheel

The mission of the Institute for Mathematics and its Applications (IMA) is to
increase the impact of the mathematical sciences by fostering interdisciplinary
research linking mathematics of the highest caliber to important scientific and
technological problems from other disciplines, technology, industry, and
society. Allied with this mission, the IMA also works to expand and strengthen
the talent base engaged in mathematical research relevant to such problems. To
this end, the Institute serves as an information hub in the mathematical
sciences, hosts postdoctoral researchers at the start of their careers, conducts
and sponsors graduate student workshops, offers opportunities for mid-career
mathematical scientists to change research directions, organizes programs aimed
at students and researchers from groups traditionally underrepresented in the
mathematical sciences, and sponsors public outreach activities.

The IMA is a national research institute that hosts scientific programs on short
(one week or less) and long (academic year) time scales, without permanent
faculty or research staff. Most of the Institute's programs are conducted in its
Minneapolis facilities, but the IMA also sponsors conferences and graduate
summer workshops at its academic participating institutions. Those academic
institutions and IMA's participating corporations contribute to the Institute's
programming and planning through dedicated governance committees. The IMA web
site at http://www.ima.umn.edu/ describes upcoming and past programs, solicits
ideas for future programs, and offers application forms for Institute
activities.
