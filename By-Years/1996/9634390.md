This project will investigate the lives of women and children in two Yupik
Eskimo communities on Saint Lawrence Island, Alaska, and in Chukotka, Russia.
The people of both communities, Gambell and Sireniki, are close kin and still
strongly identify themselves as Yupik, but they have experienced very different
histories of contact with Western policies and cultures. The researchers will
work with elders, with family groups, and with Yupik women in community work
forces. Life histories will be recorded as well as documentation of childbearing
tasks, interactions of families and in education settings. Analysis of words
related to emotions and values will also be carried out. The special features of
the research are the circumpolar comparisons, the combinations of multifaceted
methodologies, the attention paid to women, children and family life and a focus
on cultural psychology, the nature of personhood, and the socialization of
emotions and values.
