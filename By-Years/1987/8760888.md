The object of this research is to develop permanent magnet motors having
significantly higher torque capability than the state- of-the-art through the
use of air-gap winding armatures and advanced cooling techniques. According to
preliminary studies, the air-gap winding motor has a performance factor more
than twice as high as conventional permanent magnet motors, two to three times
as much torque capacity as equivalently cooled conventional motors, and shorter
mechanical and electrical time constants. These high torque and rapid response
capabilities would enable such motors to compete with electrohydraulic actuators
as lower cost, faster response, direct actuators for robotic and control
applications. These characteristics, as well as high thermal capacity, suggest
their application as machine-tool servo motors. The object of the Phase I
research is to further develop the electromagnetic, thermal, and mechanical
models of the air-gap winding motor, and to prepare a detail design for a
prototype air-gap winding motor.
