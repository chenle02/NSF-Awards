9515306 Townsend This project employs theory, field work and econometrics to
examine how credit and insurance systems work both in theory and in actual
economies. The economies include poor high risk villages in India's semi-arid
tropics, using the standard data set gathered by the International Crops
Research of the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) and one designed by the
investigator. The same approach will be used to study the entire national
economy of Thailand, a growing economy with wide disparities in levels and
growth rates of income, using the household-level data of the Thai Socio-
Economic Survey (SES) gathered by the National Statistical Office (NSO) of
Thailand, using multiple years of village-level surveys conducted by the
Community Development Department (CDD), and using data to be gathered in field
research and in a larger more standard survey. The work is extended to begin to
consider the economy of the United States, analyzing business and household data
gathered in the Hispanic community of Little Village in Chicago. The
significance of the research is two-fold. First, because the project employs
theory, field research and econometrics, it has the potential of making a
contribution to each of these areas. Second, theory and data will be used to try
to understand formal, informal, market and programmed credit-insurance systems
in order to see whether or not there might be some scope for improvement.
