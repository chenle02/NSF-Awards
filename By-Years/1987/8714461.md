A NASA Spacelab flight instrument is available for ground based observations
for a period of a year owing to the delays in flight schedules caused by the
Challenger accident. It is proposed to operate this highly sophisticated set of
spectrographs with intensified CCD detectors at McDonald Observatory until June
1988, to obtain spectra of upper atmosphere emissions in twilight. The spectra
would be used in the inversion of a thermospheric photochemistry model in an
attempt to deduce changes in the composition and temperature of the thermosphere
on a day to day basis, in conformity with a CEDAR project. The thermospheric
composition and temperature change in response to auroral zone energy inputs
which propagate over the globe, and to changing solar ultraviolet fluxes on a
seasonal and solar cycle basis. Currently the composition changes can only be
determined by in-situ spacecraft observations. The PI has both the observational
and the theoretical background to make full use of the data once obtained, and
to provide input to the aeronomy community. They will then be able to design the
optimum observing program and instrumental configuration for CEDAR to determine
atmospheric composition changes in coordinated multistation campaigns.
