The investigator will work on some questions in the theory of commutative rings
that arise from tight closure theory, the theory of intersection multiplicities,
a study of local cohomology modules, and from the homological conjectures for
local rings. In tight closure theory, there is a substantial focus on
understanding the class of F-regular rings and on developing theorems for this
class of rings. The study of local cohomology modules addresses finiteness
issues of these modules over regular rings of mixed characteristic, and another
question that is related to the theory of solid closure. Research on Hilbert-
Kunz multiplicities and on the rigidity of the Tor functor will be carried out
in continued collaboration with Claudia Miller.

Commutative algebra is a field closely related to algebraic geometry: while
algebraic geometry focuses on the geometry of solutions sets of polynomial
equations, in commutative algebra the main objects of study are certain
functions on these solution sets. The connections between algebra and geometry
are largely due to the revolutionary work of Grothendieck, Serre and Zariski. An
active area of research in commutative algebra today is the theory of tight
closure developed by Hochster and Huneke. This theory provides stronger
formulations of existing theorems, and brings together many seemingly unrelated
problems. It also has strong connections with the study of singularities of
geometric objects. The theory of local cohomology was developed by Grothendieck
who used it to obtain several striking results. Local cohomology has
applications to basic, and yet deep, questions such as determining the minimal
number of polynomial equations needed to define an algebraic set. It continues
to develop a fascinating interaction with several other branches of mathematics.
