Monge.Kantorovich problems (MKPs) deal with "optimal" correspondences between
two or more masses of equal volume given on an abstract space, where the
optimality depends upon the context of the problem. MKPs have a long and
colorful history in different areas of mathematical sciences since their
original formulation by G. Monge (1781) and L.V. Kantorovich (1940). Despite the
existence of separate results for particular MKPs no serious attempt has been
made to explore the interplay among the various approaches. The objective of
this project is to make a systematic study of the relationships between the
methods and results in the "continuous case" of MKPs . marginal and moment
problems in probability . and those in the "discrete case" . optimization over
transportation polytopes and axiomatic approaches to measurement problems. It is
the belief of the principal investigators that the algorithms and axiomatic
approaches of the discrete case hold great promise in obtaining explicit
solutions for continuous MKPs. Symmetrically, the methods of probability .limit
theorems, normal and stable models . will lead to the identification of new
mathematical programming and game theoretic structures, algorithms and models in
the discrete case.
