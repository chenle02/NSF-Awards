9452283 Jiracek Geophysical equipment is being used for field programs at two
universities and a multi-institutional field camp. The equipment includes a dc
resistivity unit, a transient electromagnetic (TEM) system, a ground penetrating
radar (GPR) unit, and a portable magnetometer/gradiometer, all being used in
courses in Applied Hydrogeophysics at San Diego State University (SDSU) and
Field Geophysics at the University of California at San Diego (UCSD). The use of
this equipment in these courses reflects the changing role of geophysics, which
emphasizes environmental/hydrologic applications where electromagnetic methods
are preeminent. Students are becoming familiar with the newest techniques used
in environmental geophysics. In addition, the use of the equipment in the Summer
of Applied Geophysical Experience Program (SAGE) is allowing undergraduate
students from small schools with limited geophysics offerings to learn hands-on
use of modem equipment in a true research environment.
