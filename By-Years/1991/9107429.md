The goal of this proposal is to address a central but poorly understood topic
in the evolution of life-history patterns in organisms: whether trade-offs of
one ability relative to another result from trade-offs of nutritional resources
at the physiological level. Specifically, the trade-off between flight
capability and reproductive output of the crickets Gryllus rubens, will be
considered. Individuals of this species occur as one of two genetically
determined forms. One form exhibits elevated egg production but cannot fly while
the other is less fecund but is capable of flight. The nutritional intake of the
two forms and the internal partitioning of nutrients among flight, reproductive
and other non-flight and non-reproductive tissues in these crickets will be
measured. This study will break new ground in its effort to investigate whether
there is a trade-off of resources between the anatomical structures and
physiological processes underlying a genetically determined trade-off seen at
the level of whole organism life-history. In addition, by obtaining data on the
physiological bases of dispersal and reproduction, this study will provide
important background information for applied studies that attempt to control
insect populations.
