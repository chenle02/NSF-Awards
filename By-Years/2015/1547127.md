It is widely believed that the arrival of 3D printers in the 21st century will
pave the way for the Maker revolution. This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory
Research (EAGER) project is aimed at investigating fundamental theoretical and
practical issues in the cloud-based utilization of an ensemble of heterogeneous
networked 3D printers. The development of cloud-based scheduling algorithms is
expected to be important for several cyber-manufacturing systems. Additionally,
the theoretical and practical insights developed for the decentralized 3D
printing-as-a-service paradigm may have a significant impact on the
manufacturing ecosystem at large. Several students are expected to directly and
indirectly benefit from the research and enhanced
curriculum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This two-year research effort will focus on
developing a fundamental understanding of optimal job assignment in networked 3D
printers. Specific objectives of the work include data collection and analysis
of heterogeneous 3D print jobs on an existing test bed at University of
Maryland, design of optimal routing, batching, and scheduling algorithms to
minimize job completion times by efficient decentralized resource utilization,
and deployment of the algorithms on a virtual simulator and existing 3D printing
infrastructure at University of Maryland.
