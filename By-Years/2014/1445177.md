An estimated 1.6 million people in the U.S. developed some form of cancer last
year and this number is predicted to increase in coming years. Standard
treatment approaches for some forms of cancer (such as breast or prostrate)
provide high chances of survival, whereas for other types of cancer such as
pancreas or brain cancer, survivals rates are significantly lower. One
significant issue with the current approaches is that a cancer patient is
treated based on their cohort and not based on their personalized genetic
makeup. This often leads to ineffective treatments and poor outcomes for
patients at all levels of risk. The proposed technology is an optimized
algorithm and software to discover potential multi-target protein combinations
that can produce highly effective combination drug treatments. The proposed
approach is novel in integrating drug screen and genomic characterization data
for predicting effective drug combinations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed
process can produce truly personalized therapeutic options with a small set of
input data. Specifically, the team is looking at multi-target protein
combinations that can produce highly effective combination drug treatments, with
a current focus on protein kinases. Protein kinases been shown to be effective
in multiple types of cancer, and have led to a treatment for CML, a type of
leukemia. The framework allows the team to refine and focus predictions as more
data becomes available through parallel tests that can be performed, such as
exome sequencing, RNA sequencing and siRNA knockdown experiments. Most existing
personalized approaches are primarily focused on applying drugs to target
specific mutations based on what happens in other similar models. This team's
approach intends to improve on this by specifically looking for multi-target
combinations and multi-drug therapeutics to overcome many of the obstacles faced
in the expansion of targeted therapies to new cancer types.
