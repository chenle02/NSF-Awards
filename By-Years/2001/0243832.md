PI: Kozliak: Institution: University of North Dakota&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
Chemistry Division award supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates
(REU) site at the University of North Dakota (UND) for the summers of
2003-2005.&lt;br/&gt;Evguenii Kozliak is the site's program director and Michael
Mann from the Department of Chemical Engineering is the Co-Director. Scientists
and engineers of the Center for Gas and Gas-Solid Interactions Impacting the
Environment (CIGSIIE), Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Space Studies will
serve as REU mentors to eight students, who will each participate in a ten-week
program. Students will be recruited from colleges in the Upper Midwest, with
particular attention to Native Americans and first generation students resident
in the rural communities of the upper Midwest and Western states. Fifteen
research projects are described in the area of gas-phase chemistry and related
environmental chemistry. Students will conclude the program with a poster
presentation at a statewide meeting. The Office of Instructional Development at
UND will evaluate the REU site.&lt;br/&gt;
