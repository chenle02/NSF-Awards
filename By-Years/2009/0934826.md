The project is disseminating educational innovations that have the potential to
transform engineering education in a dedicated track at the National Collegiate
Inventors and Innovators Alliance (NCIIA) annual conference. The track is
comprised of a series of workshops presented by faculty who have received NSF
funding for educational innovations in engineering. The NCIIA is broadly
soliciting and selecting workshop proposals to identify the most innovative
educational practices. These efforts are reaching the NCIIA community of
educators, which is known for leading curricular change and program development.
The workshops target "early adopters" in the engineering education community who
are most likely to implement emerging methods and tools for instruction and
assessment. To engage a diverse constituency in this work, the NCIIA recruits
workshop presenters and participants through focused outreach to
underrepresented groups in engineering. The investigators are evaluating the
impact of the workshops on the attendees: a) knowledge of educational
innovations, b) intentions to implement workshop ideas, and c) actual
implementation of the innovations presented at the workshops.
