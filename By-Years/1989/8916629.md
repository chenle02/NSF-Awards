Balanced cross-sections are a powerful tool for under- standing the development
of a fold-and-thrust belt, and have commonly been applied to external thrusts
where internal strain is small. However, the drawing of viable and admissible
cross- sections for internal thrust sheets requires additional informa- tion on
strain within the thrust sheet, how the strain was dis- tributed and when during
the deformation the strain accumulated. By using strain history studies to
separate successive finite increments of deformation, appropriate strain
increments can be removed at proper times in the restoration sequence. However,
a practical method for obtaining the required strain data has not been perfected
or tested. This project will collect strain data from widespread markers in the
well-known Meade thrust sheet of the Idaho-Wyoming-Utah thrust belt. The methods
developed in this project are expected to help extend the technique of cross-
section balancing to hinterland terrains.
