Semiconductor Field Effect Transistors and GaAs/AlGaAs Heterojunction Field
Effect Transistors have demonstrated performance suitable for operation in
systems at millimeter wave frequencies, and in ultra-high speed integrated
circuits. While a large body of work modeling these devices exists, the only
experimental results are S-parameter device measurements and the device
performance in circuits. Thus, the detailed physics of these devices are
surmised from their circuit performance and the correlation of trends predicted
by modeling. Measurement of parameters affecting the physics of these devices
are virtually nonexistent. This proposal will attempt to measure some
fundamental device parameters using an electron beam probe. Previous, work of
this kind on semiconductor devices, have been largely confined to Gunn devices,
and GaAs FETs. Other work in this area has been performed by using the gate
current of a GaAs FET as a measurement probe for the electron temperature in the
channel.
