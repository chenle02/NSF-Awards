9315611 Crane Funds are provide for a completion of a study of two axial
volcanic systems and a non transform en echelon offset of Reykjanes Ridge. This
would lead to an understanding of how crustal thickness affects tectonic and
magmatic evolution of the ridge. Existing SeaMARC and Hydrosweep as well as
submersible data will be used.
