This is a funding supplement representing the support of the DoD WHSIC program
in planning the focus and objectives of the contemplated SEMATECH
industry/government semiconductor manufacturing technology initiative. These
funds will go to support the SRC, under the existing MOU between NSF and SRC,
for an intensive planning study on the SEMATECH concept. No NSF funds have been
allocated for this segment of SRC support; DoD VHSIC funds have been transferred
to NSF via a MIPR.
