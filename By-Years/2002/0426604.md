Barbara Garrison of Penn State is supported by the Chemistry Division under the
Information Technology Research program to develop an innovative simulation
protocol to incorporate chemical reaction effects into a united-atom, mesoscale
molecular dynamics simulation of laser ablation of polymers. She will include
chemical reactions in a probabilistic manner in sufficiently large size and time
scales to simulate the photochemical etching of polymers. Industrial
applications of photoablation include drilling ink jet nozzles and printed
circuit board holes, fabricating micro-fluidic devices, and etching
tissue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will provide a fundamental
understanding of the interplay between photochemical bond-breaking, cross-
linking, and heating on the ablation dynamics of polymers. This has direct
implications for design of experiments and industrial processes, as well as
other simulations including the modeling of ionization effects in the
atmosphere, detonation of explosives, and propulsion of rocket engines.
