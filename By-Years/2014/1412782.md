This award provides funding to help defray the travel expenses of 18 US
participants, especially young researchers and graduate students, to participate
in the conference "Beyond Hamilton-Jacobi in Avignon", which will take place in
Avignon University, from Wednesday April 23 - 30, 2014. The PIs expect that
about 2/3 of the budget will go towards the support of graduate students and
postdocs, with recruiting as many underrepresented groups as possible a
priority.

The Avignon conference will cover recent developments in the areas of Weak KAM
theory and Aubry-Mather theory. This is a very active area, with origins in
practical applications to solid state physics and dynamics. The Avignon
conference will bring together participants from many parts of the world to
enrich and connect the many different aspects of Weak KAM theory. The junior
researchers from the US will be exposed to a high level program and will become
acquainted with the most promising and vibrant areas of research connecting PDEs
to dynamics. There will be 6 senior lecturers, including the two PIs who are
also co-organizers of the event.
