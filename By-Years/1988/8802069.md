This research addresses the development and verification of mathematical models
for the solution of inverse problems associated with phase change casting
processes. The methodology is based on sequential and regularization methods in
conjunction with an implicit Finite Element Method (FEM) formulation and
deforming FEM techniques. A general analysis of inverse phase change problems
including variable material properties will be developed. Casting processing
involving mushy regions and complex geometries will be considered. This
analytical research is closely tied to an industrial affiliate who is performing
the associated experiments. Solidification processes are of vital engineering
significance. There is no existing methodology for the computational analysis of
inverse phase change problems. This research considers the development of
inverse techniques for phase change problems, the control of solidification
processes and the associated microstructure is possible. This could lead to
significant fundamental and practical contributions of importance to our
industrial institutions.
