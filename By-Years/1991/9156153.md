The objective of this proposal is to improve the undergraduate statistical
education of engineers by integrating statistics into their laboratories and
courses. In this way statistical thinking and techniques are being reinforced
after an introductory statistics course, with the expectation that in this way
students will retain their statistical skills. The goal is to create a course
that engineering faculty will want their students to take, and that will prepare
the students for what will be required of them in their labs and courses.
