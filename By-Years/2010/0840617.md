CBET-0840617&lt;br/&gt;Agonafer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award partially
supports a symposium on Grand Challenges in Thermal Management of Electronic
Systems: From Device to Systems, which will be held in conjunction with the ASME
International Mechanical Engineering Congress &amp; Exposition on October 31 -
November 1, 2008. The purpose of this meeting is to bring together an
international group of researchers to discuss emerging topics in electronic
packaging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With respect to the intellectual merit of the
conference, electronic packaging remains an especially challenging area of
research, particularly given its interdisciplinary nature that combines
expertise from electrical engineering, thermal engineering, materials science,
and others. A topic of special importance, to be emphasized at this symposium,
is three-dimensional packaging, in which a third dimension is added to typical
two-dimensional electronic systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of
the conference include partial support for a number of US-based junior
researchers and students, with women and minority attendees especially
encouraged to attend. The results will be widely disseminated through a special
issue of the ASME Journal of Electronic Packaging.
