This project funded by NSF's Science, Technology, and Society Program will
examine the history of the development and use of the spirometer, a machine that
measures the capacity of the lungs, as it incorporated varying ideas of race in
different national contexts from the mid-19th century to the present. Of
particular relevance to this project is that the adjustment of volumetric
measurements for lung capacity is routinely made for age, height, gender, and
race of the subject. "Race correction," also referred to as "ethnic adjustment"
is sanctioned by many professional societies without a full understanding of the
limitations of such a practice.

Specific contexts to be studied include military medicine, physical fitness
movements, and workmen's compensation systems in three countries: The US, the
UK, and South Africa. This project will draw extensively on the biomedical
literature, physiology and medical textbooks, records of consensus conferences
on standardization of the technology, personal papers of researchers and
archives of governmental committees and spirometry manufacturers. Archival
material will be supplemented with personal interviews.

The era of genomics has brought with it renewed concerns about the meanings of
race and ethnicity, the role of scientific theories, practices, and technologies
in constructing such meanings, and the use of race and ethnicity in scientific
investigations. As complex technologies become ever more central to daily life
and the medical marketplace, it is critical to understand the mechanisms by
which technological instruments have worked across national boundaries to
naturalize racial and ethnic categories in the past and how this global history
shapes present understandings of lung capacity measurements. By elucidating the
historical process by which social and cultural beliefs about race got attached
to spirometry and then built into the machine, this project will illuminate an
understudied dimension of the history of technology and contribute to the
cotemporary debate on race, genetics, and health.
