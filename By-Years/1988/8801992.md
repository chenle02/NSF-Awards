The research for this project is directed at establishing suitable
approximations to the distributions of estimators of parameters in linear
stochastic models. By approximations, Berry.Essen bounds and asymptotic
expansions are also included. The method that will be used will be different
from the usual method of characteristic functions and will also give
approximations uniformly over all Borel subsets, which is also one of the aims
of the project. Some specific statistical models that will be considered in
detail include nonlinear regression, autoregression, regression with lagged
dependent variables. Robust versions of the estimators in these models will be
considered in addition to the least squares estimators.
