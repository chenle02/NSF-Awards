The role of bacteria in recycling dissolved organic matter in freshwater and
marine environments is, at present, pooly known. Yet because dissolved organic
matter is one of the largest pools of biospheric carbon, knowledge of the
processes involved in its formation and biological utilization is essential for
a full understanding of global carbon cycling. One particular class of dissolved
organic matter, the humic substances, is of particular interest because it makes
up a very large fraction of the total dissolved substances (up to 80% in some
natural environments) but has been very poorly studied in the past. We propose
to examine the bacterial processes involved in recycling (formation and
utilization ) of dissolved humic substances in a freshwater wetland in the
southeastern United States (the Okefenokee Swamp Ecosystem).
