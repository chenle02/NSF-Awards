This award supports a dedicated workshop devoted to synthesizing the data from a
multi-year interdisciplinary field and laboratory study into the complex
interaction of earth systems in the Northern Antarctic Peninsula. The Larsen Ice
Shelf System, Antarctica (LARISSA) is an International Polar Year-supported
project devoted to furthering our understanding of a vulnerable region of the
Earth that is undergoing rapid changes of climate and ecosystem function. This 3
day workshop will unite all participating Principal Investigators (PIs), post-
docs and students in one venue to provide an effective forum to discuss the
integration of the various results and plan the next steps for dissemination and
peer review publication. The complexities of field work logistics and difficult
sea ice conditions have forced the team to adapt to varying field sampling
strategies and, because of this, an extra amount of synergy is required in order
to harvest the scientific outcomes of the various disciplines which include:
physical oceanography, glaciology, marine and Quaternary geology, marine
biology, geodesy, and climatology. The efforts of the LARISSA program included
four marine expeditions and numerous field visits to the Antarctic Peninsula in
the past three years, and there is a tremendous amount of data that needs to be
presented and discussed amongst the members of the collaborative research
team.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This workshop will involve both senior and junior
PIs, as well as PhD to undergraduate students. The workshop will convene a
critical mass of researchers with a diversity of contributions, which will
benefit all participants. The long-term results of this workshop will be to
expand and disseminate the impact of LARISSA results beyond the PI community of
scholars. The data distribution plan has directives to make the results
available to the broader community.
