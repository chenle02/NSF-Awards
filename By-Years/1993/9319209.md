9319209 Momoh The Howard University Center for Energy Systems and Controls
(CESaC) within the Department of Electrical Engineering will conduct a 2nd
International Workshop on Power Systems Operations and Planning. The first
workshop was held in Lagos during 1992 and focused on voltage regulation. The
activities of this workshop are documented in our proceedings "International
Workshop on Voltage Collapse and Voltage Regulation '92" (IWVCVR '92) The need
for increased collaboration and exchange of technical information in planning
and operation is timely for both the U.S. and SubSaharan Africa. Some of the
planning and operational problems include development of strategies for handling
small and large disturbance modeling problems, and inefficient and uneconomic
operations and reliability issues. The participants of this workshop will
include countries from SubSaharan Africa and the United States. Power engineers
from Ghana, Kenya, Cameroon, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zaire, Mozambique and
Zimbabwe will be invited to participate in tutorials, lectures, discussions and
recommendations. ***
