This proposal deals with the study of the mitotic spindles of invertebrates
zygotes. The major goal is to purify tektin-like proteins from mitotic spindles
and to determine how these proteins interact with the microtubules of the
spindle and the spindle matrix. Tektin antibodies will be used to identify and
purify similar proteins from the spindles and these proteins will be used to
generate antibodies to be used as specific probes. Laser confocal light
microscopy and transmission and scanning electron microscopy will be used to
determine the 3-dimensional organization of these matrix polypeptides.
Antibodies will be microinjected into living cells to determine effects on
spindle structure and function. These studies will advance our understanding of
microtubule assembly, polarity and stability in the mitotic spindle and how the
matrix provides a framework for the operation of the cell division process.
