Soils in the western United States are diverse, both in their properties and
distribution across the landscape. Plants species show exceptional diversity as
well. Many species of plants grow only in specific soil types. The wild
buckwheats (Eriogonum) are a group of plants that include many of these soil
specialists (edaphic endemics). This project examines these patterns using
modern DNA sequencing and classic greenhouse experiments to determine if there
is an evolutionary pattern relating to these soil specialists. It will also
address whether these species are specifically adapted to these soils, or if
they can survive on a variety of soils.

This project reaches across many disciplines, incorporating principles of
botany, evolutionary biology, soil science, and ecology. The results of this
project will add to the knowledge relating to the distribution of rare plant
species, especially pertaining to soils. Unique methods incorporated in this
project will be disseminated for other researchers to use and improve. A number
of species in the study group are rare or endangered. Data gathered from
fieldwork will be vital to various conservation agencies, for implementing
sound, well-informed policies.
