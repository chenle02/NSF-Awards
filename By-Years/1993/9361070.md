9361070 Sachs This research is to develop a new viscoplastic constitutive model
which utilizes internal variables in order to model the Bauschinger effect. It
will account for rate and temperature dependence, large strain kinematics and a
suitable corotational stress rate. The model will be implemented using an
existing Lagrangian finite element computer code and will be verified by
comparing simulation predictions with experimental results for several common
experimental and manufacturing configurations. ***
