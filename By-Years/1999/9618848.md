The proposed research aims to provide the scientific and technological base for
a new paradigm for human-computer interaction, one that enables the principled
design of multi- modal dialogue-supporting interfaces. Two strands of previous
research support this effort: research towards building novel, collaborative
interfaces for automated graphic design and the development of explicit theories
of collaboration. The proposed research addresses a key missing element of prior
research, an understanding of how theory can be integrated with practice, so
that a theoretical understanding of collaborative activity can inform in a
principled manner the design of concrete software interfaces. The research
comprises three activities: specialization of the general theory of
collaboration to provide a framework for the design of collaborative interfaces;
application of the theory to human-computer interface design leading to a set of
design principles enabling system designers to construct software elements that
communicate well in multiple modalities; and implementation of specific
collaborative interfaces in a range of domains. The proposed research will
contribute to fundamental research in communication, to the development of
collaborative human-computer interface systems, and to training of
undergraduates, graduate students, and post- doctoral fellows for work in multi-
modal communication.
