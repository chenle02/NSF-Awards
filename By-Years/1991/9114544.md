In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor James J. Valentini of Columbia University will study the
state-to-state dynamics of photodissociation and photo-induced reactions in van
der Waals and hydrogen-bonded molecular complexes. The research addresses the
influence of many-body interactions, solvent effects, cage effects, mode-
selective or bond-selective chemistry, and steric effects in these reactions.
The clusters will be excited to a specific vibrational mode via stimulated Raman
excitation, and photofragments or reaction products will be detected using
laser-induced fluorescence or multiphoton ionization. %%% The study of molecular
complexes which are held together with bonds which are weaker than chemical
bonds impacts our understanding of many phenomena. For example, the way solids
and liquids are formed from condensing vapors or the conditions under which
certain surfaces catalyze chemical reactions are governed by the physical forces
that hold the separate chemical species together. An understanding of the role
of these forces in weakly bound complexes is a major goal of this current
project.
