DNA replication in Escherichia coli is catalyzed by DNA polymerase III
holoenzyme. This enzyme, thought to coordinate leading and lagging strand
synthesis as an asymmetric dimer, contains polymerizing activity in a core plus
essential auxiliary factors. Two of the auxiliary factors, tau and gamma, are
the products of one gene, dnaX. They are synthesized in equimolar amounts and,
although their exact functions are unknown, it is possible that their asymmetry.
Tau is the translation product of the full-length dnaX reading frame; the
shorter gamma shares the same N-terminal sequence as tau but is terminated
within the tau reading frame by a programmed ribosomal frameshift followed by a
nonsense condon in the new frame. Knowledge of the sequence and mechanism of
gamma formation makes possible investigations of tau and gamma functions.
Specifically, the requirement for each tau and gamma in vivo (because the in
vitro data are equivocal) will be tested by generation of mutant dnaX alleles
which synthesize only tau or only gamma and gene replacement. Other mutant genes
and proteins altered in ATPase and suspected helicase motifs will be analyzed in
vivo and in vitro to correlate loss of complementing activity, ATPase, helicase,
and ability to support polymerization in vitro. Second, dnaX gene expression
will be preliminarily characterized. Third, the sequenced of dnaA mutations
which suppress dnaX(Ts) mutants will be determined.
