9401256 Green Professor Green will investigate problems in the geometry of
projective varieties and commutative algebra. These include problems in
Castelnuovo theory, syzygies of algebraic curves and generic initial ideals.
This is research in the field of algebraic geometry. Algebraic geometry is one
of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had a revolutionary
flowering in the past quarter- century. In its origin, it treated figures that
could be defined in the plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials.
Nowadays the field makes use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis
and topology, and conversely is finding application in those fields as well as
in physics, theoretical computer science, and robotics.
