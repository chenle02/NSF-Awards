Konza Prairie is a 3487 hectare tallgrass prairie laboratory located about 10
km south of Kansas State University. This site is a Man and the Biosphere
preserve, an Ecological Experimental Reserve and a Long-Term Ecological Research
facility. Konza rairie was also selected as the site of the first field
experiment for the NASA-sponsored International Satellite Land Surface
Climatology Project. A large and increasing portion of current and pending
research at the Prairie is focused on roots, on soil microbes and chemistry, on
the growth, demography and life histories of underground plant parts, and on
buried seed and rhizome pool dynamics. Samples of soils and vegetation presently
must be transported and processed at Kansas State University because adequate
on-site laboratory facilities are not available at the Prairie. This project
will provide funds to remodel a building at Konza Prairie to house a modern and
much-needed belowground studies laboratory. This addition will greatly
facilitate research on belowground processes, will provide on-site laboratory
facilities for visiting scientists, will expand the site's ability to sample and
process large quantities of soil, soil fauna and underground plant parts, and
will allow the sampling and processing of prairie soil during periods when
climatic conditions otherwise would prohibit field-processing of such samples.
