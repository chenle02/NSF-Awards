This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). Granted funds will support a laboratory technician to work
as a fossil preparator at Ohio University. The technician will support the
research of at least nine faculty members who rely on detailed study of fossil
vertebrate and invertebrate remains to elucidate evolutionary and paleoecologic
responses of communities to environmental changes. Much of the faculty research
center around study of Mesozoic and Cenozoic fossil vertebrates recovered from
well age constrained East African Rift Valley sequences. This grant will
establish a new full time research scientist position at Ohio University for a
minimum of three years and will advance the research programs of multiple early
career scientists.
