9452156 Diehl Twenty-two Macintosh Quadra 610 workstations are set up to serve
courses in Statistical Methods and Experimental Psychology. Four more are for
use primarily by students in Cognitive Psychology and those engaged in
Independent Research and Honors Research courses. In addition to extending the
repertoire of statistical tests that can be taught, availability of computers in
laboratory instruction makes possible the transition from passive observation of
demonstrations to active involvement in data collection and analysis, and,
ultimately, to the design and implementation of student-generated research
projects.
