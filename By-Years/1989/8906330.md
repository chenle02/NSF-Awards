This is a fundamental engineering research project to characterize the
mechanical and rheological properties of normal and sickle erythrocytes under
various physiological and therapeutic conditions. A better fundamental
understanding of the mechanical engineering properties of sickle cells could be
used to base new therapies for treating sickle cell anemia.
