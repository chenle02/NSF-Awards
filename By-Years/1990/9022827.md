This award supports a combination of new observations, theoretical analysis,
and numerical modeling to develop fully self-consistent models of the dynamics
and structure of barred spiral galaxies. The investigators are world leaders in
this field, and this study will greatly deepen our understanding of the
fundamental mechanisms that determine the structure and evolution of these
objects.
