This award is for the purchase of equipment for the high speed acquisition of
images and for manipulator end-effector hardware. The image equipment is needed
for real-time performance and the end-effector hardware is needed for
experimentation with manipulation tasks. The equipment is also used in
integrating vision and manipulation tasks incorporating perception, cognition,
and action. Applied robotics involves the integration of many areas including
vision research, control research, sensor integration, and planning algorithms.
This proposal requests funds for the purchase of equipment to support vision
research and manipulator research. The vision equipment will allow real time
processing of visual data while the manipulators (grippers, etc.) will allow the
testing of manipulator algorithms with the robot arm connected to actual
manipulators.
