Progress has been made on analyzing micelle coagulation in a biological system
(milk). Using a Zeiss IM, darkfield microscope with TV monitor, camera, and
microflash, particles as small as 0.095 micron were detected when the
proteolytic enzyme rennet was added to diluted milk, and the time course of
coagulation was observed. For this project, Zeiss IBAS image processing system
will be used to attach to the darkfield microscope already in place in his
laboratory. The system will allow particle sizes to be determined, enhancement
of images from the darkfield microscope (increasing resolution), and analysis of
these images. After image enhancement, the geometric shape factors for the model
simulation can be calculated. Comparison of these shape factors for the actual
flocs and the simulated flocs will test the applicability of theoretical models.
