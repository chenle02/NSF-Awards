This is an "Accomplishment-Based Renewal" to continue work measuring
germanium/silicon ratios in marine biogenic silica to characterize variations in
the oceanic silica and germanium cycles. Over the next three years detailed
(Ge/Si) Opal records will be produced for two time scales: Late Pleistocene
piston cores (0 - 450 Kyr B.P.), and Late Paleogene to Neogene Ocean Drilling
Project Sites (0 - 40 Myr B.P.). These diatom Ge/Si data, when combined with
biogenic opal, carbonate, and organic carbon accumulation rates plus diatom
preservation indices in the same cores, will permit features of past global
oceanic silica and germanium cycles to be reconstructed including (1) changes in
global input and removal via mid-ocean ridge hot springs, continental rivers,
conversion of organogermanium, and burial of biogenic opal; (2) changes in local
versus global siliceous accumulation rates; and (3) variations in local
biosiliceous productivity and preformed silica concentrations of high latitude
surface waters. Ancillary work will include (1) continuing determinations of Ge
and Si associated with hydrothermal effluents and plumes (southern EPR, Juan de
Fuca), (2) finishing determinations of inorganic and methylated germanium in the
Black Sea, (3) starting diatom cultures and dissolution experiments to directly
measure Ge/Si-biofractionation factors and to assess the effect of diatom
species' preservation on the burial ratio, and (4) constructing time-dependent
models of the germanium and silicon cycles to complement information derived
from the traditional carbonate paleotracers ( 180, 13C, Cd/Ca, Li/Ca, Sr/Ca,
87Sr/86Sr) for areas and times where carbonates are not preserved and for
oceanic processes whose systematics are not recorded by calcareous microfossils.
