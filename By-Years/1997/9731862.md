9731862 STUBBS Professor Christopher Stubbs and others at the University of
Washington, in collaboration with researchers at Mt. Stromlo Observatory,
Australia, are engaged in a search for supernovae (SNe) in dense clusters of
galaxies. This will contribute to our understanding of the geometry of the
universe, to our understanding of distortions in the expanding universe, and to
our knowledge of the final stages of stellar evolution. The U.S. group has 5% of
the time on the MaCHO 1.3m telescope and wide-field imaging camera, an
instrument that is essential to the success of the project, located at Mt.
Stromlo, Australia. This award will support the travel to Mt. Stromlo and per
diem of Professor Christopher Stubbs' graduate student, David Reiss, for three
trips a year for two years during which he will be working on his Ph.D thesis.
The Australian counterpart is Dr. Brian P. Schmidt of the Institute for Advanced
Studies, Mt. Stromlo and Siding Spring Observatories, Australia.
