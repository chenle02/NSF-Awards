9316285 Bilham The PI will perform research to complement the CASA project with
dense linear arrays of geodetic points designed to determine the plate velocity
field across the SE Caribbean plate boundary. In this way he can determine the
distribution of plate boundary displacements among the several significant
faults in the region, allowing better estimates of recurrence rates for damaging
earthquakes. Aves Island and 4 other locations will be instrumented with deep
borehole reference monuments with a 3D stability of +/-1 mm. Aves is a crucial
measurement point for Caribbean plate studies because it is far from a plate
boundary and the PI will be monitoring this site for ongoing GPS projects
elsewhere in the Caribbean. The research will be undertaken collaboratively with
Venezuelan scientists who will provide 30% of the equipment and 100% of the
field logistical costs in Venezuela. ****
