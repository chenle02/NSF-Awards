The crustal structure of the Transantarctic Mountains (TAM) reflects significant
details concerning the interaction and tectonic histories of East and West
Antarctica. Yet, relatively little is known about the lithospheric structure of
the TAM. Strong constraints on the lithospheric structure beneath the TAM are
needed to discriminate between various models put forth to explain the evolution
of TAM uplift. This investigation will use a land-based digital seismic
recording array at two location in the TAM to obtain two densely recorded
seismic profiles across the TAM Front near Terra Nova Bay and in the Wright
Valley. The Bundesanstalt fur Geowissenschaften, Federal Republic of Germany,
will provide large marine airgun seismic sources in conjunction with the
GANOVEX-V Expedition during the 1988/89 field season. Seismic waveform modeling
will be used in conjunction with array processing techniques to derive maximum
constraints on TAM lithospheric velocity structure. Seismic results will be
integrated with geopotential field data and geochemical data to determine the
most appropriate models of TAM structure, composition, and tectonic evolution.
