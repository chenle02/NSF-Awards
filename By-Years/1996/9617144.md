This project connects Southeastern University to the Internet over a partial-T1
line. Faculty and students at the school benefit from access to the resources of
the Internet, including libraries and supercomputers. In addition, they are able
to communicate and collaborate with colleagues at other institutions in pursuit
of research and educational projects. The award provides partial support of the
project for one year.
