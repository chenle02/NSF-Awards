The International Workshop on Graph Grammars and Their Application to computer
Science will be held in Williamsburg, Virginia between 14 and 19 November, l993.
It is intended to bring together leading researchers in graph grammar theory and
applications to discuss open problems which are most critical to practical
applications. A diverse range of areas including programming languages, software
engineering, massively parallel computation, knowledge-based systems,
developmental biology, and picture processing shall be represented. The highly
interactive format of the workshop should encourage and enable a synthesis of
theoretical and practical concerns from diverse communities.
