Design and Fabrication of Gradient Generating Microfluidic Micro-
Incubator&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; A grant has been awarded to Dr. Noo Li Jeon at
University of California, Irvine to develop a microfluidic device that can
generate gradients of biological molecules and is capable of culturing cells in
well-controlled environments. Chemical gradients of biologically active
molecules on surfaces and in solutions play important roles in many biological
processes such as development, wound healing, and cancer. &lt;br/&gt;Recent
advances in the field of microfabrication and soft lithography enable the
fabrication devices that have structures of submicron dimensions. The purpose of
this proposal is to develop a microfluidic device that is capable of generating
gradients of active biological molecules that are controlled both spatially and
temporally. This device, a microfluidic micro-incubator will be compatible with
microscopy techniques and will allow long-term cell culture of a variety of cell
types. By significantly improving the resolution and stability of gradients and
actively controlling both the temporal and spatial gradients, the microfluidic
micro-incubator developed in this study will provide new capabilities for in-
situ observation and quantification of biological phenomena such as chemotaxis
(neutrophils, T-cells, and metastatic cancer cells) and growth cone guidance of
neurons. &lt;br/&gt; The ability to expose cells to both temporal and spatial
gradients of growth factors and other biologically active compounds will be
broadly useful in a number of biological research applications. The gradient
generating microfluidic micro-incubator can be used in understanding how cells
navigate in complex tissue environments and specifically in investigating the
processes behind tumor metastasis, wound healing, and other biological
processes. With further development, it is envisioned that the micro-incubator
will find applications in development and testing of new drugs for wound
healing, breast cancer metastasis, and others. &lt;br/&gt;
