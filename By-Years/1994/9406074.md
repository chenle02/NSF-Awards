9406074 Harrison This award provides 51% of the funding necessary to acquire an
Inductively-Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectrometer to be installed and
operated in the Department of Geology and Geological Engineering at the Colorado
School of Mines. The institution is committed to providing the remaining funds
needed for the acquisition. The instrument is to be used mainly in the research
and teaching of the Geochemistry Program at the Colorado School of Mines. The
Geochemistry Program is an interdisciplinary graduate program, involving three
departments and fourteen faculty and their students in research and teaching
that requires multielement chemical analysis capabilities for studies of natural
waters, environmental assessment studies, and igneous and sedimentary petrology.
