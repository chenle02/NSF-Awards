An undergraduate computing laboratory introducing the students to the modern
practice of expert systems, specifically when applied to design of thermal
energy systems, is established. The laboratory consists of one personal
workstation and two terminals, completely configured. Softwares associated with
the development of thermal-design expert systems is used by the students to gain
exposure and hands-on experience.
