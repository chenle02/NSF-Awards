This project is to analyze the microstructure data taken from a towed body
during the Caribbean Sheets and Layers Transect (C-Salt) Experiment in November
1985. During the experiment, about 130 km of velocity shear, temperature,
temperature gradient, and CTD data were collected. Analysis will focus on
estimating vertical heat flux, estimating vertical buoyancy flux from the shear,
inferring salt flux, and all three from finescale temperature, slainity and
density anomalies in the mixed layers. Results should be contrasted with regions
lacking in strong staircase structures.
