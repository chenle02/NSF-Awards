The implantation of artificial hip joints has become standard orthopedic
treatment; however, the failure rate of the implants demands a better
understanding of the materials involved. The main objective of this research is
to improve the understanding of material parameters which influence bone bonding
and bone growth conduction properties that thin linings of HA on porous titanium
influences the ingrowth of bone at the bone-implant interface. The process will
be studied by varying the choice of HA powders with which the deposition process
starts, the coating thickness, the method of deposition, and the time
implantation. Both in-vivo and in-vitro studies will be performed.
