This award will support collaborative research in polymers between Dr. Kenneth
Shea, University of California, Irvine and three French scientists: Drs. Alain
Guyot and Andre Revillon, Laboratory for Organic Materials, French National
Center for Scientific Research (CNRS), Vernaison, and Dr. Jean-Paul Chauvet,
Ecole Normale Superieure, Lyons. The objective of the project is the development
of new polymeric materials that can serve as heterogeneous catalysts for
chemical reactions. The program will feature a component of synthetic chemistry
to prepare the network polymers and fluorescence and ESR studies to establish
such features as: the accessibility of the network polymers towards solvents,
the penetrability towards reagents, the presence of heterogeneous domains, and
the accessibility and mobility of polymer bound functional groups. The project
will benefit from the expertise of the CNRS group in the preparation of
functionalized polymers and from the experience of the groups of Shea and Chavet
in fluorescence spectroscopy and diagnostics.
