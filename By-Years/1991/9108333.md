Preliminary work on the development of an active low frequency isolation system
will be carried out. This will concentrate on the building and testing of a
preliminary isolation stage which will operate in at least 3 and probably 6
degrees of freedom. This will make possible a low noise environment for further
developments, as well as give this University of Colorado group experience with
isolation systems with multiple degrees of freedom. This work will lay the
groundwork for the design of advanced receiver systems which may be added to the
proposed Caltech/MIT Laser Interferomer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO),
which will probe for low frequency (1 to 100 Hz) signals. It will also be of
interest for a wide variety of precision systems in science and technology.
