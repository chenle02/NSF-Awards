A number of problems in mathematical relativity and quantum gravity will be
carried out by Prof. Torre. In mathematical relativity advantage is taken of
recent results on the jet space structure of the vacuum Einstein equations. In
detail, the modern theory of conservation laws, which provides a practical
framework for computing conserved volume, surface and line integrals associated
to a system of field equations, is applied to the Einstein equations. The
conservation laws of the Einstein equations with and without Killing vectors are
computed. A general theory of asymptotic conservation laws, which describes
surface integral conservation laws of solutions with a given asymptotic
structure, such as the ADM energy, is developed and used to give a formalism for
computing such conservation laws for a large class of generally covariant field
equations and asymptotic structures. These results are applied to the problem of
giving a definition of `dynamical black hole entropy`. Finally, recent results
on symmetry reductions of partial differential equations are used to give
general theorems on symmetry reductions of generally covariant field equations
for a spacetime metric. In quantum gravity, work involves both canonical and
path integral methods of quantization of the gravitational field. The problem of
functional evolution in canonical quantum gravity is addressed via symmetry-
reduced models of general relativity obtained by assuming the existence of two
commuting Killing vector fields. These models are quantized rigorously and
consistently with respect to general covariance. The possibility of
accomplishing a Dirac quantization of a parametrized free field theory in
Minkowski space is addressed using techniques from algebraic quantization. Path
integral quantization is studied using Ashtekar variables.
