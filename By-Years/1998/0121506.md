0121506&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A modular system for ocean data assimilation has
recently been developed. It has already been implemented in an unsophisticated
way, with a variety of models of the ocean and the coupled ocean-atmosphere.
This project will enhance the system using Information Technology, including
modern software engineering concepts, new visualization techniques and
interactive web-based training. Together with effective outreach and advanced
optimization algorithms, these elements of IT will be linked through the modular
system to a wide range of coastal, basin-scale and global ocean models.
Variational data assimilation is also coming into use in operational weather
forecasting and ocean forecasting, in ocean biogeochemistry, in groundwater
hydrology and in solid-earth geophysics. The new modular system will thus be of
immediate benefit throughout the geosciences. The team includes 14 physical
oceanographers, civil engineers and computer scientists in six universities, a
national laboratory, and private industry. The project is funded under the
Information Technology Research Initiative&lt;br/&gt;
