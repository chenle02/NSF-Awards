*** 9761626 Welker This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
proposes a novel solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) that will more than quadruple
the practical power, peak power, and energy density of state-of-the-art
secondary lithium batteries. The innovation involves the controlled
incorporation of substituted sidechains onto dendritic carbosilane polymers.
Covalently attaching these high performance SPEs to high energy density fibrous
electrodes will produce secondary lithium batteries with substantially increased
energy densities and power densities. These novel electrolytes combine the
beneficial aspects of SPEs and liquid electrolytes with other desirable features
not found in either system. The innovations will enable higher power
capabilities that arise from higher cell voltages, higher conductivities, higher
transference numbers, lower interfacial impedance, and more complete utilization
of the electrode capacity - all at a reasonable cost. This program will result
in significant improvements in power density, energy density, cycle life,
safety, disposal, and cost. Improved lithium polymer batteries would find a
large market in electric vehicles, and consumer products, as well as in military
applications. ***
