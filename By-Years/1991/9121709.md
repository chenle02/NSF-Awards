This award is for an upgrade of a MasPar MP-1 massively parallel computer to
enable computational applications in information sciences and systems, and in
condensed matter and material physics. Research projects include compression of
high-definition images, distributed decision-making with very large numbers of
sensors, Monte Carlo simulations of glassy systems, and numerical studies of
quantum disordered systems. The acquisition of MasPar machines has allowed a
number of academic, government and industrial organizations to achieve
exceptionally fast computing performance for scientific and engineering
applications amenable to massive parallelism. Princeton University plans to use
the machine for several research projects in the Electronic Materials and
devices group, and in the Information Sciences and Systems group.
