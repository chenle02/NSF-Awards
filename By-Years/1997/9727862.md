This award supports a collaborative interaction between researchers in the
Center for Ultrafast Optical Science (CUOS) at the University of Michigan and
Hampton University in their studies of acceleration of electrons through
wavefields generated in high-field laser-plasma interactions. Recent discoveries
in this area have led to observations of electrons of MeV energies, and the
focus of the combined efforts of the CUOS and Hampton groups will be to
characterize the electron beam emitted through the interaction and use these
studies to determine those conditions of the interaction that would enhance the
intensity and quality of the beam. Beyond the scientific component of the work,
the postdoctoral associate would serve as the connecting link between the two
institutions, thereby cementing the interaction between this Science and
Technology Center and Hampton University, and HBCU institution, and enhancing
the involvement of minority students in the research effort. Funding for this
position is provided by the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) of the
MPS Directorate.
