9451489 Dietrich This Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement project
involves the revision of an undergraduate database course to include a
laboratory project that allows students to acquire practical experience using a
commercial database product. A unique aspect of the work is the way in which
cooperative learning techniques are used in administration of the group
projects. Each project is divided into different phases corresponding to
different functional aspects of database development. Those phases include
requirements analysis, conceptual modeling, relational database design and view
modeling, forms/report design, and application programming. Students assume
different roles during the course of the project, such as phase leader for
leading group activities, phase recorder for organizing documentation
activities, phase checker for evaluating group members on the concepts that they
have learned, and phase technical advisor for leading the technical activities
of each phase. The advantage of this approach is that it not only allows
students to become more active participants in the learning process but it also
allows students to develop good leadership and communication skills while
learning the practical use of database system software. This project is
therefore establishing a teaching environment that provides a well-balanced mix
of theory and practice with emphasis on cooperative learning.
