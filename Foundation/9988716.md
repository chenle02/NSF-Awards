ABSTRACT

Cholak plans on studying the interaction between definability and computability
in various structures in mathematical logic. Primarily, but not totally, Cholak
will focus on the collection of all computably enumerable sets under the
inclusion relation and the computably enumerable degrees under Turing
reducibility. Cholak's long range goals are to provide a complete understanding
of the relationships between these two structures and their automorphisms and
definable orbits.

Cholak's main focus is on definability and computability. These notions are both
important in measuring the complexity of an answer to a mathematical problem.
One develops an intertwined hierarchy of definability and computability. Only
answers which lay on the lowest level of complexity are computable and even then
are not always feasibly computable given today's computers. Answers of higher
complexity provide useful mathematical information and allows the user to test
the limits of their mathematical techniques.
