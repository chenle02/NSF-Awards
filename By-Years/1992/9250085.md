The University of Mary Hardin-Baylor will initiate a three-week, commuter Young
Scholars project in the fields of Chemistry and Physics for 30 students entering
grade 9. The selected students will participate in hands-on science activities
involving chemical analysis and measurements, environmental chemistry, polymer
science, lasers, holography, and investigations of the properties of light.
Activities have been selected that are both exciting and educational.
Participants will be divided into small groups to conduct a short research
project. A portion of the three-week workshop will involve career awareness
activities such as question and answer sessions with visiting scientists and
engineers and field trips. The nine monthly follow-up activities will involve
hands-on science activities, dynamic speakers, field trips, and competitive
events.
