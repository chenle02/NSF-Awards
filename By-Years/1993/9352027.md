The project will upgrade and expand the organic, inorganic, and biochemistry
courses and student research projects at Gustavus Adolphus College through the
purchase of a high-field multinuclear nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
spectrometer. The instrument will be used in the introductory organic courses
for identification and structural elucidation of products via 1H and 13C NMR
spectroscopy. The advanced organic course will be modified to include synthesis
experiments which will make use of 13C and two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy, and
to evaluate the course of enantioselective reactions. The instrument will be
used in biochemistry courses to illustrate aspects of protein structure and to
measure rates of metabolic processes. The introductory and advanced inorganic
courses will use multinuclear variable temperature NMR spectroscopy for
characterization of products and the measurement of activation barriers.
