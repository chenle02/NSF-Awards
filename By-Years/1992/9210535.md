The proposal is to use differential optical absorption spectroscopy to study and
determine the nature of the fundamental bandgap in Ge-Si strained superlattice
nanostructures. First principle theoretical studies show that both direct and
indirect superlattices exist, and previous experimental studies have given some
credible support to these calculations. The experimental demonstration of direct
bandgap behavior in Ge-Si nanostructures will open up a whole new vista for Si
as a photonic material. A principal goal of the proposed research is to forge a
new fundamental understanding of the relationship between superlattice
structures and symmetry on one hand, and optical properties on the other. A
direct result of this work will be demonstration of how crystalline symmetry,
artificially- imposed during growth, can be used to control the optical
propertied of semiconductors and other materials.
