This proposal requests funds to support the Wayne State University group's
fraction of a collaborative effort on the research and development of hardware
and reconstruction algorithms for charged particle tracking at a future Linear
Collider. The collaboration consists of the University of California at Santa
Cruz, University of Colorado, Indiana University, University of Michigan, Wayne
State University, and Yale University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brought together in
this group from the participating institutions are experts in tracking
detectors, both in the hardware aspects of such detectors and in tracking and
reconstruction algorithms. The aim of the research is to specify the tracking
system for a Linear Collider detector by determining the requirements that a
list of interesting benchmark collider processes put on the detector
design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs and a post-doc will explore a Silicon Drift
Detector (SDD) array as the tracking device for Linear Collider detector. The
main physics interest is the study of Higgs production and properties through
quark tagging and the physics at the top-antitop threshold.&lt;br/&gt;
