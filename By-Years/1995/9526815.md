James Skinner is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program to continue his theoretical work on spectroscopy and
relaxation in liquids and glasses. Studies are proposed in three major areas: 1)
spectral diffusion of individual molecules in glasses; 2) ultrafast solvation
dynamics in liquids; and 3) vibrational relaxation in liquids. A combination of
formal theory and simulations is used to interpret dynamical information
obtained from various spectral measurements obtained from fluorescence probes in
glasses and in solution. Amorphous solids or glasses have many important
technological applications. Optical spectroscopy of dilute flourescent compounds
has been used to probe the dynamics of glasses, and to obtain a better
understanding of the thermal properties for such systems. The dynamics of liquid
solvents plays an important role in many chemical and biological rate processes.
Solvent dynamics can also be probed spectroscopically using dilute solutions of
fluorescent compounds. Finally vibrational relaxation is intimately involved in
liquid-state chemical reaction dynamics. In order to predict reaction rates, one
therefore has to understand vibrational relaxation rates. Skinner will also be
studying vibrational relaxation processes in dilute solutions.
