This three-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research in
neuroendocrinology involves the research group of Yonathan Zohar of the United
States Air Force Academy and Sylvie Dufour of the Museum of Natural History in
Paris, France. The award provides travel and living expenses to Dr. Zohar, a
postdoctoral researcher, and a graduate student for short-term visits to France.
The objective of the research is to investigate the differential regulation of
two forms of Gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) present in teleost fish, the
European eel, and striped bass. This hormone produced in the brain is essential
for the control of reproduction in all vertebrates. In particular, the
investigators are interested in the differential roles of multiple GnRHs and
their involvement in reproduction in a single species. The project takes
advantage of the complementary expertise of the investigators and will advance
our understanding of the function of multiple GnRH in reproduction.
