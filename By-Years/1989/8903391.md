A program of experimental physics research that will establish a new technology
of light-element fluorescence analysis as the basis for improved industrial
process-control quantitative analysis is proposed. A successful Phase I project
provided evidence that powerful and efficient techniques for the x-ray
fluorescence analysis of low atomic-number elements are now made feasible by an
innovative wavelength-dispersive optical component known as the Layered
Synthetic Microstructure (LSM). Large-aperture figured LSM x-ray optical
components will enhance light-element fluorescence signal levels, by collection
and focussing of fluorescent radiation, and will provide effective wavelength
discrimination against continuum background radiation and competing
characteristic emissions. The challenges of Phase II research are to develop
techniques for construction of optimum LSM superlattice structures, to perfect
methods for supersmoothing of figured optic substrates, and to evaluate
experimentally the analysis precision, reproducibility and rapidity provided by
the innovation technology.
