Investigations of nonlinear phenomena in ferromagnetic thin films. Magnetic
resonance at high powers leads to a rich variety of nonlinear dynamical
processes such as regular oscillations, period multiplication, irregular period
oscillations, intermittency, chaos, and periodic windows. Analytically, a
microscopic Hamiltonian including nonlinear interactions is applicable, from
which equations of motion can be obtained. Thin magnetic garnet films represent
one of the best systems for the evaluation of nonlinear processes in magnetic
materials.
