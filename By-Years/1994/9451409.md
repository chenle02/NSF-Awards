9451409 Pastorek The new spectrofluorometric system will be used to demonstrate
both applied and fundamental applications of luminescence spectrometry in
undergraduate chemistry laboratory projects. This addition will make it possible
for us to offer our students more diverse choices for open-ended special
experiments dealing with the analysis of real samples. For example, they may
chose to analyze environmental pollutants in natural waters, pigments in foods,
and vitamins in blood, for analytes that are not well suited for absorption
spectrometry. Students from applied chemistry areas, such as, food science,
pharmacy, and agriculture taking Instrumental Analysis stand to gain a new
regularly scheduled experiment that would capture the flavor of a real sample
analysis. Chemistry majors in the "Integrated Laboratory" course will have the
opportunity to use a modern spectrometer fitted with a low temperature cell for
the study of the excitation, phosphorescence emission, and lifetime for a
variety of substituted benzophenones they have individually synthesized in the
laboratory.
