The goal of this project is to establish a long term academic/industrial
program in manufacturing and standards development, that will assist in the
development and transformation of the former Soviet Union (F.S.U.) as well as
promote United States industrial growth in the F.S.U. This effort will have
United States researchers analyzing processes and procedures, numerically
controlled programming standards, and production processes of the Moscow
Aviation Institute (M.A.I.). It will be coordinated with efforts at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Institute for Manufacturing and
Automation Research at the University of Southern California. The initial work
will be done in Moscow in partnership with Russian counterparts. The
counterparts (funded by M.A.I.) will then come to the United States to continue
on the same project.
