The chemistry of 1,3-silametallacycles of the early transition metals will be
studied in order to increase our understanding of metal-assisted carbon-carbon
bond forming reactions and intramolecular rearrangements. Three main areas will
be explored: 1) mechanistic studies of carbon monoxide and iso- nitrile
insertions and rearrangements, 2) the use of these stabilized
metallacyclobutanes to access cationic zirconium complexes for Ziegler-Natta
polymerization, and 3) the develop- ment of synthetic organic methodologies
based on metallacyclic enolates. Mechanistic, synthetic, structural, and
spectroscopic studies will be augmented with molecular orbital calculations. %%%
In this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organo- metallic Program of
the Chemistry Division, Dr. Jeffrey L. Peterson of West Virginia University will
use early transition metals to effect the formation of new carbon-carbon bonds.
The results may have relevance to practical methods of forming more complex and
useful organic molecules from cheap, simpler molecules such as carbon monoxide.
