We will explore in this EAGER proposal new methodologies for matching algorithms
and code to architecture, allowing the efficient execution of large complex
workflows using an ensemble of available computing architectures ranging from
distributed memory multi-core supercomputers to graphic processing units and
high performance data intensive computing devices. In this exploratory work we
will focus on the matching of computer architectures to computational needs and
a tuning of the methodology of Uncertainty Quantification to the architectures
at hand. We will first instrument our suite of tools to record computational,
memory, data and energy usage. This data will then be analyzed and modeled to
create guidelines for prediction of effective and efficient usage. The
facilities available to us at the University at Buffalo, Center for Computation
Research (CCR) and on the xD framework of resource providers will allow us to
conduct this investigation.
