The Computing Research Association (CRA) will manage the Computer and
Information Science and Engineering (CISE) Graduate Fellowship (CSGrad4US)
Program with the aim of increasing the number and diversity of domestic graduate
students pursuing research and innovation careers in the CISE fields. Many
undergraduate degree recipients have outstanding job opportunities in industry
and at other organizations, and only a small fraction of these individuals
considers pursuing a computing-related doctoral degree program. The CSGrad4US
Fellowship provides an opportunity for bachelor’s degree holders who may be
working in industry or other sectors to return to academia and pursue research-
based doctoral degrees in a CISE field. This program has the potential to impact
the domestic CISE PhD pipeline and production by providing the monetary
incentives and the supports for people to successfully apply and persist in a
doctoral program. The program strongly encourages people from groups that are
underrepresented in computing to apply. The evaluation will provide insight into
the characteristics of pathways into and through PhD programs for individuals
returning from the workforce, including a model of mentoring and professional
development that can be used to support a more diverse, domestic student
population.



Building upon past experience with the CSGrad4US Mentoring Program and Computing
Innovation Fellows, CRA will administer all phases of the CSGrad4US Fellowship
including: outreach and recruitment of potential applicants; facilitating the
fellowship application process; identifying reviewers and conducting panel
reviews; selecting applicants according to program goals, running a mentoring
program for participants starting with the application process and going
throughout the PhD program; making awards to CSGrad4US institutions of higher
education; conducting ongoing evaluation to assess outcomes and track
participants, and disseminating the findings. CSGrad4US includes providing up to
70 selected individuals each year mentored preparation, followed by three years
of fellowship support for graduate study that leads to a research-based doctoral
degree in a CISE discipline at an accredited doctoral degree-granting
institution of higher education having a campus located in the United States,
its territories or possessions, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. This project
builds upon the lessons learned from the CSGrad4US Mentoring Program developed
by CRA’s Committees on Education (CRA-E) and Widening Participation (CRA-WP).

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
