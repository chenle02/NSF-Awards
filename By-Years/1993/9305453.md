9305453 Southworth In flowering plants, the process of fertilization underlies
production of seeds and fruits. Although the structural events of double
fertilization have been described, little is known about the molecular
mechanisms of fertilization. Plant sperm are embedded in pollen grains and move
down the growing pollen tubes. Near the egg, the pollen tube releases two sperm:
one fuses with the egg to form the embryo, the other fuses with the central cell
adjacent to the egg to form the endosperm that supports growth of the developing
embryo. A major unanswered question in plant reproduction is how the sperm
recognizes the egg or central cell, adheres to it, and fuses with it.
Recognition molecules may be in or on gamete membranes. Monoclonal antibodies to
sperm cell surfaces are the first step in identifying unique sperm molecules.
The goals of this project are (1) to identify unique sperm membrane molecules by
screening monoclonal antibodies to isolated plant sperm cells and (2) to involve
undergraduates in a pioneering research project. The antibodies will be obtained
from fusions of splenocyte of mice immunized with sperm cells from Brassica. The
results will further our knowledge of basic developmental mechanisms that
function in plant reproduction and will lead to a basic understanding of
fertility and sterility in plants. Such information can be used to produce
hybrids from incompatible species and inhibit fertilization where male sterility
is required to prevent self-crossing. Undergraduate students will gain valuable
insight into active research by solving problems and assisting in attainment of
goals. The research experience will facilitate their development as scientists.
