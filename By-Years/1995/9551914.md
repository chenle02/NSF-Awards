This project is developing a modern, fully-equipped, undergraduate lab in the
critical cross-disciplinary area of Particulate Systems Engineering. This lab
forms the basis for an undergraduate lab course, serving approximately 40
students each year, taught in conjunction with the course, "Particulate Systems
Engineering" (ENGR 379), offered through the Particulate Systems Research
Center. This lab course is expanding and enhancing a successful undergraduate
program in this area which has included the nurturing of over 70 talented
undergraduates through a previous NSF grant. Accurate measurement and prediction
of particulate properties are important to the science and technologies
associated with global warming, ozone layer depletion, indoor and outdoor air
pollution, combustion, micro-contamination control, nanophase and materials
manufacturing, sensor and fiber optic fabrication, reduced production and
cleanup of hazardous wastes, and nuclear reactor safety. This importance is
emphasized by the fact that over 70 percent of DuPont products are in
particulate form, and that the nation's research agencies initiatives in global
warming, air quality, and nanophase manufacturing. Equipment used in this
project falls into three categories: aerosol generation, aerosol classification,
and analytical lasers. In combination with the substantial equipment already in
place, this new equipment allows undergraduate students to participate in an
intensive laboratory course that includes experiments designed to measure
particle distributions, characterize aerosol particles, study aerosol dynamics
and reaction chemistry, study specific aerosol applications, and study and
compare different aerosol measurement and generation techniques.
