ABSTRACT PI: Holekamp Proposal Number IBN96-30667: The evolution of
intelligence in response to social complexity The primary purpose of this
research is to examine predictions of an hypothesis suggesting that the
evolution of intelligence in mammals has been driven by selection pressures
associated with life in a complex social environment. If this hypothesis is
correct, then some or all of the impressive cognitive abilities observed in
primates should also occur in non-primate mammals living in primate-like
societies. Spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta) are large carnivores that live in
social groups like those of old-world monkeys. Thus the social complexity
hypothesis predicts that spotted hyenas should possess many or all of the same
features of social intelligence as do these primates. Here we propose to
determine what spotted hyenas know about their social worlds, how they use this
knowledge, and how it differs from that described for monkeys by earlier
workers. Subject animals are members of one large hyena clan in Kenya. Age, sex,
kin relations, and social status are known for all natal animals, and most adult
clan members wear radio collars so they can be regularly relocated and observed.
Using videotaped responses of hyena subjects to playbacks of recorded
vocalizations, we will determine whether hyenas, like monkeys, can discriminate
among conspecific vocalizations based on group membership, kinship, and
association patterns. A secondary goal of this research is to continue on-going
work on hormone-behavior relationships in free- living hyenas, and to supplement
this with preliminary analyses of patterns of variation in their immune system
function. This research will generate three types of useful information: it will
(1) elucidate the functions of animal intelligence in the natural habitat, as
well as the selection pressures favoring its evolution, (2) yield rare data
documenting the extent of variation in disease exposure and immunocompetence
among wild animals, and (3) enhance understanding of carnivore social behavior
and immunocompetence to facilitate decision-making by wildlife managers and
others concerned with biodiversity and conservation of African ecosystems.
