in robotics, vision systems, local area networks, programmable controllers,
programming of CNC machines, troubleshooting individual systems, and every
aspect of computer integrated manufacturing. The student will see and work with
real world applications, making them more attractive and valuable employees to
industry. The center will also be a resource for the Drafting and Design and the
