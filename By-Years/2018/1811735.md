High-dimensional random structures arise throughout mathematics and its
applications. Many classical problems of probability theory are devoted to
understanding the patterns that are generated by random noise in high-
dimensional systems. For example, suppose one has a large matrix each of whose
entries is the outcome of an independent fair coin flip, i.e., the matrix is
filled with noise. What do the eigenvalues of such a matrix look like? Such
questions have beautiful answers that are now well understood. There are however
many situations, both in pure and in applied mathematics, in which there is
nontrivial structure underneath the noise. For example, in the random matrix
problem, we could allow each entry to have an arbitrary variance that reflects
the intensity of the corresponding variable. The challenge in such problems,
which are much less well understood than their classical counterparts, is to
capture the interplay between the structure and the noise. The aim of this
project is to develop mathematical techniques that make it possible to address
such questions in considerable generality. Beside their fundamental interest,
such techniques are expected to be applicable to areas such as statistics and
computer science where high-dimensional random structures play an important
role. Several education and outreach activities further form a key part of this
project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overarching goal of this project is to develop
new mechanisms and techniques in high-dimensional probability to address
problems that could be broadly characterized as having nonhomogeneous structure.
The fundamental question in such problems is: how is the underlying geometric
structure reflected in the probabilistic behavior of the model? Such questions
are of significant importance in various pure and applied mathematical problems.
This project aims to systematically investigate such problems that arise in
three interrelated themes: (i) the norms of nonhomogeneous random matrices (for
example, with arbitrary variance or sparsity pattern); (ii) the geometry of
nonhomogeneous random processes (such as those that arise, for example, in
random matrix theory or in functional analysis); (iii) geometric inequalities
and dimension-free phenomena (for example, in connection with measure
concentration or convexity). The project will leverage recent advances on these
topics to push forward the state-of-the-art in this area of probability and its
applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
