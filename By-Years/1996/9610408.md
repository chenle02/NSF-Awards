9610408 Tsukruk Engineering of self-organized molecular films that potentially
have tribological applications will be attempted by a combination of self-
assembly, chemical binding to the surface, and Langmuir-Blodgett transfer.
Emphasis will be on very thin films that are expected to have good boundary
lubricating properties for MEMS and similar applications, and on films that
could serve as "markers" of actual contact area and sites, initial deformation
in sliding, and other elusive contact phenomena. ***
