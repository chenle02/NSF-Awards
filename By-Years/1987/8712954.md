The Research Experience for Undergraduates program was formed by the National
Science Foundation to provide opportunities for undergraduates to perform
research under the guidance of established researchers. It is hoped that they
will find the experience rewarding, and will be attracted to careers in
research. Two types of awards are supported: site grants, and supplements to
existing research awards. This is a site grant, in which the University of
California - Berkeley will use the NSF REU award to add four students to its
existing minority-oriented academic assistance program. The Computer-
Communication Networks Program currently has sixteen students led by three
professors. Projects will include development of hardware or software tools for
designing and evaluating communication networks.
