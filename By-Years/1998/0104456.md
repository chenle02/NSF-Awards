Dr. Hooper is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship
to carry out a program of research, education, and public outreach at the
University of Texas at Austin. His research focuses on understanding the
phenomenon of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) by constructing a sample that is
broadly representative and fully characterized. He will obtain spectroscopy for
source characterization and the determination of multi-epoch luminosity
functions of a subsample of objects observed with the Chandra X-ray telescope.
The resulting sample will incorporate most known AGN types and include
previously hidden populations. Dr. Hooper's educational activities will include
participation in a science teacher training program, known as UTeach, being
developed at the University. He plans to offer an upper-division course on
research methods which is aimed at synthesizing the students' previous course
work and developing independent problem solving skills. ***
