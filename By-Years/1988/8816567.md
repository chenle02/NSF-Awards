Most of the knowledge about the behavior, ecology and population dynamics of
Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii) comes from research conducted in the
austral spring and summer. This study addresses the overwinter movements and
diving behavior of adult seals near McMurdo Sound, Antarctica. The project will
rely on satellite-linked time-depth recorders attached to the seals, giving
periodic location and summaries of dive durations and depths from seals that
haul out on ice or beaches. The habitual return by the seals offers the
opportunity to recover the satellite time-depth recorders and a twenty-year
population study provides the population background for the study. This will
result in a better understanding of age related differences in important
behavioral traits that may explain demographic features and selective pressure
on the life history of Weddell seals and by extension, that of other large
mammals.
