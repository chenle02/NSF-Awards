This project will upgrade the operating systems and hardware of the IBM PS/2
computers of the Department of Atmospheric Science at the University of Wyoming
to allow PC-McIDAS to be integrated into the department's network environment.
This will allow the wider diversity of data ingested by the UNIDATA SDM software
to be viewed using the more comprehensive display software and looping
capability of PC-McIDAS. It will also allow McIDAS data to be archived on the
larger disks and on tape on our Apollo network. PC-McIDAS is used extensively
for both educational and research activities. It has enhanced the teaching of
synoptic meteorology courses offered in the department, allowing the student to
interactively analyze meteorological data. It is also being used to assist the
training of Saudi Arabian meteorologists participating in a special training
program set up within the department. PC-McIDAS is routinely taken into the
field to provide forecasting support for the department's research aircraft.
