NSF has made an award to support travel costs and registration fees for 6
workshop speakers and registration fees for 24 trainees and 5 young faculty
members who will attend the three-day Regenerative Medicine Workshop at Hilton
Head being held March 16-19, 2016, on Hilton Head Island, SC. The workshop, part
of a series that began in 1996, brings together national and international
regenerative medicine experts from a variety of engineering and scientific
disciplines in a small conference setting to effectively convey knowledge,
stimulate new ideas critical to advancing the development of regenerative
medicine applications and therapies and promote research collaborations. This
year's workshop will focus on the theme of regenerative medicine discoveries,
technologies and translation. Conference session topics include: Translation of
cellular therapies, Immunoengineering, Controlling stem cell fate, Regeneration
of cardiovascular tissues, Synthetic biomaterials, Arthritis and tissue
regeneration and Tissue engineering and personalized medicine.
