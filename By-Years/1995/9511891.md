The core of Optimality Theory (OT) lies in these ideas: Constraints are
universal. Constraints can be violated. Grammars are rankings of constraints.
The optimal form from among the set of competing candidates is grammatical, all
non-optimal candidates are ungrammatical. An optimal output form for a given
input is selected from among the class of competitors in the following way: A
form which, for every pairwise competition involving it, best satisfies the
highest-ranking constraint on which the competitors conflict, is "optimal". OT,
while originally developed for phonological analysis, is a general theory of
constraint interaction, and several recent pieces of research suggest that it
extends in interesting ways to the domain of syntax. The research described in
this proposal builds upon this earlier work, and addresses two fundamental
questions concerning syntactic theory which can be addressed under OT
assumptions in ways which differ significantly from prior approaches. The first
question concerns the relationship between the syntax of a language and its
lexicon. The position is often taken that the lexicon of a language determines
its syntax. Indeed it has been asserted that all grammatical variation among
languages is reducible to lexical differences. The current project takes a
different line, and aims to show that many grammatically significant lexical
properties of languages (perhaps all?) can be derived from their grammars, i.e.
from the ranking of universal constraints which constitutes their grammars. The
second question concerns the universality of constraints, a question that is
clearly tied in a central way to the idea of constraint violability. The core
hypothesis of OT is that every constraint is present in the grammar of every
language. This contrasts sharply with the view that constraints vary
"parametrically"; a view in which the form a constraint takes in one language
need not be the same in all. The project research focuses strongly on the
predictions and problems raised by this hypothesis about universal grammar
