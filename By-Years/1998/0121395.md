This research examines electronic market mechanisms as a means of coordination
and communication in the industrial supply chain. The research focuses on two
main components: (1) innovative market mechanisms (exploring the theoretical and
computational foundations for electronic market intermediaries in the supply
chain, thereby deriving market mechanisms beyond price determination to include
activity, resource, and structural coordination), and (2) focused industry
survey (understanding the economic realities and key development trends in the
industry by conducting in-depth field studies and empirical analyses). Insights
developed from the research will lead to the development of efficient market
mechanisms for supply chain coordination, and versatile market analysis tools.

This research will extend the current literature in market microstructures,
mechanism design, and supply chain coordination by (1) exploring the synergy
between game theory, optimization, and computational economics approaches, (2)
examining the roles of intermediaries in emerging supply chain markets, and
their implications to market efficiency, and (3) suggesting engineering
methodologies that convert market insights into implementable market instruments
(e.g., contracts, protocols) and monitoring tools. The industry survey, to be
conducted with McKinsey & Company, will document and classify emerging e-supply
chain practices, and identify key issues relating to supply chain strategy in
different industry sectors.
