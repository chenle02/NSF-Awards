ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wax,
Adam&lt;br/&gt;1604562&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will develop novel
optical methods for visualizing mechanical stresses in live cells. They will
study the mechanics at the subcellular level to understand transduction of
mechanical stresses and the roles of key proteins in both focal adhesion and the
cell cortex.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key technical advance this project will
pursue is to incorporate FRET (Forster resonance energy transfer)-based tension
sensors into the current quantitative phase imaging platform. Tension sensors
were developed by incorporating two fluorophores into load-bearing proteins.
Traditionally dynamic loading has required indirect measures and complex
devices. The proposed platform will be able to directly visualize cell stresses
and to do so without mechanically displacing the cell. Further technical
advances will develop FRET sensors for a load-bearing protein in the cell cortex
to enable simple, reproducible loading of cells while preserving imaging
capabilities.
