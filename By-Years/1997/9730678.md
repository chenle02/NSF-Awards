9730678 Marchetti Theoretical research will be conducted with the goal of
understanding the dynamical properties of various spatially extended condensed
matter systems. A major part of the research focusses on the nonequilibrium
dynamics of periodic media driven through disorder. Examples of such systems
include flux lattices in type-II superconductors, charge density waves in
anisotropic conductors and the magnetically- induced Wigner crystal in a two-
dimensional electron gas. As revealed by recent experiments, the interplay of
interaction, disorder and drive results in a complex dynamics that is poorly
understood. The main goals of this work are to develop a theoretical framework
for the description of these nonequilibrium systems and to map out their
nonequilibrium phase diagrams. Closely related problems that will also be
investigated arise in microscopic models of friction and lubrication. One
important difference is that inertial terms, negligible for overdamped systems
such as flux lattices, may be important in this case and change the nature of
the sliding state. A key objective is to understand the relative importance of
surface roughness and bulk elasticity in yielding dissipation. Another effort
more directly continues past research on flux- line arrays in type-II
superconductors. The focus is on the physical consequences of entanglement and
longtudinal correlations which are probed experimentally by magnetization
measurements and transport experiments. Both analytical work, aiming at a two-
fluid hydrodynamics capable of describing both entangled and disentangled
components of flux liquid, and numerical work, addressing the stability of the
transverse Meissner effect against point disorder, are described. %%%
Theoretical research will be conducted on a class of problems which describe the
behavior of the high temperature superconductors. These type of problems are
very common and the results will also impact studies of friction, charge
transport in periodic media and novel phases at low temperatues. ***
