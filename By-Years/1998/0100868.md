Salmon&lt;br/&gt;OCE-100868&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lattice-Boltzmann techniques
are simple, stable, and conducive to massive parallelization, but 'inflexible'.
With effort, they can be made more flexible. The PI proposes to continue his
efforts in this regard. He has developed a square, flat-bottomed ocean model
using the shallow water equations and the quasi-geostrophic equations. He will
derive the formulae for a Lattice-Boltzmann primitive equation model on
spherical coordinates. He will also develop balanced versions of the Lattice-
Boltzmann model.&lt;br/&gt;
