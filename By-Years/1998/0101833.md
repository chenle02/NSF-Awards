CCR-0101833&lt;br/&gt;Mili&lt;br/&gt;Univ of Texas - Dallas&lt;br/&gt;SGER:
Using NLP Tools for Requirements
Visualization&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Creating,
understanding, and formalizing requirements are major hurdles in system
development. Inherent ambiguity in natural language makes requirements documents
difficult to interpret and maintain, while formal specification methods are
unacceptable to many stakeholders. This project intends to demonstrate the
feasibility of using natural language processing (NLP) tools to analyze informal
descriptions of software requirements for the purpose of generating semi-formal
and formal descriptions, analyzing them, and automatically maintaining
interdependencies between textual, graphical, and formal representations. The
chosen NLP tool is the Ergo parser of Bralich and Bickerton, one that is capable
of full analysis of English grammar and syntax and of engaging in
question/answer and statement/response repartee in real time. The project
explores a variety of grammatical and writing styles to establish guidelines for
useful documents; analyzes synonymous English styles to establish dependency
grids; and creates and integrates interfaces with other program
functions.&lt;br/&gt;
