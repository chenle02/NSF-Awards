This four-year Teacher Enhancement Renewal and Retention project will prepare
180 experienced teachers to be mentors for 360 novice science, mathematics and
technology teachers. Over a span of three years each novice teacher will receive
a minimum of 150 hours mentoring. The phased mentoring plan has each mentor
teacher mentoring one novice teacher the first year, two the second year and
three the third year. Mentors are supported by project personnel, their local
districts and for travel to professional meetings to participate in the larger
professional learning community of mentor teachers. The novice teachers receive
the mentoring support plus educational materials and local district support. The
project emphasizes a rigorous content-focused professional development (PD)
curriculum, dictated in part by hiring practices that employ teachers who have
not fully met state licensing standards. PD opportunities will be delivered
through summer institutes and statewide conferences. Of the teachers who are
supported directly by the project, 180 will serve as district and statewide
content mentors for the states of Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont.
