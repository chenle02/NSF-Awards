9505661 Blaine This award provides support for the planning and preliminary
design of a world virus database. The planning and preliminary design will be
pursued by experimentation with current standards and newly developed guidelines
for biological database interoperability to support the design of a World Virus
Database (ICTVdB). The International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses
(ICTV), a standing committee of the Virology division of the International Union
of Microbiological Studies, is charged with establishing, maintaining and
disseminating information on a universal system for virus taxonomy. Such a
system can used to address questions in systematics, comparative biology and
ecology. Database structural design, data collection, and dissemination methods
will be explored in close collaboration with other major biological database
producers to implement concepts recommended by an emerging federation of
database providers. Development of the ICTVdB, because of its interdisciplinary
interest and close links to genetic sequence data, can provide a model for the
design, testing and modification of software tools for database
interoperability.
