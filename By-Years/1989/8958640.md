This research is concerned primarily with development and application of
theoretical, computer simulation, and experimental techniques for the study of a
broad range of physical properties of complex systems. There are currently three
main areas of interest: computer simulation methodologies for prediction of
phase transitions; properties of micellar systems; and stability of
biomacromolecules. Advances in supercomputer technology are revolutionizing the
chemical sciences. As new levels of computational power are reached, new levels
of predictive capability become imaginable. This research will constitute a
leading edge in the ability of scientists and engineers to predict and to
control the macroscopic properties of matter from a knowledge of the molecular
structure of the molecules. >____________________________> >____________>
