Operational weather forecast models show little skill at predicting regime
transitions such as the onset or dissipation of "blocking events" (when large
scale weather patterns remain locked in large amplitude waves) even a day or two
in advance. Moreover, this deficiency accounts for much of the loss of skill in
dynamical forecasts in the 30-day range. Dr. Mak and colleagues will investigate
the role and evolution of heat sources (radiation, condensation, and surface
heating and cooling) in blocking events as well as how high frequency
disturbances (storms) affect vertical circulation patterns in the troposphere on
the intraseasonal scale. They hope to clarify the quantitative contributions of
these processes, and to delineate their relative importance in regime
transitions. The dramatic blocking event of the winter of 1985-86 (which caused
a record cold February in Europe) will be the focus of the diagnostic studies.
The results obtained in this project should serve as an important contribution
to community efforts to improve the skill of extended-range forecasts.
