The objective of the research is to explore new active electronic device
architectures, such as Field Effect Transistors and new, room temperature
fabrication routes for such devices. The devices incorporate a random network of
carbon nanotubes as the conducting channel. Due to the high electron and hole
mobility associated with carbon nanotubes, the architecture leads to high device
mobilities, excellent mechanical properties, together with robustness, and fault
tolerance. Initial studies indicate that the devices have performance superior
to alternative device architectures, such as organic transistors. The approach
for the fabrication process includes the solubilization of nanotubes by various
agents, nanotube deposition and subsequent removal of the agents. This room
temperature process allows integration of nanotube networks to a variety of
surfaces, is compatible with standard silicon fabrication and can also be
integrated into plastic materials. The devices will also allow the exploration
of a range of physics issues such as the nature of electron states in one and in
restricted dimensions and percolation in a two dimensional random network.

The research will have, potentially major impact in the area called flexible
electronics with possible applications in areas including displays, radio
frequency identification tags and printable Integrated Circuits. The research
will be conducted by graduate students from different Departments, and it
involves device design, fabrication and interrogation. Subjecting graduate
students to an interdisciplinary environment, and to a project that has
significant application potential will generate a knowledge base critically
needed in the country.
