This project addresses the lessons learned from the 17 October 1989 Northern
California (Loma Prieta) earthquake. It follows a "quick response" award made to
Dames and Moore for the collection of perishable data from the earthquake. The
Loma Prieta earthquake affected the performance of virtually every type of
lifeline in the San Francisco Bay Area, including natural gas systems. Natural
gas systems were severely affected in areas of significant ground failure, such
as in the Marina district, where several large fires erupted after the initial
ground shock. There was concern that uncontrolled fires would be fueled by gas
leaks in the area. Fortunately, the fires were contained by utilizing several
alternative water sources. The aim of this project is to study the effects of
the earthquake on local natural gas systems. Specifically it analyzes the data
collected as part of the "quick response" award, in order to develop better
seismic risk evaluation models for natural gas systems, and to determine whether
existing safety devices, such as seismic shutoff valves, are a feasible solution
for mitigating overall earthquake losses. An analysis of these data builds upon
limited studies which already exist for these systems. A comparison of
performance data from this event to similar data from the 1971 San Fernando and
the 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquakes is critical in order to quantify
differences in performance due to regional factors and level of earthquake
preparedness.
