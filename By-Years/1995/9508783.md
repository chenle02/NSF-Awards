9508783 Pinson This award supports a one year postdoctoral fellowship for Dr.
Haru Pinson to study with Professor T. Miwa, an expert on statistical mechanics
at the Research Institute for Mathematical Sciences at Kyoto University and
Professor Kashiwara also of Kyoto University. Dr. Pinson will study the
differential equation aspect of two dimensional statistical mechanics on various
topics including the Ising model at criticality on Riemann surfaces. Dr. Pinson
has derived differential equations on various statistical systems using
conformal field theory. Professor Miwa and his collaborators have also used
differential equations to study statistical systems but from a completely
different approach. Thus, the fellowship will enable Dr. Pinson to study and
combine the two different techniques to gain a deeper understanding of two
dimensional critical statistical systems. ***
