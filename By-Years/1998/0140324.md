This proposal will provide for continuing research at the Nuclear Structure
&lt;br/&gt;Laboratory (NSL) of the University of Notre Dame for a period of
three &lt;br/&gt;years. Research at the NSL is based on a broad program in low
energy &lt;br/&gt;nuclear physics and includes studies of nuclear reactions,
structure, &lt;br/&gt;dynamics, and fundamental symmetries spanning the
subfields of Nuclear &lt;br/&gt;Astrophysics, Weak Interactions and Fundamental
Symmetries, Nuclear &lt;br/&gt;Structure, and studies of Nuclear Reactions with
Radioactive Ion Beams &lt;br/&gt;(RIBs). This proposal represents a growing
trend towards a more cohesive &lt;br/&gt;and synergistic research program as our
interests coalesce in the area of &lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Astrophysics. We are
enthusiastic about future developments in low &lt;br/&gt;energy physics with the
proposed construction of the rare isotope &lt;br/&gt;accelerator RIA. Our
funding request includes the support of three &lt;br/&gt;accelerators (JN, KN,
and FN) and various new developments in detectors, &lt;br/&gt;ion sources, and
new systems for fast transport of radioactive materials. &lt;br/&gt;While the
scientific output of the NSL and its impact to low-energy nuclear
&lt;br/&gt;physics has been tremendous, the most important part of our mission
is &lt;br/&gt;education. The obvious impact to Technology transfer via our
education &lt;br/&gt;mission has been substantial. Typically, 9 Ph.D. are
awarded in a given &lt;br/&gt;three year period. The Nuclear Structure
Laboratory is a national and an &lt;br/&gt;international resource with a lively
user program from 14 US facilities &lt;br/&gt;including universities and
national laboratories, 11 foreign countries, and &lt;br/&gt;I industrial
laboratory.
