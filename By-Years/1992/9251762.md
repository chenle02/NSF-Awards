The aim of the project is the enhancement of the recombinant DNA lab experience
for undergraduate women in the biology department. Funds are requested for the
purchase of four instrumentation units to meet the needs of the development
plan: (1) A DNA thermal cycler will be used to select and amplify a specific
eukaryotic gene from a eukaryotic cDNA library by polymerase chain reaction
(PCR). (2) A minifluorimeter will be utilized for accurate DNA concentration
determinations. (3) An electroporation system will allow efficient
transformation of bacteria with cloned DNA in an expression vector. (4) A mini
electrophoresis system will be used to perform electrophoresis of proteins and
subsequent Western blotting to detect specific proteins immunologically.
