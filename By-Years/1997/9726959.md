Richey 9726959 This is a 12-month award proposed Drs. Jeffrey Richey and Marc
Hershman, the University of Washington, collaborating with Mr. Tolentino Moya,
Mr. Anond Snidvongs, and Mr. Jariya Boonjawaat of the Asian Region of the
International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme. Dr. Jeffrey Richey requests funds
to support one post-doctoral student and one graduate student and travel support
to put together network based virtual workshops. The purpose of these workshops
is to advance the application of an integrated regional river basin model for
the East Asia and the Pacific Region. These workshops will use a customized
Internet-based communication system to link the existing sites and institutions
under the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) and sister
organizations in the Asia- Pacific. The project uses new communication tools for
carrying out international modeling study and conducting virtual workshops
through Internet, and provides opportunities for U.S. students to work with
their Asian counterparts through the Internet.
