9713977 Young This grant supports the continuing work of a senior PI,
distinguished for his significant contributions to the numerical analysis of
several problems in statistical mechanics. In the present grant he is planning
to conduct theoretical studies of quantum phase transitions in random magnetic
systems. These problems can be solved using sophisticated, state-of-the-art
numerical techniques. The principal objectives are to: (1) search for universal
critical behavior at the quantum transition and (2) to investigate the
characteristic paramagnetic phase singularities, called the Griffiths-McCoy
singularities. %%% Most phase transitions are classical, i.e. the phase
transitions takes place at temperatures which are high compared to when the
quantum mechanical effects become important in a given system. And yet, the
transition temperatures can be reduced by introduction of disorder. Given the
ease in studying material properties at low temperatures, it is conceivable that
novel transitions may be strongly quantum in nature. The combination of quantum
and disorder provides a framework which is both complex and has not been studied
well before. This senior PI plans to carry out a numerical study, to lead to an
understanding of what to expect in a quantum phase transition in the presence of
strong disorder. ***
