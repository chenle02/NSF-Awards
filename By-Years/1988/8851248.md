This project permits technology students to study Very Large Scale Integrated
(VLSI) circuits using programmable gate array technology. Since programmable
gate array devices do not require customized manufacturing, the need for long
design cycles and costly integrated circuit fabrication facilities are
eliminated. These features make is possible for students to pefect complicated
designs in little time at small expense. The laboratory supporting this project
includes the Xilinx development system, simulator and emulator running on a
colection of eight PC's. This award is being matched by an equal sum from the
grantee.
