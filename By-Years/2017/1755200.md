The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is that the
project facilitate the design and operation of electromagnetic telemetry for
underground wireless communication in oilfield measurement-while-drilling (MWD)
and logging-while-drilling (LWD). The performance of an electromagnetic
telemetry system is heavily dependent on electrical properties of the
underground formation, as well as the deployment of downhole and surface
antennas. Rigorous electromagnetic full wave simulations are critical in design,
development, and deployment of an electromagnetic telemetry system for a
drilling job. The modeling software package will potentially be the first
product on the market with the capability of providing efficient 3D simulations
of electromagnetic telemetry systems in complicated underground environments.
Besides the oil and gas industry, electromagnetic telemetry can also be used in
other important areas such as CO2 sequestration, deep borehole disposal of
nuclear waste, and geothermal energy exploration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
I-Corps project explores the market potential of a 3D electromagnetic telemetry
modeling tool for the oil and gas industry and other areas involving drilling
activities. A realistic electromagnetic telemetry system is an extremely
multiscale structure, and rigorously modeling such a system is beyond the
capabilities of available commercial electromagnetic simulation tools. The
proposed product is based on the recent advancement of computational
electromagnetics algorithms using 3D integral equations with a novel coated thin
wire model to simulate the metallic drill string and borehole environment in
layered formation. The product as a modeling software can be several orders more
accurate than existing commercial simulation tools for the analysis of
electromagnetic telemetry systems. The goal of this I-Corps team is to
investigate the market potential of this technology and related product in the
oilfield and other relevant applicable areas.
