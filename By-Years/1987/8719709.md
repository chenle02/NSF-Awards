This grant from the Chemical Instrumentation Program will be used to purchase a
high-speed transient digitizer. The instrument will be used to collect data over
very short time periods on high energy (excited state) molecules which are
produced as the result of the absorption of light from a laser and which persist
for less than a microsecond. An understanding of the properties of such species
is important in chemical processes related to solar energy conversion. The
instrumentation will be used primarily in studies of the photophysics of mixed-
metal and oligimer complexes. It will be used to determine excited state
lifetimes, activation energies, and transient decay spectra of excited state
complexes.
