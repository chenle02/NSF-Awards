9507577 Weertman This U.S.-Mexico award will support Prof. Julia Weertman of
Lorthwestern University in a research collaboration with Profs. Jorge Cabanas
Moreno and Hector Calderon Benavides of the Instituto Politecnico Nacional (IPN)
in Mexico City, for research on the mechanical behavior and characterization of
nanocrystalline metals, and the kinetics of coarsening of coherent particles in
nickel and iron-based alloys. In studying the mechanical properties and internal
structure of nanocrystalline metals, samples will be prepared by mechanical
alloying/mechanical milling and two other synthesis routes. Thus the influence
of preparation method on properties and grain boundary behavior will be
examined. The coarsening behavior of coherent particles in metal alloys will be
studied as a function of lattice mismatch in samples containing bimodal particle
distributions. The proposed research collaboration will benefit from the
extensive experience at Northwestern University on the mechanical properties and
internal structure of nanocrystalline materials and the synthesis and processing
routes followed by the Mexican side. This award will also facilitate the travel
of students, thus providing them with an international research experience early
in their careers. ***
