A short course is being offered during the summers of 1997 and 1998 focussing on
laser technology and its applications to solving chemical problems. The offering
consists of an eight day exposure to both the theory and practical applications
of lasers to all branches of chemistry. The course includes (1) lectures on the
fundamentals of lasers and related topics including their applications to
chemistry, (2) laboratory experiments done by all participants illustrating the
principles presented in the lectures, including the applications. A major
feature of these short courses is that the materials presented and experiments
done are directly transferable to the participant's home institution. All
aspects of the course are appropriate for inclusion in the undergraduate
curriculum.
