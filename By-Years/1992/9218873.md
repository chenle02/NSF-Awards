Investigations of Star Clusters. Star cluster research at Yerkes Observatory
primarily involves astrometric (proper motions) and photometric studies of
globular clusters, dwarf spheroidal galaxies, and a few open clusters. Proper
motions are used to derive cluster membership, study the internal dynamics of
the nearer clusters, and derive space velocities. High quality photometry is
normally obtained along with the astrometry to produce very clean color-
magnitude diagrams. In some globular clusters the proper motions are combined
with radial velocities obtained by Dr. Cudworth and others to further constrain
dynamical models and to derive distances with sufficient precision to provide a
useful new calibration of the globular cluster distance scale independent of
"standard candle" assumptions. Absolute proper motions and hence space
velocities are being determined for globulars and some dwarf spheroidal
galaxies. With an emphasis on space velocity derivations for very distant
globulars and dwarf speroidals, Dr. Cudworth will be able to place better
constrains on the mass of the Milky Way.
