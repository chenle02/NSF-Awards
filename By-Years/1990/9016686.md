This grant supports the continuation of an observational program to determine
the distances (parallaxes), the absolute magnitudes, and the proper motions of a
select sample of relatively nearby stars. The project has components based in
both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres with observations obtained from
telescopes located in Virginia and Australia. Data which are obtained from very
precise measurements of the positions, the motions, and the brightnesses of
nearby stars form the basis for the cosmic distance scale used by astronomers.
The long term astrometry program conducted by Drs. Ianna and Fredrick at the
University of Virginia provides an essential contribution to this fundamental
data base.
