Results from a four-year study to two chronic N-limited forests ecosystems at
the Harvard Forest have shown rapid changes in CH4 consumption, and the
initiation of pulse losses of N20. These have occurred in synchrony with changes
in N03, leaching losses, N03 and NH4 concentrations in soils, C02 efflux, and
foliar nitrogen chemistry. In this study, the principal investigators will
measure C0 consumption in these same systems, which they hypothesize will
respond analogously to CH4 consumption. The combined changes influxes of CH4,
C0) and N20 they expect to elicit, if representative of regional-scale responses
to chronic N deposition, would contribute significantly to altered atmospheric
chemistry and global climate. The PI's are well qualified to conduct this
research and the facilities are excellent.
