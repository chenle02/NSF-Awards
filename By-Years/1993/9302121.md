9302121 Yee This project is intended to place the investigator's airglow
spectrograph aboard the NCAR Electra. This will provide correlative airglow data
on the mesospheric airglow intensities and temperatures along with Na density
measurements, obtain their 1-D spatial and temporal spectra, and study the
gravity wave dynamics and its possible sources. Simultaneously, measurements can
be made on the airglow intensity and temperature with the sodium density to
understand the formation of sporadic Na layer. It will also be possible to
measure temperatures in the high latitude mesopause region in order to
understand the formation of noctilucent clouds. Finally, this will be an attempt
to study the geographic extent of the NLC display and its spectral
characteristics. ***
