This project develops a unique graduate seminar on the design and supervision of
undergraduate research projects in which graduate women across science,
mathematics and engineering (SME) disciplines will be educated about academic
and pedagogical issues related to undergraduate teaching and research design.
They will have direct experiences developing short research projects to be
carried out by undergraduates in a linked undergraduate course, Introduction to
Research. The projects will be developed by pairs of students from different
disciplines, will be in new or emerging SME fields and emphasize
interdisciplinary or applied collaborations. The graduate seminar/undergraduate
course represents an innovative model for teaching and research that connects
graduate and undergraduate education and emphasizes collaborative and
interactive learning. This model can be integrated readily into standard
university curriculum and has the potential to foster interactions with
industrial researchers that may lead to long-term associations.
