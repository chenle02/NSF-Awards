Number theory is one of the scientific backbones of modern digital technology
and has important applications in coding theory and cryptography. Beginning with
the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem in the 1990's, number theory entered a new
era, incorporating rich ideas and tools from other subjects, embracing rapidly-
developing mathematical software packages and databases, and building multi-
layer platforms and communities for collaborations. This research project
investigates modular forms, which are central objects in number theory that
occur throughout mathematics and physics. The work aims to broaden and deepen
understanding in this fundamental area. The investigator plans to widen the
impacts of the research program by continued mentoring of junior mathematicians
and organization of national and international workshops and conferences.

This project investigates the arithmetic of hypergeometric varieties and
noncongruence modular forms. A majority of modular forms are noncongruence in
the sense that their symmetry groups cannot be described in terms of
congruences. The link between the two topics of study is manifest by the fact
that all algebraic curves defined over number fields can be realized as modular
curves of finite index subgroups of the modular group. Modular forms are
arithmetic invariants of the modular curves. Among all algebraic curves, the
generalized Legendre curves are particularly amiable models for both theoretical
and computational investigations. Hypergeometric varieties are higher
dimensional analogues of the generalized Legendre curves. The objectives of this
research project are: (1) to translate a class of classical hypergeometric
formulas to the finite field setting; (2) to use these transformation formulas
to compute arithmetic invariants of the hypergeometric varieties; (3) to obtain
new automorphy results for Galois representations associated with noncongruence
modular forms based on explicit Galois representations arising from
hypergeometric varieties; and (4) to further investigate other properties of
noncongruence modular forms, including a longstanding unbounded denominator
conjecture.
