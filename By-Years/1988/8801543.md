This proposal focuses on specific applications of a statistical hypothesis
testing approach developed by the investigators and based on the Pearson
phi.squared distance measure. Targeted projects include tests for symmetry,
tests for equality of distributions for k samples and tests with ordered
categorical data. The investigators propose to work on several applications of a
general approach to statistical hypothesis testing that they developed. These
applications will extend the mathematical tools available to scientists for
determining natural differences and establishing the nature of such differences.
