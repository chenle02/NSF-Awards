Funds will provide travel grants to three American members of the Mid-
Carboniferous Boundary Working Group of the Subcommission on Carboniferous
Stratigraphy (SCCS) of the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS).
These grants will allow participation in a geological field conference organized
for the working group by the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, and the USSR
National Geological Committee. The meeting will be held September 20-29, 1988,
in Kiev and the Donets Basin (Donbass), eastern Ukrainia. The rock column in
this part of the Donets Basin is a strong candidate to become the mid-
Carboniferous boundary stratotype because it contains the appropriate boundary-
defining fossils in a seemingly continuous depositional sequence. Members of the
working group need first-hand observation to evaluate fully all stratotype
candidates. American members also provide expertise on the important fossil
groups involved in statotype evaluation, as well as significant leadership in
working group activities. Participation by Americans in this working group
meeting will facilitate acceptance and understanding of the bipartite division
of the Carboniferous passed at Beijing, 1987, at a level compatible with its
historical usage in North America.
