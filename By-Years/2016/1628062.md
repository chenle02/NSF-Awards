The conference award will support the next meeting of the interdisciplinary
"Working Group on Testing Theoretical Models of Individual Behavior in Dynamic
Social Dilemmas" (SD Working Group). Social dilemmas are situations where what
is best for the individual and what is best for the group are in conflict.
Results from research are directly applicable for public policy and real-world
issues, such as charitable giving, the environment, international conflict, and
local governance of public goods and common pool resources, among others. In
addition, the interdisciplinary nature of the SD Working Group promotes the
cross-fertilization of ideas and the progression of the science of social
dilemmas research.

Since its inception, the SD Working Group has highlighted the importance of
combining multiple methods (including formal theory; laboratory, field and
survey experiments; agent-based modeling; and observational data) with insights
from multiple disciplinary perspectives. This multi-method, interdisciplinary
collaboration leads to improved understanding and modeling of the theoretical
foundations of behavior in social dilemmas, and creates practical applications
and solutions which can be used to improve and inform local and international
governance and improve social welfare.

The workshop will make several key contributions. First, it will synthesize and
disseminate state-of-the art research on social dilemmas. Second, the workshop
meetings foster interdisciplinary conversation and promote collaboration and the
cross-fertilization of ideas across disciplinary boundaries, something which can
be difficult outside of these meetings due to the traditional structure of
departments and disciplinary conferences. Third, there will be a focus on
identifying the emerging issues, both scientific and practical, that research
should address going forward.
