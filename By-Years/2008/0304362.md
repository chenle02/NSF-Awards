We propose to conduct exploratory research on the fabrication of self-assembled
nanometer-scale structures of new classes of semiconductors with direct tunable
bandgaps in the UV/visible and infrared spectral regions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A
major part of the work will focus on the growth of nanoscale sized structures of
a completely new semiconductor system in the XCZN family where X is a group IV
element (Si, Ge, Sn) and Z is a group III metal (Al, Ga, In). Specifically,
these structures are quantum dots and pillars of the quaternary wideband gap
material (GeC) 1-x (GaN) x with an adjustable bandgap between 1.6 and 3.3 eV.
These materials are created directly on Si via suitable buffer layers utilizing
the vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) mechanism, which provides flexibility of fine-
tuning the size and spatial distributions of the nanostructures. An important
objective of this work is to integrate (GeC) 1-x(GaN)x and related optical
alloys with Si technologies so that their full potential can be realized as
commercially viable materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research program also
covers the synthesis of infrared nanostructures in the Si-Ge-Sn system with
tunable electronic and structural properties. These materials include Ge1-xSnx
quantum dots as well as related (SiGe) 1-xSnx and (Si4Ge) 1-xSnx nanostructures
created directly on silicon substrates. The novelty in this case is the direct-
bandgap nature of these Si-based systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The electronic
structure and optical properties will be thoroughly studied by spectroscopic
ellipsometry, Raman microprobe, photoluminescence, cathodoluminescence,
transmission IR spectroscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy. Structural
characterization involving high resolution electron microscopy, ion channeling
(RBS), high resolution x-ray diffraction, low energy electron microscopy (LEEM)
and atomic force microscopy are used extensively to provide rapid feedback about
the quality of the structure and morphology of the nanostructures, thus
ultimately leading to better design of the synthetic
pathways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the proposed
activity is to benefit undergraduates in chemistry, physics and materials
science, by involving them in the research and discovery process of creating
novel nanostructures of new and useful semiconductor materials. These students,
including members of underrepresented groups, will also be exposed to the
industrial environment at local microelectronic and optoelectronic laboratories
in order to gain first-hand knowledge and an in-depth appreciation of the
technical innovations in semiconductor and nanoscience research&lt;br/&gt;
