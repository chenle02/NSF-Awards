The chlorosis-inducing phytotoxin coronatine has an unusual structure and
consists of a polyketide component joined to an ethylcyclopropyl ring. In
contrast to other phytotoxins produced by Pseudomonas syringae, coronatine is
produced by multiple pathovars with distinct host specificity. Despite the
importance of coronatine in the virulence of producing pathovars the genetics of
coronatine biosynthesis has not been systematically studied. Transposon
mutagenesis was used to generate coronatine- defective mutants of P. syringae
pv. tomato. The physical analysis of these mutants suggested the involvement of
a 101 kb plasmid (designated pPT23A) in coronatine synthesis. pPT23A was
subsequently transferred into P. syringae pv. syringae PS61, a nonproducer of
coronatine. Upon acquisition of pPT23A, PS61 gained the ability to make
coronatine. Therefore, conclusive evidence has been collected for the
involvement of plasmid pPT23A in production of coronatine. The experiments
outlined in this proposal will precisely define the regions of pPT23A involved
in coronatine biosynthesis by moleuclar cloning, mutagenesis, and
complementation experiments. The results of these proposed experiments will
advance knowledge in the area of phytotoxin genetics.
