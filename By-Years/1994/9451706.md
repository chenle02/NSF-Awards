9451706 Saboury The University, through strong support of industrial sponsors
such as McDonnel Douglas Corporation and Catepiller Inc, has obtained material
and financial support for an industrially relevant polyermic composites
laboratory. The main objective of this project is to improve and augment the
materials laboratory equipment to provide hands-on experience in the fields of
design, processing and characterization of polymer- matrix composites for the
undergraduate students in the College of Engineering and Technology. This
project will affect up to 9 courses including junior-level materials courses in
manufacturing and mechanical engineering, a senior project and technical
elective courses. A new laboratory instruction manual will be developed over a
two-year period during the implementation of the project. Outreach activities
are under development to involve pre-service teachers in the materaials science
course which is being enhanced. Additionally, the laboratory will be opened to
regular visits by high school students, including a substantial number from
underrepresented minorities, from the local area and region.
