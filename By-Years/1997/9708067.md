This research is on techniques to support early system-level exploration of
memory-intensive behaviors for multimedia applications such as video and image
processing. In addition to memory, system performance, power consumption and
total cost are constraints being considered. Techniques and tools being
developed under this approach are for: (1) estimation of memory requirements
from the system's specification under resource, performance and power
constraints, enabling a tradeoff of computation time against estimation accuracy
by system designers; (2) optimization of the embedded system's specification
under area, performance and power constraints using a combination of coarse-
grain and fine-grain transformations; and (3) partitioning, organization, and
mapping of memory structures, including arrays, records and pointers, for
implementation of the system specification into hardware and software. These
techniques and tools are being integrated into an exploration environment which
permits system designers to evaluate feasible hardware/software implementations
of memory-intensive embedded applications.
