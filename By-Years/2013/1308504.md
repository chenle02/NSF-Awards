The Environmental Chemical Sciences Program in the Chemistry Division at the
National Science Foundation supports the research of Professor Jean-Francois
Gaillard at Northwestern University who seeks to establish the processes that
control the bioavailability of Mercury (Hg) in aquatic systems and particularly
to better delineate the role played by complexation reactions with human made
ligands. Mercury biouptake by microbial species is a key step in the formation
of methyl-mercury, one of the most potent neurotoxins known. Professor Gaillard
will examine how bacterial surface processes regulate this process when the
chemical speciation of Hg in solution is controlled by the presence of either
anthropogenic or biogenic ligands. The interactions of Hg with cell binding
sites will be investigated using spectroscopic and microscopic methods, whereas
Hg biouptake will be assessed using a whole cell biosensor. Hg complexation
reactions in solution will also be investigated using voltammetric methods. The
goal of this research is to provide a molecular perspective on mercury biouptake
as well as challenge conventional views on ligands controlled metal
biouptake.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The exacerbation of the release of mercury to
the global environment as a result of human activities such as coal burning has
raised a general concern about this pollutant that is distributed worldwide. The
proposed work has many essential connections to engineering applications and the
protection of human and ecological health. It evaluates in both fundamental and
practical ways the fate of Hg in response to anthropogenic releases and
redefines Hg entry pathways into microbial foodwebs. This research program will
train a Ph.D. and undergraduate students in environmental bioinorganic chemistry
and develop collaborations with the industry that is working to control Hg
concentrations in the environment.
