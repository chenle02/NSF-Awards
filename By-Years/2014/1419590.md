This workshop concerns the "taskability" of cognitive agents, meaning the
ability of an intelligent and adaptable system to accept high level, task-
oriented instructions from a human and translate those goal-oriented directives
into a suitably decomposed plan of sensing, reasoning, or action. The current
state of the art in research for cognitive systems and agents in general allows
human handlers to issue directions to agents either in terms of lower level
action primitives that correspond to the agent's particular design, or
constrained by a higher-order action language that is engineered to suffice as a
shorthand for some sequence of the same kinds of agent-specific behaviors.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop is addressing four key considerations for
this emergent topic: 1) defining this new research area with sufficient clarity
that research agendas can proceed productively; 2) identifying the science and
technology issues that most be addressed to create systems that meet that
definition of taskability; 3) decomposing that further into research and
development needs that are the precursors to such research; and 4) exploring the
formation of a research community on taskability. Taskability holds the
potential to transform the way humans interact with intelligent systems. The
ability to instruct a wide variety of agents to perform tasks that are not
preprogrammed will have a profound effect on the broader AI enterprise, and
eventually on the technologies that will enrich the daily lives of people.
