Under the supervision of faculty adviser Dr. Thomas Duncan, student Richard Lis
will conduct field work in Mexico and Central America to acquire samples of the
15-20 species of the rosaceous genus Holodiscus. Leaves of these plants will
supply a majority of characters for a taxonomic analysis of relationships among
these species. The data will be accumulated using image analysis, a new computer
method of data acquisition. Leaf characters will be supplemented with additional
characters from flowers and fruits, which have not been thoroughly surveyed
previously. Flower buds and shoot apices will be preserved for chromosome
analyses. This will be the first study of this montane genus to utilize a
variety of lines of evidence to provide consistent circumscriptions of the taxa,
to construct reliable identification keys to the species, and to map the
geographic distributions of the plants.
