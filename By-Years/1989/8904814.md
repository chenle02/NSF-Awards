The proposed study has three primary objectives: 1) to assess whether or not
the Engineering Research Centers (ERC) program has worked as envisioned: a) to
promote cross- disciplinary engineering research on problems of industrial
importance; b) to encourage industrial interactions with center research
programs; and c) to encourage engineering education with a distinct emphasis on
engineering practice. 2) to reassess the fundamental mission of the ERC program
in light of: a) experience to date with the centers; b) changes in the practice
of engineering research and education at universities; and c) currently
perceived challenges to the strength of U.S. engineering research and education.
3) to consider the effectiveness of existing proposal submission and selection
processes with regard to the ability of these to direct funds to those areas of
engineering research of highest national importance.
