9413492 Zollner It is proposed to convert an existing single-wavelength
ellipsometer with a rotating analyzer to a spectroscopic ellipsometer and to
investigate the optical properties of ternary silicon-germanium-carbon alloys
which may have optoelectronic applications. Preliminary ellipsometric
measurements will be performed on other classes of emerging materials, such as
titanium-silicon-tin, which has possible applications in the automotive industry
as a thermocouple material. %%% Same ***
