Viviparity in the vertebrates first evolved in fishes. The transition from
ovipairty to viviparity established a series of new maternal-embryonic
relationships, one of which involves the transfer of metabolites from mother to
embryo. The proposed research will investigate the cellular basis of maternal-
embryonic transfer of metabolites across a placenta and test an hypothesis about
the evolutionary origin of that placenta. Goodeid fish will be used as a model
system because their gut-derived placenta exemplifies one of the two major
routes of placental evolution. Goodeid embryos develop within the ovarian lumen
where they grow considerably (150X) due to absorption of maternal nutrients.
Maternal nutrients are transported across the ovarian lumenal epithelium into
the ovarian fluid where they are absorbed by the trophotaenial epithelium of the
embryo. Trophotaeniae are external perianal projections of the embryonic
intestinal epithelium. There are two types of trophotaeniae: long, ribbon
trophotaeniae whose cells function in macromolecular endocytosis, and short,
rosette trophotaeniae whose cells function in the transport of small molecules.
The lumenal epithelium of the maternal ovary and the trophotaeniae of the embryo
constitute a placenta. We will investigate the endocytotic and small molecule
transport function of the trophotaeniae. We will also test our hypothesis that
trophotaeniae are embryological and evolutionary derivatives of the embryonic
hindgut and that the endocytotic and small molecule transport configurations of
ribbon and rosette trophotaenial cells are alternative and successive states in
one sequence of differentiation. To achieve these goals, we will determine the
kinetics of small molecule uptake and macromolecular endocytosis, elucidate the
receptor recycling pathway, characterize enzymes of the endosomal-lysosomal
pathway, and analyze the structural differentiation of trophotaenial cells and
their putative evolutionary and embryological precursor, the intestinal
absorptive cell.
