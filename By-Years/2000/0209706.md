This research project, with the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
Program, addresses questions of fundamental importance in the dynamics of
adsorption and reaction on surfaces driven by photon and electron excitation.
Professors Petek and Yates, at the University of Pittsburgh, combine femtosecond
time resolved two photon photoemission with electron stimulated desorption ion
angular distribution studies to probe the effects of substrate electronic
structure on the detailed photochemistry of simple adsorbates on well
characterized metal surfaces. Sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxide adsorbed on
silver and platinum surfaces are the model systems of interest. Time resolved
photoemission microscopy provides information about the effect of specific
defect sites on the surface photochemical process. Information from these
studies provides fundamental insight into the operation of nanoscale structures
and devices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A detailed understanding of the effect of
substrate electronic structure on the dynamics of photon initiated chemistry at
surfaces is the focus of this research project. With the support of the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, Professors Petek and Yates at the
University of Pittsburgh are probing these questions. Using time resolved
photoemission methods, combined with structural information obtained from
desorbed ion angular distributions, fundamental understanding of the dynamics of
photon and electron initiated surface processes is obtained. &lt;br/&gt;
