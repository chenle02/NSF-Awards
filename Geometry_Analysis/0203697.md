DMS - 0203697 PI: Wolfgang Ziller ABSTRACT

The principal investigator plans to continue his work on various ways in which
Lie groups arise in geometry. Special emphasis will be put on geometry and
topology of cohomogeneity one manifolds, i.e. manifolds on which a Lie group
acts with one dimensional quotient. In our previous proposal we conjectured that
every cohomogeneity one manifold has a metric with non-negative sectional
curvature. A particularly interesting case are the Kervaire spheres which are
exotic in many dimensions. We will try to construct metrics with nonnegative
curvature on these Kervaire spheres. A further goal is to classify all
cohomogeneity one manifolds with positive sectional curvature in the hope of
finding some new examples, with good candidates available in dimension 7 and 9.
We will also study variational properties of homogeneous Einstein metrics. In
our previous proposal we showed that a partial Palais Smale condition is
satisfied which enables one do carry out Morse theory and Lusternik Schnirelmann
theory.

A subject of major interest in global Riemannian geometry is studying manifolds
whose curvature have special properties, in particular those whose curvature has
a fixed sign. Manifolds with positive curvature or nonnegative curvature have
been studied since the beginning of global Riemannian geometry. Very few
examples of this type are known and new ones seem to be difficult to construct.
A main objective of our proposal is to construct such knew examples. Of
particular interest are exotic spheres, which are manifolds that look like
spheres but on which ordinary calculus is quite different. These objects were
discovered 40 years ago by Milnor and ever since then geometers were interested
in finding a geometric description of them where the natural local invariants
look like spheres, i.e. where the curvature is positive or non-negative. Whether
they have metrics of positive curvature is in fact one of the major open
problems in the subject. Another subject of major interest in global Riemannian
geometry is the existence of Einstein metrics, which have many applications in
physics in particular to building new models of Kaluza Klein theory. In this
context homogeneous Einstein metrics have been studied a lot by various
physicists. We develop a general variational theory for homogeneous Einstein
metrics which enable one to find many new examples without having to solve the
algebraic equations which the Einstein equations reduce to in the homogenous
case and which can be quite difficult or impossible to solve explicitly.
