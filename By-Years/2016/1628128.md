Jailing for child support nonpayment is one of many possible mechanisms of child
support enforcement, but little is known about how frequently this tactic is
used, against whom, and what the consequences are. This project, then, has three
aims: first, to provide a quantitative overview of jail for child support
nonpayment using data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study
(FFCW); second, to understand the processes by which courts decide whom to jail
for child support nonpayment; third, to understand how families experience
punitive child support enforcement and what the consequences of this enforcement
tactic might be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using a mixed methods design, this project
explores the frequency, distribution, process, and consequences of jail for
child support nonpayment. The researchers will perform court observation in two
Texas counties and conduct in-depth interviews with custodial and noncustodial
parents. This approach will explain how interpersonal and jurisdictional-level
factors interact with individual characteristics to shape an individual's risk
of being jailed.
