Hydrostatic pressure is an ecological and evolutionary factor in the seas. The
principal investigator, a leading authority on deep-sea bacteria and on the
biological effects of hydrostatic pressure, is continuing and extending his
investigations into this topic by focusing on the ability of deep-sea bacteria
to synthesize polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). PUFAs are required dietary
lipids for most animals in near the surface and are likely to be for those in
the deep sea also. If bacteria are the major source of PUFAs in the deep sea,
then they are likely to constitute an essential feature of the deep-sea food
web. Thus this study will provide important insights into the synthesis and role
of PUFAs in the deep-sea food web.
