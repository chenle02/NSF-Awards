Chloroplasts are autonomously replicating organelles which function to harvest
light energy into chemical form in plants. They possess their own DNA and
replicating machinery. In this renewal project, Dr. Wu will continue studying
the control of DNA replication in the chloroplast of the unicellular green alga,
Chlamydomonas. In particular, she will focus on the minimal structural
requirements for the DNA replication origin, the development of an in vitro
replication system for studying the process, and characterization of a novel 18
kDa iron-sulfur containing membrane protein which exhibits very strong binding
to the replication origin and which has electron-transport capability. Some
experiments are also proposed using chloroplasts isolated from higher plants, to
determine if the information obtained from the algal system are directly
relevant to higher plant systems. Chloroplast DNA replicates preferentially in
the light phase of the growth cycle. The control of DNA replication initiation,
and its relationship to other cellular processes, is not well understood. These
proposed experiments promise to shed light on this problem, not only for the
green alga, Chlamydomonas, but also for higher plants.
