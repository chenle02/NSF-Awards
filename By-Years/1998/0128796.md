0128796&lt;br/&gt;Hedges&lt;br/&gt;This award supports John Hedges and students
from Washington University in a collaboration with Gerhard Kattner of the Alfred
Wegener Institute in Bremerhaven, Germany. The project will have several foci,
including the study of export of organic matter from rivers to the ocean,
biogeochemistry of tropical systems, dynamics of dissolved organic matter in
natural waters, and preservation of organic materials in marine sediments. Both
groups are actively developing analytical methods for organic materials in
environmental samples. In particular, the project will produce a method for
analysis of the stable carbon and nitrogen isotope compositions of individual
amino acids and their stereoisomers. In addition, the US group will learn the
high-performance liquid chromatographic method now practiced by the AWI group
fro ultra-sensitive analysis of amino acids as well as their methods for
characterizing the molecular weight distribution of samples of dissolved organic
matter. The work plan provides for extensive participation by graduate students
in the international travel and research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
