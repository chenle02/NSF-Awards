This dissertation uses Health and Retirement Study data to investigate the role
of exercise in explaining racial and gender disparities in health among older
Americans. Exercise can be regarded as a type of investment that people make in
their own health. These health investments are hypothesized to be affected by
the other kinds of capital that people possess: economic, social, and cultural.
Multiple dimensions of each of these forms of capital will be tested for their
relationships with exercise. Racial/ethnic and gender differences in exercise
may be explained in part by varying levels of social, economic, and cultural
capital.
