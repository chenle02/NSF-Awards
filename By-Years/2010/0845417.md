This project will examine neural circuits that make up a unique region of the
insect brain called the central complex. This large midline brain region is made
up of several subunits that each has a columnar anatomy. The repeating units
that make up these columns provide a unique opportunity for understanding the
underlying neural circuitry. They appear to be involved in processing large
amounts of sensory information, then using it to influence movement. A range of
electrophysiological techniques will be used to examine how central complex
circuits process mechanical information arising from antennal stimulation as
well as visual cues. In conjunction with behavioral techniques, central complex
processing will be related to actual movements. The results are critical to the
understanding of how brain systems influence more immediate local reflex
circuits that directly control leg movements in walking, turning and climbing
which in insects are found in thoracic ganglia. They will complement recent
advances in motor control stemming from neurogenetic techniques from several
other laboratories. Indeed, because similar interactions between higher brain
systems and local reflexes exist in virtually all legged animals, including
vertebrates, the results will have wide ranging neurobiological impact.
Moreover, the PI has a long-term commitment to bringing knowledge of biological
systems to the design of legged robots. As such, the project should also lead to
more advanced robots that can move autonomously through tortuous terrain with
less direction from a driver. The project will continue a successful record of
training both graduate and undergraduate students. Students will have the
opportunity to work directly with senior laboratory personnel on the project and
a larger number of students will take part in a novel capstone course that
brings together undergraduate biologists and engineers on semester-long projects
related to this research.
