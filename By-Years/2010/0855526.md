This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides support for an
expanded program of research involving three faculty members in elementary
particle physics at the College of William and Mary. The members of the group
are actively involved in a series of precision experiments with the goal of
exploring the nature of neutrino oscillations and filling in the missing pieces
of the neutrino puzzle. Each investigator leads analysis groups or analyses in
the currently-running MINOS long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment. While
continuing to exploit the data from MINOS and support its operations, the group
is adopting a leading role in the next phase of the program, namely the MINERvA
neutrino-scattering experiment and the NOvA long-baseline experiment, and looks
forward to a long-range program centered at the DUSEL facility. The W&amp;M
group is committed to engaging undergraduates in research as a vital component
of their education. This proposal will enable cutting edge research experience
for two undergraduate students per year, in conjunction with the department's
robust REU program, and will support senior theses. The group also maintains a
RET program in neutrino and underground physics which enables two teachers to
participate in research projects at the Soudan Underground Laboratory each year.
The members of the W&amp;M group actively promote the participation of groups
which have been historically underrepresented in particle physics. MINERvA has a
significant contingent of students from Latin American universities working on
detector commissioning at Fermilab who have been mentored by the group.
