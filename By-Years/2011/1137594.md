The 2-Pi-STEM (2-Pathways into STEM) Project is designed to create pathways to
professional careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)
through awareness activities, field experiences, teaching and learning through
problem-based learning concept and the establishment of a college bridge program
at Lawson State Community College (LSCC). The activities of the project will be
supported by an enhanced STEM infrastructure at LSCC impacting the
underrepresented populations in STEM careers especially in the Central Alabama
region. The overarching goal of the 2-Pi-STEM Project is to increase the number
of underrepresented minorities in the STEM career paths focusing in the
following goals: (1) Provide cross curricular mentoring and learning communities
for STEM students to improve persistence and efficacy in STEM courses (2) Create
a STEM pipeline by providing enrichment and academic enhancement programs for
high school students (3) Implement a college bridge program for incoming
freshman/sophomore and transfer students in concert with LSCC's Freshman
Academy, a seminar class acclimating new students to college life. The project
expects to increase preparation and success of a pool of African American
students in Central Alabama in transitioning from high school, being retained in
STEM at the community college, and transferring in STEM to a four-year college.
