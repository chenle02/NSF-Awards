Oklahoma State University continues operating a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) Site. The theme of the REU Site is Optical Materials,
Lasers and their Application in Optical Sensing. The Site is hosted by the
Department of Physics and the Center for Sensors and Sensor Technologies at OSU.
Ten undergraduate students are recruited every year for a ten-week summer
research experience. Student research projects address optical, electro-optical,
radiation-sensitive, biological and colloidal materials with present or
potential applications in optical, laser and sensor systems. In addition to
participating in individual research projects, REU students attend research
seminars and field trips to nearby industrial research
facilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU Site is supported by the Department of
Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
