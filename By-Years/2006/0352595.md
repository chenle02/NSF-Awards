Kenneth Lipkowitz of Indiana U.-Purdue U. is supported by the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to study enantiomeric selectivity for molecules
such as those employed in chiral chromatography. Specifically, this research
will examine the hypothesis that maximum chiral discrimination takes place when
the binding site or chemical reactivity center is spatially coincident with the
molecule's region of greatest enantiodifferentiation. A theoretical approach is
used wherein regions of maximum stereoselection or stereoinduction will be
calculated and then compared to computed binding sites and/or to experimentally
determined recognition sites. A second, related goal of this project is to
examine the relationship between chirality and
enantiodiscrimination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While chirality must exist as a
precondition for stereoisomer-specific reaction chemistry, the relationship
between how chiral a molecule is and its ability to induce an effect in a
stereoselective manner is less well understood. This project will make that
connection, and aid separations scientists in designing stationary phases for
chromatography and synthetic chemists in making better chiral catalysts. The
relationship between chirality and enantioselection will be firmly established,
which has far reaching influences in all areas of science and technology,
including medicine, materials, and related endeavors where chiral recognition is
important.
