Spin is a fascinating property of matter which has no classical analog and which
is largely ignored in mainstream charge-based electronics. As the scalability of
conventional devices nears exhaustion, the spin degree of freedom moves to the
forefront of research in the quest to find alternative device paradigms.
Holes&lt;br/&gt;in semiconductor nanostructures are especially attractive for
future implementation of spintronic devices due to their potentially very long
spin relaxation times. The goal of this proposal is to understand mechanisms of
spin interactions in p-type semiconductor nanostructures, to develop functional
spin-based quantum devices, and to develop a versatile educational program
closely integrated with this research
project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Semiconductor nanostructures provide a unique
controllable environment where a single spin can be isolated and fundamental
aspects of its interactions can be investigated. Hole nanostructures have a
peculiar set of parameters and symmetries that are largely unexplored. Strong
anisotropy of exchange interaction, effective mass and $g$-factor for high index
crystallographic axises will allow the applicant to investigate different
mechanisms contributing to spin relaxation and to devise efficient methods of
spin manipulation. Applications relevant to the emerging fields of spintronics
and quantum information processing will be
investigated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Educational activities are an essential part
of the proposed career development plan and are closely integrated with the
proposed research program, which include (i) training of graduate and
undergraduate students in state-of-the-art experimental techniques via their
direct involvement in the proposed research program, (ii) development of a
special course ``Physics of Low-dimensional Systems'' and (iii) development of
an enrichment program for K-12 students.&lt;br/&gt;
