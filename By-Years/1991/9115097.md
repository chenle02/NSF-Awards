Dr. William Bowman is Director of the University of Colorado's Mountain
Research Station, located at 2900 meters elevation in the Front Range of the
Rockies near the Continental Divide. The Niwot Ridge area near the Station is an
alpine tundra study area that is designated an NSF-supported Long-Term
Ecological Research Site, an Experimental Ecological Reserve by the U.S. Forest
Service and the Institute of Ecology, and a Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO and the
U.S. State Department. Dr. Bowman requests support for purchase of two
snowmobiles for research use, an upgrade of their weather station equipment, and
winterization of the Station's water supply system. The proposed equipment
acquisitions and site improvements to the Mountain Research Station would make
it possible for research projects to operate during the winter months, and would
increase the quality and quantity of environmental data gathered at the Station.
Research on the fragile tundra environment is especially critical to our
understanding of global climate change. This field station has supported leading
research in this area, and continued improvement to this facility will enhance
future research significantly.
