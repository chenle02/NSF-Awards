9553066 Li This Presidential Faculty Fellowship award will involve primary
synthesis, structure characterization, and property studies of novel solid-state
materials, particularily the metal chalcogenides and carbides. Both experimental
and theoretical methods will be employed in these investigations. A focus on
teaching activities will include areas of chemistry including physical,
computational, and quantum chemistry. %%% The principal objective of this
researc is to develop innovative routes to new inorganic solid-state materials
that can be shown to have novel functional properties with a broad impact across
many areas of strategic research. The educational efforts are aimed at
integrating research with education, making the world of chemistry relevant
through an enhanced knowledge of the world of new materials derived by novel
synthetic techniques.
