9503040 Garvine In this project, the PI will continue his studies of the
discharge of water from estuaries into shallow water over the continental shelf.
A 3-Dimensional model developed by Blumberg and Mellor will be used to study
generic processes in an idealized setting. Following this, a wide range of
specific processes will be studied in the setting of the Delaware Coastal
Current, and the results would be compared with ongoing field observations,
those of both the PI and others. ***
