This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conflict between the sexes over control
of fertilization is expected to be widespread among organisms, but its
evolutionary consequences are still poorly understood particularly in vertebrate
animals. Waterfowl have complex breeding systems that include female partner
preferences based on elaborate male plumage and courtship display, and
unsolicited reproductive attempts by males other than the female's chosen
partner. Female ducks show resistance behaviors and anatomies that have
coevolved with male coercion. Ducks are ideally suited to study the evolution of
sexual conflict and the evolution of reproductive structures. The project
examines how reproductive morphology covaries with season, age, and social
environment in a diverse sample of duck species that differ in ecology,
territoriality and breeding system. Preliminary results of the project, suggest
that male competition plays an important role in the evolution of waterfowl
reproductive morphology, that male reproductive morphology is plastic depending
on age and condition, and between species with different breeding systems. The
project constitutes an exciting opportunity to investigate the role of sexual
conflict on the evolution of reproductive structures in the context of social
and behavioral complexity in vertebrates. Broader impacts of the research will
be international, national, local, and personal. The first research publication
related to this project was widely disseminated in popular newspapers,
magazines, television programs, websites and blogs. The project will incorporate
high school students from under-represented minorities through the Yale
University EVOLUTIONISTS program, which serves students in New Haven, CT. The
experimental manipulations suggested in this project will be carried out at a
non-profit conservation organization (LRWC.net) whose mission is to conserve
waterfowl through education, research and outreach and this project will help to
further their goals.
