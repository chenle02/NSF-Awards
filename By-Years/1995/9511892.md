The proposed research is directed towards the development of mathematical and
computational tools for the geometric analysis of molecular conformation,
kinematics and dynamics. The resulting algorithms and computer programs are
expected to be of widespread utility to researchers in many areas of structural
chemistry and biochemistry, including spectroscopists seeking to interpret their
data in terms of a precise molecular model, stereochemists who need to find all
conformers consistent with a given bond arrangement, molecular biologists
attempting to predict protein and nucleic acid conformation, and theoreticians
studying their dynamics. The overall approach combines established methods of
conformational analysis based on distance geometry with one of the most
important tools of modern theoretical physics: Clifford algebra. In previous
publications, we have shown how distance geometry can be understood within the
broader framework of Clifford algebra, and how the Clifford algebra of three-
dimensional Euclidian space can be used to solve important problems in modern
conformational analysis. We have also shown how the martix exponential and
related matrix-valued functions can be used to compute the necessary
transformations, and have developed efficient algorithms for them. Specific
research activities planned for the award period include: (1) Conformational
analysis in four dimensions, (2) Mobius sphere distance geometry, and (3)
Kinematics of internal molecular motions.
