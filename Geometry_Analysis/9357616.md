This research, supported by the National Science Foundation Young Investigator
award, will concentrate on various problems related to the Einstein equations.
Many of these problems are suitable for the application of perturbation methods
in the presence of nontrivial kernel for the linearization. The National Science
Foundation Young Investigator award recognizes outstanding young faculty. This
award recognizes the recipient's strong potential for continued professional
growth as a research mathematician and for significant development as a teacher
and academic leader. //
