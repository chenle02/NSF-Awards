This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial Biology for
FY2002. The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of
protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are
not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides
opportunities for a recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in
microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of
established scientists, and to broaden his/her scientific horizons beyond the
research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These
fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their
research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves
of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign
locations.

The research and training plan is entitled "The fungal community on corn (Zea
mays) resistant and susceptible to smut (Ustilago maydis)." The effects of
selective breeding and changing host genetic environment on non-target,
potentially beneficial microorganisms are often overlooked. This research
investigates these effects by studying the fungal microbial community on corn
plants resistant or susceptible to one its major pathogens, smut. It will have
important implications for understanding how altering the host plant genetic
environment can affect species diversity and genetic structure of non-target
microorganisms.
