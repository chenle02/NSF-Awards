Several critical refinements are identified and proposed in connection with a
very precise test of time reversal invariance using nuclear spin resonance in
the thallium fluoride molecule. These improvements will increase the sensitivity
of the measurement by an order of magnitude, which will bring it to almost three
orders better accuracy than previous measurements. At this level the
measurements will reveal, for the first time, an example of T asymmetry; or they
will introduce a new constraint on possible theories.
