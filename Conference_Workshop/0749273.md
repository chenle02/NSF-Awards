Oral and poster presentations by undergraduates have become an integral part of
the Mathematical Association of America (MAA) summer MathFest and winter Joint
Mathematics Meetings (JMM). Participation in national meetings offers students a
chance to become a part of the mathematical community at a national level and
interact with peers from other institutions. Learning new mathematics and
sharing experiences with others can provide strong motivation for continued
study of mathematics. Despite the positive effects and the upsurge in
participation by undergraduates at national meetings, funding for travel remains
a significant obstacle to participation for many undergraduate students. This
five-year grant is for travel support for students who are presenting their
research talk or poster at either the summer MathFest or winter JMM. The grant
will support approximately 75, 100, 125, 150, and 175 students in the years
2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012, respectively.
