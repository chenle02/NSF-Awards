This award will support the purchase of necessary pieces of equipment for a
multi-user plant growth and tissue culture facility at University of Arizona.
NSF and the University will share the cost on a 1:1 basis. Primary users of the
facility consist of 17 mostly young faculty members in the Departments of Plant
Sciences and Plant Pathology. The facility will be used for research and
teaching in the areas of plant growth and development, plant
physiology/biochemistry, plant genetics/molecular biology, transformation
technology, and host- pathogen interactions. Specific pieces of equipment
include growth chambers, light banks, Laminar flow hoods, and shakers, and they
will be installed in the new Agricultural Research Laboratory.
