9319505 Collins Carnegie Mellon Univ. Dr. Terrence J. Collins, Chemistry
Department, Carnegie Mellon University, is supported by the Inorganic,
Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program for research into the
development and chemistry of stable high valent mid- and late- transition metal
complexes. Through ligand modification, alkane soluble oxidants will be
prepared. A series of water soluble or polymer attached high valent cobalt,
copper, and nickel oxidants will be developed as potential replacements for
commercially used, but toxic, Cr(VI) reagents. As there is evidence that Cr(V)
will induce DNA damage, the role of this species as a carcinogen and mutagen
will be evaluated. Finally, a series of Cu(IV) and Ni(IV) complexes will be
developed as two electron reductant and the feasibility of producing Cu(V) and
Ni(V) species will be explored. A wide variety of oxidants, compounds which
transfer one or more electrons to another species in a chemical reaction, are
used routinely in all areas of chemistry. In this project new oxidants will be
developed which will be more efficient, easier to use, and environmentally more
friendly than the ones which are currently employed. As chromium is commonly
used in oxidations, the interactions of DNA with one important form of this
element will be evaluated. Overall this project will contribute to design of new
reagents which are easier to use, not as toxic, and less polluting than those
which are now being used.
