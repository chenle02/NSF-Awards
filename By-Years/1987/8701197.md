Ice nuclei can be applied to promote the independent freezing of large numbers
of water droplets, and to transduce molecular events into macroscopic signals.
Ice nuclei of bacterial origin vary in their critical temperature for activity;
the variability is problematic for practical applications, and its cause is not
understood. In this research, the ice nucleation gene InaZ is manipulated and
its products are analyzed to discover what governs the variability in critical
nucleation temperature. Changes in protein concentration, caused by promoter
substitutions, are correlated with nucleation frequency; this will indicate the
molecularity of the assembly reaction for ice frequency: this will indicate the
molecularity of the assembly reaction for ice nuclei over a range of critical
temperatures. The subcellular locations of mutant InaZ proteins are determined
and compared to their ice nucleation potentials, to reveal relationships between
protein primary structure, localization, and function. Domains from heterologous
proteins are substituted into the InaZ protein to further explore the
requirements for nucleation at the higher end of the range of critical
temperatures. The information obtained is utilized in the engineering of ice
nucleation proteins with enhanced capacities for forming populations of ice
nuclei with uniformly high critical temperatures. The goal of this research is
to analyze how the critical temperatures of ice nucleic are determined. This is
a thoughtfully concerned and focused research effort dealing with a significant
phenomenon of great interest in biology. The implications for frozen food
processing, snow making, arctic ice engineering, climate modification and frost
control are infinite.
