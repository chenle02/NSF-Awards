This project is concerned with a number of issues in algebraic geometry, the
geometric theory of noncommutative rings, the differential topology of complex
algebraic varieties, and arithmetic algebraic geometry. These issues include the
following: (1) the enumeration of the multiple-points of a finite map that is
birational onto its image; (2) Whitney equisingularity and the Buchsbaum-Rim
multiplicity; (3) the inseparablility of the Gauss map of a smooth complete
interaction; (4) the enumeration of the rational normal curves on the generic
quintic hypersurface in 4-space, and the singularity of the Hilbert scheme
component of the rational normal n-ics; (5) the autoduality of the compactified
Jacobian; (6) the theory of a transition map in the theory of residues and
duality; (7) quantum projective planes; (8) the foundations of noncommutative
projective geometry; (9) noncommutative projective schemes of dimension 1; (10)
maximal orders with p-fold ramification in characteristic p; (11) special
polyhedral filtrations; (12) higher Chow groups as derived functors; (13)
bivariant sheaves and motives; (14) applications of geometry to the study of
class groups of number fields. This is research in the field of algebraic
geometry, which is one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics. In its origin,
it treated figures that could be defined in the plane by the simplest equations,
namely polynomials. Nowadays the field makes use of methods not only from
algebra, but also from analysis and topology. It is finding application in those
areas of mathematics as well as in theoretical computer science and in robotics.
