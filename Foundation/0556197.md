Aschenbrenner proposes to contribute to the fields of model theory and algebra.
He proposes to continue his collaborative efforts to create a synthesis between
the fields of real algebraic geometry and differential algebra, in the form of
asymptotic differential algebra. This will lead to a deeper understanding of the
model-theoretic and algebraic properties of Hardy fields and fields of
transseries, and the relationship between them, and will open up new
perspectives in the asymptotic theory of algebraic differential equations. He
also proposes to continue his investigations into non-standard methods and
degree bounds in commutative algebra. For example, Aschenbrenner proposes to
increase our knowledge about Grobner bases for ideals in the ring of polynomials
with integral coefficients.

Mathematical logic, although it originated in the late 19th century with
philosophical investigations into the foundations of mathematics, has in recent
decades found many applications in other parts of mathematics, in computer
science, and even in engineering (quantifier elimination as it relates to
robotics). This project deals mainly with pushing the applicability of the
methods of mathematical logic into as of yet unexplored territory, namely,
asymptotic analysis. Our hope is that these investigations will lead to a deeper
understanding of the behavior of solutions to differential equations. Another
part of the proposed project involves the construction and analysis of
algorithms for algebraic problems. Finding degree bounds as suggested in this
project is of central importance for applications of computer algebra in science
and engineering.
