This project unites the mathematical theory of iterated functions systems with
the geophysical (observable) phenomena of rack fractures. The aim is to
determine whether or not rock fractures can be characterized by iterated
function system codes, and if so, what predictive validity these codes might
then have for fracture-related phenomena. This award supports the cross-
disciplinary efforts and the development of a research collaboration involving
quantitative modelling in the geosciences. In particular the mathematicians and
the geophysicists will focus their attention on mathematical models derived from
chaotic dynamics to model and predict rock fractures and related phenomena.
