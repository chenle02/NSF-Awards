The proposed research is designed to enhance the efficiency of and competiviness
of manufacvturing firms by broadening the scope of the production scheduling
function to include not only the sequence of work, but also the coordination of
all resource inputs (e.g., different types of skilled labor and support
equipment) required to process work. Recognizing that certain resource types are
inherently flexible (i.e., they can migrate to processors as needed) and that
job operaton times often depend directly on the amount and mix of resources
dedicated to tasks, the investigators formulate the flexible- resource
scheduling problem with the objective of simultaneously determining the job
sequence and resource allocaton policy that optimize a chosen measure of system
performance. General Dynamics will be their collaborator.
