9452884 Radford Three North Louisiana parishes, Caddo, Claiborne, and Bienville,
and Louisiana Tech University will collaborate to develop system- wide plans to
initiate systemic reform in science instruction. A steering committee consisting
of teachers, supervisors, principals, superintendents, university science and
science education faculty, the regional service center director, and business
and lay persons will oversee the project at the regional level. Additional
parish personnel will serve on a task force for each parish. In order to make
informed decisions about science reform, data will be collected on successful
science instructional strategies. The project will investigate varied science
instructional formats such as kit-based science instruction, integrated science
programs, technology-based instruction, and appropriate assessment strategies.
Nationally recognized experts will address the above areas at general planning
meetings involving all three parishes. Selected parish representatives and
university personnel will visit exemplary programs chosen by the steering
committee. Using what is learned about reform in science, each task force will
develop a specific plan for implementation of the chosen instructional programs
to bring about systemic reform in science for the parish.
