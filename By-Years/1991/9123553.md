Theoretical research will be conducted to characterize the large amplitude,
non-linear stability properties of a fluid with motion driven by unstable
buoyancy, but stabilized by a mechanically driven oscillatory boundary. Previous
research has shown that stabilization can be achieved with the proper driving
oscillation when only small amplitude disturbances are considered. The present
investigation is to explore the large amplitude regime, where it is conjectured
that mechanical boundary oscillations can result in a strong inhibition of
thermally driven motion. The results have application to such engineering
systems as Chemical Vapor Deposition of thin films, where prevention of flow
instabilities could result in larger useful rates of deposition.
