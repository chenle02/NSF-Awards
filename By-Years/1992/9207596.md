The lamprologine chichlids of Africa are an extraordinarily species-rich and
ecologically diverse group of fishes. Within Lake Tanganyika, where most of the
species occur, they constitute 75% of the littoral fish community and form a
centrally important component of the ecology and economics of the Lake
Tanganyika ecosystem. For the study of processes of speciation and
diversification, patterns of morphological and molecular tranformation, and
ecological, trophic and reproductive divergence, it is hard to imagine a better
suited cichlid model than the lamprologines. The study will document the
anatomical variation exhibited by the group, determine the phylogenetic position
of the lamprologines within the African Cichlidae, and resolve their species-
level intrarelationships. The project represents a major contribution to our
understanding of cichlid morphological systematics, and will also lay the
foundation for the truly integrative study of morphological, molecular and
ecological evolution in a major group of fishes. The PI and her institution are
well equipped to conduct this research.
