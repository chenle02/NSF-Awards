9513400 Roth Protein phosphorylation-dephosphorylation events condition the
regulation of numerous cellular processes in eukaryotes. However, there are few
examples in plant systems that provide a model to dissect the functional
significance of a phosphorylation-mediated signal transduction pathway. The long
term goal of this research is to characterize the role of the plant encoded
double-standed (ds) RNA-dependent protein kinase, pPKR, in uninfected and in
virus and viroid infected cells. The primary goals of this renewal are: to
extend characterization studies of pPKR and to determine its functional
significance with respect to regulation of protein synthesis initiation in
tobacco and potato plants. The pPKR is part of a regulatory pathway that may be
involved in regulation of protein synthesis, cell division and differentiation,
and defense against viral infection. Therefore, it is important to understand
the role of this protein in plants.
