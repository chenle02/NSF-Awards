are to formulate and analyze mathematical models of demographic and genetic
factors and their interactions affecting the risk of population extinction.
Demographic factors to be investigated include random catastrophes and their
interaction with fluctuating environments, local extinction and colonization in
spatially distributed "metapopulations", and harvesting of populations in a
fluctuating environment. Genetic factors to be investigated include inbreeding
in small populations, deleterious mutation, random genetic drift, and adaptive
evolution in changing environments. Methods from dynamical system theory and
stochastic process theory will be employed, e.g. modeling fluctuating
environments and random genetic drift as diffusion processes, and random
catastrophes as a jump process. The main quantities of interest are times and
probabilities of extinction, especially the mean time to extinction. Using
suitable approximations, simple formulas will be derive that elucidate the
extinction risks associated with each factor and their interactions. Analytical
results will be checked by computer simulation where feasible. %%% The results
will help to establish a stronger theoretical foundation for the science of
conservation biology. A better understanding of factors causing extinction,
particularly in small populations, will have immediate applications in viability
analysis, and in conservation and restoration plans for threatened and
endangered species. ***
