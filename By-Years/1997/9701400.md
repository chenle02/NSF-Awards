An existing component-oriented software system that is based on a platform-
independent software distribution format will be augmented by a dynamic re-
optimizer. The existing system already employs load-time code generation that
happens in a single burst and puts compilation speed ahead of code quality, so
that program execution can commence immediately. The additional re-optimizer
will improve this situation by continually re-generating the object code of all
active software components in the background, applying aggressive intermodular
optimization techniques. Hence, it will combine a collection of independently
compiled and distributed software components into a single, fully cross-
optimized, quasi- monolithic code image, and then supplant the currently
executing version of the code by the newly generated image. Re- optimization
will be guided by run-time profiling data, so that successive re-optimizations
will adapt to shifting usage patterns. Dynamic code generation will enable
component- oriented systems to match or even surpass the efficiency of
statically optimized software, in spite of being extensible at run-time.
Concurrently with this research, a new upper-division undergraduate course
sequence on language implementation will be developed.***
