During the preceeding decade, the general area of chaotic behavior in
complicated dynamical systems has received a great deal of attention in a
variety of fundamental and applied scientific disciplines. Closely related
subjects are fractals, phase transitions, nucleation, and the renormalization
group approach. The recognition of the existence of deterministic chaos raises
important questions about the role of causality, chance, and the prospects for
deterministic prediction of physical processes, such as earthquakes, in the
earth sciences. Only a small number of earth scientists are actively working in
these areas. This award contributes support to a small workshop - format
conference, which will be invaluable in stimulating interest and developing
expertise in this area. 20 - 30 earth scientists will informally meet with 10 -
20 nonlinear dynamicists to explore how these newly developed ideas might best
be used in understanding the complexity seen in the dynamics of the earth's
crust.
