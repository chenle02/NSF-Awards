This project develops models for information assurance education and outreach
that can be disseminated to other institutions. The primary focus areas of this
project are a high school outreach program, a multidisciplinary information
assurance curriculum, and a community lecture series.

The high school outreach program is a four-week summer program for high school
students and high school teachers in two aspects of information assurance -
introduction to cryptography and explorations in network security and
vulnerability analysis. The purpose of the outreach program is to introduce
self-exploratory projects to students who have never participated in a research
project and to encourage participating teachers to disseminate the ideas back to
their classrooms during the school year. This program will help cultivate
interest in information assurance.

The proposed multidisciplinary information assurance curriculum incorporates
computer science, mathematics, political science, criminal justice, and other
related fields to build a strong program that addresses both the technical and
social aspects of information assurance. Developed in consultation with faculty
of the respective departments and with members of the law enforcement and
intelligence communities, the intent of the curriculum is to create well-rounded
graduates with a broad base of knowledge.

The community lecture series addresses the lack of information assurance
education channels in the region. The annual free community course provides in-
depth exposure to information assurance topics, with culminating lectures
featuring regional and national speakers. The proposed activity is a model for
community engagement and education which will raise community awareness of
information assurance issues.
