The broader impact of this I-Corps project is to reduce the incidence of urinary
tract infections (UTIs) caused by intermittent urinary catheter use. The main
goal is to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with intermittent urinary
catheter use, improve quality of life, and significantly reduce the cost to the
health care system. This novel intermittent urinary catheter design offers three
important advantages, it : eliminates the translocation of bacteria at the
urethral opening into the bladder, prevents catheter contamination due to
handling, and eliminates frictional stresses imposed on endothelial tissues
during catheter insertion. Together, these features are expected to result in a
significant reduction of UTI incidence due to intermittent urinary catheter
use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project develops a novel intermittent
urinary catheter with a sheath, initially stored on the inside of the catheter,
that is deployed over the catheter as it advances up the urethra, resulting in
sterile material covering the catheter that remains stationary against the
urethra as the catheter advances. Before deployment, the sterile sheath is
inside the catheter with only a small portion on the outside covering the tip
connected to a flange. As the catheter is pushed forward, the flange stays in
place and a sterile barrier in put between the catheter and the urethra. This
technology would eliminate bacteria at the urethral meatus from reaching the
bladder and eliminate frictional damage to tissues, in addition to reducing
concerns of improper handling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
