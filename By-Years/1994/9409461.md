9409461 Franchek In this research project a design methodology is developed that
deliberately uses actuator saturation to maximize the allowable step disturbance
size acting on a class of uncertain regulating systems whose output must be
maintained within a prespecified tolerance. The approach is based upon
frequency-domain techniques that displays the trade-offs between output
performance in terms of sensitivity reduction and controller bandwidth. Using
this approach, it is feasible to design linear feedback controllers that only
saturate for large disturbances, which offers a significant advantage over the
use of bang-bang control. ***
