This action funds Alec Michael Kretchun of Portland State University to conduct
a research project, entitled "Landscape change and carbon sequestration in the
forests of northeastern Asia under a changing climate," during the summer of
2012 at Kookmin University in Seoul, Korea. The host scientist is Dr. Dongwook
Ko.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is that it addresses landscape
and regional issues related to climate change, forest succession, and carbon
dynamics and management using both empirical data collection and modeled forest
change in Korea. Because of their unique history and composition, these forests
are a source of valuable lessons on forest growth processes, successional
dynamics, land use impact, and human-nature interactions.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
