This NSF award will be utilized to renovate approximately 5,600 square feet of
research space in the Steele Laboratory of Electrical Sciences on the campus of
the California Institute of Technology. Steele Lab is approximately 30 years
old, and the renovation will retrofit the facility to the changed emphasis of
Cal Tech electrical engineering research programs. In addition, it will
consolidate researchers into one facility to work together on interdisciplinary
projects in communications and automatic control. All seven project faculty have
joined the faculty in the last ten years. Specific renovation activities include
construction of a unique high bay area to house a flexible structure experiment
as well as a distillation column of sufficient size to mimic actual industrial
problems. A local area network will be established to increase researcher
interaction and to overcome the inefficiencies associated with use of the campus
backbone system which is approaching maximum capacity. The project will have an
important impact on faculty growth and student enrollment, including minorities
and women, in the competitive area of communications and automatic control.
