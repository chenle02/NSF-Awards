This is an Equipment Grant Proposal. The purpose of this research is to collect
further data on the biomechanics of healing collagenous tissue. The focus is
centered on the factors which affect the return in strength of ligament and
tendon repairs and grafting procedures; several different types of interventions
will be assessed by measuring the mechanical and histological changes in the
repair or replacement of tendon material. These fundamental engineering research
studies will enhance the knowledge base of the material properties of healing
tissue.
