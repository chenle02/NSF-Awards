Three areas of computationaly efficient algorithms for design of IC's are under
investigation. 1. Algorithms for display of VLSI artwork: Sequential and
parallel algorithms to quickly display collections of polygons and lines on
popular display devices are being investigated. 2. When a VLSI design can be
modeled by graphs, it is often required to split or delete a set of vertices so
that the resulting graph will satisfy design criteria. Classes of graphs for
which the problems are polynomially solvable and methods for minimizing the
number of components in the resulting digraph are being determined. 3. Module
orientation and rotation problems for a variety of design styles are being
examined to determine which are NP-hard and polynomially solvable. Approximation
algorithms, heuristics, and polynomial algorithms are being developed for the
NP-hard problems.
