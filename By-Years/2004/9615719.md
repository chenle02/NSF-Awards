9615719 BENGTSON The pack ice region surrounding Antarctica contains at least
half of the world's population of seals, with population levels comprising about
eighty percent of the world' total piniped biomass. These seals are among the
dominant top predators in Southern Ocean ecosystems and the fluctuation in their
populations, patterns of growth and life histories provide a potential source of
information about environmental variability integrated over a wide range of
spatial and temporal scales. As top predators, seals are like to be sensitive to
changes in the dynamics of ecosystems and , in particular, variations in the
flux of photosynthetically fixed carbon to higher levels of the food web caused
by either climatic or ecological changes. To assess the functional significance
of these seals in Southern Ocean ecosystems, the Scientific Committee for
Antarctic Research, the scientific body which provides advice to the Antarctic
Treaty nations, developed a program focused on Antarctic Pack Ice Seals. This
workshop will bring together an interdisciplinary group of scientists to develop
research priorities for the US contribution to this international program. In
particular, the development of an interdisciplinary cruise plan, will move the
US forward in addressing important questions related to pack ice seals and their
environment.
