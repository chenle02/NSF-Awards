GER-9554591 Moharam The Center for Research and Education in Optics and Lasers
(CREOL) is an interdisciplinary academic center comprised of tenured and tenure-
track faculty at the University of Central Florida (UCF). Since its inception in
1986, the center has grown to become an internationally recognized center of
excellence in optics with 26 faculty, 25 PhD-level research scientists, and 70
graduate students. UCF offers PhD programs in Optical Physics, Optical Science
&amp; Engineering and Electrical Engineering with Specialization in Electro-
Optics. By innovative use of NSF and matching funds, CREOL proposes to recruit
20 new students over five years, from a diverse pool across the USA, into an NSF
Graduate Research Traineeship (GRT) program that will train PhDs in the
nationally critical field of optical science and engineering. To achieve this
end, each GRT student will participate in a research project, supervised by an
internationally recognized faculty researcher in one of the six subdisciplines
described in the proposal. These subdisciplines represent the new growth areas
of research in the center and those in which new faculty have recently been
hired. The GRT students will receive a training that will include instruction
and advisement by internationally recognized faculty, industrial internships,
instruction and practice in undergraduate teaching and interaction with students
and faculty from international locations.
