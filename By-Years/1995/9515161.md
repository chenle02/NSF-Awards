A Unified Information-Value Approach to Sensitivity Analysis Models of phenomena
in physical and social science are quite often subject to sensitivity analyses
in which analysts evaluate the effects (sensitivity) of the model to changes in
parameter values. As models become complex, however, such evaluations becomes
cumbersome, time consuming and, at times, suspect õ have all the relevant
combinations of parameter values been considered? This research will examine the
possibility of using the `expected value of perfect informationn on a parameter
or group of parameters as a measure of problem sensitivity to those parameters õ
a procedure which is both axiomatically sound and consistent with expected value
maximization. A retrospective analysis of standard sensitivity analyses will
also be conducted to see how conclusions reached using such methods compare with
those suggested by the `expected value of perfect informationn approach.
