continuation of its ongoing program to promote chemical inquiry based laboratory
instruction. The instrument is being used by students across the entire
departmental curriculum, from non-majors and students in related programs such
as pre-health sciences and pre-engineering through advanced courses for
chemistry majors. A emphasis is being placed on investigations of both naturally
occurring and synthetic mixtures in the consumer marketplace.
