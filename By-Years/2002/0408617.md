Chemistry (12) A 300 MHz NMR spectrometer is being utilized to incorporate a
broad range of modern NMR techniques across the undergraduate curriculum and in
research projects. Within the curriculum, it is facilitating a dramatic increase
in the use of hands-on NMR spectrometry in the organic chemistry laboratory,
where students are being introduced to 13C spectrometry at an early stage and
conduct two new guided inquiry laboratories and a project-based laboratory that
includes two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy. In upper division courses, a new
integrated NMR/chromatography experiment is being incorporated into the
analytical chemistry laboratory while new project-based experiments featuring
relaxation techniques and diffusion measurements are being implemented in the
physical methods course. We are also developing and teaching a new two-week,
all-day winter session course for chemistry majors entitled "Standard and modern
NMR techniques: A nuts and bolts hands-on workshop". Finally, the capabilities
of the NMR spectrometer are being used to support both ongoing and new
undergraduate research projects including molecular structure determination,
characterization of molecular motions and phase behavior in ionic liquids, and a
research collaboration with a local industry.
