There is general concern for the integrity of field measurements of reactive
atmospheric species that exist simultaneously in both the gas and aerosol phase.
This work permits comparison of the amine nitrogen of concurrently acquired
atmospheric gas and aerosol samples using the mist chamber and denuder
techniques. The experimental design focusses on identifying potential
gas/aerosol phase interactions which might compromise determination of discrete
phase distribution for reduced nitrogen compounds. In a broader sense, the
results of this study should enhance our understanding of processes involved in
atmospheric multiphase sampling. Preliminary measurements point to the
possibility that reduced organic nitrogen may be important basic components of
the atmosphere in regions not directly influenced by anthropogenic sources.
