Strauss, Michael 96-16901 Dr. Strauss plans to combine observational data and
theoretical analyses to constrain the standard model for the evolution of the
universe and its formation of structure. The observations include two all-sky
photometric and spectroscopic surveys of galaxies to measure the large-scale
bulk flow of galaxies. Also planned is a detailed statistical comparison of the
large-scale distribution of galaxies of different morphological types to
constrain physical models for the relatite distribution of galaxies and dark
matter. The final portions of the research are to compare the observed galaxy
density and velocity fields, to test the gravitational instability paradigm and
to constrain the Cosmological Density Parameter.
