This project is initiating an Industry/University Cooperative Research Center
for Software Engineering at the University of Florida and Purdu University as a
consortium. The initial research program for the Center will address: (1) front-
end languages for requirements definition, specification, and software design;
(2) intelligent programming environment; (3) software parts technology; (4) an
empirical basis for cost-effective; (5) large-scale software cost estimation;
(6) efficient implemenation strategies in team-oriented software development;
(7) principles of software engineering for adaptability; (8) environment for
developing reliable ADA programs; (9) graphics for software engineering.
