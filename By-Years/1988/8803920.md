Recent earthquake observations (e.g., 1985 Mexican Earthquake) confirm that
failures of buildings often involve the torsional mode of response. Study of the
data from the extensively instrumented buildings that appear quite symmetric.
This project, through the use of simple models, will investigate the observed
response of two low- rise buildings, in both the elastic and inelastic domains.
The studies also will investigate the response of these same buildings if
subjected to a stronger earthquake. Observations pertaining to provisions for
future building codes will be provided. The aim is to develop a better
comprehension of torsional effects arising from seismic base motion. This
research would clarify the not yet well understood phenomena of torsional
effects in the dynamic response of low-rise buildings.
