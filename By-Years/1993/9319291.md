In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Lon
Knight of Furman University will use electron spin resonance (ESR) techniques to
study small cluster cation radicals. The radicals will be generated in low-
temperature matrices using x-irradiation as well as synchronized pulsed
gas/pulsed laser vaporization. The experimental measurements will yield
electronic structure information which will be shared with theory groups for
collaborative analysis and interpretation. Study of a series of heavy-atom
diatomic radicals should aid in the development of ab initio spin-density
calculations. Information obtained from this work on small unstable ionized
molecules will be useful in determining the optimum conditions for fabricating
semiconductor microelectronic components, in identifying new interstellar
species, and in understanding reactions in the earth's upper atmosphere.
