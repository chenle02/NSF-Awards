9629072 Richards The PIs propose to hold an interdisciplinary Chapman conference
that brings together 80-100 scientists and students focused on identifying and
solving fundamental problems of plate tectonics and mantle dynamics. Recent
advances in geodynamic modeling and seismic imaging of the earth's interior
offer new possibilities for integrating knowledge of the history of plate
motions with these new results. The main purpose of the conference is to bring
together the plate reconstruction and mantle dynamics communities, which have
until now worked in isolation. Conference goals include: 1) fostering innovative
cross-disciplinary scientific interchange toward better integrating the
geological record of plate motions into geodynamic models, 2) improving
geodynamic models by integrating a more mature knowledge of the forces acting on
plates, 3) improving our understanding of the nature of plate boundaries, and 4)
developing a better understanding of the relationship between deep mantle
processes and global plate motions. ***
