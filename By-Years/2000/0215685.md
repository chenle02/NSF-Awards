This Major Research Instrumentation RUI grant supports acquisition of a
Mossbauer spectroscopy system that will be used to further understanding of the
structures and interactions that take place between tin-iron probe molecules and
different liquid crystal polymer systems. Mossbauer spectroscopy will be applied
to investigate the chemistry and structure of heterobimetallic polynuclear
compounds containing iron and tin. These iron-tin compounds will be used as
probe molecules to study the glassy phase of several liquid crystalline
polymeric materials. This investigation will be carried out by undergraduate
students involved in research projects directed by the chemistry and physics
faculty at Bloomsburg University and Fayette campus of the Pennsylvania State
University respectively. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The equipment provides the
capability to systematically investigate liquid crystal polymer systems by
introducing both orientational and translational order by using the
heterobimetallic and heterotrimetallic compounds. The equipment enhances the
undergraduate research programs at two institutions by giving the students the
ability to have hands-on experience with updated equipment. It will also be used
as part of an undergraduate instrumentation course giving students the
opportunity to learn the techniques of spectroscopy. &lt;br/&gt;
