9353957 Bouldin A five-day short course will be offered twice--once in
Knoxville, TN, and again in Sacramento. CA. The course introduces new techniques
for designing microelectronic systems that rely on rapid prototyping using
field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). Thus, a design can be taken from initial
specification to a working implementation involving all the steps in the design,
debugging, and evaluation cycle. Laboratory exercises permit each participant to
complete a project that can be taken back to their home institution. Also, each
participant receives a "starter kit" containing class notes, reprints, sample
completed projects and instructions on how to obtain donations of vendor
hardware and software.
