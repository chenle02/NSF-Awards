Abstract: EEC-9527527: This award provides funding to the University of
Tennessee, Knoxville (UT) for support of a Combined Research Curriculum
Development Program entitled, "Ceramic Matrix Composites (CMCs)". The CRCD
program emphasizes the need to incorporate exciting research advances in
important technology areas into the upper level undergraduate and graduate
engineering curricula and stimulates faculty researchers to place renewed, equal
value on quality education and curriculum development. This three year program
will integrate the long standing research advances, achieved by UT and the Oak
Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), on the materials science and mechanics of CMCs
into interdisciplinary undergraduate and graduate level curricula at UT. The
proposed program will be conducted at UT and ORNL under the supervision of Drs.
P.K. Liaw and N. Yu, assisted by three graduate students. In addition, a number
of distinguished UT faculty members and renowned ORNL scientists, who have
extensive research experience on CMCs have committed to participate in the
proposed program. Strong administrative commitment to the implementation of the
proposed program has been made by UT and ORNL and state of the art instructional
modules, such as an on line hypermedia textbook, will be developed for quality
teaching and learning.
