Abstract: DMS-0086688 PI: Fienberg, Stephen E

A special international conference, "Foundation of Statistical Inference:
Applications in the Medical and Social Sciences and in Industry and the
Interface with Computer Science", will be held in Israel at the conference
center at Kiryat Anavim near Jerusalem, on December 17-21, 2000. This conference
brings together leading experts in statistics and its applications to discuss
both the issues in the foundations of inference and their relevance to the many
and varied uses of statistics in the medical sciences, the social sciences, and
in industry. A similar conference was held in December 1985. A special focus at
this conference will be on the interface between statistics and computer
science. Funding will provide travel support for approximately 20 U.S. primarily
new researchers and members of underrepresented groups, and invited speakers and
participants. The KCS Program in the CISE directorate and the MMS Program in SBE
directorate is providing co-funding along with the Statistics Program in MPS.
