Descriptive complexity is an approach to complexity theory that measures the
richness of a language or sentence needed to describe a given property. The
language studied are variants of first-order logic and their targets are finite,
ordered structures. In this setting, there is a non-trivial relationship between
the traditional computational complexity of a problem and the descriptive
complexity of the problem. Indeed, all major complexity classes have been shown
to have natural descriptive characterizations. This project continues this
research into descriptive complexity by concentrating on the following four
research areas: (1) Order-independent languages; (2) First-order
interpretations; (3) Applications to databases and dynamic complexity; (4)
Trade-offs in descriptive complexity.
