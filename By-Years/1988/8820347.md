The proposed research is the continuation of a long range program aimed at
understanding the structure, properties and metabolic activities of the aqueous
compartments of animal cells: nucleoplasm, interiors of cytoplasmic membrane-
bound organelles, and the cytosol, or aqueous cytoplasm. Although these
compartments make up about 75% of the mass and volume of most cells, and are the
sites of much metabolic activity, very little is known about the details of
their properties and organization. Current work focuses on the aqueous
cytoplasm, and employs chiefly cultured mouse fibroblasts (L cells) which have
been permeabilized with dextran sulfate (DSP cells). They retain most
macromolecules that are released into the medium by harsher treatments
(detergent extraction or homogenization): those macromolecules commonly thought
to be freely dissolved ("soluble") in the aqueous cytoplasm. Retention of most
of these macromolecules in DSP cells occurs in spite of lesions ("pores") in
their plasma membranes that are large enough to allow them to escape. This
research is designed to test the hypothesis that most "soluble" macromolecules
defined by extraction and classical cell fractionation are not actually free in
intact cells but are instead organized, and associated loosely with the
cytomatrix. The hypothesis will be tested in DSP cells by an examination of the
enzymes of glycolysis (long believed to be "soluble") using a variety of
metabolic probes and high voltage electron microscopy. The efflux of these
enzymes (and proteins in general) from DSP cells exposed to treatments designed
to perturb postulated cytomatrix-enzyme associations will be studied by
electrophoretic and enzyme activity assays. Studies on DS permeabilization of
other cell types will also be initiated. Although little is known about the
organization of the cytoplasm of living cells at the macromolecular level, it
has long been overlooked as a subject of rigorous study because "cytoplasm" has
generally been regarded as a simple solution of proteins and small molecules.
Several lines of recent evidence from cell biology and biochemistry suggest that
this is an oversimplified and misleading view of the cell. The proposed research
will provide much needed data on the state of organization of proteins and small
molecules in cells and could lead to a fundamentally different and more
realistic concept of cellular structure and function.
