International crises and major ongoing internation disputes are a central topic
of concern for everyone. This project provides scientific theoretical
underpinnings to our understanding of the recurrence of major international
disputes. The goal is to study mathematical representations of dispute sequences
or histories by drawing together the work of the principal researchers in
international relations and embedding them in a framework that emphasizes common
ties, interests, interconnections, and relationships among nations.. By analytic
and computer explorations, attempts will be made to predict, for a sequence of
disputes, who will be a party to each dispute, what will happen in each dispute,
and how the outcome and details of each dispute will affect the relationships
among the nations involved. These predictions will then be used to examine a
number of major questions current in the international relations literature and
develop empirical tests using several of the datasets that have been compiled by
the National Science Foundation's project on Data Development for International
Research. This project goes beyond previous studies of internation conflict
because it examines dispute sequences, allows different nations to move in and
out of disputes from one time period to the next, and brings to the forefront
the important influence of relationships among nations.
