The objective of the program is to analyze the problem of thermal
elastohydrodynamic lubrication of rolling/sliding contacts and to develop an
expert system model to aid in the design process of tribo- systems. The
theoretical model will analyze each component of heat generation and dissipation
within the lubricant film and the rolling/sliding elements. Hence, the lubricant
operating temperature for prescribed boundary conditions is determined. The
pressure and temperature distributions developed in tribo-systems induce
mechanical and thermal stresses in the rolling/sliding elements. These stresses
could generate and propagate fatigue cracks in the machine elements. The
theoretical model will be used to predict the pressure distribution, the
temperature distribution, and the mechanical and thermal stresses generated due
to the pressure and temperature for different geometries, velocities, loads, and
lubricants.
