An early critical step during animal development is the separation of ectoderm,
cells that produce the epidermis (skin) and central nervous system (brain/spinal
cord), from endomesoderm, the cells that produce the intestine and internal
organs. In most animals this process is strongly influenced by a molecular
polarity present in the unfertilized egg termed the Animal-Vegetal (AV) axis. In
general, cells derived from the egg's animal pole produce ectoderm, while
vegetal pole-derived cells produce endomesoderm. This separation of
developmental potential is frequently mediated by localized activation of a
highly conserved signaling cascade called the canonical Wnt (cWnt) pathway. How
AV egg polarity regulates restricted activation of cWnt signaling at one pole of
embryos is not well understood, but the PI's group has shown that in sea urchins
and in the sea anemone Nematostella, this process occurs by the localized
'activation' of a key Wnt pathway protein called Disheveled (Dvl). Using
biochemical techniques the PI's group has identified candidate proteins that are
hypothesized to restrict Dvl activity to one end of the embryo. Hence, the goal
of this research is to use molecular methods to functionally analyze how the
identified candidate proteins regulate Dvl activity in sea urchins and
Nematostella. This work will elucidate the molecular mechanisms that regulate
the earliest separation of cell potential in animal embryos, and provide
critical insight into the development and evolution of complex animals. The
research involves graduate and undergraduate students, including students from
groups under-represented in science. Public outreach includes an ongoing program
with a local public high school teacher aimed at getting new immigrant students
from Haiti and Central and South America interested in biology.
