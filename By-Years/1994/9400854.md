Banuelos The investigator will study several problems which lie in the
intersection of probability and various areas of analysis. Specifically, subject
areas include extremal problems which are motivated from the study of Brownian
motion in simply connected planar domains; a geometric characterization ofr
intrinsic ultracontractivity for certain types of simply connected planar
domains; martingale inequalities and a conjecture of T. Iwaniec for the
Beurling-Ahlfors operator; and the zero Khintchin inequality for lacunary
trigonometric series. This award will provide funding to further study the
interrelationship between mathematical analysis and probability theory. Several
problems will be investigated dealing with geometry, operators, series and
Brownian motion. This should lead to a better understanding of these areas of
mathematics, especially as they relate to one another.
