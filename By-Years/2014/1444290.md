Leading researchers in the field of Neuroethology from around the world meet at
the International Congress of Neuroethology to share their research findings and
forge research collaborations that are critical in moving the discipline
forward. Research in neuroethology is at the cutting edge of neuroscience and
behavioral research with basic biological and health related implications. For
U.S. researchers to remain current, it is essential that they exchange ideas
directly with their international colleagues. The Congress will emphasis
comparative evolutionary approaches which meets the biodiversity initiatives of
NSF as well as fostering development of scientists that may be involved in the
Brain Initiative. The exchange of information among scientists during oral and
poster presentations is of great value, but equally important are the personal
exchanges and resulting collaborations established in the hallways between
sessions and during the numerous topic-based workshops and symposia scheduled
throughout the congress.

Funds provided by NSF will help support the attendance of future leaders of in
neuroethology and behavioral neuroscience. Specifically, recipients will be at
an early stage in their careers (e.g., graduate students, post-doctoral fellows,
and beginning investigators) and will be from U.S. institutions. The selection
committee will also strive to support individuals from groups that are
historically underrepresented. Assistance of such scientists will help forge
new, international collaborations, thereby creating long-term benefits for all
involved.
