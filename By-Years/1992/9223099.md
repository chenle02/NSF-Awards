We will continue our experiments on diffusion and segregation in polymer films,
exploiting the complementary depth profiling capabilities of forward recoil
spectrometry, nuclear reaction analysis, dynamic secondary ion mass spectrometry
and neutron reflectometry for polymer molecules labelled with deuterium.
Emphasis will be placed on understanding diffusion in microphase- separated
block copolymer melts with spherical morphologies, where we will investigate
both the diffusion of individual block copolymer chains and the diffusion of
micelles. Emphasis will also be placed on understanding surface segregation in
model mixtures of polymers, with both the details of the equilibrium
concentration profile and the kinetics with which such equilibrium profiles are
approached being of interest. Finally the influence of a surface attraction on
phase separation by spinodal decomposition in polymer films will be further
explored. The goals of this research are to develop new experimental methods for
investigating the fundamental aspects of diffusion in polymers and to use these
methods to critically test models of these processes. Diffusion of one polymer
into another plays an important role in a variety of industrial processes
ranging for melt blending of miscible polymers to friction welding and heat
sealing of plastics. Basic information on diffusion rates is also required to
allow predictions on the kinetics of phase separation in partially compatible
polymers and to permit comparison between theory and experiments on polymer
crystallization. On an even more basic level, diffusion measurements in polymers
are of interest for the light they can shed on the fundamentals of viscoelastic
processes ("molecular rheology") in polymer melts.
