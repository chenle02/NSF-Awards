This project uses satellite observations to analyze the impact of changes in
surface characteristics (e.g., land use, snow cover trends and urbanization) on
surface temperature variations. Typically global temperature is assessed with in
situ 2-meter air temperature measurements from weather stations, which are
usually located in populated regions where human activity causes disturbances
such that the temperature record may not be representative of the global land
surface. The use of satellite observations can provide an independent global
estimate of the surface temperature change over the last 25 years or so. This
project focuses on infrared-based skin temperature estimates from polar-orbiting
satellite instruments and includes cross-validation and calibration of the
satellite retrieval estimates. The PIs have done much work previously developing
methods to translate skin temperature to near-surface air temperature and have
applied this in a global mean sense. This project extends the developed
methodology to the scientific problem of trend detection and attribution on
regional and smaller scales. A key feature of this project is the effort to
connect observed land use changes to observable temperature trends. An
examination of uncertainties is also part of the plan. This activity will
support a graduate student at Georgia Tech and employ an undergraduate at U.
Maryland on an hourly basis to perform data processing. There are strong
implications for climate change assessment and attribution.
