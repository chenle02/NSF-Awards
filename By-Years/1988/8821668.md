The research proposed here would tackle a difficult problem ("heterogeneity")
which arises in the statistical modelling of relationships among concepts
measured in nonhomogeneous populations. In theoretically driven research in many
fields of social science, concepts have multiple measures and the measures are
related to each other and to concepts in ways that make estimation of statistics
and interpretation of results very difficult. Taking this much as given, this
proposal considers theadditional complications that arise when more than one
subpopulation has their opinions or attitudes measured (e.g., in public opinion
or educational research). This additional complexity calls for special methods
if practical problems in merely estimating unknown parameters are to be
addressed. This PIproposes to investigate the use of methods (e.g., multilevel
models) not typically used in past research. The PI is generally accepted as one
of the top scholars in this area of methodological research.
