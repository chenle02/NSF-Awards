9709712 Drake Recent identification of the deep origin of some inclusions from
diamonds opens a way to constrain the mineral and chemical composition of the
deep mantle through direct observation of these samples. The PIs propose to
determine the origin of selected inclusions by matching their major and trace
element chemistry in experiments under the P-T conditions of the transition zone
and lower mantle. They hope to identify the original assemblages and thus place
constraints on the chemistry of the source region. In addition, they will
develop a rapid in- situ X-ray technique for identifying inclusions in diamonds
from the deep mantle and thus obtain new samples for the future studies of their
origin. The proposed research is likely to increase substantially our
understanding of the composition of the deep mantle and its structure. ***
