Emergency response professionals and disaster researchers agree that emergency
planning is an important precondition for effective community response to
environmental emergencies. Unfortunately, hazard mitigation repeatedly has been
found to be a low priority activity because of perceptions of low hazard
vulnerability and the high cost of hazard mitigation. However, local emergency
planning committees (LEPCs) are a promising mechanism for promoting community
emergency planning. This study will investigate the structure and planning
effectiveness of such organizations. Results of this study will be relevant to
planning for toxic chemical releases caused by natural hazards such as
earthquakes and industrial accidents. In addition, the study results are
expected to illuminate many important issues associated with community planning
for a broad range of natural and technological hazards.
