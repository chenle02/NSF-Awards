Funding is requested for purchase of an X-ray fluorescence analyzer (XRF), the
Kevex EDX-771, to enhance our capabilities in quantification of environmental
data in undergraduate courses and undergraduate research in the fields of
Environmental Sciences, Geological Sciences, Biology, and Chemistry. The recent
establishment of an Environmental Sciences concentration (major) at Brown builds
on the expertise of faculty in these natural sciences and the established
policy-oriented Center for Environmental Studies. Joint use of the XRF would
encourage development of interdepartmental ties while strengthening the new
Environmental Science program.New environmental courses are being offered and
existing courses are evolving to a stronger field-analytical orientation. Access
to the XRF would give students in these courses the opportunity to perform
chemical analyses in lab exercises simulating natural processes, to analyze
natural materials, and to determine how limitations of the instrument constrain
our ability to solve certain problems. A senior thesis is required of all
Environmental Science and GeoScience majors and most science concentrators
choose at least one semester of independent research. Many of these research
projects will make excellent use of an XRF analytical facility.
