In order to understand the impact of energetic protons upon our atmosphere the
quantitative yield of emissions from energetic H atoms, as well as atmospheric
constituents such as O and O2, needs to be determined. To date there is a
paucity of such information and this grant is aimed at providing this
fundamental information in the ultraviolet, visible and near-infrared portions
of the spectrum using laboratory techniques and analysis of past laboratory
data. The study will determine the probability of emission of H (alpha), H
(beta) and L (alpha) from energetic hydrogen as well as other emissions arising
from the target specie, such as O, O2 or N2. In light of new data on the
importance of laboratory electric fields on the photon measurements in
laboratory cross-section experiments, much of the old particle collision
laboratory data will also be reevaluated. The overall aim of this research is to
understand the interaction of the auroral particle beam with the terrestrial
atmosphere.
