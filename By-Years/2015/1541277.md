This project investigates in much more detail the human anatomy and dynamics to
further progress in replicating human articulation capabilities. To overcome
long-standing imaging limitations, the project follows a data-driven approach,
in which sampled dynamic motion data is used to infer unknown parameters such as
soft-tissue geometry and behavior. The project is cross-disciplinary and driven
by specific problems in orthopaedics and human character animation, although its
focus is fundamentally on computational and automated analysis tools. The
research plan develops computational tools for capturing robustly and accurately
dynamic skeletal motion from medical images, for inferring biological shape and
behavior from dynamic motion information, and for representing and calculating
with these data. The education effort is naturally integrated with the research
work, and includes recruiting and training graduate, undergraduate, and high-
school students into multi-disciplinary work, through a modeling and simulation
approach to teaching computer graphics. The outcome of the project is a set of
human-anatomy based (i.e., humanoid) models of articulations that impacts
orthopaedists' understanding of articulation injury and disease, leads to
improved diagnosis and medical treatment, and improves the realism of digital
character animation. The broad impact of the project includes applications in
biology, bioengineering, ergonomics, evolutionary biology and robotics. Results
of this project, including software, data, and publications, are publicly
available through the project web site, http://vis.cs.pitt.edu/marai_nsf_career
