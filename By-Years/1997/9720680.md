9720680 Dushaw The project will use acoustic data obtained during the Acoustic
Mid-ocean Dynamics Experiment (AMODE) to study internal-tide properties in the
western North Atlantic. The initial part is to finish the work on antenna
properties of the tomography array. The results will be extended by calculating
the energy flux, and comparing that to tidal models. The data will be used to
examine the refraction of diurnal waves at turning latitude. Another goal is to
develop 2- and 3-D internal tide modeling capability to support the acoustical
observations. SEOM models will be used.
