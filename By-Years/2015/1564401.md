Approximation defines our world. For example, the letters on this screen have
smooth curves and bends. But zoom in and all you see are squares: pixels. The
smaller the pixels (i.e., the finer the approximation), the smoother a curve
looks. Add three colors and suddenly we can approximate a rainbow. In a sense,
science is all about refining and improving approximations to reality. Take
Newtonian physics, for example. It works great at medium scales, but breaks down
when things are too big or too small. Einstein's relativity and quantum
mechanics work much better at those scales. And these theories require
sophisticated mathematics. Operator algebras arose as a framework for quantum
mechanics. Over the years many classical theories were extended to this
noncommutative context: geometry, topology, probability and more. This focused
research group project addresses several outstanding questions in operator
algebras and their analogies in other areas of mathematics.

The PIs will spearhead an international effort to capitalize on recent
connections between operator algebras and other areas such as dynamics, measure
theory, coarse geometry and K-theory. Specifically, the PIs shall push analogies
between nuclear dimension and asymptotic dimension, two notions defined via
approximation and encompassing a huge swath of examples, to address K-theoretic
questions such as the Universal Coefficient Theorem and the Baum-Connes and
Farrell-Jones conjectures.
