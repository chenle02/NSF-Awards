9732152 This REU Site at the Medical University of South Carolina provides
opportunities for undergraduate students to become involved in research on
cellular signal transduction. Students will have opportunities to use a variety
of biological, chemical and biophysical approaches to study cell signaling
events including signaling molecules and their receptors functions, of surface
receptors, signal transduction pathways, and signaling in development and cell
differentiation. The approaches and structural tools used in the research
projects of the mentor faculty include DNA and protein sequencing, peptide
synthesis and purification, oligonucleotide synthesis, molecular imaging, mass
spectrometry, NMR spectrometry, light spectroscopies, bimolecular computing and
organic synthesis. In addition to the 10-week research projects, activities
including seminars, a journal club and social functions are designed to
stimulate student-faculty interaction and student communication. The REU Site
builds upon MUSC's strong continued commitment to research training,
demonstrated by provision of supplies, personnel costs, and two additional
student stipends to the program.
