The 27th Midwest Probability will be held at Northwestern University on October
21-22, 2005. The Principal Speaker, Robert Adler, will give a series of two
connected lectures on a recent theme of probability theory. The two Hour
Speakers are Alice Guionnet and Marek Biskup, who will also give talks on their
recent researches in probability theory. It is expected that 75-100 researchers
will participate in this two-day meeting.

The Midwest Probability colloquium serves are a regular get-together of
probabilists from the greater Midwest area, while allowing graduate students and
other researchers a chance to interact with specialists of similar interests. As
in the past, it is planned to continue to give the highest priority to people
without other support, especially to junior researchers and members of under-
represented groups including women, minorities and persons with disabilities.
