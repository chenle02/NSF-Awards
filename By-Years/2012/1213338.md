In this project, supported by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms
Program (CSDM) of the Division of Chemistry, Prof. Dor Ben-Amotz of Purdue
University and his graduate and undergraduate research students will use
hydration-shell vibrational spectroscopy (especially Raman scattering
spectroscopy), nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and other
experimental, computer simulation, and theoretical modeling strategies to
address key questions pertaining to water-mediated processes occurring molecular
interfaces, including how solute molecules influence water structure and how
such structure changes influence water-mediated chemical interactions.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results will be use to better understand and predict
how water participates in processes of relevance to the biological self-assembly
as well as green chemical manufacturing, geological petroleum recovery, and
environmental remediation. Besides the broad impact of the research on several
areas of science, Prof. Ben-Amotz will continue to provide his research students
with excellent training in the development and application of experimental and
theoretical tools and innovation strategies.
