Scowcroft's work, in mathematical logic, will center on constructive mathematics
and the model-theory of p-adic fields. Having found an effective test for the
constructive truth of propositions, in real algebra, of a bounded logical
complexity, Scowcroft hopes to isolate a convenient set of axioms for these
constructively true propositions. He also wants to learn whether first-order
real algebra in Dana Scott's model for intuitionistic analysis is recursively
undecidable. Scowcroft's new model for intuitionistic analysis may permit him to
develop a new model for first-order real algebra, and recent work on subanalytic
sets may allow him to extend his effective test for constructive truth to
propositions involving certain transcendental functions. In the model-theory of
p-adic fields, Scowcroft plans to study the properties of definable equivalence
relations, the differences in expressive power between the first-order languages
commonly used to describe a p-adic field, and the efficiency of quantifier-
elimination procedures for Macintyre's first-order theory of the p-adics. These
issues in the foundations of algebra bring modern mathematical logic to bear
upon another related area. Syntheses of this sort have been the source of some
of the most significant mathematics of our time.
