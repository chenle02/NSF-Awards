This grant supports expenses of U.S. graduate students and early career
researchers to attend the 2023 Atomic Physics Gordon Research Conference (GRC)
and Seminar, which brings together top researchers and future leaders in the
fields of atomic, molecular, and optical physics. The 2023 Gordon Research
Conference on Atomic Physics will be held June 11 to June 16, 2023 at Salve
Regina University in Newport, Rhode Island.

The Gordon Conference on Atomic Physics has a 50-year tradition of communicating
and stimulating the most exciting new research in atomic, molecular, and optical
physics. The 2023 conference session themes include entangled systems and
quantum computing, probes of gravity, tests of fundamental physics, atomic
clocks and the nature of time, quantum sensors and metrology, cold chemistry and
molecules, novel phases and properties of ultracold matter, and quantum and
nonlinear optics.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
