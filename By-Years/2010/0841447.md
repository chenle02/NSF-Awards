Understanding how diversity of life on earth grows is a fundamental goal of
evolutionary biology. To address this essential question, this research will:
(1) build an evolutionary tree (phylogeny) for muroid rodents (the most diverse
and successful group of mammals) using DNA sequence data from 550 muroid
species, (2) conduct anatomical studies of the skulls of those species using 3D
imaging tools, and (3) combine the anatomical results with the phylogenetic
results to determine when and where different lineages diversify, in terms of
numbers of species and modifications of the skull and dentition. The results
will determine which mechanisms - adaptation, colonization of new areas, or
changes in inherent "evolvability" - cause diversity to
increase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will also have broad utility to the
biomedical sciences because the muroid rodents include most of the species used
in biomedical research (e.g., mouse, rat, hamster). Understanding their
evolutionary history can profoundly change how we interpret those studies. The
phylogeny will also serve as a road map for choosing new species for biomedical
studies. In addition, the research team will train several post-doctoral
researchers, graduate students, undergraduate students, and high school students
in DNA sequencing, morphological analysis, and phylogenetics.
