The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project it to help
implement networks that are less likely to fail or can recover more quickly
under failure, thus providing a more reliable networking infrastructure. The
project targets software-defined networks, which promise improved network
functionality, but have seen slower-than-expected deployment due to the lack of
network management solutions. Bringing a novel fault detection and traceback
system to market may have significant impact on the software-defined network
management business.

This I-Corps project aims to develop a commercialization plan for a network
management and troubleshooting tool for software-defined networks. The
technology aims to provide network operators with improved network visibility.
Software-defined networks are very dynamic, which provides network operators
with the capability and flexibility to program the network, but at the cost of
more complex troubleshooting. The methodology used in our technology uses
network state in such a way that enables operators to visualize the evolution of
their network, resulting in faster root cause analysis when network faults
occur.
