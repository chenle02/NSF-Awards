In this one-year U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research project in organic chemistry
between Bozo Plesnicar, University of Ljubljana and Glen Russell and Tom Barton,
Iowa State University and J.C. Martin, Vanderbilt University, the investigators
will study the chemistry of organic saturated compounds, polyoxy and peroxy.
This topic is of continuing interest in organic chemistry as peroxides are
widely used in idustrial chemical processes (oxidants, bleaching agents,
polymerization initiators). This project was approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint
Board on Cooperation in Science and Technology and is supported through a joint
fund consisting of matching contributions from the governments of the United
States and Yugoslavia. The U.S. contribution is provided annually by the
Department of State. No NSF funds are involved. Grants are made to the principal
scientific institution in Yugoslavia, but include dollar funds for U.S.
scientist travel to Yugoslavia and for Yugoslav scientists' living expenses in
the U.S.
