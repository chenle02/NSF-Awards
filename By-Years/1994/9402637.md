9402637 Baartmans The second Upper Michigan Workshop on Codes, Designs, and
Geometries will be held in Michigan's Upper Peninsula in July 1994. This four
day workshop will cover the latest results on Designs, Codes, and Finite
Geometries. The workshop leaders will include some of the world's premiere
experts in these areas. The mathematical objects that mathematicians call
Designs, Codes and Geometries form the basic structures many scientists use to
classify things. Through the study of the structure of these simple objects,
mathematicians provide these other scientists with hints about the nature of
their classification schemes. Also, these mathematical objects can have their
own direct applications. Mathematical codes, for example, are an essential part
of electronic communication. They are the basic building block in Compact Disks
and Computer Modems.
