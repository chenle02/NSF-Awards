The continued growth and expanded applications in engineering, economics, and
sciences have greatly increased the need for advanced computational methods for
solving some highly complex nonlinear complementary problems and variational
inequalities. The proposed investigation will focus on several major aspects:
(a) foundational---convergence properties and posteriori error analysis of new
and existing solution methods, (b) numerical--- computer implementation and
testing and software development of new algorithms, and (c) practical---the
efficient solution of important classes of engineering and economics problems.
The class of mathematical programs with equilibrium constraints will also be
investigated. ***
