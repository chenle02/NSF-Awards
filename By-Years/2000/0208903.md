This project investigates gestural communication in collaborative physical
tasks, tasks in which two or more individuals work together to perform actions
on concrete objects in the three-dimensional world. For example, an expert might
guide a worker's performance of emergency repairs to an aircraft, students might
collaborate to build a science project, or a medical team might work together to
save a patient's life. Observations of physical collaborations in face-to-face
settings have suggested that gesture plays an important role in communication
and task performance. To date, however, video systems for remote collaboration
on physical tasks have rarely incorporated technologies to support gesture. The
project has three aims: (a) to increase our understanding of the types and
functions of gestures in collaborative physical tasks in face-to-face settings;
(b) to systematically evaluate the impact of alternative methods for
implementing gesture in systems for remote collaboration on physical tasks; and
(c) to develop and test prototype gesture systems. A closely inter-related
series of laboratory experiments, field studies, and technology development
efforts will be used to meet these aims. Taken together, these research
activities will improve the design of systems for remote collaboration in
medical, educational, vehicular repair, and other physical domains.
