This proposed research uses a multidimensional approach to validating the
constructs of student achievement in high school mathematics and science. It
elaborates and indicator of student achievement to enhance the validity of large
scale education surveys. Specifically it identifies knowledge and reasoning
components of mathematics and reasoning test that are both multiple choice and
constructed response using the NELS:88 High School Effects Study (HSES). It
analyses the constructed response tasks for con students of different gender and
ethnicity's: it extends the construct approach to the National Assessment of
Education Progress (NAEP) and develops improved procedures for conduction
interview studies in item construct validation. It also will develop guidelines
for other investigators who apply multidimensional scoring of student test.
