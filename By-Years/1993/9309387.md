9309387 Iglesias Research is proposed on investigating a minimum entropy H-inf
control problem for discrete-time, time-varying systems. For linear time-
invariant systems, these controllers have shown to be a very useful tool for
designing practical controllers because they provide a simple way of integrating
the robustness of H-inf controllers with the performance of linear quadratic
Gaussian optimal controllers. The main theme of the proposed research is to use
some very recent developments in the representation of time-varying discrete-
time systems in order to develop a complete theory for several problems in H-inf
control for time-varying systems. Part of the analysis will include the recently
introduced W-transform which is a generalization of the usual Z- transform. In
addition to the minimum entropy control problem, we will consider H-inf control
for time-varying systems defined over an infinite time interval, as well as a
modification of the H-inf control problem in which the future time variations of
the plant are not known. The proposed research is expected to result in a new
design methodology for linear time-varying systems that has improved performance
as compared to the standard H-inf design, and improved robustness as compared to
the standard LQG design. An additional benefit of the proposed research is that
the theory will strengthen the interconnections between operator theory and
H-inf control. ***
