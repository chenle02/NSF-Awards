The fast-paced world of rapid-fire TV commercials, action movies and dynamic
video games does not prepare college students for sitting in a statistics
lecture and absorbing the material presented on a subject that seems remote and
difficult. Yet, quantitative reasoning skills are essential if these students
are to be capable of filling the jobs necessary to keep America competitive in
the world economy and of making crucial decisions on issues affecting societal
advancement. Traditional statistics courses do not build on the interests and
culture of the students to get them actively involved in the learning of the
subject. This project is revising, through creative use of technology, the
content, conduct and quality of introductory statistics courses so as to improve
the quantitative reasoning skills of all undergraduates. This is being
accomplished through a series of computerized units that allow students to
"discover" basic concepts of statistics while engaged in hands-on activities at
a computer work station. Such an exploratory, discovery-based approach to
learning statistics requires that the course be taught with a computer
laboratory.
