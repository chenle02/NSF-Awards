CARTER 9730381 This award provides funding for an Engineering Research Centers
(ERC) Program/Centers for Research Excellence in Science and Technology (CREST)
Program Partnership between the Engineering Research Center for Computational
Field Simulation at Mississippi State University (MSU) and Florida A&amp;M
University and Florida International University CREST Center for Distributed
Computing, entitled "An ERC-CREST Partnership in Distributed and Computational
Systems." This partnership will be initially founded on collaboration in four
research projects: (1) The Hector Run-Time Environment; (2) Data Compression and
Visualization using Wavelets; (3) Engineering Distributed and Parallel Software;
and (4) Application of Parallel Computing Environments to Molecular Reaction
Theory. The partnership will increase interactions and improve the educational
experiences of students at all three institutions with the additional exposure
serving to attract more students, particularly minority students into research
careers.
