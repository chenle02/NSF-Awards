The area of computer networks is very broad and is growing larger each day.
Typical undergraduate courses in the field only address basic principles and do
not have the scope to cover internetworking, security, client server computing,
and high speed networks. The first course gives little or no experience working
with a real network and does not prepare students for jobs in networking, even
though there is a growing demand for network administration. This project is
developing a second course in networking from the point of view of a system
administrator, and addresses the deficiencies of the first course in preparing
students both for careers and graduate work. Students are working with the
network equipment found in many corporations today and discussing in class the
theory behind this equipment. Students are performing some tasks done by system
administrators today and working on experiments to help prepare them for the
near future. *
