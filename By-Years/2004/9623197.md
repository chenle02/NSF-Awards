9623197 LI, W-S The purpose of this project is to obtain a better understanding
of the structure of bounded linear operators acting on a complex, separable,
infinite dimensional Hilbert space. During the past sixteen years, the theory of
dual algebras has provided us considerable knowledge for the dilation theory of
contraction operators, the invariant subspace problem, and the reflexivity
problem. The principal investigator plans to continue this program, focusing now
on more general classes of operators and dual algebras generated by more than
one operator. At the same time, the principal investigator will also continue
her research on control theory via the commutant lifting theorem. In addition,
she will also continue her study of the class of C-0 operators. My current work
is in operator theory, in particular studying the structure of linear operators
on Hilbert spaces. These operators appear in many mathematical models, which are
used in physics, economy, engineering, etc.. Therefore, a better understanding
of these operators is of fundamental importance since it should lead in
improving these models as well as the qualities of the simulations and forecasts
made out them.
