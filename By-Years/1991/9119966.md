This research will concentrate on radical-based organoantimony chemistry,
relying on the coordination of metal centered radicals by an adjacent hetero
atom prior to intramolecular iodine atom transfer from carbon to antimony.
Tetraphenyl distibine, diphenylstibine and allyl(diphenyl)stibine will be
examined as selective reagents for the conversion of alkyl halides,
chalcogenides and other precursors into alkylstibines, alcohols, compounds
bearing allylic substituents, nitroalkenes and ethers. The methods will be
extended to other antimony reagents, to other Group V elements and to tin(IV)
compounds bearing electron withdrawing ligands. These studies will clarify the
mechanism of radical selectivity and provide a new strategy for synthetic
chemistry that will be applied to the concise synthesis of several natural
products. %%% With this renewal award, the Synthetic Organic Program is
supporting the research of Dr. Anthony G.M. Barrett of the Department of
Chemistry at Colorado State University. Dr. Barrett will focus his work on the
development of selective synthetic methodology based upon metal centered
radicals generated from antimony compounds.
