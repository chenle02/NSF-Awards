The project aims at the development of an integrated assessment system for
exploring interactions of climate change and land use on the steppes of Mongolia
and Inner Mongolia, northern China. the methodology combines remote-sensed
vegetation indices with simulation modeling and ground truth analysis. Results
will be interpreted from both scientific and policy perspectives. The goal of
the study is to provide a means (the integrated assessment system) for
determining how regional patterns of climate and land use interact to influence
ecosystem dynamics and human utilization potential. The assessment system will
be based on a spatially explicit GIS simulation model (SAVANNA). Integration of
NDVI data will provide for the generation of ecosystem stability and resilience
indices, and will allow evaluation of climate-land use interactions and impacts.
The completed assessment system will be used to explore probable effects of
future climate changes on ecosystem properties and human land use. Alternative
policies for responding to climate change will be assessed
