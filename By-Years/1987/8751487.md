This three-year teacher preparation project will develop and evaluate a model
for recruiting and preparing midcareer persons to teach secondary school science
and mathematics. Mills College and the Lawrence Hall of Science (University of
California, Berkeley) faculties will address the issues of the critical shortage
of well-qualified secondary science and mathematics teachers through an
innovative two-year graduate Midcareer Mathematics and Science Program (MCMS).
The aims of the program are to: (1) attract midcareer persons with strong
academic and applied backgrounds in mathematics and science; (2) develop model
subject update and methods courses for the midcareer population; (3) implement a
preservice teacher education program specifically tailored to these midcareer
candidates. The new model courses will emphasize recent developments and
applications in the fields of mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology and
their relationships to the high school curriculum; the integration of concepts
within and across fields; and hands-on, interactive teaching strategies
developed in subject-specific methods classes and in school-based experiences.
Course development, implementation of the model program, and evaluation of
program effects will lead to a self-sufficient component of the Mills College
credential program, to technical reports of program development and effect, and
to instructional materials which can be implemented at other sites.
