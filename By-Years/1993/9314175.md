9314175 Lopez This Americas Program award will support Prof. Hugo Lopez of the
University of Wisconsin in a research collaboration with Prof. Lorenzo Martinez
of the Materials Laboratory of the Institute of Physics of the National
Autonomous University (UNAM) of Mexico. The researchers will investigate the
performance of an X-80 steel in sour environments, particularly at temperatures
above 100 degrees C. They aim to obtain a full characterization of the
microstructure and strength of received and heat-treated steels, and expose
fracture-mechanics specimens to sour environments by means of direct current
electrical potential drop methods for continuous monitoring of crack growth.
Steel microstructure characterization will be done at UNAM while the U.S. side
will focus on the continuous monitoring of crack propagation rates under sour
gas environments. Expected outcomes of this work include the determination of
the influence of temperature on steel resistance to sour environments,
correlation of steel properties and microstructural features with conditions for
crack growth and severity of damage, and further insights on the role of
alloying additions and steel strength on its susceptibility to cracking under
various testing environments. ***
