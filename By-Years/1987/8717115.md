The objective of this study is to develop a consistent conceptual framework for
the identification and measurement of damages and losses that result from
natural hazard events such as tornadoes, floods and earthquakes. For this
purpose a set of categories of impacts such as primary and secondary economic,
and ecological and environmental impacts will be identified, and the associated
measurement methodology will be developed. The results of this research will
benefit governmental and private administrators, managers and professionals in
the area of hazards mitigation, by providing consistent and/or normalized
damage/loss data and guidelines for the impact data collection. Consistency of
data across hazards will help the development of economic planning, and hazards
mitigation, prevention and response strategies.
