EAGER: A Novel Approach to Study Earth's Oldest Environments and Biosphere:
Tidal, Shelf, and Deep Ocean Habitats in the &gt;3.7 Ga Isua Greenstone Belt,
Greenland&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nora Noffke, Old Dominion
University&lt;br/&gt;EAR-1232499&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Isua Greenstone Belt
(IGB), Greenland, comprises the oldest, &gt;3.7 Ga sediments preserved in Earth
history. Until now the firm dogma is that all IGB rocks would be highly
metamorphosed and therefore information on Earth's oldest paleoenvironment and
the origin of life would be erased or so strongly masked that no firm
conclusions can be drawn. This project allows analyses demonstrating the IGB
constitutes a valuable archive on Earth's deepest time. Linda Hinnov's newly
developed methods allow the PIs to reveal this unique information by analyzing
bedding characters in shallow-marine deposits. The results will allow the
understanding of the Earth-Moon constellation 3.7 Ga ago, the number of days per
year, and possibly seasonality.
