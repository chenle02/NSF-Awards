The PI and the co-PI study how l o c a l properties affect the g l o b a l
parameters of various combinatorial structures. This is a very general framework
of the so-called Turan number problems. The PI and the co-PI emphasize five
different aspects: Turan numbers of triple systems, cardinalities of hereditary
families, geometrical/algebraic representations of graphs where Turan numbers
naturally emerge, they study more general coding theory problems, and
investigate random combinatorial structures, especially the phase transition of
various models of bootstrap percolation.

Combinatorics, in other words Discrete Mathematics, studies finite, but large
structures, many of them arising from computer science. Combinatorics is the
theoretical basis of coding theory, computer graphics, computer science,
cryptography and communication theory. Combinatorists are looking for
economical, fast and reliable ways to store and search data structures. A wide
variety of combinatorial problems deal with l o c a l properties, or use local
probabilities in order to determine (or estimate) global parameters to describe
the bigger picture. This effect of local properties on global parameters is the
subject of this proposal.
