Title: CISE RR: Processing and Display of Volume Images and High Resolution
Image Sequence

This proposal, acquiring resources for real-time processing and display of
large volume imagery and high resolution image sequences, aims at supporting
collaborative research projects in compressing and analyzing extremely large-
scale images and high-bandwidth video. The infrastructure supports the
collection and display of high-resolution imagery as well as the image
processing computations. Moreover, it enables improved data transmission over
gigabit network. Medicine, terahertz radiation sensing, and hyperspectral
imagery, and digital cinema constitute the sources of the research. The
equipment, to be placed in the Center for Image Processing Research (CIPR),
supports the following collaborative research projects. Volume and Hyperspectral
Image Compression, Terahertz Image Processing, Multispectral Imaging in Electron
Microscopy, Transparent Migration of Complex Scientific Computing Software to
Real-Time Execution, Digital Cinema Compression, Remote Collaboration
Environment, and Human Fatigue Monitoring and Machine Parts Tolerancing.
