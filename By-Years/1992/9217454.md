Two methods of Arbitrarily Primed Polymerase Chain Reaction (AP-PCR) for the
development of molecular markers for populations and species of marine
phytoplankton will be examined. These are Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA
(RAPDtm) and transfer RNA-PCR (tRNA-PCR). Preliminary data obtained using the
eucaryotic picoplankter. Nannochloropsis spp. (Eustigmatophyceae) provide
supportive evidence of the utility of these methods.
