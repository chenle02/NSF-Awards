Abstract&lt;br/&gt;A new type of actuation device has been conceptualized that
meets the needs of large 1) displacement, 2) force and 3) bandwidth within a
package more compact than currently available magnetostrictive and stack-type
piezo actuators of similar rating. The actuation mechanism relies on micro-scale
electrohydrodynamic (EHD) pumping of a dielectric liquid with a small
concentration of free charges. &lt;br/&gt;Analytical and numerical studies have
shown the EHD-pumped actuator to be capable of delivering equal force and
bandwidth to magnetostrictive and stack-type piezo actuators of the same size,
but with considerably greater displacement. Research is proposed to further
analyze the new concept to establish a parametric understanding of the actuator
with respect to geometry, fluid, and temperature constraints. Research is also
proposed to experimentally verify the viability of the promising concept. A
multitude of prototypes will be designed, fabricated, and tested to provide
experimental benchmarking of the model predictions. &lt;br/&gt;It is envisioned
that 1) tools for the design, fabrication, and deployment of the EHD pumped
actuator, 2) working prototypes providing force, bandwidth, and size
capabilities superior to comparable magnetostrictive and piezo type devices will
be developed. It is expected that these actuators will substantially impact the
field of active sound and vibration control&lt;br/&gt;
