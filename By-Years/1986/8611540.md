This research is a fundamental biochemical engineering study on the
purification, biochemical characterization, and the reaction kinetics and
mechanisms of enzymes involved in the biosyntheses of beta-lactam antibiotics.
The overall biochemical characteristics and basic reaction kinetics and
mechanisms of those enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of beta-lactam
antibiotics and further apply the knowledge base to be acquired from this
research to the improvement of fermentation process and/or development of new
and direct in-vitro enzymatic processes for production of existing and novel
beta-lactam antibiotics derivatives. During the initial phase of the research,
efforts will focus on the purification and characterization of those key enzymes
involved in the ring formation and ring expansion reactions of beta-lactam
antibiotics.
