This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project will develop advanced,
nano-engineered thermal spray powders for producing composite coatings with
revolutionary enhancements in performance. The Phase I project demonstrated the
production of high volume reinforced (25-65 wt % SiC) aluminum and nickel matrix
composite materials using CVD fluid bed coated powders and low cost
consolidation techniques. Dramatic increases in flexure strength and modulus
were achieved, with results showing greater than 5% (80% increase) ductility and
a 600% increase in flexural strength compared to current metal matrix composite
state of the art. A greater understanding of the nano-engineered particles being
produced, and the relationship between nano-structural features and the
resulting mechanical property improvements will be developed leading to
repeatable, predictable performance and application to additional composite and
coatings systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial potential will be for
producing low cost; high volume fraction consolidated spray-deposited composite
systems with significant improvements in mechanical properties and desired
physical properties for structural and corrosion applications for the electronic
industry.
