The research group of Professor Bernath is supported by the Physical Chemistry
Program in an ongoing spectroscopic characterization of novel high-temperature
molecules. Information is being obtained on the electronic, vibrational, and
rotational properties of metal-containing free radicals. This research program
is exploring new and unusual chemistry involving metal vapor reactions with
organic oxidants. Work exploring the reactions of alkaline earth atoms (Ca, Sr,
Ba) and various organic molecules is being extended to other metals (Mg, Al, Zn,
Ag, and Cu). Laser-driven vapor phase chemistry and laser-induced fluorescence
detection is being used to study many new and unusual molecules, including
single-metal single-ligand free radicals.
