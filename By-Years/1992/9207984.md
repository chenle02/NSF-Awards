This study will use nuclear and mitochondrial rDNA sequence information to
assess phylogenetic relatedness of organisms derived from the various ancestral
groups of present day Oomycota. The utility of these molecules for studying
relationships will be evaluated at different taxonomic levels. Inferences will
be derived concerning which groups are monophyletic relative to ancestors of the
Chromista (Cavalier- Smith 1986-includes Chrysophyceae, Xanthophyceae,
Bacilliarophyceae etc.) and should, therefore, be included in a revised
Oomycota. Phylogenetic schemes based on molecular data will be used to test
those based on other existing non-molecular characters. Preliminary molecular
analyses and those based on zoospore ultrastructural characters have resulted in
the same phylogenetic relationships among the groups in common and this approach
can provide the truest understanding of their phylogenetic relationships. The
relationships of these groups to other protist lineages will provide a pivotal
framework for examining and predicting every aspect of their biology and will be
highly useful in selecting a suite of appropriate characters for further
phylogenetic investigations in this and related groups.
