Improving the fields of tissue engineering and drug/gene delivery is of great
interest because these areas are expected to have a significant impact in the
medical field and the quality of life for many people. Of particular interest
are: healing rates of tissue injuries, the synthesis of frameworks that organ
tissue can be grown on, and side effects from inefficient drug delivery, among
other areas. Peptide-polymer conjugates, which are a class of biomaterials that
contain a peptide sequence (a specific arrangement of amino acids) coupled to a
polymer, can be used to improve these biomedical applications. Some peptides
arrange into fibers or penetrate cellular membranes, and coupling a polymer will
allow for additional properties to be introduced that the peptides do not
possess. This research will investigate the coupling efficiency of a variety of
peptides and polymers in collaboration with Dr. Sebastien Perrier, who leads one
of the most successful research laboratories for synthesis of peptide-polymer
conjugates in Monash University in Australia.

Peptides are capable of self-assembling into fibers and sheets, in addition to
penetrating cellular membranes by judicious choice of amino acid sequence. The
inclusion of a polymer to either end of the peptide sequence allows for
additional functionality to be introduced that amino acids do not possess. This
allows for potential improvement of biological functions or the transport of
drugs. This project will investigate a series of peptides that are known to
self-assemble and undergo gelation or penetrate cellular membranes, and polymers
that are either anionic or hydrophobic to aid in biomineralization or drug
delivery. The conjugation efficiency between the proposed peptides and polymers
using various ?click? chemistry or conjugation pathways will be investigated.
This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Australian Academy of
Science.
