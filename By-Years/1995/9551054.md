This project centers on the introduction of modern infrared spectroscopy into
the chemistry curriculum, beginning in the general chemistry laboratory and
proceeding to the organic laboratory. General chemistry students are using FT-IR
spectroscopy in both the first and second semesters of the laboratory, in the
context of group-based open-ended research projects. The sophistication of their
observations and uses of the spectra will progress as students increase their
chemical knowledge. Even those students who do not go on to take any more
chemistry (the majority) will have had quite extensive exposure to modern
instrumentation by the end of two semesters of chemistry. FT-IR is also being
used in the organic laboratories in a newly developed curriculum that extends
the developments made in the general chemistry labs.
