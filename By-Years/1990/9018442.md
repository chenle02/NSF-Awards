This award provides one-half the funding required for the acquisition of a
computer system that will installed in the Department of Geology and Geophysics
at Yale University and used primarily by the seismology and geodynamics faculty
and their students. Yale University is committed to providing the remaining half
of the funding. The added computing power of the system will be applied to
problems of mantle rheology, convection in the Earth's core, seismic anisotropy
modeling, free oscillations of the Earth, global scale seismic tomography, and
other computing-intensive geophysical research projects.
