The Bacterial Collection of the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) is one
of the most comprehensive and diversified assemblages of bacteria in the world.
It functions as a national and international "microbiological bureau of
standards" by distributing well-characterized reference strains to the
scientific, educational and industrial communities. The Collection presently
maintains over 14,000 strains and distributed more than 37,000 cultures in 1988.
Previous support from the National Science Foundation has permitted the
development of a comprehensive battery of characterization tests for the various
taxa and the authentication of the Collection's strains. Data derived from these
programs have been used to develop a microbial strain database which serves as
an information resource center for the entire bacteriological community on
nomenclature, preservation techniques, strain applications, phenotypic
properties and quality control procedures. The database is also used to compile
the ATCC Catalogue of Bacterial Strains, which includes information on media and
special applications of strains. This award provides a partial operational
subsidy for the maintenance of the Collection, further implementation of the
computerized on-line strain database, publication of the strain catalog and the
acquisition of additional bacterial strains with special application to
biotechnology.
