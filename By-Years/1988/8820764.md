Professor Andrews is supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program in
a continuing investigation of the molecular structure and the spectroscopy of
various weakly-bound or very reactive species trapped at low temperature in
frozen rare gas matrices. Fundamental information is learned about many unusual
chemical intermediates that would react or dissociate too quickly to be
observable under most conditions. His research group will use fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy to study unusual hydrogen-bonded complexes involving
hydrogen fluoride molecules, novel and unstable oxides and sulfides of various
elements, and complexes of several metal atoms with benzene and ethylene. They
will also use infrared chemiluminescence techniques to probe the dissipation to
the matrix of excess energy from the photolysis-induced initiation of various
exothermic reactions occuring within the matrix.
