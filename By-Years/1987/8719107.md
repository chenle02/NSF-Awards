Impairment of memory is one of the most common and most perplexing signs of
aging. The goal of this research project is to gain an understanding of the
nature of how these memory deficits occur with advancing age. Drs. Morrell and
deToledo Morrell are using an animal model of aging--a strain of rat which has a
specific and identifiable memory impairment which occurs as the animal
approaches the end of its expected lifetime: These animals show progressive
performance deficits in their ability to learn spatial cues as they age. One of
the most promising areas of research regarding the location in which memories
are formed is the hippocampal formation, a region of the limbic forebrain which
has been shown to be involved both in human and in animal memory functions. The
nature of this memory deficit is being extensively characterized by the use of
both spatial and non-spatial tasks (spatial tasks appear to be dependent upon a
functional hippocampal formation, whereas non-spatial tasks are not). This
specific deficit is measured by performance in a radial arm maze, a spatial
task. An interdisciplinary team of investigators is exploring three major
correlates of this memory deficit, by examining changes in: 1) synaptic
morphology (the locus of connections between nerve cells). Modification of
synaptic circuitry is examined in several sub-fields within the hippocampal
formation by using new stereological methods of electron microscopy. 2) long
term potentiation an electrophysiological correlate of synaptic plasticity), and
3) receptor biochemistry (by quantitative autoradiographic techniques which
identify biological markers of the age- related memory loss). Finally, these
investigators are examining the mechanism by which a new drug (pentoxifylling)
appears to be capable of at least partially reversing this age-related memory
loss. Research at this level contributes not only to our understanding of the
processes by which learning and memory occur, but also provides insights into
the basic physiological mechanisms by which these processes decline with age.
