This award, in the Small Grants for Exploratory Research mode, supports initial
explorations of the use of acoustic conduction properties to differentiate among
materials. The focus of the exploration is an initial determination of the
potential for the acoustics-based approach to produce useful information about
material properties, while invariant to object shape. Useful analogs will be
sought from results on visual invariants. If it is found that there are acoustic
features that are shape invariant, then longer-term research in this area may
lead to new robotic sensing systems with more capabilities for guiding materials
handling opreations.
