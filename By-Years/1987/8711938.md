The atmosphere below 100km altitude is in a state of continual motion, and the
winds and waves in it can be measured by radar measurements of the scattering
from small scale inhomogeneities it contains. To obtain echoes from below about
80km an operating frequency of about 40Mhz is used, while from the region
80-100km a frequency of 2-3Mhz is optimum. One of each type of radar is to be
upgraded and put into operation at the Urbana field station of the University of
Illinois. Scientific issues to be addressed include the statistical
characteristics of stratospheric and mesospheric gravity waves, tropospheric
frontal dynamics, and dynamics of narrow turbulent layers and momentum deposited
in the mesosphere. Observations will be made in conjunction with the Flatland
meteorological radar and the day/night sodium lidar systems in the immediate
vicinity. The PI and his group at the University of Illinois are well known
nationally and internationally for their output of high quality work, which has
been up to the present mainly theoretical, but is now to be rounded out with an
experimental effort.
