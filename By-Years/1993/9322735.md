Proposal #: 93-22735 The PI requests funding to purchase shipboard
instrumentation in support of NSF-funded research. The instruments will be used
aboard the R/V CAPE HENLOPEN, a 120 foot vessel, which is owned and operated by
the University. Instrumentation requested includes computer hardware for the
shipboard computer system, a profiling radiometer, electronic boards for the
ADCP, and upgrades to the thermosalinograph. The instrumentation requested is
required for support of NSF-funded cruises aboard the CAPE HENLOPEN during 1994
and will enhance the scientific capability of the vessel in the future.
