The annual Geometry Festival is one of the main conferences in the area of
Geometry- Topology. Its aim is to expose and explain the major recent
accomplishments in the field to a diverse audience of interested students and
faculty, and to advance discoveries in the field by bringing together present
and future experts in a supportive atmosphere, with special attention to and
financial support for under-represented groups, graduate students, and young
faculty.

Since 1985, the Geometry Festival has been held in rotation at the University of
Pennsylvania, the University of Maryland, the University of North Carolina, the
State University of New York at Stony Brook, Duke University, New York
University's Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, and Northeastern
University
