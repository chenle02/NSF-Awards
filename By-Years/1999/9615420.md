This award is for support for a four year program to study the basal conditions
of ice stream D using techniques previously applied to ice stream B. The
objective is to determine whether the physical conditions and processes to be
observed by borehole geophysics at the base of this large ice stream are
consistent with what has been observed at ice stream B and to point to a common
basal mechanism of ice streaming. This project includes a comparison between two
parts of ice stream D, an upstream reach where flow velocities are modest (about
80 meters/year) and a downstream reach of high velocity (about 400 meters/year).
The comparison will help to reveal what physical variable or combination of
variables is mainly responsible for the streaming flow. The variables to be
monitmred by borehole observation include basal water pressure, basal sliding
velocity, flow properties and sedimentological characteristics of subglacial
till if present, ice temperature profile including basal water transport
velocity, connection time to the basal water system, basal melting rate and
others.
