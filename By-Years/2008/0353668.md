This award provides support for an REU Site at Loyola Marymount University (LMU)
for up to three years to provide research experiences to students from community
colleges in the Los Angeles, California area and students from LMU. A total of
24 students will be recruited to spend ten weeks in the summer at LMU engaged in
cutting-edge research projects in the field of materials and process
engineering. The program will serve to encourage students to pursue advanced
degrees in engineering and thus impact the nations need to increase the number
of U.S. citizens and permanent residents engaged in research-related careers. It
is also anticipated that this REU Site will have a Broader Impact on the nations
need to have broader participation in the research enterprise of citizens and
permanent residents from demographic groups traditionally underrepresented in
science and engineering.
