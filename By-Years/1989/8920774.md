This research project is concerned with ultrasonic tissue characterization (UTC)
which is an automated means of detecting and classifying diseased tissue using
an ultrasound image. Current research in this area is based upon computer
manipulation of two- dimensional (2-D) ultrasound images. This project will
extend current 2-D to 3-D images. Use of 3-D images permits the characterization
of tissue texture along any plane or using any volume. Plane will be defined by
vectors or by some boundary in the 3-D image, i.e., the boundary between the
kidney wall and the liver wall. Existing 2-D algorithms will be transformed to
the 3-D format. Devising a general mapping of any 2-D algorithm is complex, but
fortunately the particular parameters involved lend themselves to this
transformation. The ultimate goal is to present a 3-D color-coded image to a
human operator for interpretation, manipulation and diagnosis. This combination
of machine computation and human intelligence leads to increased accuracy and
has the potential of discovering new techniques.
