Many physical processes exhibit interesting patterns with a nontrivial spatio-
temporal structure. Stationary and time-periodic localized spots and rings, for
instance, occur in autocatalytic chemical reactions, ferro-fluids, cavity
lasers, and as vegetation patches in deserts. Sources are more complex patterns
that can be thought of as defects that actively organize a spatially periodic
background medium: they arise as planar spiral waves and as one-dimensional
flip-flops in chemical reactions and as surface waves in fluids. This project
aims at developing techniques to analyze the existence, nonlinear stability, and
parameter dependence of coherent structures for general reaction-diffusion
systems and for systems posed on lattices. Example projects that we will carry
out are geometric singular perturbation theory for functional differential
equations of mixed type, the analysis of planar and three-dimensional localized
structures near Turing and Hopf bifurcations, and the nonlinear stability of
sources in reaction-diffusion systems using pointwise Green's function
estimates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coherent structures and nonlinear waves organize
the dynamics of many biological, chemical and physical processes. Examples are
pulsating combustion fronts, vegetation patches, nerve impulses, spiral waves in
cardiac tissue, and localized convection rolls in fluid experiments. We will
develop analytical and numerical tools to study under which conditions such
structures appear and to determine their spatial extent and their stability
properties as functions of system parameters. Among the potential technological
applications are semiconductor lasers, which can exhibit localized hexagonal
patches that may be used in all-optical storage devices, and fiber lasers whose
optimization depends crucially on understanding the effect of design parameters
on the power of the generated light wave.&lt;br/&gt;
