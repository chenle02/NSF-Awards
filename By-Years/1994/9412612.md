9412612 Brown This is an experimental program to investigate the properties of
correlated electrons systems. The program focuses on organic and inorganic
conductors with incommensurate charge-density-wave and spin-density-wave
instabilities. The objective is to discover the correlation between the
fascinating transport and thermodynamic behavior with the elementary microscopic
excitations. The program includes samples preparations and characterizations,
and experiments conducted at the home institution and national user facilities
such as the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory and the National Synchrotron
Light Source. The present capabilities of the laboratory will be expanded. The
materials preparation facility will be improved. Higher accuracy will be sought
in transport and thermodynamic experiments under high pressure and in magnetic
fields. Nuclear magnetic resonance experiments under high pressure will be
performed. % % % % A large number of materials have high electrical conductivity
like metals but only along specific crystallographic directions. Such materials
are referred to as quasi-one-dimensional. They have specific physical properties
different than the conventional metals. Electrons interacting with each other
and with the lattice in such restricted dimensionality, are likely to form
states of matter known as density waves (charge or spin) distinct from metals
but with fascinating electrical and magnetic properties. This program is
designed to investigate the correlation between the underlying microscopic
interactions and the macroscopic properties such as electrical conductivity. The
Principal Investigator will synthesize the materials and perform experiments in
the department of physics at University of California at Los Angeles as well as
at two national facilities, National High Magnetic field Laboratory and the
National Synchrotron Light Source. ***
