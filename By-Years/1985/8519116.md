Turbulent subsonic flow over swept airfoils with blunt trailing edges will be
studied in three major phases. First, techniques for attenuating vortex shedding
from two-dimensional blunt bodies will be studied and the results applied to
three-dimensional bodies. In the next phase, methods for controlling spanwise
vortical flow associated with separated-flow regions downstream of swept
rearward-facing steps and near the trailing edges of swept lifting airfoils will
be investigated. The third phase applies the results of the first two phases to
the design of swept lifting airfoils with blunt trailing edges which incur no
drag penalty for the bluntness.
