9506784 Engler Ssm1(strain-specific modifier) is a locus on distal mouse
chromosome 4 that controls the methylation of a class of transgenic targets and
presumably endogenous sequences as well. Because any detailed understanding of
how Ssm1 functions depends upon cloning the gene, the first goal of this project
is to isolate the murine Ssm1 locus using positional cloning techniques. A high
resolution genetic map of the involved region will be made in order to
specifically locate the locus. Clones from existing libraries will be analyzed
in order to identify the region of DNA containing the gene. A second goal is to
characterize specific targets of the Ssm1 modifier locus and efforts will begin
to isolate endogenous sequences whose methylation might be controlled by Ssm1. A
third aim is to identify any other genes which might be required in addition to
Ssm1 for methylation of the target genes to occur. %%% The regulation of gene
expression in eukaryotic cells is much more complicated than was first believed.
It is now known that epigenetic effects such as gene methylation can be the
determining factor in gene expression. A gene which controls the methylation of
target genes in the mouse will be isolated by positional cloning and analyzed.
It is the first such locus to be characterized in mammals and detailed
understanding of its mode of action should greatly expand our knowledge of
mechanisms of gene silencing in higher organisms. ***
