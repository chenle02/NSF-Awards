9527543 Cahay This award supports the Third International Symposium on Quantum
Confinement: Physics and Applications to held as a part of the 188th Meeting of
the Electrochemical Society in Chicago, October 8-3, 1995. More specifically,
the funds help students to attend the meeting. A conference mailing will
announce a Graduate Student Competition for Best Student Paper Award. The ten
best abstracts submitted by graduate students will be awarded a check for $250
each to help their contributors attend the meeting. Additionally, during the
meeting, a $500 award will be given for the best student presentation
independent of the first contest. A total of three awards for $500 each will be
given. The audience will be asked to rate each of the talks presented by
graduate students. We believe that this competition will increase the attendance
at the meeting and will also favor a strong interaction between graduate
students and the scientists attending the symposium. The additional $500 is
requested for preparation of awards certificate and announcement mailing to
encourage student participation. The symposium is dedicated to recent research
in transport in mesoscopic structures (both semiconducting and superconducting).
The symposium will address all aspects of fabrication, characterization and
modeling of both semiconductor and superconductor mesoscopic structures and
coupled systems. This symposium is a follow-up of the Second International
Symposium on Quantum Confinement which was organized as part of the 185th
meeting of the electrochemical society in San Francisco (May 22-27, 1994). ***
