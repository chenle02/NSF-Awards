Soft robots are a compelling new platform for operating alongside humans in
unstructured, rugged, and dynamic environments. However, as of yet, very few
soft robots are field-deployable in scenarios such as search-and-rescue and
disaster response. This is due in part to the challenge of finding ways of
making soft robots move effectively. The central aim of this project is to
establish methods by which soft robots can autonomously develop environment-
specific task repertoires with little or no prior knowledge about their own
abilities or the surrounding environment. These new techniques will allow robots
to quickly and efficiently retrain themselves when they are damaged or when
their task environment changes. Importantly, this work will also establish a
model for involving and developing undergraduate students as independent
researchers in the high risk, high payoff field of soft robotics, thereby
growing the community of researchers and lowering the barriers of entry for the
next generation of robotics researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, this
project will use of Quality Diversity Algorithms to efficiently and autonomously
discover effective soft robotic behaviors that allow them to robustly and
adaptively move in complex environments. These techniques will be developed
using low-cost dynamically complex tensegrity-based robots. The specific goals
of this research are to produce insights into how soft robots can autonomously
explore the range of their abilities, producing multimodal repertoires of
behaviors that fully leverage their dynamics, and to develop methods by which
these robots can robustly and efficiently adapt their repertoires in response to
damage and unexpected environmental change. Throughout, this effort will involve
substantial hardware-based validation and testing using a high speed, high
resolution motion capture system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
