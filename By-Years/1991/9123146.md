Financial support is requested to bring three to four young scientists from
Eastern Europe ($4,800) and a selected number of ($1,700) to the GRC scheduled
for July 20-24, 1992. The chief aim is to identify future scientific leaders in
high-temperature chemistry and provide a medium for their interaction with
approxi- mately 125 scientists from academic, industrial, and government
laboratories. Participants will discuss fundamental thermodynamic properties of
refractory materials, stability and structure of molecules at high temperature,
theory of the relation of structure to the properties, etc. These topics are
important in material design and processing, energy conversions, and
microelectronics.
