9508298 Luke The Department of Mathematics and the Center for Applied
Mathematics and Statistics at the New Jersey Institute of Technology will
purchase Server which includes a memory upgrade, mass storage devices, and
scientific software which will be dedicated to the support of research in the
mathematical sciences, and in addition will employ a part-time systems
administrator to oversee the network of workstations, install software and
hardware, and perform routine maintenance tasks. The equipment will be used for
several projects, including in particular: 1. Dynamics of Turbulent Incinerator
for Hazardous Waste Remediation by Robert R. Barat, John Bechtold and Bruce
Bukiet 2. Microwave Heating of Ceramics: Applicator Effects by Gregory A.
Kriegsmann 3. Optimizing Matched Field Algorithms for Underwater Communications
by Zoe-Heleni Michalopoulou 4. Dynamics of Multi-Fluid Interfacial Flows by
Demetrios T. Papageorgiou 5. Flow in a Collapsible Tube by Madeleine E. Rosar
