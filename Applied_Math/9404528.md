9404528 Goodman We will study nonlinear dispersive waves by combining the normal
forms technique of dynamical systems with nonlinear harmonic analysis. We will
study multi-D perturbations of plane wave solutions of systems of reaction-
diffusion equations, attempting to relate simple effective equations to the full
equations. We will develop and analyze numerical methods for stochastic
differential equations with special attention to boundaries. Nonlinear
dispersive waves include waves on the surface of water and sound waves in a
crystal lattice of atoms. Reaction diffusion equations describe, among other
things, flames. Understanding of instabilities of flames is important, for
example, in chemical engineering. Stochastic differential equations are used to
model molecules in modern drug design, stock price and interest rate movements
(important in New York City), and many other things. Efficient and accurate
simulation technology is sorely needed in these areas.
