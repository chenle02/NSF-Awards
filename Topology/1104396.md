The PI continues to study when derived equivalences can be realized by
underlying richly structured equivalences. Examples of this arise in the PI's
long term project with John Greenlees of constructing algebraic models for
rational G-equivariant spectra for compact Lie groups G. The PI and Greenlees
plan to extend their model for connected groups in the free case to non-
connected groups. The PI and Greenlees also plan to extend their model for tori
to provide an algebraic model for rational G-equivariant commutative and
associative ring spectra. As a step towards the general case, the specific case
of SO(3) is also being considered. The PI and Kathryn Hess propose to develop
model categories for coalgebras over various comonads in various settings. The
main motivation here is to provide a homotopical setting for studying Hopf-
Galois extensions of ring spectra.

The proposed research projects involve the interplay between the study of
algebraic structures and topology, the study of shapes or spaces. Algebraic
topologists use algebraic structures to describe and simplify topological
phenomena. Spectra, which represent cohomology theories, are algebraic
structures built out of topological spaces and hence are useful for translating
from one field to the other. In one project, the PI and Greenlees develop
algebraic models for certain types of spectra which allow complete calculations.
The PI also continues to train graduate students and disseminate research
results. In addition, the PI is involved with several organizations which
promote the participation of women and underrepresented minorities in science.
