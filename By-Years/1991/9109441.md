Gibbons are the one nonhuman primate closely related to humans that exists with
an apparent monogamous mating relationship and a family-unit form of social
organization. Moreover, these animals represent an endangered species that have
not been adequately studied. Using a semi-natural environment, Dr. Nadler will
carry out a series of studies on gibbon reproductive endocrinology, stress and
behavior. The research program integrates evolutionary, functional and
mechanistic issues and approaches at several levels including physiology,
behavior and taxonomy. This work is of great importance in discerning the
possible origins of human behavior. The ideas fostered by this research may lead
to a better understanding of the nature of monogamy in primates and with respect
to possible parallels to human mating systems. Moreover, information about
reproductive physiology on gibbons is critical for the conservation and
maintenance of this endangered species. Finally, given their close biological
relationship, information gained from this work is of potential value in
elucidating the interactions between reproductive hormones and behavior in
humans.
