This is a Minority Research Initiation (MRI) planning grant to study the post
World War II applied social science research industry in the United States that
is instrumental in the formation of the Nations's economic and political
agendas. The study will focus on the social context of knowledge production and
its uses for individuals and organizations that produce it. Historical and
contemporary aspects of the topic will be included in the study. The proposer
will use the planning period to acquire additional archival research experience
and develop a sound methodological plan. This grant will provide support for a
well-trained minority sociologist to prepare a competitive proposal for
submission to the MRI research initiation component.
