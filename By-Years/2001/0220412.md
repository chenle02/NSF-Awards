The United States and other industrialized nations in the Organization for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) have made large investments in
information communication technologies (ICT) for schooling and expect these
investments to advance not only school reform but life-long learning as well.
For these aspirations to be realized, policy makers require information on how
ICT impacts schooling and learning and how ICT might best be used to achieve a
range of educational goals. This proposal requests partial financial support for
an international conference to disseminate results of major research efforts of
these issues in 23 OECD countries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
