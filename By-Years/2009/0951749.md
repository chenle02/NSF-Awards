Karbi is a Tibeto-Burman (TB) language spoken by about half a million speakers
located in the Karbi Anglong District of Assam, Northeast India. Its genetic
affiliation within the TB family has remained unclear. Previous treatments
provide information on the language; however, a detailed documentation and
grammatical analysis is needed as a comparative resource for typologists, who
seek to understand commonalities and differences between languages and language
families of the world. Most of the several hundreds of TB languages have
remained un- or under-described to the present day. This project supports
fieldwork in Karbi Anglong, and is concerned with the collection and analysis of
naturalistic data reflecting how the language is actually spoken in the everyday
life of the community. The execution of the project is based on strong
collaboration between linguists from the University of Oregon and the Karbi
Lammet Amei (Karbi Literary Association). The co-PI will train community members
to help with data collection and analysis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
will produce a modern, detailed descriptive grammar that will also contribute to
the understanding of Karbi culture and cultural knowledge, and of the history of
Northeast India by working out genetic relationships to other TB languages. The
collaborative foundation of the project will create an innovative model of
linguist-community interaction, which is not only preferable from an ethical
standpoint but also has the important advantage to help accumulate more data and
more naturalistic data by training community members to help with recording and
analysis of oral texts. A technical linguistic grammar will be the prerequisite
for a pedagogical grammar that will help strengthen the status of Karbi, and
potentially other minority languages in the area.
