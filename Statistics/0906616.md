The proposed project aims to develop new statistical theory and methodology for
high-dimensional structured data. The project is inspired by challenging
problems that arise in two important biological applications: disease gene
identification and gene function discovery, where one central issue is how to
utilize problem structure effectively to deal with high statistical uncertainty
in a discovery process. The project consists of two major components: subnetwork
analysis and structured learning. With regard to subnetwork analysis, the PI and
his collaborators will develop new techniques for extracting a certain low-
dimensional subnetwork structure, where a network is described by a directed or
an undirected graph. With regard to structured learning, the PI and his
collaborators will develop new large margin techniques for partial multi-label
hierarchical classification, with particular effort focused on accurate
prediction under hierarchical constraints and various hierarchical loss
functions. The goal is to achieve a substantial improvement on predictive
accuracy over the current best techniques. In addition, computational tools will
be developed to target real problems and to provide optimal or near-optimal
solutions.

The proposed project will address fundamentally important issues in structured
data analysis. It will generate research interest for studying emerging
problems, and will promote collaborations between statisticians and scientists
from other fields such as computer science and biomedical science. The research
program will have an impact in several areas of research, particularly in
document management and exploration, automatic machine processing, biomedical
research, and social science. The educational program will integrate teaching
with research to get students exposed to state-of-the-art research, and to
create an interdisciplinary learning environment for training and learning.
