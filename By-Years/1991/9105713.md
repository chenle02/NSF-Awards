Glossiphoniid leech embryos, such as those of the species Helobdella
triserialis, are well suited for studying cellular aspects of early development,
because they are relatively large and hardy, and because their blastomeres are
both experimentally accessible and individually identifiable. Thus, experimental
analyses can be carried out on developmentally equivalent cells from one embryo
to the next. This proposal is to continue previous analyses of various aspects
of leech development, including: the role of cytoplasmic determinants in
determining early cleavage; the specification of mesodermal and ectodermal cell
lines; fate determining interactions between initially equipotent cells; the
continuing refinement of developmental cell lineages; the influence of a
transient embryonic epithelium on morphogenesis. The experiments proposed will
carry out these analyses at the cellular and molecular level, by incorporating
the techniques of the "reverse genetic approach" in combination with those used
previously, such as microinjection of cell lineage tracers and other materials
into identified embryonic cells, single cell ablation and optical microscopy.
