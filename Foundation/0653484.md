Marker plans to continue his research in model theory, focusing on the
connections with other areas of mathematics. One direction of his current
research focuses on trying to understand definable sets in the complex numbers
with exponentiation. He also remains very interested in the model theory of
differential fields--a fascinating area requiring a sophisticated mixture of
ideas from stability theory, differential algebra and algebraic geometry. In a
different direction Marker will continue his work on connections between model
theory and descriptive set theory. In particular, he will try to understand more
about theories where the isomorphism relation on countable models is Borel.

In model theory one studies mathematical structures by looking at solution sets
to systems of equations and more complicated sets you can build from these basic
sets. In some situations, like the real or complex numbers with algebraic
operations, the sets constructed are geometrically simple-for example there are
only finitely many connected pieces. In the real numbers if you add the
exponential function, the definable sets are still geometrically simple, but in
the complex numbers you can construct infinite discrete sets like the integers.
In this case it is unknown if the sets constructed can be arbitrarily
complicated. Possibly, all the sets arise from simple pieces. Marker will
investigate this problem. The sets studied arise naturally in many applications
in dynamical systems and control theory and it would be useful to understand
their constraints.
