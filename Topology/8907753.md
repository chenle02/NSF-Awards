Lattice gauge fields were invented by physicists as discrete models of
connections in principal fibre bundles. Anthony Phillips' previous work (with
David Stone) on calculations of topological charge led to a general scheme for a
local calculation of cocycles representing real characteristic classes. Part of
the planned research involves extending this scheme to a wider class of
structure groups. Another part involves modification of this scheme to detect
U(1)-monopoles in SU(n)- theories in a way that is both reliable and efficient
for lattice computations. Phillips also plans to investigate the topology and
geometry of H-monopoles in G-bundles for general G including H. Finally, he
intends to attack a combinatorial problem, the enumeration of a certain class of
mazes which arose in his prior work on lattice gauge fields. Overall, this
project employs some of the most modern mathematical tools of differential
geometry and topology to analyze a type of structure which arises in one
formulation of quantum mechanics.
