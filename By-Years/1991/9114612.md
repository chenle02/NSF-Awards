and educational activities of the Laboratory for Electronic Networking and
Distributed Systems at Bowie State University. The support includes computing
equipment and software, faculty development costs, and student assistantships.
The principal investigators will conduct research in (1) distributed
heterogeneous data and information management. (2) data compression techniques,
and (3)distributed artificial intelligence systems. In addition, the educational
activities will include further development of a pipeline program to attract and
retain more minority students in computer science careers. Components of this
program include a mentoring project for minority undergraduates, summer training
in computer programming for high school students, tutoring and laboratory
research experiences for undergraduates.//
