This proposed study will analyze a sediment core to relate long-term sediment
accumulations with Werner Deuser's 10 years worth of sediment trap data
collected near Bermuda. A wide variety of techniques will be used to document
the change in various sedimentary parameters within the cores- O-18, lipids,
grain size, cyanobacteria, dinoflagellates, Cd,Ba,CaCo3, opa,l230-Th, clay
minerals, etc. The result of this study will attempt to document the temporal
variability of particle flux and near-bottom transport near Bermuda, with
implications for much of the western North Atlantic.
