This project is research in mathematical physics. It will focus on the study of
spectral properties of Schroedinger operators for systems consisting of many
particles. Though Schroedinger operators have been the subject of intensive
mathematical research for many years, the many-body case appeared out of reach
until recently. Exploiting new developments in this area, Professor Sigal will
investigate scattering theory, the spectrum of large atoms and ions, the
instability of negative ions, and resonances in atoms and molecules.
