The Grouplens research project explores collaborative filtering approaches to
address information overload for users of Internet information systems.
Collaborative filtering is a technology that uses the opinions of some readers
of a document to predict the interest of other potential readers in that
document. This project builds upon the successful Grouplens collaborative
filtering system for Usenet news to explore in more detail the human factors and
algorithmic issues of collaborative filtering. This project addresses three
fundamental problems in collaborative filtering: how to effectively measure user
interest with minimal effort from users, how to use these measures of interest
to produce accurate predictions of other user's interest, and how to integrate
non-collaborative and collaborative filtering approaches to create robust
filtering environments. The research approach relies upon three experimental
methods. A set of controlled experimental trials is used to gather complete
ratings datasets to directly measure the effectiveness of collaborative
filtering algorithms. A small- scale public trial is used to collect data on the
actual usage of the GroupLens system. Survey research is used to obtain user
opinions and feedback from both trials.
