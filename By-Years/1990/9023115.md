Scientists at the California Institute of Technology are carrying out a new
Palomar Observatory Sky Survey known as POSS II. Private grants helped fund an
upgrading of the telescope and laboratory facilities and materials for the
survey. National Science Foundation (NSF) funds support a photographic scientist
who oversees the quality control necessary to produce a collection of high
quality photographic plates. The first Palomar Observatory Sky Survey, produced
in the period 1952-1957, is an extremely important reference source for all of
astronomy. However, since the sky is constantly changing through long term
spectral and intensity changes, proper motions of celestial objects, and
relatively short term explosive events, as well as through improved
instrumentation and photographic techniques, a repeat of the 30 year old atlas
is of great importance.
