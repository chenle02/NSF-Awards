The objective of this research is to increase the resolution and reduce the
cost of wideband spectrum sensing and cognition, which are challenging core
issues in spectrum-sharing cognitive networks. The approach seeks to leverage
the benefits of compressive sampling and user cooperation to develop a
collaborative compressed sensing framework for wideband networks. Research
thrusts include compressed wideband sensing at affordable signal acquisition
costs and reliable collaborative sensing with low network overhead.

This research combines compression and collaboration techniques with the goal of
innovation in wideband spectrum sensing. The project seeks to develop a suite of
compressed sensing algorithms that exploit spectral sparsity to reduce the need
for high-speed sampling in ultra-wideband and wideband radios. A decentralized
approach for joint cooperation and compression, which exploits spatial diversity
to alleviate the hidden terminal problem caused by wireless channel fading, is
investigated for ad hoc cognitive networks. Further, the research examines
fundamental tradeoffs in a cooperative sensing system including diversity gain,
compression, sensing time and complexity.

This project has the potential to lead to techniques that can improve the
spectrum utilization efficiency and user capacity of wireless networks, thus
allowing a multitude of new cognitive radio transceivers. Such devices include
wireless sensors and radio frequency identification (RFID) chipsets for
monitoring and tracking applications. The compressed sensing and decentralized
collaboration techniques being investigated also have the potential to
contribute to other sensing-related applications, such as wireless sensor
networks. Research experiences gained through this project help to prepare
students for engineering in the 21st Century.
