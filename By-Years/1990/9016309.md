Professor Blackadar will continue his work on a wide range of problems
concerning the structure of operator algebras and noncommutative algebraic
topology. Specific topics to be studied are: (i) structure of inductive limits
of homogeneous C*- algebras, (ii) nonstable K-theory and the fundamental
comparability question, and (iii) existence and properties of cohomology
theories on C*-algebras. The notion of a C* algebra is an abstraction of the
idea of a family of linear transformations on a space. These transformations can
also be thought of as having values in the states of the space, and the property
of this family which is responsible for the symbol * is that the algebra is
generated by transformations whose values in these states are real numbers. The
fact that these objects appear naturally in many branches of mathematics and
physics make them important to study.
