Catalyst Projects provide support for Historically Black Colleges and
Universities to work towards establishing research capacity of faculty to
strengthen science, technology, engineering and mathematics undergraduate
education and research. It is expected that the award will further the faculty
member's research capability, improve research and teaching at the institution,
and involve undergraduate students in research experiences. This project at
Elizabeth City State University will investigate the specific associations
between nematodes and prokaryote communities in freshwater and marine ecological
sites using marker gene-based and shotgun metagenomics sequencing. The project
will introduce underrepresented minority students to molecular techniques, while
preparing them for graduate school or entry into the STEM workforce.

Complex biological processes are carried out through interactions of biotic and
abiotic components. Nematodes are ubiquitous and arguably the most diverse and
numerically dominant component of the meiofauna. Their close association with
the most diverse group, the prokaryotes, would play a critical role in sediment
ecological processes, however, this remains largely unexplored. The goal of the
project is to employ a tiered approach to investigate this association and its
ecological implications in 15 nematode taxa. An initial, phylogenetically
informative marker gene-based characterization will be followed by shotgun
metagenomic sequence-based functional analysis. Shotgun sequence data of
nematodes & associated microbial communities will be used to predict community
functional potential using gene and gene family functionality of recognized
associations through putative metabolite profiles. This will be in the framework
of inter- and intraspecific genetic variations and community ecological
relevance in freshwater and marine environments.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
