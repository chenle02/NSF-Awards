The Cold Spring Harbor Symposia are held yearly . They bring together
approximately 300-400 scientists from all over the world to present and evaluate
new data and ideas in rapidly moving areas of biological research. The topic for
the 1989 Symposium is Immunological Recognition. It will focus on the following
topics: Antibody structure and epitope recognition, antigen uptake, processing
and presentation, the induction and breakdown of self-tolerance, transmembrane
signalling in lymphocyte activation, the structure of MHC molecules, peptide
binding by MHC molecules, epitope recognition by T lymphocytes, the generation
of T cell and B cell repertoires, and antigen receptors and ancillary molecules
on T lymphocytes. The Symposia always seek to bring research workers from
abroad, as well as the U.S., so as to ensure the wide scope and depth of the
program and to take advantage of their specific contributions. They also seek to
provide outstanding younger scientists, both graduate students and post-doctoral
fellows with an opportunity to participate and communicate with more senior
scientists. The Symposia also bring together scientists who use a variety of
approaches, e.g. genetics, biochemistry, molecular biology, cell biology, and
structural studies. The proceedings of the Symposia are published by the
Laboratory and thus made available to a wider audience than the scientists who
attend the meeting. This Symposium promises to further the progress of basic
research in immunobiology.
