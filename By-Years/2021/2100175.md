This project is based on recent developments at the interface between geometry
and physics. There are a number of intricate conjectures about central objects
in mathematics (“Hitchin moduli spaces” and “K3 spaces”) coming from theoretical
physicists studying particular quantum systems at low energies. The PI uses new
tools coming out of geometric analysis which are well-suited for verifying the
extremely delicate conjectures about the geometry of the Hitchin moduli space
and K3 spaces. This strategy often stretches the limits of what can currently be
done via geometric analysis, and simultaneously leads to new insights into these
physics conjectures. Because Hitchin moduli spaces occupy a distinguished
position in geometry at the crossroads of a number of mathematical fields
including algebraic geometry, differential geometry, representation theory, and
geometric analysis, this work has cross-disciplinary
impact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is centered on the asymptotic geometry
of Hitchin moduli spaces and families of K3 surfaces. A main goal is to verify
the beautiful conjectural description of the hyperkaehler metric on the Hitchin
moduli space by the physicists Gaiotto, Moore, and Neitzke. A second goal is to
verify a similar conjectural description of hyperkaehler metrics on
elliptically-fibered K3 surfaces by the physicists Kachru, Tripathy, and Zimet.
The Hitchin moduli spaces and elliptically-fibered K3 surfaces are both
algebraic completely integrable systems admitting a hyperkaehler metric. Both
are fibered over a half-dimensional base and the generic fibers are abelian
varieties. Some fibers are singular, and these conjectures are most interesting
and most difficult near these singular fibers. Constructive analytic techniques
and the methods of geometric microlocal analysis seem to be the most appropriate
way to verify conjectures from physics because they are well-suited to analyzing
the singular differential operators that naturally
appear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
