Through this planning grant, steps are being taken to develop the framework for
a Master Teaching Fellows program. This project builds on an existing Noyce
scholarship program in the Cleveland region. It is anticipated that the Master
Teaching Fellows will include many of the same partners from the scholarship
program, including several high needs school districts. The planning activities
are beginning with a needs assessment survey to determine the level of interest
in the region for the program and the expected outcomes. As part of this
planning project, a non-profit organization that has the willingness, capacity,
and expertise to support the goals of the program is being identified and
recruited. The educational curriculum for professional development of master
teachers is being designed, drawing on existing courses and structures where
appropriate. Other planning activities include identification of sources of
university cost share, securing school district support for implementing salary
supplements for the Fellows, and defining the roles and responsibilities of all
participants.
