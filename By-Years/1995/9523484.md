ABSTRACT CTS-9523484 Partial travel support will be provided to a group of young
academic researchers to participate and present papers at the International
Congress of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (ICTAM), to be held in Kyoto
Japan, 25-31 August 1996. The Congress will cover the entire field of
theoretical and applied mechanics, being a leading forum for dissemination of
fluid and solid mechanics knowledge in the world. Special symposia will be
devoted for the following topics: vorticity dynamics and turbulence, non-
Newtonian fluid flow, aero- and hydroacoustics, mechanics of heterogeneous and
composite solids, solid mechanics in manufacturing, and structural optimization.
Specialized sessions in a variety of areas, including, computational fluid
mechanics, multiphase flow, contact and friction problems, fracture and crack
mechanics, stability of structures, and earthquake engineering, will be
included. The U.S. National Committee on Theoretical and Applied Mechanics has
as members 14 national societies in engineering, science and mathematics, and is
representing U.S. in the International Union of Theoretical and Applied
Mechanics (IUTAM), the organizer of ICTAM. The NSF grant will partially support
travel to the meeting of 15 to 20 young investigators, who will present papers
at ICTAM. Their participation is essential for the advancement of the IUTAM
objectives to younger academic generation and suitable representation of the
U.S. mechanics community at the Congress. ***
