The fifth SCAR (Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research) symposium on biology
will be held 29 August-3 September, 1988 in Hobart, Tasmania, Australia. The
symposium theme is concerned with short- and long-term changes in ecosystem and
community structure and function caused by natural and man-induced factors.
Specific consideration to natural factors that induce change such as climate
change, volcanic activity and exposure of land by ice retreat will be considered
in the symposium. Insight into the ecological processes that occur in changing
environments is particularly important in the development of monitoring programs
for sound conservation policies. The SCAR biology symposia are the only
conferences of their kind and occur at intervals of about six years. This group
travel award will allow for attendance by United States scientists and is
consistent with U.S. policy in the Antarctic in the maintaining of an
influential research presence in Antarctic affairs.
