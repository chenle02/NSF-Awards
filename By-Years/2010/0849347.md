Paulraj Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due to the broadcast nature of wireless
transmissions, when a packet is forwarded by a node, many nodes other than the
intended node overhear this transmission. The goal of this project is to exploit
a new concept of capturing/exploiting soft information at nodes in a multi-hop
ad hoc network. Storing appropriate information from these overheard
transmissions and its subsequent reuse can increase multi-hop throughput
performance. This appears to be a new idea with significant potential to improve
throughput and scalability of multi-hop networks. The nodes in such networks
will need large storage capabilities to exploit this technique. However, with
the dramatic reduction of memory costs, this is now economically feasible.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A variety of issues related to developing this new concept
will be explored: (a) Scalability of the network throughput with increasing node
density, with varying path loss exponent and in the presence of time selective
fading. (b) Appropriate format or metrics for soft information captured from
overheard packets (c) Memory requirements as a function of node density and
other related parameters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
