This project continues to investigate an extension of the inverse scattering
transform (IST) method of solving integrable nonlinear evolution PDEs (partial
differential equations) to handle initial data in a larger class. In other
words, the project focuses on soliton theory for initial profiles that are much
broader than rapidly decaying or periodic. It is well-known that slow decay at
infinity may lead to new phenomena. For instance, certain smooth but slowly
decaying initial data may turn into rough or even blow-up revealing a very
complicated relation between local and global behaviors. Standard techniques of
PDEs or numerical analysis are ineffective to tackle such issues. The IST is
much better suited to study such phenomena as it combines both global and local
properties of initial data, linearizes the problem, and provides accurate
asymptotic behavior. Although the spectrum of the underlying differential
operators (e.g. Schr√∂dinger in the case of the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation)
is much more complicated than for the classical IST, it can be suitably
expressed in terms of the Titchmarsh-Weyl m-function which is well-defined for
virtually any reasonable initial profile. The main thrust of this project is a
study of the IST in this setting. In particular, the effect of different
spectral components of the differential operator in the Lax pair on the solution
of the corresponding nonlinear PDE will be investigated.

The inverse scattering transform was first discovered in the 60s for the KdV
equation of shallow-water waves. Soon after, it was found for many other
important nonlinear PDEs and now is regarded as a fundamental breakthrough in
mathematics, connecting different branches of pure mathematics and theoretical
physics, with numerous applications ranging from hydrodynamics and nonlinear
optics to astrophysics and elementary particle theory. The importance of
extending the range of validity of IST, which is the principal aim of the
project, is recognized by both mathematicians and physicists. The results are
expected to be of a very applied nature and could be employed for the study of
wave propagation on different backgrounds (including noisy), tidal waves,
certain meteorological phenomena, understanding freak waves or any other applied
problems where initial data do not approach zero at infinity, and in such
diverse disciplines as hydrodynamics, telecommunication, atmospheric sciences,
nonlinear optics, plasma, astrophysics, etc. Given their remarkable pedigree,
diversity of mathematics involved, and richness of applications, the topics of
the project provide a great educational experience through research for the
undergraduate and graduate students involved.
