A novel table top, ultra wideband, time domain scattering range will be
developed under this Research Initiation Award grant. A picosecond laser will be
used to switch planar antennas photoconductively, generating and detecting
picosecond bursts of freely propagating electromagnetic (EM) radiation. The EM
pulses will have bandwidth extending over 10-80 GHz, and will allow one to
obtain ultra-wideband scattering data in a single measurement. In this work new
antennas that increase the radiated power and improve signal- to-noise will be
designed and fabricated. These antennas will make feasible the measurement of
the late-time response of low-Q targets. Additionally, optical fiber will be
used to guide the optical pulses to the antennas, yielding a system in which the
transmitter and receiver can be moved about arbitrarily. This new scattering
range has bandwidth and flexibility that are not found in conventional
scattering ranges, and uses no conventional microwave nor millimeter-wave
equipment. Particular structures that will be investigated with this system
include partially open cavities, layered media, and targets embedded in layered
media. Calculations of short-pulse scattering in such environments will also be
made for comparison with experimental results.
