DMS-9732742&lt;br/&gt;Guojun Liao&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A key factor to the
success of numerical simulation of scientific and engineering problems is that
of grid generation of the physical domains. The objective of the project is to
develop an adaptive grid generation method that can be used with various
numerical schemes such as finite element, finite difference, etc. Our method is
based on sophisticated mathematics and its numerical implementation is
straightforward. It is the deformation method which redistributes the grid
points according to the physical variables that are being simulated. A monitor
function is calculated which is small where the error is large. The deformation
method then moves each grid point according to the monitor function so that the
new grid will be concentrated where the need for better resolution exists to
reduce the error. Model problems from fluid dynamics and other important
applications will be simulated on such moving grids. We will demonstrate that
the method is capable of generating grids that are adapted to the fine features
of the physical variables such as shock waves, moving fronts, and boundary
layers, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is aimed to greatly enhance our
ability to simulate large scale computational problems that are crucial to the
national strategic interests. The advance of computing technology allows us to
simulate some real world problem without conducting costly experiments. But the
needs for accurate and efficient simulation far exceed the most powerful
computers of today. A lot of simplification and upgrading have to be made to
stay within the limit of today's computing capacity. Fixed grids are wasteful in
computing resource. Our research will lead to software that can automatically
put more points to the regions where and when the physical variables change
rapidly without adding new points. This would be very useful for high
performance computing and the numerical simulation of material science,
environment problems, manufacturing process and other fields that require a
grid. By working in the project, mathematics and engineering students will gain
first hand experience on the application of mathematics to the solution of
engineering problem. Advanced degrees will be granted to graduate students who
make significant contributions to the project after their completion of course
work.&lt;br/&gt;
