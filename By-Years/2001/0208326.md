This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY2002.
The goal of the fellowship is to prepare minority scientists for positions of
scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the
fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training of the highest
quality to recent doctoral recipients. This program is an effort by the NSF to
increase the number of research scientists from underrepresented minority
groups, thereby contributing to the future vitality of the Nation's scientific
enterprise. It is expected that Fellows trained through these fellowships will
play important roles in training of the future workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Electron
microscopy study of the structure of ATP Binding Cassette transporter protein
MsbA." ATP Binding Cassette (ABC) transporter proteins couple ATP hydrolysis
with translocation of various substrate molecules across biological membranes.
This study is investigating the model that posits that large conformational
changes in the transporter protein allows the substrate to move across the
membrane. Electron microscopy and helical image analysis are being used to
determine the structure and mechanism of the MsbA transporter.
