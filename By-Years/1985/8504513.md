This research involves novel applications of intersecting waveguides, and
studies of the physical mechanisms which control the electro-optical
characteristics of a device, limit its performance, and affect its
reproducibility. Several novel devices for optical signal processing which take
advantage of recently understood coupling mechanisms between intersecting
waveguides, as well as the simplicity of their geometry, are proposed.
Investigators are pursuing important problems in guided wave integrated optical
devices which will be particularly useful in optical communication systems.
Their solution would contribute significant results to this important field.
