A long-standing biological question regarding the mammalian kidney revolves
around the role of the renal medulla in maintaining water balance on a minute-
to-minute and day-to-day basis. The kidney's ability to excrete wastes while
conserving water is especially important during periods when the body is losing
water (e.g. exercise) or when water intake is low (e.g. sleeping overnight). The
nephrons (kidney tubules) and blood vessels of the mammalian kidney are
assembled into elaborate tubular networks. The nephrons and vessels interact
with each other, exchanging water and solutes among many spatially-distinct
compartments in a highly orchestrated manner in order to produce a urine that is
concentrated in solutes. This research project will focus on the kidney of the
kangaroo rat. This desert animal rarely drinks water and, therefore, it is
anticipated that its kidney will be an ideal system to study the urinary
concentrating mechanism. Physiological, molecular, and computational studies of
protein expression and function in the various nephron segments of the kangaroo
rat kidney will be carried out so as to more clearly define how water and
solutes move within the medulla of the kidney. Models developed from these
studies will reveal fundamental insights into how these fluid and solute
exchanges play a role in maintaining proper water balance in the whole organism.
Students will play a central role in this research project and by doing so they
will gain research experience in cell biology, systems physiology, and
computational approaches.
