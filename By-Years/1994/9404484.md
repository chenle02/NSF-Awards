Man 9404484 This project has the following two objectives: (A) To study the
well-posedness of the boundary value problem pertaining to using the hole-
drilling strain-gage method for the measurement of residual stress in a thin
plate. This boundary value problem will be formulated in the context of the
general theory of linear elasticity with initial stress. Particular attention
will be paid to examining whether the size of the drilled hole would have any
effect on the well- posedness. (B) To develop a mathematical theory on the
radiation, focusing, and multiple arrival of SHo waves in anisotropic thin
sheets. Accurate determination of phase velocities at different propagation
directions is required when we use SHO waves for the evaluation of stress,
texture, and elastic constants of anisotropic sheets. Measurement of time delay
of signals by cross correlation does not deliver phase velocity. The present
study will lay the theoretical groundwork for the determination of phase
velocities from measured data. With applications to composite laminate plates in
mind, provisions will be made to allow for strong anisotropy of the sheets. This
project comprises two studies: (A) Mathematical foundations of the hole-drilling
strain-gage method for the evaluation of residual stress. The general theory of
linear elasticity with initial stress, which studies small deformations from a
prestressed configuration, provides a natural setting for the analysis of the
hole-drilling test. The present analysis will be conducted in its context. The
current standard procedure for conducting the hole-drilling test will be
reexamined in light of findings in this mathematical study. (B) . The present
study will lay the theoretical groundwork for the determination of phase
velocities from measured data. With applications to composite laminate plates in
mind, provisions will be made to allow for strong anisotropy of the sheets.
