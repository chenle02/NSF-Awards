Objective: The objective of this program is to devise and demonstrate
architectures incorporating mode-evolution based, integrated polarization
splitter and rotator devices in silicon photonics, in order to enable
polarization sensing and manipulation functionalities on a silicon chip.

Intellectual merit: Effects related to the polarization of light lead to
significant issues in lightwave technology. One example is polarization-mode
dispersion: optical pulses spread in time in a frequency- and polarization-
dependent manner, leading to errors in telecommunications. While such effects
can be compensated, the devices for sensing and manipulating polarizations are
usually implemented in bulk optics, which limits their widespread application.
Integrated devices are desirable for their strong size and cost advantages,
especially if multiple devices can be integrated on a single chip to support
wavelength-division multiplexing. Silicon photonics based, integrated
polarization splitters and rotators enable polarization sensing, control and
high speed modulation, thereby potentially offering a practical solution to
compensate polarization mode dispersion, and also enable polarization
multiplexing techniques, in which independent data is sent on two orthogonal
polarization states to realize higher bit rate.

Broader impacts: This work has the potential for significant impact by
supporting advances in high-speed communications infrastructure pervasive to the
economy. If successfully developed, integrated chips capable of polarization
manipulation could pave the way to practical deployment of new optical
compensators addressing serious distortion effects in fiber communications and
enable new concepts for optical transmission systems and networks. Two Ph.D.
students will be supported and one undergraduate student will be invited to
participate.
