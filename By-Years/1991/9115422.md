Tsunamis are ocean waves generated by an impulsive geophysical event, such as an
earthquake. Historically, Hawaii and Alaska have been the areas of the U.S.
affected by tsunami impact. The objective of this research program is to study
the runup of a tsunami onto a coastline, the overland flow of tsunamis, and
their interaction with structures located in the nearshore regions.
Specifically, it is investigating: (1) The shape, kinematic characteristics and
shoreward limit of propagation of the overland flow of the surge which may
develop at the shoreline due to the tsunami. (2) The determination of the forces
and pressures imposed on two-dimensional and three-dimensional structures by an
impinging surge. This investigation is directed toward the mitigation of tsunami
hazards by contributing to the knowledge needed: to improve tsunami warning
systems, to estimate the overland flow of a tsunami-induced surge, and to design
structures located near the shoreline which could be impacted by such a surge.
