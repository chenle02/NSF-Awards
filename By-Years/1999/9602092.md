McAllister 9602092 Funding is requested to defray partial travel expenses for
American scientists who wish to participate in the Tenth International Phage
Workshop. The workshop will be held in Salamanca, Spain from July 1-6, 1996
under the auspices of the European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO). The
meeting will deal with fundamental problems in the molecular biology of
bacteriophage and their hosts. Progress in understanding these processes at the
molecular level has contributed greatly to advances in research in this area is
therefore well justified.
