This award is for the support of Proceedings of Workshop on Very High Energy
and Ultra High Energy Gamma Ray Astronomy; Simferopol, USSR; April 15-21, 1989.
The Crimean Workshop had attracted the attention of the two US High Energy
physicists who attended. The proceedings will help disseminate the results
presented at the workshop to a larger audience of High Energy physicists and
astrophysicists.
