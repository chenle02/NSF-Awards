This project will investigate the relatively unexplored area of how beliefs,
knowledge, decisions and actions of people in the process of becoming middle
school teachers of mathematics change during their training and first year of
teaching as they begin to make the transition from novices to experienced
teachers. In conceiving the study, these investigators bring together the
concepts of (1) teacher beliefs and knowledge, (2) decisions and instruction
strategies used by teachers, and (3) environmental influences including both
contextual and social factors present in the schools where teachers study and
work. These are used to form a framework for understanding the changes over time
in the manner in which new teachers identify and respond to situations in which
problems and opportunities arise during instruction. The study will employ a
case study approach to describe the detail and complexity of the succession of
decisions and actions of novice teachers during the final year of preservice
preparation and first year of teaching middle school mathematics. Particular
attention will be given to the ways these teachers plan, implement, and reflect
upon the mathematics instructional units they teach.
