Black holes and neutron stars are believed to be the compact remnants of
formerly massive stars that passed through their evolution and ejected their
outer envelopes in supernova explosions (some black holes, such as those thought
to exist in the cores of some galaxies, may have other origins). These compact
stellar objects are characterized by strong magnetic and gravitational fields.
Many are accreting matter from nearby companions, giving rise to the emission of
short wavelength radiation. The Principal Investigator proposes to study the
radiation emitted by black holes and neutron stars and the distortion of this
radiation by strong magnetic and gravitational fields.
