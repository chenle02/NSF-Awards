Rosenfeld 9619466 The characteristics of the internal waves and turbulence field
in Monterey Submarine Canyon will be measured with a suite of vertical fine-
scale and microstructure profilers and shipboard instruments to test the
hypothesis the energy flux of up-canyon propagating semi-diurnal internal waves
is lost to turbulent dissipation and mixing. Also of interest are the shape,
level heterogeneity and anisotropy of the vertical wavenumber spectrum on the
fine-scale (wavelength 10-50 m) as compared to that found in the open ocean.
Finally, the turbulence measurements will be used to assess the importance of
canyons to mixing at boundaries.
