The aim of this research is to study Noetherian rings and affine algebras, with
special reference to their representation theory. The principal investigator
will study extensions of modules with applications to localizations of
Noetherian rings. Attention will be focused on the graph of links of a
Noetherian ring, and how information contained in this graph can predict the
possible extensions of a module. The ideal theory of finite ring extensions will
also be considered in the hopes of using recent progress in this area to obtain
results on how the representation theories of a ring and a finite extension ring
are related. The principal investigator will also study affine algebras of
polynomial bounded growth, with special reference to the Gelfand- Kirillov
dimension and the associated Poincare series. Throughout there will be an
emphasis on the construction and study of appropriate examples. A ring is an
algebraic object having both an addition and a multiplication. These objects
arise naturally in many areas of mathematics. Given a ring, one area of
importance is if a ring containing the original one exists having certain
properties. The question of when it is possible to localize is of this type and
is a central topic in ring theory.
