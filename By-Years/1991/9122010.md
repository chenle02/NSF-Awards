This project supports the dissertation research of a cultural anthropology
student in Soviet Armenia. The student will interview residents of two Soviet
Armenian villages where local and diasporan Armenians are collaborating in
reconstruction projects following the 1988 earthquake. The project will study
how the rebuilding reflects local conceptions of national Armenian identity in
the current changing macro-political context of a dissolved Soviet Union. Using
participant observation, residential surveys, and formal interviews, the student
will see how plain citizens as well as architects and developers express
Armenian identity in their construction plans. This research is important
because knowledge of the nationalist feelings and values of Eastern European
peoples is critically important at this time in history, as the Soviet empire
reduces its scope.
