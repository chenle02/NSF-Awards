Abstract EEC-96-27936, National Technological University, Lionel V. Baldwin,
Principal Investigator This award provides funding to the National Technological
University for support of the 1996 National Engineers Week Teleconference for
Middle and High School Students. This seventh annual Discover Engineering
teleconference will be delivered nationwide during National Engineers Week, on
Feb. 21, 1996. The purpose of this teleconference is two-fold. First, the
program provides U.S. middle and high school students and their teachers with an
interesting insight into the work and career opportunities of engineers in a
novel teleconference setting. Secondly, the Discover Engineering telecast serves
as the centerpiece of open houses at many industrial, government and college
locations. The telecast series is central to many local activities wherein
engineers welcome students and teachers to the workplace, providing tours and
wraparound discussion which are stimulated by the telecast.
