The American Mathematical Society in a cooperative venture with the Mathematical
Association of America and the Society of Industrial and Applied Mathematics
will establish a collegiate mathematics education newsletter. Its purpose is to
stimulate greater communication between research mathematicians, and collegiate
mathematics educators. The newsletter will provide a balance of short, timely
items directing readers to sources of further information, and longer, more
substantive articles presenting discussion of important issues in collegiate
mathematics education. The newsletter will include articles on mathematics
curriculum, innovative teaching methods, funding for collegiate math education,
outside classroom activities, profiles of successful math programs, information
on conferences, workshops, courses, use of technology, review of international
activities, review of information in other publications, and a column for
queries.
