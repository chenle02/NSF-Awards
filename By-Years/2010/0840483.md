With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
Multiuser Program (CRIF:MU), Professor Benjamin S. Hsiao and colleagues Nancy S.
Goroff and Peter G. Khalifah from SUNY Stony Brook (SBU) will acquire an X-ray
diffractometer with variable temperature control and a 4-circle-kappa goniometer
configured for an enhanced molybdenum radiation source. This instrument will
benefit students from nine different research groups who will use the
diffractometer on a regular basis. The main research projects that will benefit
from this award are in the areas of inorganic periodic solids, inorganic
framework materials, lithium-ion batteries and other layered materials,
organometallic enzyme models, transition metal complexes, crystal engineering
and topochemical polymerizations, molecular electronics, conjugated organic
materials, and physics of electronic materials. In addition, at least 11 other
groups at SBU, whose research ranges from synthetic organic chemistry to
terrestrial magma formation, will benefit from occasional access to these
upgraded capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An X-ray diffractometer allows
accurate and precise measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a
molecule, including bond distances and angles, and provides accurate information
about the spatial arrangement of the molecule relative to the neighboring
molecules. The studies described here will impact a number of areas, including
chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an
integral part of teaching as well as research.
