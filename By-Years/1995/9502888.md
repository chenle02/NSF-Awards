9502888 Menoni A four year career development program that combines a research
plan in the technological important area of blue semiconductor lasers and
educational activities centered in the development of a freshmen course
"Introduction to Electrical Engineering" designed to motivate students early on
in their career, is proposed. A research plan is proposed to study the optical
and electronic properties of the II-VI quaternary ZnMgSSe which have significant
potential for the development of short wavelength semiconductor lasers. Short
wavelength semiconductor lasers will greatly impact high density optical
memories, laser printing and other important technological applications, whose
capabilities are presently limited by the use of infrared laser sources. Blue-
green laser have been demonstrated. However, their output characteristics are
still far from being ideal for most of these applications. Improved
characteristics will arise from a detailed understanding of the material
properties and device structure dependent processes which control the laser
operation. I propose to study carrier confinement, the mechanisms of carrier
capture and escape and recombination in ZnMgSSe MQWs. The results of these
studies will be first applied to the development of edge emitting lasers which
will be characterized from threshold current and gain and loss measurements. The
knowledge gained in the study of edge emitters will be applied to the design of
vertical cavity surface emitting lasers. The main focus of the proposed
educational activities lie in the development of a freshmen course "Introduction
to Electrical Engineering." This course is designed to captivate the interest of
the students into the different areas of Electrical Engineering at an early
stage on their career, and thus reduce the drop-out rate. I also envision this
class as an avenue to teach them different tools they will use throughout their
career and to show them how fun and challenging this pr ofession can be. ***
