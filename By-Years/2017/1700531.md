Across the country, jobs remain unfilled due to a shortage of workers with
technical skills and knowledge. The STEM Guitar Project is addressing this
"skills gap" by engaging high school and college faculty and students in hands-
on guitar design, manufacturing and construction and incorporating the technical
subjects into kinesthetic learning. The project motivates students to learn STEM
subjects and explore career interests in technical fields, thereby impacting the
skills gap found in industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the three-year
project, 10,800 secondary and postsecondary students will engage in science,
mathematics, and engineering technology practices through electric and acoustic
guitar design, manufacturing using Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machines and
construction activities, integrated into the school curriculum. While project-
based learning is recognized as a proven method to increase student learning,
effectiveness is highly dependent on the quality of professional development
educators receive. Therefore, the project provides: 1) faculty professional
development Institutes and year-long support and follow-up activities helping
instructors integrate STEM into their programs; 2) evaluative research with a
focus on student outcomes; and 3) an online STEM community of practice
supporting practitioners across the nation. The professional development is
aligned with national curriculum standards and industry skill sets and nurtures
the skills absent yet required of current and future technicians. In addition,
the project is engaging a diverse population into STEM learning, developing
their interest in STEM careers - a critical activity to address the STEM
technician shortage.
