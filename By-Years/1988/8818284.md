The objective of this project is to explore the applicability of ecological
principles to the process by which alternative concepts are evaluated for
selection of solutions to environmental engineering problems. Concepts derived
from energy analysis offer a potential for complementing traditional economic
indices in determining relative costs for alternative designs and in considering
the economic values of intact environmental systems. Results of this project are
expected to be applicable to a wide variety of problems that are addressed in
environmental engineering practice including water supply and treatment,
wastewater collection and treatment, solid waste management, and air pollution.
