The investigator continues his mathematical study of qualitative theory for
quasilinear hyperbolic-parabolic partial differential equations, including
analysis convection, compression, shearing, dissipation, and electromagnetism.
The main goal is to understand the nonlinear stability and instability in waves
in the contexts mentioned above. Applications include gas dynamics, elasticity,
multi-phase flow, magnetohydrodynamics, and combustion.
