&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dillard University will develop a strategic plan to guide
the systemic reform of its science, technology, engineering and mathematics
(STEM) curriculum with the goal of preparing students for entry and success into
the STEM workforce. Achievement of this goal will result in increased numbers of
African-American students pursing advanced degrees, obtaining doctoral degrees,
and entering the workforce and professoriate in STEM fields. Impacted
disciplines include biology, chemistry, computer science, mathematics, physics,
and pre-engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed systemic reform plan
includes the following objectives: &lt;br/&gt;- Strengths Weaknesses
Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) analysis of STEM programs, curricula,
instruction, and research practices at Dillard University;&lt;br/&gt;- SWOT
analysis of current and potential university partnerships and programs for
student and faculty research collaborations;&lt;br/&gt;- SWOT analysis of
current intervention and outreach programs that impact STEM educational
programs;&lt;br/&gt;- Development of an implementation plan for the systemic
reform of the STEM instructional and research enterprise at Dillard
University.&lt;br/&gt;
