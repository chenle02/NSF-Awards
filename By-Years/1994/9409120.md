This project develops a parallelizing compiler for distributed shared memory
systems, and incorporates a vertically integrated system to manage data and
thread locality in parallel programs. The compiler locates threads and data
statically whenever sufficient compile time information is available to make
near-optimal decisions. When such information is not available, the compiler
provides the underlying system with whatever information is available, and lets
the underlying system utilize the information. The project investigates the
following compile time issues as related to distributed memory systems: (1)
automatic parallelism for relaxed models of memory consistency, (2) elimination
of false sharing, (3) adaptive coherence protocols, and (4) communication
optimizations. Solutions to the issues are implemented within a compiler known
as Rochester Optimizing Compiler (ROC). These solutions will be evaluated using
standard benchmark programs such as LINPACK, SPEC, Perfect Club, SPLASH and the
HPF benchmark suite of Syracuse.
