Romberg 9614031 The Gateways V Conference, titled How Can Curricula Best be
Disseminated and Implemented, brings together leaders from all the National
Science Foundation funded elementary, middle, and high school comprehensive
mathematics curriculum projects in order to share information and experiences,
and address common questions that have surfaced as materials have been
developed, tested, and implemented. This edition of Gateways is hosted by the
Mathematics in Context materials development project at the University of
Wisconsin, Madison. A special feature is a panel discussion on implementation,
which is an issue of major concern to the materials developers and to NSF.
