Plants and herbivores comprise the majority of the earth's biodiversity and
their evolutionary interactions have resulted in an arms race in which plant
defenses are met by counter adaptations on the part of herbivores. In tropical
forests, the vast majority of herbivory occurs by insects feeding on young
rather than mature leaves and there is enormous variation in damage among
species, yet we know little of the underlying causes of this variation. Using an
approach that explicitly considers the evolutionary history of the interaction,
this project will examine the chemical defenses of young leaves of tropical
legume trees, and correlate this with other plant defenses, with leaf damage by
insect herbivores, and with herbivore life history traits. Methods include
analyses of plant chemistry, feeding trials with herbivores to assess toxicity,
and field measurement of herbivory, timing of leaf expansion, and diet breadth
of herbivores. This project will improve our general understanding of the
ecological and evolutionary interactions between plants and herbivores, and will
provide data on poorly known tropical forests. In addition, the plants under
study have commercial value (fruit), and are used for reforestation and for
enriching soil nutrients.
