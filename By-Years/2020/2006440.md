Brain networks, protein‐protein interactions, and social networks all build on
basic ingredients of sets, trees, and graphs, yet a theory of information for
such advanced dynamic data structures is lacking. Fundamental questions for such
data structures include: What are the fundamental limits on storage and
processing of structural and temporal information? What are the limits on the
extraction of information from large biological databases? What are the fewest
bits of an incomplete database needed to reliably answer a query? This project
seeks to find answers to these questions and thus make headway in information
theory for dynamic structures by finding efficient algorithms to appraise
structural and temporal information – whether it is embodied in graphs of social
networks, Markov fields of images, or protein tertiary
structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific goals of the project are as
follows: 1) Finding fundamental limits of information content in a wide range of
dynamic structures, including dynamic networks, Markov fields, and structurally
complex channels such as Boltzmann’s channel; 2) Examining dynamic networks by:
(a) Inferring underlying dynamic processes governing network evolution; (b)
determining the minimum number of bits to describe dynamic networks; and (c)
inferring spatial‐temporal properties such as node arrivals; 3) Understanding
structural properties of large systems with local mutual dependencies,
constraints, and interactions often described by Markov fields; 4) Analyzing
flow of structural information over a noisy channel. Tools developed as part of
the project will be used in areas such as characterization of biological and
social networks, deciphering evolution of the human brain, development of a
comprehensive formal model for misinformation, and designing a robust pervasive
communications infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
