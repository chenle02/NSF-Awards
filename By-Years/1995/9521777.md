Korzennik, Sylvain 95-21777 Dr. Korzennik will analyze and interpret solar data
from the Global Oscillations Network Group (GONG) in order to advance our
understanding of the causes of the 11-year cycle of sunspots and solar magnetic
activity. Decades of study of magnetic activity strongly suggest that the
activity cycle is somehow caused by a dynamo process involving the interaction
of rotation and convection in the interior. Unfortunately, detailed
understanding of this process is frustrated by our inability to measure the
rotation or convective flows deep within the Sun. Helioseismic data from the
GONG will permit the study of rotational and convective flows at and beneath the
solar surface, with velocity precision and spatial resolution sufficient to test
theoretical models of solar magnetic field generation.
