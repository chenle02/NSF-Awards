Lead-based paints are commonly used on steel substrates for opacity,
reactivity, durability, lubrication, and corrosion protection purposes.
Conventional sand blasting methods for removal of such paint coatings result in
significant environmental problems and associated disposal costs. This research
is directed toward establishment of an alternative technique namely a laser
system for paint removal with considerations of minimum cost, pollution and
hazards. Fundamental interactions between the laser beam and the paint will be
investigated, such as ablation, spallation,and evaporation mechanisms.
