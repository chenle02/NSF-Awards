This project is aimed at a systematic investigation of the variations of
superconductive properties with thallium content and carrier concentration in
thallium cuprates. Superconductive properties will be correlated with structure
and chemical composition, including hole concentration and oxygen content, for a
number of thallium cuprate systems. The proposed study will help to gain an
understanding of the superconductive mechanism, and will also help to optimize
synthetic procedures and chemical compositions required for more homogeneous
materials with higher Tc, or for the preparation of new materials.
