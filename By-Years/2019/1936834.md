This award supports travel of a diverse group of approximately 25 dissertation-
stage students at U.S. institutions to participate in an international doctoral
consortium with distinguished research faculty. The Organizational Communication
and Information Systems (OCIS) doctoral consortium at the 2019 Academy of
Management (AoM) convention in Boston, Massachusetts, will consist of one and a
half days of talks and interactions among OCIS students and researchers. The
doctoral consortium provides students with feedback on their work from other
students and faculty members, allowing them to enhance their own dissertation
research proposals. Additionally, because of the diversity of the business sub-
disciplines and communities involved in the AoM conference, the consortium will
allow students to establish research connections beyond their own disciplines.
Consequently, participation will allow students to develop a better
understanding of the different research communities, which will facilitate their
participation in future interdisciplinary research and their progress toward
becoming professional researchers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The OCIS division at
the annual AoM meeting provides a leading international forum for the
presentation and discussion of research and practical issues related to the use
and impact of information and communication technologies in organizations and
society. This project provides a forum for doctoral students to exchange
insights and receive feedback and guidance in order to enhance the quality of
their dissertation research. It also facilitates the establishment of new
research collaborations and professional networks and develops a greater
awareness of ongoing cutting-edge research in the field of organizational
communication and information systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
