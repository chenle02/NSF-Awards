The solar surface layers are characterized by numerous energetic phenomena that
follow an eleven-year cycle, the so-called sunspot cycle. The next maximum in
this cycle will occur in 1991. The number of sunspots and energetic erruptions
is now, in 1989, already steadily increasing and building up to the maximum two
years hence. The most energetic phenomena of such a cycle are called "flares."
They are regions characterized by the localized buildup of strong magnetic
fields, the sudden release of energy associated with these fields, acceleration
of charged particles, and heating of plasma. The Principal Investigator proposes
to carry out an observational project with the goal of understanding better the
origin and temporal development of solar flares. In particular, he will
determine the spatial and temporal distribution of energetic particle
acceleration in the solar atmosphere and their effects on the structure and
evolution of magnetic fields. In addition, he will study magnetic reconnection,
shocks, and energy and momentum transport during the course of flare
development. New and existing data will be used.
