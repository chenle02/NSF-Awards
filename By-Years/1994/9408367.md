A number of important surface analytical tools rely on an understanding of the
transmission of ions through solids. This research project, supported by the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, is designed to explore the fundamental
scattering and charge transfer processes that influence ion transport through
solids having different chemical and electronic properties. Electron stimulated
desorption of ions from substrates overlayed with thin films of metal and metal
oxide will be used to probe the transmission of ions through these layers. Ion
angular distributions, yields, and ion charge exchange processes will be
measured for a range of different thin film overlayers. The understanding
obtained from these studies will impact surface analysis methodology as well as
various material processing technologies using ions. The detailed interactions
of ions with solid surfaces are the focus of this research project. Using
electron stimulated desorption of ions through carefully controlled thin films
of various materials, the fundamentals of the ion-solid interaction will be
probed. This information will be useful for the development of surface
analytical tools, and in the ion processing of solid surfaces.
