9401192 Moscovici The proposed research aims to: (1) develop an Alexander-
Spanier version of the Chern character; (2) obtain explicit local formulae for
the Pontryagin classes of topological manifolds; (3) develop a theory of
straight characteristic classes for foliations of Lipschitz manifolds; (4)
obtain residual index formulae for abstract elliptic operators in terms of the
Dixmier trace; (5) recover the holomorphic torsion of a Hermitian locally
symmetric manifold by means of a geometric zeta function. The "quantized"
differential and integral calculus, recently invented by Alain Connes, will be
applied to the treatment of certain open problems in several areas of
mathematics -topology, geometry and operator algebras. ***
