Professor Livingston will investigate topics concerning parallel computation.
Graph embeddings will be studied in the context of simulating one parallel
computer on another with a different interconnection scheme. Particular
attention will be directed to hypercube architectures. Fault tolerant allocation
schemes will be studied along with parallel approximation algorithms.
