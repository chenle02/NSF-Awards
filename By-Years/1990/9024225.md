The places where one stream flows into another are important points in stream
systems. Abrupt changes in the velocity and direction of water flow and in the
shape and character of streambeds alter the character of the streams and create
distinctive ecological niches within which certain species thrive and others are
repelled. Most research on the geomorphic and ecological dynamics of stream
confluences has been conducted in laboratories using flume experiments or on
computers using mathematical models. Some field observations have been made, but
measurements usually have been limited to a few variables. This project will
explore geomorphic and ecological processes empirically by taking detailed
measurements of a wide range of variables at the confluence of two streams of
roughly equivalent size in central Illinois. These measurements will be used to
determine how temporal variations in the different rates of velocity for the two
merging streams affect interactions among flows, streambed morphology, and
sediment transport. A related set of measurements of biotic phenomena will be
used to assess habitat conditions and to determine how geomorphic
characteristics of the confluence influence the structure and function of
aquatic communities upstream and downstream from the confluence. Some members of
the investigative team engaged in field observations and data analysis will be
undergraduate students funded through the Research Experiences for
Undergraduates program. This research project is an intensive case study at a
single site, but the measurements collected at that site will provide a coherent
test of qualitative and mathematic models that have been developed in laboratory
and theoretical settings. In addition to providing empirical tests of these
models, the project also will contribute to evaluation of the efficacy of
methods to obtain detailed measurements in settings like this. The addition of
the undergraduate students to the project's research team will enhance the study
and will provide valuable experience for promising undergraduats.
