Dr. Victoria Buch at the University of Illinois, Chicago, is doing theoretical
research on molecular processes taking place on the surfaces of interstellar
grains. The processes include sticking of gas particles on grains, accumulation
and desorption of dirty ice mantles on grain surfaces, and mobility of particles
on and within the mantles. Interstellar chemistry has emerged as a new and
exciting field during the past 20 years, and observations of the spectra of
molecules are a major diagnostic tool for probing the interiors of interstellar
clouds. A detailed understanding of the formation and destruction processes of
molecules under physical conditions applicable to interstellar clouds is of
great importance for the interpretation of the observational data. Dr. Buch's
theoretical studies of molecular processes on grains will enable a more accurate
and thorough interpretation of observations.
