This proposal provides a plan for enhancing the level of knowledge and skills
in basic science for 75 secondary agriscience teachers. The project is for three
years and will include the following: development of a yearly summer institute
in basic and applied science concepts; the methodology of teaching science; and
curriculum materials development designed to integrate the scientific concepts
and teaching methodologies of the institute. Cost sharing is equivalent to 51%
of the NSF award.
