This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site project is in the areas
of chemistry and chemical engineering. For a three- year period beginning April
1992 eight (8) undergraduate students will spend ten (10) weeks engaged in
research in the chemical sciences, under the direction of various members of the
faculty in both the Chemistry and Chemical Engineering Departments. The summer
research experience will be in projects drawn from material science and in
biotechnology. Seminars, tours, and the projects will allow the chemistry and
chemical engineering students to see how the two disciplines strongly overlap,
and how they are synergistic.
