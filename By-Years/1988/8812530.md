This project is a continuation of an earlier project that investigated the
accumulation of fine-grained sediment on the continental shelf near the mouth of
the Amazon River. The earliest research proved that sediment was actively
accumulating, and later research identified the sedimentary processes
controlling accumulation. This project will examine in detail the operation of
the processes and how they affect the formation of sedimentary strata. This new
research will be done as the Sedimentology and Stratigraphy portion of AmasSeds
(A Multi-disciplinary Amazon Shelf SEDiment Study), which is a cooperative
project between US and Brazilian scientists. The project involves collaboration
of Physical, Chemical, Biological, and Geological Sciences. %%% The project will
examine mechanisms of Holocene strata formation over a range of time and
vertical-length scales. Time scales will be evaluated using several
radiochemical techniques (Th-234,Pb-210, Cs-137, C-14) and length scales will be
examined using a range of coring (box cores, kasten cores, piston cores,
borings) and high-resolution seismic techniques (3.5-kHz system, lower-frequency
system). Cooperation with the other groups of AmasSeds will provide much
information about the sedimentary processes controlling strata formation, and
the resulting stratigraphy will be characterized by a range of observational
techniques (SEM, optical microscopy, x- radiography, seismic stratigraphy). The
research derives importance from its evaluation of a major subaqueous delta,
which is typical of the largest dispersal systems for fluvial sediment in the
world. These large systems have a profound influence on modern oceans, and have
a good potential for reaching the geological record. The study area is the
continental shelf near the mouth of the Amazon River, where the previous
research associated with this grant allows establishment and testing of advanced
hypotheses regarding strata formation.
