9318328 Kim The objective of this project is to investigate the functionality
and the specificity of neural networks formed from artificially cultured
biological neurons on a VLSI chip, with respect to information processing. To
achieve the objective, methods to understand signal transmission and processing
in neurites, as well as the methods to understand the operation of neural
networks formed from biological neurons. For this project, there are three
goals: 1) investigate the dynamic neuronal connectivity of function-specific
neurons of the snail, Helisoma trivolvis on a VLSI chip with real time
measurements. 2) test the hypothesis that the synapsin molecules play an
important role on the information processing as the neighboring associated
molecules of cytoskeleton of neurites. 3) develop a nonlinear dynamic Hebbian-
like learning algorithm based on the mathematical modeling of the experimental
results. The proposed research will develop a new discipline called synthetic
neuroscience, i.e. the use of electronics technology to assist the quantitative
understanding of the brian, bringing together neuroscience and electronic chip
engineering.
