A fluorescence spectrometer and accessories is being used in upper division
teaching and in student research. The instrument is being used in laboratory
courses in inorganic and analytical chemistry and in undergraduate are research
projects in inorganic chemistry, biochemistry, physical chemistry and in joint
projects with members of the Biological Sciences department. In the teaching
labs experiments have been designed to use fluorescence to measure rates of fast
reactions and to illustrate the use of fluorescence as an analytical tool.
Research uses are in projects dealing with the photophysics of metal complexes,
membrane properties of a particular class of cyanobacteria, measurement of
crosslinking in membrane research and the equilibration between photosystems I
and II in plants. The grantee is matching the award from non-Federal sources.
