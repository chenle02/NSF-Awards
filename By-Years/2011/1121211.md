Understanding how developmental mechanisms evolve to generate novel traits in
form or disease is a major challenge of contemporary biology. By exploiting the
knowledge of developmental mechanisms in genetic model organisms such as the
fruit fly Drosophila, this challenge can be addressed in great molecular detail.
This proposal takes advantage of a newly established experimental system, the
hover fly Episyrphus balteatus (Syrphidae), to understand the genetic mechanism
underlying the origin of the amnioserosa tissue, which guides important
morphogenetic movements in the Drosophila embryo. The amnioserosa is not
conserved but combines characteristics of two distinct tissues commonly found in
other insects, the amnion and the serosa. The research goal is to understand how
the genetic pathways specifying the serosa and the amnion merged into a single
tissue. Episyrphus is the closest relative of Drosophila known to develop
distinct amniotic and serosal epithelia and therefore of key importance for
understanding this transition. By studying amnion and serosa specification in
this species, it is expected to better understand how mechanisms of cell fate
specification and tissue formation evolve to generate major novel traits.
General benefits of this project to the research community and society will
result from a deeper understanding of developmental and evolutionary mechanisms,
from developing and promoting new experimental systems, and from inspiring a new
generation to pursue a career in science.
