Infants that are involuntarily separated from their mothers may suffer severe
physiological and behavioral consequences. Most of what we know concerning the
physiological effects has derived from studies using nonhuman primates. These
effects include increases in sympathetic activity, changes in neurotransmitter
levels, and increased activity of the pituitary-adrenal system, a neuroendocrine
system associated with stress. For many years, it was only possible to study
such questions in primates since common laboratory rodents have been thought to
respond to separation in a fundamentally different way than do primates, and
possibly humans. With his previous NSF support, Dr. Hennessy demonstrated that
the responses of young guinea pigs to maternal separation are in many ways
similar to those of primates. The guinea pig model provides an alternative to
primate research which, in turn, offers many practical advantages. Dr. Hennessy
would continue his research to further our understanding of how brief periods of
maternal separation alter neuroendocrine and behavioral functioning. These
studies will contribute to our understanding of the consequences of mother-
infant separation and processes of attachment and elucidate the nature of the
stress response in young.
