Theoretical investigations are performed for the interaction of laser light
with atoms. The result is the excitation and/or ionization of one or more atomic
electrons and perhaps the generation of radiation at wavelengths different from
those of the laser. Mathematical and computational methods will be developed to
account for the coupling of the intense laser radiation to the atomic electrons
and to the details of the atomic structure. Predictions will be employed in the
interpretation of ongoing experiments and provide a guide for the design of
future experiments.
