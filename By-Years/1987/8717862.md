The objective of this project is to improve current knowledge on the effect of
wind around bluff objects of circular cross-section at high Reynolds numbers.
The work includes: 1) measurements of strains, displacements, accelerations and
pressures experienced under wind loads by the 300 m TV Tower at Shenyang, PRC;
2) the analysis of these measurements; and 3) the use of these results in
current physical and mathematical models used in estimating wind effects on
structures with circular cross-section. The results of this project will benefit
the design and construction practices of tall, slender structures subjected to
strong wind loading. This project is jointly sponsored by NSF and the Chinese
State Education Commission under the 1980 Protocol on Cooperation in Basic
Sciences.
