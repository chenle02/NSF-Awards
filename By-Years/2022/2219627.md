This grant supports the Doctoral Mentoring Consortium (DMC) at the Association
for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence conference on Artificial
Intelligence (AAAI) that will be held in virtually, Feb 22 - Mar 1, 2022. This
is the premier international conference for researchers in artificial
intelligence (AI) research across a fully international research community. This
activity will bring together a broad community of researchers in the field of AI
and support junior researchers at this critical early-career stage. The DMC
creates the opportunity to bring in participants who might not have attended an
AI conference due to lack of resources. This is especially true for those at
smaller institutions and those which have less developed AI programs. Engaging
such participants has the potential to draw more talent into AI research,
improve research ideas in their formative stage, and engender collaborations
across the breadth of disciplines. This event provides students with invaluable
exposure to outside perspectives on their work at a critical time in their
research and enables them to explore their career
objectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
