This project is to investigate the dynamics of the North Atlantic Ocean by
comparing the density field from observations with comparable areas resulting
from the applications of a model based on the method of characteristics by
luyten &amp; &amp; Stommel. A comparison of terms in the potential thickness
equations is indicative of the source of local characteristics as derived from
eastern and western boundaries. A mapping of the N. Atlantic based on the
characteristics will be made. A second effort will be to relate the diagnostics
to climatological wind-stress, heat- flux, and evaporation/precipitation. A
simple laboratory experiment will be performed to examine vorticity dynamics for
cross-equatorial floe.
