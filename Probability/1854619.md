This award supports fundamental research on mathematical models that describe
complex interactions, growth and motion in an irregular environment. These
mathematical systems incorporate also random unpredictability. The goal is to
discover general mathematical laws that govern such systems. These systems
appear quite different at small scales and large scales. So it is important to
understand how different rules for small-scale evolution lead to different
large-scale system-wide behavior. Real-world phenomena that such mathematical
studies can illuminate include the motion of vehicles, packets in a
communication network, fluid particles in a tube, wetting transitions where
fluid spreads in a porous medium, epidemics advancing in a population, or the
fluctuations of a polymer chain in a fluid. Over the long term understanding
complex interactions has profound implications for science and engineering and
thereby for society. Mathematical systems of the kind described in the proposal
are intensely and concurrently studied by mathematicians, natural scientists,
social scientists, and engineers.

This project investigates mathematical models of growth and motion in random
media. Examples include first-passage percolation, the corner growth model,
random walk in random environment, and directed polymer models. The objectives
of this work are mathematically rigorous descriptions of the behavior of these
models and the development of robust tools for their analysis. Specific goals
include regularity of limit shapes, properties of optimal paths such as their
length, fluctuations and geometric features, descriptions of large scale limits
in terms of variational formulas and entropy, and descriptions of probability
distributions of complicated random geometric objects such as trees of geodesics
and competition interfaces. The methods employed in this work are those of
rigorous mathematical research, aided by experimental computer simulation.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
