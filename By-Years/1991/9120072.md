We have determined that two important magnetospheric boundary regions on the
side, the low-latitude boundary layer (LLBL) and the cusp, can be identified
from energetic particle observations as well as from observations of
magnetosheath-energy particle precipitation on polar-orbiting satellites. We
propose to analyze simultaneous observations of magnetosheath energy particles
obtained from the S3-3 satellite in order to identify these boundary regions, to
analyze processes occurring within these boundary regions, and to investigate
the mapping of these regions from the magnetosphere to the ionosphere. We will
compare the identification obtined using the criteria developed be Newell and
Meng Ä±1988! for magnetosheath-energy particles. In this way, we will investigate
the accuracy of both techniques as well as determine the advantages of using
energetic particle measurements to supplement and verify the identification
obtainable using the Newell and Meng criteria. In addition, using the measured
angular distributions of particles, we will investigate the extent to which the
LLBL lies on closed field lines and estimate the locations of auroral
acceleration regions relative to each of the magnetospheric boundary regions and
to the open-closed field line boundary. We also propose to determine criteria
for distinguishing between precipitation from the LLBL and that from the plasma
sheet boundary layer. We will use the criteria to study the important transition
between these two boundary layers as mapped to the ionosphere. Using the
electric and magnetic field data from S3-3, we plan to study the spatial
relations between the convection reversal, field-ligned currents, the different
boundary regions, and the open-closed field line boundary. In this way, we hope
to gain significant information on the extent to which the magnetospheric
electric field is generated by reconnection versus viscous interaction and on
the generation regions for day side field-aligned currents. Finally, using
precipitation data from the identically instrumented, almost co-orbiting, DMSP
F6 and F8 satellites, we will pursue the separation of temporal and spatial
effects over latitudinal scale sizes as small as 10km within the day side
boundary layers.
