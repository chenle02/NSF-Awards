This research examines certain definability and decidability problems for
finite models, motivated by the theory of relational databases. Among them are
problems of existence of recursive characterizations for specific classes of
queries (formulas), such as, safe, monotone, or distributive queries. In
addition, this project investigates the expressive power of different logical
languages for finite models, particularly in the absence of linear order. Among
the targeted languages are those of first order logic, different fixpoint
logics, implicit definability, and of fragments of infinitary logics. The main
goal here is to expand numerous definability results for ordered models to wider
classes of models, for example, finitely axiomatizable classes of rigid models.
