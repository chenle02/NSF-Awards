A multi-channeled, electromagnetic cable winch with automated multi- parameter
probe sensors will be used by undergraduate students from six southern
California state universities aboard the Southern California Ocean Studies
Consortium teaching vessel. With this winch and instrumentation the laboratory
exercises will expose students to the application of current principles and
analytical techniques. The equipment makes possible a continuity in the
laboratory exercises by eliminating the need to return to the home campus for
data analyses. This provides the students with a much needed "hands on"
experience with automated instrumentation. This type of experience with this
equipment in the "at sea" laboratory enhances the preparation of prospective
graduates for future professional work.
