Funds are requested to purchase a coupled gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer
that will be used primarily in studies of the ecology, behavior and physiology
of insects. Several projects are proposed. The instrument will be used to
identify pheromones and other behaviorally active compounds from bark beetles
that inhabit pine trees. Another project will study the biosynthetic pathway of
phenromones in fruit flies and also cuticular lipids that are important water
proofing agents in mole crickets. Another study will use the instrument to study
allochemicals and their metabolites that are responsible for enzyme induction in
insects. Cardiac glycosides and pyrrolizidine alkaloids used as defensive
compounds by butterflies will be identified with the instrument. Finally, the
insect hormones involved in host parasite interactions will also be determined.
