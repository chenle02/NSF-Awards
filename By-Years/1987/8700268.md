After demonstrating the overall feasibility of the computer modeling approach
to investigate the frictional behavior of rolling bearings in Phase I, this
Phase II research effort is directed towards the development of a comprehensive
understanding of frictional interactions and the fundamental mechanics of
initiation of an instability in the motion of bearing elements. The fundamental
interaction models in the available computer codes for bearing performance
simulation shall be greatly enhanced and significant correlations between
bearing geometry and the frictional behavior between the bearing elements, shall
be developed for both ball and cylindrical roller bearings. The research effort,
in addition to a significant contribution to the rolling bearing technology,
shall result in enhanced computer codes which will provide the foundations for
technology transfer and development of specific designs. The findings of the
research shall be significant for the design and performance simulation for a
wide range of rolling bearings; the rolling elements bearings used in automotive
and aircraft engines, gyroscopes and guidance systems, satellites and a variety
of computer hardware are some examples. The results shall be particularly
significant for solid lubricated rolling bearings used in adverse operating
environments, such as the adiabatic diesel engines in automotive applications.
