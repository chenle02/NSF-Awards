This is a collaborative project to build a system of arrays that will serve as a
pathfinder for future Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) instruments. The arrays
will use detectors known as Microwave Kinetic Inductance Device (MKID) detectors
in multiple frequencies between 130 GHz and 280 GHz. Each array will have 20
elements. Broader impacts of the work include the training of undergraduate and
graduate students in instrumentation development, which helps build the US
workforce in STEM fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The MKID arrays are tailored for
experiments that are designed to simultaneously characterize the polarization
properties of both the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and Galactic dust
emission. The device design builds from successful transition edge sensor (TES)
bolometer architectures that have been demonstrated to work in instruments on
the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and South Pole Telescope (SPT).
