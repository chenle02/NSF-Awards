This project installs a new MF radar in the subtropical southern hemisphere and
for use in correlative studies of large-scale dynamics of the equatorial and
global mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT). The radar, located at a southern
hemisphere site conjugate to a similar system operating in Hawaii, would provide
sensitivity to atmospheric tidal structures in a location with no present
measurement capabilities. The PI will use data from new and existing radars to
examine interhemispheric tidal structure and variability, tidal responses to
source variations in the lower atmosphere, and global structure and zonal wave
numbers of other planetary-scale motions in the MLT. Analyses of equatorial and
subtropical tidal variability closely link to parallel numerical studies of the
atmospheric responses to local tidal forcing, enabling a quantitative
understanding of the causes of tidal variability.
