9317327 ASHLEY Advanced petrological and geochemical analysis of stone
artifacts provides a unique opportunity for resolving questions about
prehistoric societies, including migration and trading routes by the earliest
Americans. This dissertation research will focus on the study of chert outcrops
and the correlation of their petrological and geochemical signatures with those
of chert artifacts from prehistoric sites in northwest Alaska. The petrological
correlation will be made using microscopy, electron microprobe analysis of
mineral inclusions and microfossil identification. The geochemical correlation
will be based on statistical results of neutron activation analysis of trace
elements. ***
