This project studies Web Information Extraction (WIE), the task of automatically
extracting computer-understandable knowledge bases (KBs) from the World Wide
Web. The project addresses two key challenges in WIE. First, many different
teams in academia and industry are pursuing WIE, but they lack methods for
combining their KBs into a more powerful whole. This project explores how to
integrate knowledge automatically across WIE systems and approaches. Secondly, a
long-standing goal for WIE is to construct systems that can scale to billions of
facts, by continually improving themselves over time. This project is
investigating new methods that continually optimize a WIE system with limited
human intervention. The project's goal of scaling and integrating WIE systems
promises to address needs in the research community, the computing industry, and
the public. Methods that allow different WIE systems to seamlessly exchange
knowledge could dramatically hasten the progress of Web extraction efforts
currently underway in academia and industry. For the public, advances in Web
extraction promise to enable improved search engines that can assist users with
tasks and answer complex questions. Further, through application prototypes, the
project will provide public-facing information retrieval tools that promise to
help users retrieve, understand, and analyze the Web's knowledge more rapidly.
The project's research is also integrated with an education plan that includes
outreach to underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical
solutions pursued in the project utilize probability distributions over natural
language. For the integration challenge, the project is developing new
Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that leverage the expressiveness of
natural language to automatically integrate current and future WIE systems, even
when the systems extract from different types of corpora and represent knowledge
in different ways. For the scaling challenge, the project is developing ways to
continually optimize new Statistical Language Models (SLMs) over text on the
Web. The project investigates the SLM approach for WIE theoretically, asking
what types of knowledge different SLMs can encode, and how much text is required
to obtain the knowledge. Further, the project introduces new SLM capabilities,
including methods for scaling to larger corpora and more semantic classes, and
novel models that incorporate collocations, quantitative attributes, sense
disambiguation, and actively-selected human input. The project web site

access to results, including software, corpora, and evaluation data sets.
