The widespread uses of suspensions in industry such as paint products, slurry
fuels, and coal slurry transportation have for long provided motivations for
their study. Recently, additional impetus for study of suspensions has been
generated since coal-water slurry (CWS) fuel was recognized as the potentially
most economical means for the usage of coal, one of the nation's most abundant
energy resources, to replace oil in utility boilers. The research is concerned
with experimental and theoretical studies of two related subjects, rheology and
airblast atomization, in concentrated suspensions of particles larger than
colloidal sizes. The major research objective is to improve understanding of the
structure and the underlying mechanisms of concentrated suspensions with
application to CWS technology. Research emphasis will be placed on particle-
particle and particle-fluid interactions as affected by particle surface
property.
