The Massachusetts Institute of Technology -- Haystack Observatory will initiate
a 2-week commuter Young Scholars project in Astronomy for 20 students in grades
7-9. The students will be given direct exposure to a multidisciplinary research
facility engaged in radio astronomy, geodesy, and the atmospheric sciences. A
personal and career component explores technical career options and the skills
that are needed to achieve success in high-level science/math coursework and
technological fields. The students are exposed to a direct hands-on experience
using the Groton-Dunstable Regional Schools' computer banks and data collection
from the Haystack instrumentation with guidance from staff. Follow-up activities
involve mentor scientists from Haystack bridging between the Observatory and the
teachers and classes from which these students come, as well as a conference
supporting the science endeavor of these young students in the spring at the
Observatory.
