This proposal is to request partial funding for a sum of $10,000 for the Fourth
International Conference on Surface Modification Technologies that is to be held
in Paris, France between 6-9 November 1990. The purpose of this annual
conference is to bring together diverse experts, researchers and scientists from
interdisciplinary areas ranging from the basic sciences to practical
industrialists and end users for the various surface technologies. Surface
Modification is one of the key areas that will increase the "Competitiveness" of
American industry as it is a vital ingredient in both the manufacturing and
remanufacturing sector.
