A grant has been awarded to Utah Valley State College under the direction of
Dr. James G. Harris and Dr. Renee Van Buren for partial support of a project to
digitize plant collection data from the UVSC Herbarium and make the information
available on the worldwide web to students, researchers, and the general public
as a virtual herbarium. Each collection record will be entered into a searchable
online database, georeferenced for use in Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
applications, and photographed with a high-resolution digital camera. Users of
the UVSC Virtual Herbarium will be able to locate specimen records in a
searchable database, plot plant distributions on a map, and view high-resolution
photographic images that will permit critical examination of the morphological
details of each specimen. The Virtual Herbarium will increase the educational
and scientific value of the UVSC Herbarium by providing unlimited access to
collection data and by facilitating rapid integration and analysis of the data.
In addition, the Virtual Herbarium, by reducing the need to handle actual
herbarium specimens, will reduce the incidental damage that inevitably occurs
with their use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The UVSC Virtual Herbarium will
significantly enhance botanical education at UVSC. Students enrolled in a
variety of botany courses and members of the UVSC Plant Identification Team
require access to the UVSC Herbarium for study. The Virtual Herbarium will
provide students with continuous access from any computer with a connection to
the worldwide web. In addition, the UVSC Virtual Herbarium will be a valuable
tool for researchers in a wide variety of fields, including systematics,
ecology, and plant geography. The UVSC Herbarium includes National Park
collections, specimens collected for a study of Utah endangered plants, one of
the most complete collections in the country of the arctic/alpine plant genus
Braya (Cruciferae), and specimens from remote and poorly collected locations in
Utah. Access to the UVSC Virtual Herbarium will be of value to land managers,
state and federal agencies charged with inventorying and protecting the nation's
endangered and threatened plants, and other individuals and organizations
needing information about plant identification and distribution.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The UVSC Virtual Herbarium will have an educational and
scientific impact throughout the region. Public schools and smaller colleges
typically do not have herbaria. The UVSC Virtual Herbarium will serve as an
educational resource for teachers and students at these institutions as well as
for students at larger universities who may not have adequate access to a
herbarium. The UVSC Virtual Herbarium will meet a need that is currently not
being met, by providing a valuable scientific and educational resource to the
public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
