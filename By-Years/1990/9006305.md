The Inter-Congress Committee on Tephrochronology of the International
Quaternary Association will hold a field conference and workshop in Wyoming in
June, 1990. This is to promote international communication, determine current
status of worldwide studies, assess the impact of new developments in related
fields, and promote dialogue on the role of tephra (volcanic extrusions) in
solving fundamental Quaternary stratigraphic problems. This award is to defray
expenses for a symposium on the relationship of these dating mechanisms to
questions of hominid fossils in East Africa. Some of the most exciting finds
relating to human origins have come from East Africa and tephrostratigraphic
correlations have been among the most important mechanisms to fix firmly the
dates of various early hominid fossils. All the participants in the symposium
have made, or are making, substantial contributions to the advancement of
paleoanthropological knowledge.
