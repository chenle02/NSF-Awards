The principal investigator will study certain random phenomena using ideas from
geometry, especially convex geometry. The latter will provide spatial insight
together with novel analytical tools. Among the questions to be considered are
certain features of Gaussian processes, hypothesis testing of directional data,
random matrices, a spatial median, random curve models, and a new approach, to
statistical theory of shape. Applications of the investigator's work will be to
image processing and biology.
