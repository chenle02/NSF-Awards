Kingsville, TX 783640201 ILI - Instrumentation Project: Life Sciences Title:
Improvement of a Plant Physiology Laboratory at Texas A&amp;M University-
Kingsville Funds are being requested to add equipment to a Plant Physiology
laboratory at Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville that is integral to high
school biology teacher preparation.. The equipment requested; a Wescore
Osmometer, Oxygen electrodes, monitors and chart recorders, and a Sorvall RC-5C
Centrifuge with a rotor adds a new and advanced element to an already existing
upper-level Plant Physiology lab. In depth studies in Transpiration and Water
Relations, Photosynthesis, Enzyme Kinetics and Protein Purification are now
possible using the equipment requested. South Texas plants are emphasized so
that the students in this course preparing for careers as high school teachers
may better relate to, and understand, the environment around them. The equipment
is also being used in Introductory Botany laboratory exercises, Cell Biology
labs and extensively, by undergraduate students, doing directed research in the
PI's laboratory.
