A double-cylinder, opposing transmission, proportioning positive displacement
pump is being acquired for use in providing a constant, accurate flow
calorimeter system. The calorimeter is presently used to measure the enthalpy of
model compound mixtures exhibiting effects of association present in coal-
derived liquids. The current system under study is the m-cresol, quinoline,
tetralin ternary system. Measurements are obtained at elevated temperatures
(700K) and pressures (13MPa) where experimental data for higher boiling fluid
systems are very scarce. Development of an automated flow calorimeter system is
currently underway. It is anticipated that this calorimeter will greatly
simplify the data collection effort. This will result in the development of a
data base for those fluids, such as polar associating liquids, for which
correlation methods are not available.
