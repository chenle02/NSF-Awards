The objective of this project is to study the effects of electron beam
irradiation on contaminants of water to determine engineering design parameters
for design of decontamination systems based on use of this concept. This project
involves use of a 1.5 million volt electron accelerator with a beam current of
50 milliamperes located at the Miami-Dade Water and Sewer Authority's Wastewater
Treatment Plant on Virginia Key in Miami, Florida. This accelerator was
installed originally to obtain engineering design parameters for full-scale use
of electron-beam irradiation to disinfect sludges derived from treatment of
wastewater. Having served this purpose, it has become available for use in
conduct of additional research. An initial phase of this project includes
detailed assessment of the readiness-status of the accelerator and associated
equipment, design of potential modifications to meet this project's objective,
and to conduct a workshop/conference to assist in modification of the research
plan to take full advantage of recent advances in knowledge regarding the
application of ionizing radiation for this and related purposes. A system for
decontamination of water supplies contaminated by organic substances could be
responsive to the problem of widespread contamination of groundwater aquifers
and surface water supplies of the United States caused by improper management of
hazardous wastes, leaking underground storage tanks for petroleum products and
solvents, and accidental spills of chemicals in transit to users. This unit that
has been made available for conduct of research to the University of Miami and
Florida International University offers a unique capability to operate an
irradiation system at a sufficiently large scale to obtain data for engineering
design of decontamination systems utilizing knowledge gained through its
operation and that of smaller, bench-scale sources of ionizing radiation.
