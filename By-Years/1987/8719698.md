This two year project focusses on the development of assays to allow accurate
measurement of steroid hormone excretion in the feces of nonhuman primates.
Laboratory primates will be injected with radiolabeled estrogen and progesterone
and the major fecal radiolabeled metabolites will be isolated and identified.
Subsequently assays will be established for the measurement of major estrogen
and progesterone fecal metabolites. In the second part of this study, animals
will be injected with radiolabeled aldosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone, fecal
metabolites identified and assays developed. These latter will hopefully serve
as indexers which will permit fecal ovarian steroid profiles which accurately
reflect ovarian steroid output. Application of these techniques will allow
primatologists to address directly issues concerning the reproductive physiology
and behavior of primates under field conditions.
