The S-STEM program at Western Kentucky University (WKU) provides financial,
academic, and career assistance for twenty financially needy and academically
talented students (freshmen and transfers), with an interest in the broadly
defined area of biotechnology. Retention and success are supported through early
development of a structured cohort, targeted academic and career assistance, and
encouragement of engagement opportunities including research training in
biotechnology. Established partnerships with 20 regional high schools and
regional community colleges in underrepresented counties with significant
educational and/or economic needs support recruitment efforts to specifically
target underrepresented groups. Regional biotechnology industrial partners are
also providing internships to promote workforce
development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Potentially transformative strategies such as
a common advising day for incoming S-STEM students, courses to develop early
research and laboratory skills, faculty research and career mentors, and
workshops for first year students are unique features of this program. Program
objectives include an increase in retention and graduation of the S-STEM
students versus the university average, participation of the students in
biotechnology training and undergraduate research, and development of
introductory research courses. Formative and summative evaluation measures from
the program inform recruitment and retention efforts at WKU. Successful
practices are disseminated through regional and national presentations and
publications.
