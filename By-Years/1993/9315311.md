9315311 Bidigare This project provides core measurments of algal pigments
(chlorophylls, carotenoids, phycoerythrin and phaeopigments) for the Hawaii
Ocean Time-series (HOT) Program. Analytical methods employ QA/QC procedures to
insure highly accurate and precise, as well as "comparable" data. Pigment data
are being used to document depth-dependent, seasonal and interannual variations
in phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll a) an composition (accessory pigments) at
Station ALOHA. Accessory pigments provide class- specific differentiation,
allowing the recognition of bomass contributions by cyanobacteria
(phycoerythrin); prochlorophytes (divinyl chlorophyll a); prasinophytes
(prasinoxanthin); chlorophytes (lutein); prymnesiophytes (19'-
hexanoyloxyfucoxanthin); chrysophytes (19'- butanoyloxyfucoxanthin); cryptohytes
(alloxanthin); dinoflagellates (peridinin); and diatoms (fucoxanthin). Relative
biomass contributions (i.e., as a percentage of total chlorophyll a biomass) by
these algal groups are estimated from HPLC-determined pigment concentrations and
accessory pigment-to-chlorophyll ratios (cf. Hooks et al., 1988; Letelier et
al., in revision).
