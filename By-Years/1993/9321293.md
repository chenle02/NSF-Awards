9321293 COLEY A widely accepted explanation for the diversity of tropical forest
trees is that there is high mortality of seeds and seedlings near conspecific
parents. However, the mechanisms of this effect have received little study: do
plant enemies accumulate in the vicinity of conspecific adult trees? This
project examines where the herbivores attacking seeds and seedlings come from,
how distance from adult trees affects rates of herbivory and pathogen infection,
and whether herbivory facilitates pathogen infection. %%% This study will
provide important data on the role of herbivores and pathogens in maintaining
tropical forest tree diversity. The results will be of value to tropical
forestry, forest management, and tropical forest conservation. ***
