A one-week workshop in Computational Physics is helping 20 faculty members from
predominantly undergraduate departments throughout the United States become
conversant with two important, rapidly developing areas of computational
physics. These are the use of symbolic manipulation programs such as Maple and
Mathematica in the solution of physics problems, and the use of computer
simulation methods to better understand physical problems. Participants in the
workshop are expected to develop one or more applications of these methods for
use in advanced undergraduate courses during the semester or the term following
the workshop. In 1991, the participants will return to the university for a two-
day follow-up session. They will then share the applications that they have made
with the entire group. Project staff are available both by telephone and
computer network in the interim between the workshop and the follow-up session
to assist the participants in the development of their applications.
