The goal of this research is to grow oriented periodic multilayer thin films
and characterize relationships between their ferromagnetic properties,
interfacial structure and composition. Two model experimental systems,
manganese/gold and iron/platinum, are being examined. Direct correlations are
established between the structural and compositional evolution of the interphase
interfaces and magnetic properties as a function of selected incremental
annealing treatments. Experimental techniques include transmission electron
microscopy, X-ray diffraction, vibrating sample and torque magnetometer, and
ferromagnetic resonance. DC sputtering is used to create the multilayer films,
which are a new class of materials offering the potential of possessing unique
properties not attainable in other materials.
