9315708 Lomatch A new design component, the multi-layered tunnel junction,
consists of a vertically stacked array (a one dimensional superlattice) of
Josephson tunnel junctions will be studied both theoretically and experimentally
in consideration for application in superconducting electronic circuitry. The
proposed research includes the computer modeling of circuit designs employing
multilayered junction technology, and the use of this information or the
engineering fabrication and testing of multi-layered junction circuits. The
application to superconducting logic and memory circuitry, such as single flux
quantum and Josephson transmission line devices, will be focus. ***
