This is an award to support research on the rate at which non-aqueous phase
liquids that reach a groundwater aquifer undergo interactions with the
groundwater and constituents of the aquifer itself. The project addresses the
dissolution of liquids such as benzene, carbon tetrachloride and vinyl chloride
when they form pools on the surface or below the surface of the groundwater. The
investigator plans on using an aquifer simulation laboratory model to simulate
an aquifer and data will be used to determine the mass transfer coefficients and
to validate the mathematical model that incorporates longitudinal advection,
longitudinal and vertical dispersion, and adsorption. The fluids being studied
in this project are characteristic of groundwater contaminants that may be
subject to removal by an extraction process. However, the extraction is
influenced by the limited solubility of the target fluids in water. Results of
this project may be applied to better engineering design of systems for removal
of this class of contaminants from groundwater.
