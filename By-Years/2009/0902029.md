Stream networks are intimately connected to the landscapes through which they
flow and significantly transform nutrients and organic matter that are in
transport from landscapes to oceans. This work will quantify the relative
influences of throughflow, lateral inputs, and hyporheic (a layer of surface
sediments that contains water which exchanges continuously with water in the
open channel) regeneration on the seasonal fluxes of C, N, and P in an arctic
river network, and determine how these influences will shift under seasonal
conditions that are likely to be substantially different in the future. This
objective is a logical extension of earlier. This work will focus on seasonal
dynamics at different river reach scales (1st to 4th order streams) and will lay
the groundwork for a whole river network model to integrate the influences of
throughflow, lateral inputs, hyporheic regeneration, and in-stream metabolism on
C, N, and P fluxes through an entire river network.
