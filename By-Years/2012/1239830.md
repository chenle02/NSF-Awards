This engineering education research project funded through the EAGER mechanism
seeks to understand the challenges of preparing the next-generation engineering
workforce and increasing the number and quality of engineering graduates. The
proposal will determine if transformative breakthroughs can be achieved by
considering education as a complex, adaptive system. The work proposed may allow
the integration of advances in computational modeling, understandings about
complex, adaptive systems, and emerging understandings from education research.
Such a synthesis of perspectives and knowledge may shed light on understanding
the educational system, thus informing more focused public and private
investment and policy decisions.

The broader significance and importance of this project arises through
establishing collaborations and information exchanges between researchers in
multiple disciplines. By additionally bringing together researchers, policy
makers and industry and community stakeholders it may be possible to develop
tools and models that allow these groups collaboratively consider implications
of proposed policies or interventions in education. This project overlaps with
NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers through preparation of an
engineering workforce with new capabilities and expertise. Additionally NSF's
goal of innovating for society is enabled by creating results and research that
are useful for society by informing educational policy and practices.
