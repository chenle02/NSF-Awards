This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project explores expanding open
ocean mariculture by using mobile, drifting fish pens entrained in regional
oceanic gyres. Offshore fish farming offers tremendous growth opportunities, but
faces constraints: lengthy permit processes for leases or expansion and concerns
for impacts on water quality, benthos, wild fish health and view planes. Velella
drifter cages resolve these regulatory concerns, reduce potential for
environmental impacts, and improve fish health and productivity. Velella cages
are entrained within offshore gyres, using remotely-controlled sails or
deployable sea-anchors for vector forces. Research must develop predictive
models of the Kona gyre, test this by deployment of GPS-tracked drogues, and
then deploy a drifting cage from the existing farm and track its movement.
Satellite links for video-monitoring and feeding controls will also be tested.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research are development of
sustainable, scalable technology for open ocean mariculture. NOAA aspires to
increase aquaculture production fivefold by 2025. The need is pressing:
America?s seafood trade deficit is $9 billion. Domestic seafood demand is
increasing, yet capture fisheries face declining stocks, closures, and
increasing regulation. Open ocean aquaculture presents the best opportunity for
meeting NOAA's goal and global seafood needs in a sustainable, environmentally-
sound manner. Kona Blue already produces up to 100,000 lbs/month of sashimi-
grade Kona KampachiÂ® offshore in Hawaii, but expansion opportunities are limited
by leases and permits. Broader technologies developed for Velella could also be
licensed to existing farm operations, to increase automation, reduce labor, and
increase efficiencies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).
