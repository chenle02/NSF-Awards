Disorder and randomness can induce very deep complexity for systems. This
project studies the importance of this induced complexity on the time evolution
of such systems. It thus addresses topics at the interface between mathematics
and statistical physics of disordered media. The signature of complexity on the
dynamics of these complex systems is seen in the fact that the evolution is very
slow and trapped in regions far from equilibrium. It exhibits new
characteristics like aging, and break the well established rules of fluctuation-
dissipation. Nevertheless some universal features are shared by these complex
systems and this project builds the foundations for understanding these
universal phenomena.

This universal behavior is exhibited in very different models which include the
slow dynamics of Spin glasses, both for spherical and Ising spins, and the
diffusion and transport on disordered structures like percolation clusters and
random trees. One of the tools recently built (by the PI) is a new and powerful
link between the study of the random energy landscapes and random matrix theory.
This link will also be explored further since it enables the introduction of a
new classification of different classes of complex behavior in one class of
systems (the spherical spin glasses).
