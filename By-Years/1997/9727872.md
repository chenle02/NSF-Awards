Abstract ATM-9727872 Miller, Ronald Columbia University TITLE: Mineral Dust
Aerosols and Climate Variability The theme of this proposal is mineral dust
aerosols as a contributor to and signature of climate variability. Numerical
experiments will be designed, with the state of the art coupled Ocean-
Atmosphere-dust generating models, to identify the processes controlling the
variability of mineral dust within the atmosphere. Emphasis will be on the
relation of dust to such familiar modes of atmospheric variability such as the
Tropical Atlantic Oscillation (TAO), North Atlantic Oscillation NAO), and ENSO.
This basic research will take the climate models closer to reality and make them
better tools for projections into the future climate. r
