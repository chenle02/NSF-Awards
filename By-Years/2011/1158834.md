The Tech Topology Conference will be held December 9-11 at Georgia Institute of
Technology. This is a new annual conference on geometry and topology, with an
emphasis on highlighting and enhancing research being done in the Southeast US.
We will have seven speakers, in the areas of contact topology, geometric group
theory, and knot theory, and we will have participants from Georgia Tech,
Florida State, Sevilla, Emory, Georgia, Columbia, Penn State, Rice, Clemson, and
Tennessee. Over the past few years, there has been an incredible amount of
cross-fertilization between the fields of surface topology, contact topology,
knot theory, and group theory. At this conference, we will have specialists in
each of these areas, whose work lies at the interface of two more more of these
areas. As such, the conference will be a fertile ground for new ideas in
geometry and topology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goals of the conference are
(1) To provide a high-profile geometry-topology conference to the Southeast that
brings leaders of the field to the area as well as showcases the high quality
mathematics being done in the Southeast, and (2) To provide a convenient meeting
place for Southeastern researchers and students to gather, discuss, research,
and interact with leading mathematicians from across the country. This
conference will be a valuable learning environment for graduate students and
junior faculty in the Southeast, and will help raise the profile of the region.
We will provide ample time for the participants to meet, formally and
informally, for example during long breaks between talks and organized
discussion sessions. We plan to post notes from all the talks on the conference
web site. More information can be found on the conference web site:
