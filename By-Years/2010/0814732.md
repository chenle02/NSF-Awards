Because of the small size of sperm and the technical challenges of observing
events taking place inside the complex reproductive tract of females, there are
numerous, fundamental aspects of reproduction that remain poorly understood in
internally fertilizing species, including humans. This project is a detailed
investigation of genetic, physiological and behavioral aspects of events taking
place between insemination and fertilization in a model system: the fruit fly
Drosophila melanogaster and closely related species. For the first time, these
events will be directly observed in real time using unique transgenic fly
strains producing sperm with heads that express green (GFP) or red fluorescent
protein (RFP). Experiments will explore mechanisms of sperm migration, sperm
storage, egg fertilization, the mechanisms by which sperm from different males
compete to fertilize the eggs of twice-mated females, and mechanisms of
ejaculate-female incompatibility contributing to reproductive failure in hybrid
matings between closely related species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed
research has the potential to generate watershed advances in the fields of
reproductive physiology and genetics, sexual selection and speciation. Resulting
progress in our understanding of sperm behavior within females and the
identification of candidate genes contributing to sperm-female incompatibility
are further likely to lead to advances in our understanding and treatment of
human infertility. &lt;br/&gt;
