9612674 Bluestein While much progress has been over the last decade in
understanding the structural characteristics of tornadoes and their parent
thunderstorms, many questions still remain unanswered. Among these are What are
the critical factors that actually trigger convection and tornadoes? This is a
three-year project whose objective is to understand better the ways in which
severe convective storms form and behave. A combination of analyses of data from
the Verification of Origins of Rotation in Tornadoes Experiment (VORTEX)
conducted in the Southern Plains of the U. S. in 1994 and 1995, conventional
data sets, and advanced mesoscale numerical weather models will be used to
achieve the objectives of this research. Areas of focus include the effects of
small-scale variations in surface characteristics and clouds on storms initiated
near the dryline, tornadogenesis, and the relationship between the environment
and the mode of initial storm formation on the subsequent evolution of severe
convective storms. The results of this research will improve our ability to
forecast severe weather in the Plains region of the U. S. ***
