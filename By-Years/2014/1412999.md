The investigators will make measurements of nearby dwarf galaxies and compare
them with theoretical simulations to constrain the nature of Dark Matter in the
universe. Broader impacts of the work include training of graduate students and
a postdoctoral researcher, and engagement of under-represented groups toward
careers in science. Visualizations of dark matter simulations will be created
for public outreach. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program aims to measure chemical
and dynamical structure of stars within the Milky Way's dwarf spheroidal
satellites and compare the measurements to simulations, in order to infer the
spatial distribution of dark matter in the least luminous galaxies. The
observational results will be compared directly to a suite of cosmological
hydrodynamical simulations that resolve actual observables - stellar positions,
velocities, metallicities, and ages. The generation of mock observational
catalogs from simulations will allow dark matter and galaxy formation models to
be compared to data directly in terms of observables. The wider ranging goal of
this project is to test the standard cold dark matter cosmological model.
