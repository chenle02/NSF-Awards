This project will produce "Jewels of the Jungle," an hour-long film for public
audiences documenting the discovery of new species of endophytes and the
isolation of their medicinal compounds. The film presents an exciting story of
scientific discovery that takes the viewer around the world from Montana to
Madagascar, in search of new species of plants important for medical research.
Compounds isolated from endophytes have proven vital in the treatment of many
diseases including cancer, AIDS, malaria, and drug-resistant bacterial and
fungal infections. "Jewels of the Jungle" aims to enhance viewers' understanding
of bio-chemical research and cultivate a better appreciation of scientific
research in general.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
