Complex data sets arise in a plethora of application domains from measurements
of various physical processes, history of financial transactions, logs of user
activity in a network, and so on. The analysis of such data sets is therefore a
task of increasing importance for science and engineering. Even though in many
applications there is an abundance of such raw inputs, extracting meaningful
information can often be a major computational challenge. In most cases, this
difficulty is due to the lack of a useful representation of the
data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the recent years, geometric methods have become
an indispensable tool for overcoming this difficulty. The reason behind this
development is the fact that a data set endowed with pairwise similarities can
be naturally interpreted as a geometric space. Such data sets include DNA
sequences, statistical distributions, collections of news articles, and so on.
Under this interpretation, several important data analytic questions can be
understood as geometric computational problems. For example, the problem of
classification can be expressed as geometric partitioning. Similarly, the
problem of fitting a model to set of measurements can be thought of as
interpolation in some appropriate geometric space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In these
contexts, the main algorithmic challenges occur in high-dimensional, or more
generally, complex metric spaces. This project aims at resolving some of the
main problems inherent in the analysis of such geometric data sets, and thus
enabling improved solutions for a variety of computational tasks. The project
also seeks to use diverse mathematical tools in the setting of geometric data
analysis, forging new connections between mathematics and computer
science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will be part of the PI's
curriculum development, undergraduate and graduate teaching, and educational and
outreach activities. It will also provide the set of research problems that will
be used for mentoring undergraduate and graduate students.
