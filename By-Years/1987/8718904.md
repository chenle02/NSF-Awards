The office of Scientific Freedom and Responsibility of the American Association
for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) will organize and convene a "Science,
Engineering and Ethics State-of-the-Art Workshop." The workshop will build on a
two-session symposium on this topic to be held on February 15, 1988 at the AAAS
Annual Meeting. The symposium and workshop will bring together an
interdisciplinary group, to assess recent developments in research and education
about ethical and value aspects of scientific and engineering practice and its
use. The group will produce an agenda of research priorities and mechanisms for
implementing research in science, engineering, and ethics. It will also identify
priorities and strategies for improving national literacy abour freedom and
responsibility in science and engineering. The workshop will generate
recommendations on these matters for consideration by researchers, educators,
public and private organizations and interested individuals.
