CBET-0827497&lt;br/&gt;Mayer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is for partial
support of two sessions at the 2008 International Symposium on Society and
Resource Management (ISSRM), to be held at the University of Vermont, June
10-14, 2008. ISSRM is the largest international meeting of social scientists who
focus on environmental and natural resources issues. The goal of the sessions
will be to create a network of social scientists interested in integrative
biophysical-social watershed observatories. In particular, these sessions will
assist in the integration of social scientists in the planning of the WATERS
Network. The first session will include a panel discussion with social
scientists familiar with methodologies for collecting and analyzing social data
on human-environment interactions and speaker familiar with the WATERS Network
project. The second session will be a workshop on the design of integrated
social science and biophysical networks for watershed data collection. Following
the sessions, the session organizers will organize the writing of a white paper
on the most significant results of the sessions.
