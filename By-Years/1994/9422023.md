9422023 GRECZY In order to promote a long term education effort relating to
important global change issues, the Subcommittee on Global Change Research of
the Committee on Environment and Natural Resources (CENR/SGCR) is committed to
sponsoring the "Project Earthlink" education program. Project Earthlink
educational efforts focus on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
assessments; the effects of human actions on the environment; and the use of
information technologies for informed decision making. These educational efforts
promote general awareness about global change issues as well as enhanced
accessibility to related information and technologies, benefiting students at
all levels and the public at large. These focus areas are consistent with the
goals of the Committee on Environment and Natural Resources and the newly
released "Science in the National Interest" report from President Clinton.
Activities sponsored by Project Earthlink include a resource guide for use by
teachers and informal educators, a video conference for teachers (May 1994), a
Global Change Education Conference (August 1994), and an Informal Educators
Workshop (November 1994). Member agencies of the CENR/SGCR have reviewed the
merits of this program and have decided to support these educational activities
in Fiscal Years 1994 and 1995. This interagency agreement transfers $159,000
which originally were transferred to NSF from the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration as its share of the CENR/SGCR distributed-agency funding pool to
the U.S. Department of Agriculture for this purpose.
