This award supports collaborative research on comparative study of geologically
recent volcanoes on opposing sides of the Pacific. In collaboration with Chinese
colleagues, four U.S. scientists will conduct field exploration on the volcano
Changpaishan in the Jilin Province of China. The U.S. Principal Investigator,
Dr. James Whitford-Stark of Ross State College, Texas, and Dr. Feng Maoseng,
Wuhan College of Geology, have defined a research plan which will focus on
investigation of an extremely young volcano, of unusual composition
(peralkaline). Both U.S. and Chinese scientists will participate in the field
work; Chinese scientists will then visit the U.S. to develop a joint
presentation for the General Assembly of the International Association of
Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth's Interior to be held in Santa Fe on June
1989. This project is jointly supported by NSF and the Chinese State Education
Commission under the US/PRC Protocol on Cooperation in Basic Sciences.
