Auctions are becoming increasingly common, both in the award of government
&lt;br/&gt;contracts and in commercial transactions. Traditionally, game theory
has &lt;br/&gt;been used by economists to design auction mechanisms, but, for
various &lt;br/&gt;reasons, these undoubtedly powerful analytic methods are not
always &lt;br/&gt;successful or appropriate. In contrast, this project is
exploring &lt;br/&gt;computational approaches to auction
design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project focusses on two computational
approaches. One of these is a &lt;br/&gt;co-evolutionary approach, in which
mechanisms and participant trading &lt;br/&gt;strategies evolve together over
time. The other uses reinforcement &lt;br/&gt;learning to set trading strategies
and then searches for the best mechanism &lt;br/&gt;given these strategies. The
project aims to develop these specific &lt;br/&gt;techniques along with software
tools to support them, towards a point at &lt;br/&gt;which they can assist those
who design auctions in the same way that &lt;br/&gt;computer-aided design (CAD)
packages help mechanical engineers and &lt;br/&gt;architects.&lt;br/&gt;
