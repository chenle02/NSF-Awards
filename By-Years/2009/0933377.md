&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI plans to develop a novel hybrid wall-modeling
strategy for large-eddy simulation (LES) of compressible wall-bounded flows,
After formally developing the model, hybrid LES of attached compressible
boundary layers will be performed. The model will be evaluated against both
direct numerical simulation (DNS) and experiment. Unlike conventional hybrid
approaches, the PI does not blend near-wall RANS (Reynolds-averaged Navier-
Stokes) regions with LES regions away from the wall, Instead, he solves the LES
equations down to the wall. He defines a new error that is a weighted sum of the
Germano identity error (LES error) and an error that relates the time-average of
the LES subgrid stresses to the Reynolds stresses (RANS error). This composite
error is minimized to obtain the model coefficient. The weight in the composite
error is defined such that it skews the error toward the RANS component in
regions where the LES error is high (near walls). As a result, the model does
not explicitly depend on distance from the wall. LES is rapidly progressing
towards becoming the method of choice for a wide range of engineering flows.
This work addresses a key limitation of LES that is hindering its acceptance --
inaccurate predictions of attached wall-bounded flows. It recognizes important
limitations in the prevalent approach towards this problem, and plans to
construct a hybrid model applicable to subgrid models beyond those considered in
this work. This work will be performed by one PhD student and one undergraduate
student. The PI will participate in outreach programs involving high school
students from the twin cities area, and summer interns drawn from across the
country. This work will form part of the PI's teaching material, and
presentations and articles intended for a broad audience.
