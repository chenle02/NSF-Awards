PIs plus US and Russian collaborators will conduct field and laboratory
research on Upper Carboniferous to Lower Permian paleontology (ammonites,
fusulinids, conodonts), stratigraphy and sedimentolgy of strata in the southern
Urals, which are among candidates for stratotypes. This study will contribute
significantly to global correlation and to understanding events associated with
the construction and nature of the supercontinent of Pangaea.
