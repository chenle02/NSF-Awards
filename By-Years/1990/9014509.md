This grant provides partial support for an investigation of heavy ion reaction
mechanisms by Prof. Peter Gonthier, Hope College. The work will involve using
the 4. detector array at the Michigan State University National Superconducting
Cyclotron Laboratory, and equipment at SARA in Grenoble, France. The experiments
will attempt to understand the emission of light ejectiles from nuclear
reactions induced by 16O bombarding 58Ni at energies from 35 MeV/nucleon to 100
MeV/nucleon. Several undergraduate students will participate in these
experiments.
