Control Laboratory which improves the instructional capability in real-time
system analysis and control. The Laboratory consists of four workstations
containing a microcomputer, and four real-time sample data experimental setups.
The laboratory supplements three undergraduate courses in control theory as well
as provide a vehicle for senior digital control design projects for electrical
and computer engineering students. This award is being matched by an equal
amount from the principal investigator's institution.
