This research project examines the impact of participation in various types of
science-rich professional development activities and affiliations with a larger
science educator comunity on the science knowledge, pedagogical knowledge and
classsroom practices of novice science researchers. Specifically the program
follows a diverse population of novice middle and high school science teachers
and their students as they participate in programs offered through the
Exploratorium. The outcomes provide data regarding the importance of specific
components of professional development programs that are the most effective in
supporting the induction of science teachers. The project uses collaboration
between an informal science education insitution and a research university to
carry out the research.
