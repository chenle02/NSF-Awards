9700012 Harmon Highly Confined Concrete can be much stronger and more ductile
than unconfined concrete. For this reason, confinement is being used
extentensively for seismic retrofit of columns and for new construction. Current
design procedures were developed to meet immediate and pressing design needs.
They are based on results of full scale tests simulating existing bridge pier
conditions in California. In order to extend the design procedures to more
general design and loading conditions, design procedures should be formulated
which are based on fundamental mechanical principles. The results of this
research narrow range of design parameters. The objective of the research would
be to extend these principles to cyclic loading and to perform tests to
demonstrate their application to column and bridge pier design as well as
formulate design procedures.
