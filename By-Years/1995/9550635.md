The Eastern Michigan University (EMU) Summer Environment Camp will address the
critical Shortage of mathematicians, engineers, and scientists the United States
has experienced in recent years and that is expected to worsen during the next
two decades. This program will create opportunities for talented
underrepresented minority students in the seventh and eighth grade to obtain
mentoring and learning experiences that will encourage their enrollment in
mathematics and science courses at the secondary and college levels. The
disciplinary focus is on the environment- specifically, water, air and energy
resources. The camp consists of two phases: a four-and-a-half week residential
program and four Saturday Academies during the following school year. Fifty
seventh-grade students from six public school systems in southeast Michigan will
plan and conduct research projects; participate in explorations and field trips;
ald discuss academic and career goals with university and pre-college faculty,
graduate and undergraduate students and minority mentors from business and
industry. This project ia an interdisciplinary partnership of EMU's science and
mathematics faculty with student mentors, industry leaders, government agencies,
school systems and parents. ***
