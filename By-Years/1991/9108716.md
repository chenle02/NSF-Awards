This project studies diversity in size and character of welfare state
provisions in 19 industrial democracies in the post World War II period.
Investigators hope to identify social, economic, political, and demographic
factors accounting for the diversity. Further, they will link the determinants
and form of welfare state provisions to effects on the distribution of income
and on living conditions in a subset of the countries. The research combines
comparative historical analysis, quantitative cross- national analysis of
aggregate data, and analysis of individual level data on income and living
conditions. Its virtues include going beyond welfare expenditures and income
inequality as variables of interest to create data usable for testing general
scientific hypotheses about the functioning of welfare expen- ditures. Thus the
project will permit measuring, rather than just assuming, what effects welfare
planning and spending have. Results bear on sociological theories of state
development and stratification, and have implications for income redistribution
policies.
