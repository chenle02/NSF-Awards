Robust adaptive control is one of the most promising and most active research
areas in systems and control theory. During the last two years major causes of
nonrobust behavior have been discovered and means to counteract instability
mechanisms have been recommended. A sharp stability-instability boundary can now
be determined using a signal dependent criterion. To extend the validity of this
linearized result, the concept of a slow integral manifold is proposed. This
concept will be used as a nonlinear geometric-asymptotic tool in the research.
The goal of this research is to employ a priori information about the plant and
signals in order to reduce the complexity of the adaptive controller and thus
improve its robustness. This is to be achieved by removing matchability and
positive realness assumptions and allowing problem specific reduced
parameterizations. A pseudo- gradient approach will be developed to guarantee
local convergence. The practically guaranteed region of convergence will then be
maximized by nonlinear geometric -asymptotic methods, including an analysis of
in-manifold and off-manifold bounds. A preliminary pseudo-gradient scheme is
described as a possible starting point for more general designs.
