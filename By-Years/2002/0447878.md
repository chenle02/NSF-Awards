What university policies and practices are relevant to the recruitment,
retention, and advancement of female academic scientists and engineers, and how
do they affect career development? The project will: 1) develop a longitudinal
contextual database of faculty recruitment, retention, and advancement-related
personnel practices in Research Extensive Universities; 2) describe and
characterize faculty-related personnel practices in this academic sector; 3)
link the contextual database to individual-level data; and 4) develop
statistical models to test academic career trajectories within and between
academic institutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The public-use database will be of
interest to scholars working in the area of gender, scientific careers and
university organizational behavior by providing 1) data that can be linked to
individual-level data for statistical analysis that accounts for contextual
factors; and 2) data that can be used for descriptive analysis of the personnel
and career-development practices of Research Extensive Universities. The
research will enhance the ability of policy makers and administrative leaders to
understand how the organizational contexts of universities foster conditions of
equitable academic career development&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study will enable
the principal investigator to develop methodological techniques that integrate
the use of longitudinal and multilevel data. The research will result in the
development of a graduate-level statistics course that is not currently
available at Georgia Institute of Technology. The curriculum for the course is
likely to be of interest to professors at other institutions as well, and will
be disseminated through a professional association and on the Internet. The
research team will be comprised of graduate students, undergraduate students,
and public K-12 STEM professionals during all phases of the CAREER award.
