This award provides a Sun computer system as the principal instrument for
research in theoretical astrophysics at Penn State. The activities in this area
are strongly oriented towards numerical investigations, including medium scale
computations, numerical simulations and program development, as well as
supercomputer calculations with very large numerical output which is transferred
back to the workstation environment for further processing, graphic display and
evaluation, down to the final publication stage. The requirements are imposed by
the need to accommodate 6 to 10 users and by the nature and volume of the
numerical tasks. These will be met by a configuration with a Sun 4/330 server
with 24 Mbyte core and 2-327 Mbyte disks, accompanied by a Sparestation 1
diskless workstation with an ethernet interface which provides access to other
computers, to external networks and to the supercomputer environment. The system
will serve the needs of the theoretical astrophysics research program at Penn
State, and will also serve as the training ground in numerical and theoretical
research methods for graduate students in the department.
