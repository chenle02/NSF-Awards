The investigator and colleagues organize the seventh in a series of
international conferences on the electrical, transport, and optical properties
of inhomogeneous media. Previous ones were held in Ohio (1977), Paris (1987),
Guanajuato, Mexico (1993), St. Petersburg-Moscow (1996), Hong Kong (1999), and
Snowbird, Utah (2002). These conferences have provided a forum for
experimentalists and theorists to discuss the electromagnetic and elastic
properties of inhomogeneous media, now often called metamaterials. ETOPIM7
brings together a diverse group of scientists, enginneers and mathematicians to
report on leading research in these areas, to identify common themes and
solutions that thread through a variety of problems, and to point the way for
promising future research.

The electrical transport and optical properties of composites and inhomogeneous
media are of fundamental importance to a broad range of highly interdisciplinary
problems throughout science and engineering. Nanocomposites, metamaterials,
photonic crystals and band gap structures, design of novel composites (and as
discovered recently, some with the predicted ability to cloak or make objects
invisible), imaging in geophysical, medical and industrial applications, the
role of sea ice microstructural and optical properties in polar biology and
climate, and defense applications, are all examples of topics that this
conference covers. The grant supports US junior researchers and US researchers
from underrepresented groups to participate in ETOPIM7. This strengthens the
level of cross-disciplinary expertise in the US, allows these researchers to
present their findings to an international audience, facilitates interactions
between junior US researchers and senior researchers in different fields, and
gives women and minorities the opportunity to strengthen their contacts and
present their work.
