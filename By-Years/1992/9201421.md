Mycorrhizae are specialized soil fungi that form symbiotic relationships with
the roots of most woody plants. The fungi are important in the uptake of water
and nutrients. One group of mycorrhizal fungi are angiocarpic---that is, the
fruiting body does not open---and are commonly called truffle-like fungi. From
an ecological perspective, this is an especially important group of organisms
throughout the forests of the world, but they a relatively poorly known. This is
especially true for the forests of the southern hemisphere. A joint venture that
involves scientists from the forestry programs of C.S.I.R.O. in Australia and
American mycologists from Oregon State University will conduct extensive surveys
of the Australasian rainforests for truffle-like fungi. It is certain that the
collecting team will discover numerous new species, genera, and even families.
These forests are being rapidly logged, thereby potentially eliminating many of
the endemic mycorrhizae before their ecological and economic utility can be
explored. This research should make those materials available to the scientific
community at large.
