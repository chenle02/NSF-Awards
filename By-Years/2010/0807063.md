This project is providing twenty-five scholarships per semester to academically
talented and financially needy students pursuing Bachelor's degrees in
engineering, computer science engineering, or an Associate's degree in science.
Various support services and associated student activities are enhancing the
academic experience of the scholarship recipients. The project has identified a
specific opportunity to prepare students to meet the demands of the high
technology industries in its region. Thus it features strong interactions with
companies in the area that offer internship and mentoring opportunities for the
scholars. The intellectual merit of the project lies in its leveraging of prior
successful projects that offer existing student support structures that help to
promote academic quality in the targeted STEM disciplines. The project's broader
impacts are felt through activities such as field trips and participation in
professional societies, that supplement the students' regular classroom
interactions so as to maintain their interest in the STEM disciplines. The
project also is striving to award forty percent of its scholarships to groups
traditionally underrepresented in the STEM disciplines so as to promote a more
diverse workforce. In the long term the project is benefiting society by
increasing the number of highly skilled, well-educated members in the high-tech
workforce.
