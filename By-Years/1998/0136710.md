This award provides funding to the University of Central Florida, under the
direction of Dr. Sudipta Seal, for the support of an international research
collaboration entitled, "U.S.-Australia Cooperative Research Development of
Solgel Derived Monsized Oxide Nanoparticles." This three year collaboration
between student and faculty researchers at the Advanced Materials Processing
Analysis Center/Mechanical, Materials and Aerospace Engineering at UCF and
Materials Science and Engineering research groups at the University of New South
Wales, Sydney, Australia will help establish a joint international research
program in nanotechnolgy research which is proving to be one of the most
promising frontiers in scientific research and development.
