This research focuses on the examination of the properties of condensed phases
and clusters by computer simulation. It will concentrate on the electronic
degrees of freedom within these systems and the algorithms necessary to simulate
them. Particular emphasis will be placed on going beyond Density Functional
Theory which gives only approximate ground state properties and the
parallelization of the various algorithms used to study many fermions. The
ultimate goal of this program is the microscopic modeling of real chemical
processes at surfaces and in the bulk in a computationally efficient manner.
