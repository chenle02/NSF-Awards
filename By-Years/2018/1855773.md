Representation theory is a branch of algebra studying symmetries, especially
symmetries of linear mathematical structures, using groups of invertible
matrices. Representation theory of finite groups has numerous applications to
other areas, including number theory and mathematical physics. In this project
the linear structures are themselves finite matrix groups, or more generally
matrix groups whose entries satisfy divisibility properties with respect to a
fixed prime number. Geometric and combinatorial techniques will be brought to
bear to study representations of these groups, especially in the important case
when the representing matrices themselves have entries in a finite
field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A central aim of this project is to continue the new
approach to the representation theory of reductive groups over a finite field
and the theory of character sheaves on reductive groups in which the notion of
categorical center plays a key role. This will lead to a better understanding of
the classification of irreducible representations and of character sheaves, and
in particular will help to remove some non-canonical features from earlier work
in the area. The project is also concerned with the study of characters of
irreducible or tilting modules of a semisimple group in positive characteristic,
and with the study of the canonical basis of Hecke algebras with unequal
parameters using the theory of parabolic character
sheaves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
