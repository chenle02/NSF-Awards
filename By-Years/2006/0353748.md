Notre Dame's logic group strives to train graduate students and postdoctoral
associates who have experienced many aspects of professional life and are full
members of the community of mathematicians. In particular, students should
develop a strong individual research agenda, have experience in collaborative
work with a variety of faculty and students, be able to view their work from the
perspective of mathematics as a whole, and be able to communicate effectively
with a variety of audiences. Under this award, skills will be developed by
integrating junior members into research-style groups involving Notre Dame
faculty and visiting faculty. Travel to meetings and research discussions with
faculty around the world will be facilitated to accelerate their inclusion in
the community and deepen their perspective on their work. In many activities the
connections with other disciplines in mathematics and philosophy are explored,
to increase the breadth of the participants.
