9504091 Ortiz This Americas Program award will fund a planning visit by Dr. J.
V. Ortiz to go to Ecuador to develop a collaboration between the computational
chemistry group at the University of New Mexico and the mass spectrometry group
of Dr. N. J. Medina at the Escuela Politecnica Nacional in Quito. They will use
computational and experimental approaches to understanding ion chemistry which
will be used in an investigation of the behavior of various matrix materials
used in matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization experiments. The latter
technique is useful in the mass spectrometric characterization of large
biopolymers such as proteins. Each group will use completely different methods,
thus taking advantage of each other's expertise. Ab initio computational methods
are not currently used in Ecuadorian research. The instrument to be used by
Ecuador will provide the New Mexico researchers with a unique opportunity to
obtain experimental tests of theoretical predictions. ***
