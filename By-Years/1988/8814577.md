Elaheh Kheirandish, dissertation student; Dissertation, "The Arabic Tradition
of Euclid's Optics" On the first day, according to the traditional story of
creation, "God said, Let there be light: and there was light. And God saw the
light, that it was good, and God divided the light from the darkness." This
passage from Genesis demonstrates the importance which light has traditionally
held for our understanding of the world. Even in the modern world, optics, the
scientific study of light, has played a central role in the development of
science: from Kepler, Huygens and Newton in the 17th century who argued over the
nature of light, to Maxwell and Faraday in the 19th century who showed that
light is an electro-magnetic phenomenon, to the founders of quantum theory in
the early 20th century who argued that light is both a wave and a particle, to
current workers in unified field theories who try to account for the behavior of
light photons. Given the centrality of the study of light in the history of
science, it is important to have an understanding of the way it has been treated
by science throughout history. Such studies not only show how science developed
but also provides insights into a culture as it shows how these cultures which
examined light treated this central phenomenon. A major lacuna in the history of
the study of light, however, is in the transition from ancient Greek optics to
the medieval world view. Ms. Kheirandish's dissertation promises to fill this
void and to provide the kind of insights which we need to understand how the
scientists in the Arabic world thought of light. Specifically, Mr. Kheirandish
is looking at the Arabic treatment of the foremost text in the science of light,
Euclid's Optics. Euclid's work used a geometrical approach to the study of
vision and was first translated into Arabic in the 9th century. Ms. Kheirandish
will examine this early version and examine how this optical tradition developed
up to the 13th century. This study requires travel to archives in Europe and the
Orient in order to examine the remaining copies of these Arabic treatments of
optics. This grant provides Ms. Kheirandish with the travel support to these
archives.
