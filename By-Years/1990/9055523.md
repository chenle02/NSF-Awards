This two year project, sponsored by the University of Southern Illinois
Edwardsville (SIUE), will provide content and pedagogy instruction to less well-
qualified Junior High School teachers in minority schools in the East St. Louis
Illinois region. Each summer 20 teachers in science and 20 teachers in
mathematics will attend a six-week summer workshop and participate in an
academic year follow-up. A coordinated workshop for 12 principals will also be
included. The science teachers will study biology and physical science with an
emphasis on using microcomputers to increase learning. The mathematics teachers
will learn techniques of teaching problem solving and application of
microcomputers in geometry and algebra. Both groups of teachers will learn
techniques for instructional improvement particularly those which are effective
with minority students. The follow-up activities include classroom visits by
SIUE faculty and meeting with teachers in the summer once a month throughout the
academic year. The matching funds from SIUE and the target schools is 31% of the
NSF award
