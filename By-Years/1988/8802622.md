This grant in Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry provides support for the
research of Dr. Peter Stang, University of Utah. The work is focused on
preparing and understanding unusual bonding species in organic chemistry. The
synthetic use of such species also will be studied. Three independent areas will
be examined: a) unsaturated carbenes, b) organometallic chemistry and c)
strained ring systems. The uses of silicon as a chiral auxiliary along with
alkylidenecarbene-ylides will be studied. The detailed mechanism of metal-
mediated unsaturated cross couplings will be examined using Pt as the metal and
vinyl triflates as the substrates. The interaction of varied organometallic
nucleophiles with alkynylvinyl triflates will also be probed. The chemistry of
the new alkylidencycloproparenes with emphasis on oxidation, cycloadditions, and
metal complexes will be developed along with the preparation of new, novel
strained ring systems. Kinetics, stereochemistry, structure-reactivity, NMR, and
X-ray structure determinations will be the major techniques and tools employed.
Although these studies are primarily of a fundamental nature, they will provide
considerable insight into the detailed mechanism of synthetically useful
reactions. They will also provide a better understanding of organometallic
pathways where fundamental mechanistic insights are currently limited and
greatly needed.
