This Americas Program award will support Dr. Paul E. Berry of the University of
Wisconsin Madison in collaboration with Dr. George J. Shepherd and Dr. Maria de
Carmo Amaral, both of the Instituto de Biologia (UNICAMP). The aim of this
project is to initiate the revaluation of Martius' great work and explore the
feasibility of presenting Flora Brasiliensis in facsimile form on the World Wide
Web, including corrections for the now outdated taxonomy. The following steps
will be taken: (1) Develop a pilot Web page, (2) Evaluate the cost of digitizing
and indexing images only, (3) Contact and recruit active systematists worldwide
to update the taxonomy and nomenclature of the published treatments in the
Flora, (4) Use the concept of this project as a springboard to help produce new
regional and national floristic treatments in Brazil and neighboring areas. The
long-term goal is to develop a complete Neotropical checklist of vascular plants
and contribute more fully towards floristic treatments within tropical South
America.

This project will build strong and lasting international ties between key
institutions involved in plant diversity efforts as well as strengthen
international ties between systematic biologists and discourage isolationist
tendencies in individual countries where the greatest biodiversity is found.
