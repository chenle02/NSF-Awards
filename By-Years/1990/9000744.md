Eight undergraduate students will participate in a ten-week comprehensive
research experience. In accordance with his/her interests, each student will do
one of the following: 1) join in a project investigating strains in geomaterials
in underground water disposal tunnels; 2) investigate advanced acoustic wave
propagation methods to detect flaws in materials 3) use laser interferometry to
detect crack propagation in brittle materials; 4) join in an exciting
development of a new fast-scan scanning electron Microscope; 5) use a new
interactive graphical program to analyze a fracture mechanics problem; 6) assist
in an experimental effort to understand internal micro cracking of solids
through data obtained for a x-ray device; 7) assist in developing and testing
video recording equipment to automate construction operations; and 8) conduct a
study to correlate the intact and fissured properties of rocks using indicative
techniques. At least half of the students will be selected from applicants from
other institutions, especially those without active research programs. Women,
minority and handicapped applicants will particularly be recruited. The students
will become familiar with their projects through early contact with the research
director and will present a preliminary seminar on the research. Each student
can expect to learn to work quite independently over the course of the summer.
He/she will also present a final seminar on the research, assist in writing a
publication describing the work, and may travel to a meeting to present the
results.
