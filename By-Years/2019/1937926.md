This award will provide support for a two-day workshop to be held at Boise State
University. The workshop will convene teams funded through the EFMA Germination
program together with other academic stakeholders (including senior leadership
and individual researchers) to share the results obtained in their Germination-
funded research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specific goals of the workshop
include:&lt;br/&gt;1) Build community and support collaboration among
Germination awardees.&lt;br/&gt;2) Share the outcomes and positive strategies of
Germination-funded research projects.&lt;br/&gt;3) Explore ways that the
Question Formulation Technique, developed by the Right Question Institute, can
be applied to academic scholarship at a diversity of institutions.&lt;br/&gt;4)
Share the effective practices learned at Boise State University during
Germination-funded work.&lt;br/&gt;5) Consider ways to sustain, scale and
disseminate successful Germination approaches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
workshop will assist in building a community of practitioners committed to
designing new learning frameworks, platforms, and/or environments for training
academics to formulate research questions with substantive potential for
societal impact. Successful scaling and implementation of these Germination
approaches offers significant opportunity for broader impacts through catalyzing
research directions that address pressing societal challenges and
needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
