Neuronal plasticity is the term for mechanisms underlying functional changes in
the brain that result from experience, such as sensory adaptation and learning.
These mechanisms include changes at specific synapses, which are the functional
connections between nerve cells. At the subcellular level, these changes can
include changes in synaptic molecular receptors, synaptic architecture, and
changes in activity of enzymes such as kinases and phosphatases, presumably
driven by changes in gene expression. An unsolved mystery is how one synapse can
be specifically altered while others of the same neuron remain unchanged. The
roundworm C. elegans is a genetically tractable and anatomically simple animal
that has become well established for examining molecular mechanisms of neural
function. It uses its sense of smell to locate food, and to make that
discrimination it must adapt to and ignore other odors present that are not
associated with food. Recent data from C. elegans suggest that there is a
potential link between activity of a membrane channel and control over mRNA
translation, related to olfactory adaptation by down-regulating neuronal
response to odors after odor exposure. This project uses molecular and genetic
approaches to see how this linkage may underlie olfactory adaptation, and
provide a novel molecular mechanism for neuronal plasticity. Results will have
impact across all neuroscience, and in particular to learning and memory, if a
link is discovered between ligand-binding channel proteins and intracellular
protein translation that would allow a direct effect of extracellular events on
gene expression. This project also will help establish the career of a young
woman scientist, as well as promote graduate training.
