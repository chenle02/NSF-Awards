Abstract

Award: DMS-0803213 Principal Investigator: Steven A. Bleiler

This grant partially supports the speakers and participants at conferences of
the Cascade Topology Seminar (CTS). During the three-year grant period May 1,
2008 - April 30, 2011, meetings of the CTS are scheduled at semiannual
intervals. These conferences will be held at various universities in the
Northwestern United States and Southwestern Canada. Universities currently
active in the CTS are the Universities of British Columbia, Calgary, Nevada-
Reno, Oregon, Puget Sound, Victoria, and Washington, and Boise, California-
Chico, Oregon, and Portland State Universities.

The basic goals of the CTS include providing for frequent contacts between
workers in similar fields, to allow participants to keep abreast of recent
developments by bringing in speakers from outside the region, to enable graduate
students and topologists in the Pacific Northwest and Southwestern Canada to
hear, consult, and possibly collaborate with the outside speakers and members of
other institutions, and to provide an opportunity for local people to lecture on
their own work. Topics covered are not limited, however, the interests of the
various organizers tend to be mirrored by the interests of the participants.
Thus, the seminar programs usually concern algebraic, geometric, or low
dimensional topology, differential or algebraic geometry, or combinatorial group
theory. The CTS also coordinates its activities with the Pacific Northwest
Geometry Seminar and the Western States Geometric Topology Workshop with whom
joint meetings have occasionally been held. The URL for the Cascade Topology
Seminar is http://www.mth.pdx.edu/events/cts/.
