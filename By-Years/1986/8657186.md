This action funds a five year Presiential Young Investigator award. Dr. Koide's
research in plant physiology is directed to an understanding of the role of
phosphorus nutrition in the plant's response to drought. Plants infected with
symbionts differ in their water use and phosphorus uptake during water stress.
Molecular mechanisms determining the plant's productivity under these conditions
will be determined.
