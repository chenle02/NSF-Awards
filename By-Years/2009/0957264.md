Remodeling of the polysaccharide-rich cell wall surrounding all plant cells may
accompany increased susceptibility to Botrytis cinerea, a pathogenic fungus that
rots most fruit. Tomato fruit ripening is an example of plant cell wall
disassembly that coincides with increased pathogen susceptibility. While
ripening tomato fruit and Botrytis express similar plant cell wall degrading
enzymes, previous work demonstrated that the enzymes produced by ripening fruit
are crucial for the ripening-associated increase in susceptibility. Observations
that not all non-ripening tomato mutants are resistant to Botrytis, suggested
that some, but not all, ripening events are responsible for fruit susceptibility
to decomposition. The mechanism(s) that make ripe fruit susceptible include cell
wall disassembly which provides B. cinerea with accessible nutrients in
circumstances where anti-pathogen responses are limited. This project identifies
1) polysaccharide targets of fruit cell wall remodeling proteins, 2) B. cinerea
and fruit gene expression changes and 3) proteins produced by both interactors,
to link specific components of the wall architecture to pathogen perception and
the consequent susceptibility. The researchers' expertise in polysaccharide
characterization and simultaneous plant and pathogen transcriptome and proteome
analyses allows evaluation of wall architecture, infection, and ripening,
thereby expanding knowledge about the diversity of fungal decomposing strategies
and the plasticity of plant responses. This project uses an economically
significant pathogen and fruit; the results may be applied to other crop plants
and plant parts whose wall architecture is altered. The researchers have strong
ties to US and international agricultural sectors enhancing the education of
high school and undergraduate students, including individuals from agricultural
communities in Costa Rica and Mexico and from small underserved undergraduate
and technical institutions.
