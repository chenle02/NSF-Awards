Chemistry (12) At Delta State University we are creating and developing a
regional cooperative NMR facility by adapting and implementing a system
developed at Rider University. This facility serves our institution, Coahoma
Community College, Mississippi Delta Community College and the wider community
in the region. Our overarching goal is to incorporate modern 1-D and 2-D FT-NMR
spectroscopy throughout the undergraduate chemistry curricula at DSU, CCC and
MDCC. To achieve our goal, we are adapting a series of experiments primarily
from the Journal Of Chem. Education into different chemistry courses. These
experiments introduce students to varied applications of NMR and provide them
the opportunity to prepare their own samples as well as collect and process NMR
data. The subject matter is first introduced in the general chemistry curriculum
and students subsequently gain hands-on experience through spectroscopic
identification of molecules in the organic chemistry sequence. Experiments in
this sequence provide exposure to 2-D techniques and opportunities to collect
and interpret data from 1-H and 13-C spectra acquired of compounds prepared in
self-designed syntheses. In upper level courses and undergraduate research
students perform experiments that highlight more advanced applications of FT-
NMR. A longer-term goal of our project is to develop a database of student-
acquired NMR data from experiments performed in the labs and to compile an
accompanying laboratory manual. This should allow instructors located at
institutions without access to an NMR to download raw student data from the
database and process the data at their desktop. This virtual NMR allows smaller
institutions the ability to provide students with real data that they have to
process in a manner commonly found in large chemical research laboratories
without having to buy a spectrometer.
