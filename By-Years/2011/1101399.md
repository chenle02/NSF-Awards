The mathematical community shows expanding interest in the deformations Shepler
and Witherspoon study, for example, in graded Hecke algebras and symplectic
reflection algebras. These algebras pervade mathematics, appearing in algebra,
geometry, number theory, combinatorics, topology, statistics, harmonic analysis,
mathematical physics, and the theory of special functions (for example, they
appear in the Langlands program, the theory of quantum groups, knot theory, and
conformal field theory). Shepler and Witherspoon work towards a theory of skew
group algebras and Hochschild cohomology that connects work by various prominent
mathematicians working in different mathematical fields.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Their research leads to international talks and
collaborations and results in publications in selective international journals.
Shepler and Witherspoon dynamically engage the wider community by collaborating
with international experts,organizing conferences and workshops, delivering
invited talks in various countries, and working with outreach programs. They
actively prepare junior colleagues and students (at all stages) for engaging
careers which use mathematics. Their work supports research of several graduate
students and summer research experiences for undergraduates.
