This award supports offshore coring into the coral reefs of Barbados to
retrieve a detailed sea level record for the past 20,000 years. U-series dating
of the reef crest coral indicates that sea level was approximately 120 meters
below present sea level during the last glacial maximum. Sea level rise was not
monotonic; rather, it was marked by a series of jumps with rates of sea level
rise exceeding 2cm per year at least three times during the deglaciation. The
glacial meltwater associated with this sea level rise is clearly recorded in the
oxygen isotopic records of planktonic foraminifera. Immediately preceding this
sea level jump was the initiation of North Atlantic Deep Water production and
associated meridional heat transport. Measurement of C-14 and U-Series ages on
the same coral samples, will also provide a unique opportunity to calibrate the
C- 14 time scale beyond the 10,000 year dendrochronology. The radiocarbon
calibration beyond 10,000 years is critical for climate research that compares
radiocarbon-dated proxies with absolute chronologies based on annual layer
counting, such as ice core records or astronomical calculation. These results
have immediate implications for climate and geophysical models that incorporate
phase lags or rates of climate change based on calibrated radiocarbon records.
