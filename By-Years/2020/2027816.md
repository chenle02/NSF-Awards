The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be the development of a new rapid COVID-19
virus diagnostic system that recognizes specific virus surface characteristics
and generates accurate results within minutes. The current viral diagnostics
standard involves complex instruments and technical expertise to run, taking
hours to produce and interpret a result. The proposed technology is a sensor
that selectively interacts with the COVID-19 virus to produce visible results
without expensive instruments or time-consuming procedures. The fundamental
technology can also be adapted to rapidly and cheaply develop new diagnostic
tests. The lower cost of the test and faster sample-to-result time will greatly
improve disease measurement and control, supporting public health needs.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project proposes to develop a highly functional,
sensitive and specific diagnostic for the diagnosis of coronavirus based on a
Pattern-Recognition Enhanced Sensing and Therapeutics (PEST) concept. The
proposed diagnostic solution uses algorithmically designed structural DNA to
form a trap that will detect the “signature pattern” of the pathogen and
selectively bind to it to generate a signal, without the need of DNA/RNA
preprocessing or amplification associated with the current state of practice.
The proposed work is to build a pre-clinical prototype of PEST-enabled lateral
flow-based COVID-19 rapid diagnostics; the technical performance goal is a
sample-to-result time of 5 minutes. The proposed work will also perform pre-
clinical validation to validate its specificity and detection limit, as well as
implement mechanisms to improve the assay specificity to avoid cross-reaction to
other virus types in the Coronavirus family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
