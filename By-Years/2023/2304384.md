The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
Phase I project is to validate a new, biochar-enriched building material as a
ceiling tile product. The plane of ceiling tiles represents a vast, untapped
opportunity in combating climate change through carbon sequestration. With the
innovation, a proprietary mineral matrix is enriched with 50-80% biochar.
Biochar is the resulting charcoal-like residue from pyrolysis. This stabilized
form of carbon is nearly crystalline and resistant to emissions-causing
oxidation. Combined with a proprietary mineral binder, the resulting novel
material is non-flammable, ultra lightweight, and biodegradable. As a ceiling
tile, it can reduce a buildingâ€™s embodied carbon in an easily quantifiable way,
position the building for carbon sink remuneration, boost the green ratings of
the building, help qualify a building for sustainability-linked financing - all
without compromising on fire safety standards. This project capacitates an
innovation that adds to the nation's toolkit in creating a climate-responsible
built environment.

The project innovation is a novel, biogenic, cementitious chemistry composed of
plant-based biochar, clay, binding minerals, proprietary catalysts, optional
reinforcement fibers and optional pigments. The inclusion of biochar is a major
characteristic of the innovation, comprising up to 80% of the material. Unlike
carbon stored in plant matter, the ocean or in soil, the carbon atoms of biochar
are more resistant to losing electrons and being converted into carbon dioxide,
therefore making the innovation a novel solution towards converting the built
environment into a "carbon bank". There are three major questions to resolve:
how could varying biochar particle sizes impact tile integrity, can the
innovation perform satisfactorily in standard tile dimensions amidst different
ambient humidity levels, and can the tiles achieve the Class A fire standard of
competing tiles. The iterative experimental protocols will utilize the classic
American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) tests used to demonstrate
building code compliance in all three of these research areas.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
