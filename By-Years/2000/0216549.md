NSF Award Abstract - DMS-0216549&lt;br/&gt;Mathematical Sciences: VIGRE Program
Meeting 2002&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;0216549
Straley&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mathematical Association
of America (MAA), the American Mathematical Society (AMS), the American
Statistical Association (ASA), and the Society for Industrial and Applied
Mathematics (SIAM), will host a meeting to provide information about the program
in Vertical Integration of Research and Education (VIGRE) of the NSF Division of
Mathematical Sciences. Attendees will be representative faculty members from
U.S. institutions with Ph.D.-granting departments of mathematical sciences. This
award supports attendance of these representatives at the
meeting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since the VIGRE program (now in its third year)
has awarded approximately thirty grants, valuable experience with the various
core elements of the VIGRE solicitation should now be shared with the
mathematical sciences communities. This conference of interested parties will
emphasize the experiences and exemplary practices of VIGRE projects nationwide.
The format of the meeting allows for discussions of the impact that the VIGRE
program has had on the mathematical sciences both locally and
globally.&lt;br/&gt;The meeting, held in the Washington, DC area on 3-4 May
2002, includes speakers from institutions that employ mathematical scientists,
including a variety of academic institutions, business, industry, and government
agencies. It is anticipated that between 125 and 150 interested mathematical
scientists will attend this meeting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
