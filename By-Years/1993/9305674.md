A workshop will bring a small group of about ten continental geologists and
geodynamists together to discuss fundamentally new avenues of interdisciplinary
research. It is now possible, with a new generation of global computer models of
mantle convection coupled to plate tectonics, to synthesis paleogeography, sea-
level change, platform stratigraphy, and basin subsidence with global dynamics.
A range of dynamical questions (centered around how plates are coupled to the
mantle and how convection changes in time) and traditional geological questions
(centered around the causes of sea-level change and Phanerozoic stratigraphic
architecture) may now be solvable. The participants will consider which
interdisciplinary questions can now be addressed, the kinds of data to be
synthesized into data bases, and how the a forthcoming generation of
supercomputer models could be interfaced with the diverse data.
