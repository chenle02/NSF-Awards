In this research program Lahti will investigate model organic molecules bearing
unpaired electrons in order to understand how to design new materials with
advanced magnetic properties. Structural and molecular interaction features
which favor the production of high-spin interactions between electrons in bulk
systems will be identified, leading to ferromagnetic domains which could be used
in new magnetic media. In addition, polymeric polyradical systems having large
numbers of unpaired spins will be designed and synthesized, and their magnetic
properties will be investigated. These fundamental structural and mechanistic
investigations are directed towards developing rules to describe magnetic
interactions both within and between molecules which may permit the design of a
new generation of bulk organic ferromagnets. Although practically useful
materials have not yet been realized, recent progress holds much promise for
synthesizing them in the future.
