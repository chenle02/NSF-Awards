This two-year award for cooperation on digital libraries involves Daniel E.
Atkins and William Birmingham at the University of Michigan, and the European
Research Consortium for Informatics and Applied Mathematics (ERCIM), which
consists of the national computer and information science laboratories of 14
European countries. The award supports the establishment of four international
working groups to foster an international community of Digital Library
researchers and to identify joint research agendas. The working groups will
focus on technical issues related to interoperability, metadata, optimized
retrieval, and intellectual property and economics. Meetings will be organized
to examine and define critical research questions through which joint research
proposals will emerge. The University of Michigan serves as the U.S. organizer.
Each working group will consist of five U.S. researchers from NSF-supported
Digital Library Projects and other research organizations and five European
researchers. The project takes advantage of significant European expertise in
informatics and applied mathematics and will eventually provide access to a
large compendium of scientific information that is produced in Europe. Through
this cooperation, common standards and strategies to develop compatible systems
and global digital libraries are likely to emerge.
