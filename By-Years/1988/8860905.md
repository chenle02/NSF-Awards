A need exists for a source of biologically active human proteins, particularly
those with complex tertiary or quaternary structure which require modification
for full biological activity. Current production of recombinant molecules by
bacteria has limited ability to satisfy this need. Cultured mammalian cells
provide greater promise as production systems. Cell lines, such as Chinese
hamster ovary (CHO), have been shown capable of expressing and properly
processing a variety of human recombinant proteins, and are adaptable to large-
scale cultivation in serum free media. This work addresses the need for an
improved expression system to facilitate the production of proteins that are
composed of two different subunits. The system proposed will utilize a plasmid
vector containing transcription promoters from SV40 and the mouse mammary tumor
virus, which is integrated into the genome of Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO).
In this construction, both promoters will be capable of directing high levels of
production, and the ratio of synthesis of the two proteins produced can be
adjusted to achieve the proper ratio of precursor proteins for efficient folding
and final assembly. The plasmid will be constructed and tested for expression
using bacterial reporter genes. Growth and expression in serum free media will
be optimized in the production of human Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 (1GF-1), a
small biologically important peptide currently produced by this laboratory using
a recombinant bacterial system. The medical use of peptides and proteins is an
immature pharmaceutical market. However, clinical usage is expected to grow
substantially during the next five years. Data indicates the current annual
market for medically important peptides/proteins exceeds $175.6 million.
However, peptides world markets associated with the mammalian cell technology
addressed in this proposal could reach $3.04 billion by 1991.
