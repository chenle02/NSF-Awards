This project provides a more comprehensive laboratory experience in the thermal
power and refrigeration areas for mechanical engineering students. The major
equipment acquired includes a diesel engine, a dynamometer, an exhaust-gas
analyzer, a computer data-acquisition system, an electric steam superheater, and
an absorption refrigeration unit. This equipment together with existing
equipment is used to conduct performance tests for a steam turbine, an
absorption refrigeration unit and a diesel engine. This award is being matched
by an equal amount from the principal investigator's institution.
