This workshop will bring together researchers from around the world to identify
and explore topics at the frontier of nonequilibrium quantum systems. This topic
is linked to profound open problems in condensed matter and statistical physics.
Recent technical advances in both experimental and theoretical techniques have
led to a spate of exciting developments in this area. The topics covered will
include nonequilibrium transitions; dynamics during and after a "quench";
thermalization and the approach to steady state; and dynamics in the presence of
a driving potential. This workshop, whose results will appear in a formal
report, will capture the excitement and promise of this rapidly growing field of
research.
