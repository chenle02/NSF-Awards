This project is providing 14-20 four-year scholarships to academically-talented,
financially-needy students who enroll in the physics programs at Eastern
Michigan University (EMU). The project is designed to attract high-quality
students into the physics majors and to relieve them of the financial burden of
tuition so that they can focus on academic success during their college career.
The project includes interventions at self-identified critical points on physics
degree paths: the first year at EMU, the first course in the major, and the
progression to upper-level courses. The project improves and augments existing
strategies in the EMU Admissions and Financial Aid Offices to recruit physics
majors, including women and racial/ethnic minorities. The project also increases
the educational opportunities for incoming freshmen and future physics majors.
