This project aims to develop an advanced five-axis high speed milling machine
and test stands. This equipment will be used for research and testing of the
five-axis high speed milling technology currently under investigation. This
technology is of interest to forging die, stamping die, and injection mold
making and other industries, particularly those in the aircraft manufacturing
businesses. It is also useful to many fields for rapid prototyping of parts. An
emphasis of the equipment development will be the longevity of the drive and
guideway components subjected to frequent accelerations and decelerations which
are much higher than in the current practice. The development will employ the
latest numerical control and servo control techniques. The development of the
five-axis high speed machine tool utilizes and integrates leading-edge
technologies on feed drives, guideways, and spindles. The equipment is valuable
for research on high-speed machining of various materials and geometries and on
development of open-architecture controllers. The project is done in
collaboration with several industrial companies.
