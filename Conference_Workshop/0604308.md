A two week workshop followed by a one week conference on Valuation Theory and
Integral Closures in Commutative Algebra will be held from July 2 - July 22,
2006 in Ottawa, Canada. This program has been funded by the Fields Institute.
NSF has provided funding to support young researchers and graduate students from
theUnited States. The organizers are Dale Cutkosky, Sara Faridi, Franz-Viktor
Kuhlmann and Irena Swanson.

This program will provide training and a support network for young American
mathematicians. The conference in the third week will allow experts in the
fields of valuation theory, commutative algebra, combinatorics and algebraic
geometry to collaborate.These fields have applications to pure mathematics as
well as applied mathematics. Algorithms developed in these areas have been used
in computer software.
