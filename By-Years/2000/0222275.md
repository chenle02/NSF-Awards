Title: SGER: Exploratory Research on Transnational Digital Government

This grant will support a preliminary study of the uses of information
technologies to support multilateral collaborations between two South American
countries in the topic area of drug abuse and trafficking. Important topics to
be surmounted include the many differences in infrastructure and processes
related to data gathering, and the differing legal and security regimes in
place. There will be an element of multi-lingualism to be explored also. The
collaboration will begin with the support and approval of the Inter-American
Drug Abuse Control Commission of the Organization of American States (OAS). The
Commission has developed a process and procedures for multilateral government
evaluation of various drug abuse parameters, which will serve as the context in
which to evaluate collaboration technologies research. Researchers from several
US universities and the OAS will participate.
