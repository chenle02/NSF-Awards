ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;#1238398&lt;br/&gt;Fisher, John
P.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have tremendous
therapeutic potential as they are capable of differentiating into various
mesenchymal lineages such as bone, adipose, and cartilage. However, MSCs
represent only a fraction of the cells that are found in the bone marrow and
lack unique identifying markers, proving them difficult to isolate precisely.
There are several limitations to traditional plastic&lt;br/&gt;adherence,
including potentially harmful interactions between MSCs and the other cell types
within the bone marrow, possible loss of late-adhering MSCs, and the undesired
expansion of non-MSC adherent cells found in the bone marrow. The goal of this
proposal is two-fold. First to overcome the limitations of traditional plastic
adherence by designing a unique material with tuned mechanical and surface
properties to strongly and selectively adhere MSCs in a heterogeneous
population. Second, to culture and differentiate the enriched captured MSC
population on the same material.
