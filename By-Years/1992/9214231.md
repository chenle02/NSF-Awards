This conference grant supports the travel costs of the PI and eight African
environmental physiologists speaking at a research seminar on "The Climatic
Environment: Influence on Physiological Functions". This seminar will be held in
Nairobi, Kenya, September 21-28, 1992, during the First International Congress
of the African Association of Physiological Sciences, a new, continent-wide
organization. The congress is sponsored by the International Union of
Physiological Sciences. The seminar will address issues currently particularly
relevant to African countries, many of which are experiencing unusual weather
changes. Besides the scientists funded under this grant, an additional eight
scientists from developed countries will participate. The main objectives of the
overall congress are to stimulate scientific interchange and cooperative
research among African physiologists, and to promote collaborative research
between scientists based in developed countries with colleagues in Africa. The
seminar promises to be mutually beneficial for U.S. and African scientists by
providing a forum for exchange of data on thermal physiology in various species,
and advancing understanding of physiological adaptation to drought. The
establishment of active Africa- wide professional societies will promote
research cooperation and networking throughout the region. This project is
relevant to the objectives of the Science in Developing Countries (SDC) Program
with regard to strengthening the scientific infrastructure in developing
countries, and increasing the level of cooperation between U.S. scientists and
their counterparts in developing countries.
