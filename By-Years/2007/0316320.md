Arid and semiarid land degradation is characterized by the reduction or
redistribution of vegetative production, accompanied by a similar reduction or
redistribution of soil resources. Wind erosion is one mechanism that accounts
for changes in soil fertility that accompany land degradation. Understanding the
effects of aeolian processes on soils and vegetation in arid and semiarid lands
is vital to our understanding of current controls on system dynamics as well as
to predict future dynamics in the face of changing environmental conditions. The
Investigators will conduct large-scale, integrated field experiments at the
Jornada Basin LTER site that address the relationship between wind erosion,
vegetative cover, soil nutrients, and plant function. The research will improve
the understanding of the role of aeolian processes in plant-soil interactions in
deserts, the role of abiotic transport in the evolution of soil patchiness, and
the sources and sinks of dustborne nutrients.
