9512790 Steinfeld This U.S.-Argentina Cooperative Workshop grant will support
travel expenses of 12 U.S. scientists to take part in a workshop organized by
Jeffrey Steinfeld in conjunction with the Chemistry Department of M.I.T. and
Roberto Fernandez-Prini with the Instituto de Quimica Fisica de los Materiales,
Medio Ambiente, y Energia (INQUIMAE) at the University of Buenos Aires,
Argentina. The workshop will be organized around the topics of preserving the
atmosphere; environmentally benign chemical processing; water resources and
aquatic chemistry; new energy technologies; and initiatives in environmental
education. Anticipated results include new cooperative research programs in a
variety of environmentally important areas of chemistry and the establishment of
electronic network links among the participating institutions. Part of the
funding for this grant comes from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry
Program of the Division of Chemistry. ***
