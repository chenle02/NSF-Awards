The availability and size of data sets has increased significantly over the
course of the past decade. To enable the analysis of large data sets on High
Performance Computing (HPC) resources while minimizing time- and energy-to-
solution requires incorporating static and runtime information to determine the
best possible data layout of the large data arrays used by an application to
minimize data movement. The goal of this proposal is to deliver Phylanx, a
general purpose framework supporting a variety of data science, machine
learning, and statistically oriented applications. Phylanx is designed such that
a user?s code will be able to perform efficiently on current and future
architecture as long as the runtime system is maintained. This greatly reduces
the maintenance burden and will increase the productivity of domain scientists.
Phylanx lays a solid foundation for technology transfer from academia to
industry and fills the gap between academic innovation and commercial
application, by creating a software layer that industrial partners can feel
confident relying upon. &lt;br/&gt;Phylanx is a scalable, array-based and
distributed framework targeting HPC systems using the HPX, dynamic asynchronous
task-based parallel runtime system. The dataflow-style capabilities exposed by
HPX guarantee the preservation of all data-dependencies even for complex
distributed workflows. This project overcomes some of the limitations of
existing Big Data solutions such as Hadoop, Spark, and Flink by providing users
the ability to: implement NumPy-styled expression-graphs using Python or C/C++,
optimize these graphs for optimal data layout, distribution, tiling, and minimal
communication overheads, and evaluate those graphs with high efficiency on a
runtime interpreter targeting distributed HPC systems. Additionally, Phylanx
uses greedy sub-modular techniques on the expression tree to provide a
mathematically provable guarantee of optimal performance in machine learning
domains and in data placement problems. The platform will provide
implementations of 6 benchmarks which have been selected for their domain
specificity in text, image, and graph applications.
