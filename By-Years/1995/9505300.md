In global parallel scheduling all processors cooperate to schedule work. This
should be contrasted with dynamic scheduling since it generates a well-balanced
load without incurring a large overhead. This project will explore a new method,
calling Runtime Incremental Parallel Scheduling (RIPS). In RIPS, the system
scheduling activity alternates with the underlying computation work. Tasks are
incrementally scheduled in parallel by the cooperating processors. This project
aims at a framework for study of global parallel scheduling and its related
techniques. The project includes the development of parallel scheduling
algorithms, the control of low parallelism, the design and implementation of a
preemptive scheduling system, and solutions to irregular applications. The
objective is to show that runtime global parallel scheduling, as a new
scheduling approach, can adapt to irregular and dynamic problems and produce
high-quality scheduling.
