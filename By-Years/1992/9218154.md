This award supports the participation of ten U.S. scientists in a U.S.-Japan
Seminar on Classical and Molecular Cytogenetic Analysis of Cereal Genomes, which
will be held in March 8-10, 1994 in Manhattan, Kansas. The co-organizers are
Professor Bikram S. Gill, Kansas State University, and Professor Koichiro
Tsunewaki, Kyoto University. The major objective of the seminar is to bring
together researchers, particularly younger researchers at the Assistant or
Associate Professor level, to discuss cereal genome structure and comparative
genome mapping. The participants, who are from classical and molecular areas,
will discuss problems of common interest such as chromosome structure and
function, nucleo-cytoplasmic interactions, and cytoplasmic male sterility. This
meeting will stimulate interaction among cereal geneticists, cereal and non-
cereal geneticists, and plant and mammalian cytogeneticists. To arrive at common
mechanisms underlying the genome structure, evolution, and speciation in
polyploid plants, some scientists in polyploid plants are also invited. The
proceedings of the seminar will be published as a paperback and widely
distributed.
