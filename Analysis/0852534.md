This award provides three years of support for the Southern California Analysis
and Partial Differential Equation (SCAPDE) Conference Series. The objective of
the project is to revive a conference series that had a highly successful run
from the late 1980s until the early years of the present decade, enjoying NSF
support for most its existence. A new generation of energetic young
mathematicians will resurrect the series, thereby restoring to the region's
vibrant mathematical culture a much missed element. The SCAPDE conference will
be held twice a year, with the venue rotating through three locations in
Southern California: UCLA, UC-San Diego, and UC-Irvine.

Among the many long-standing, recurring mathematical conferences in the US, the
original SCAPDE stood out as a model of successful efforts to ensure diversity
and broaden participation. SCAPDE was widely known for the inclusion in
conference activities of women and members of underrepresented groups, of
graduate students and postdocs. The new team of organizers intends to duplicate
that record and even build upon it.
