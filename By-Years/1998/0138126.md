This four year continuation of a program to monitor ELF/VLF radio noise
(frequencies in the range 5 Hz to 32 kHz) at Arrival Heights, Antarctica, will
extend the observational record to more than twenty years, and will allow more
precise estimates of noise statistics. The radiometer was first installed at its
present location during the austral summer of 1984-5 and has been operated
continuously since that time, thus providing a record of ELF/VLF noise in the
Antarctic that is unprecedented in its continuity and duration. In parallel with
this system, an identical one has been operating on the Stanford University
campus for almost the same period of time, thus providing a (northern) mid-
latitude comparison data set.&lt;br/&gt; Since the predominant sources of
ELF/VLF radio noise are thunderstorms occurring in the tropical regions, the
Arrival Heights and Stanford systems provide complementary views of the
thunderstorm activity occurring in the tropics. The long-term statistics can
then provide independent information about global change. The low background in
the Arrival Heights record further allows the determination of Schumann
resonances. These are quasi-standing electro-magnetic waves that exist in the
Earth's 'electromagnetic' cavity (the space between the surface of the Earth and
the Ionosphere). Temporal changes in these resonant frequencies can be related
to variations in the characteristics of the ionosphere.&lt;br/&gt;
