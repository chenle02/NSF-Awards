*** 9761131 Rostler Science Research Laboratory Inc. will develop a
revolutionary new concept for volumetric storage of Tbytes of information. This
approach relies upon femtosecond lasers, which store data in optical fibers.
Readout of the data is also very fast, with anticipated speeds in excess of
100Gbit/s. A bundle of fibers provides volumetric storage, and the ends of the
fibers form a two-dimensional array which can be addressed in the same manner as
CD-ROM or optical discs. The enormous increase in information storage capacity,
and data access rates promised by this technology, will meet the needs of
electronic data processing well into the 21st century. ***
