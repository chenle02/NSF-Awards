The Baringo Basin in the Rift Valley of East Africa has been one of the most
productive areas in the world for finding hominoid fossils from the important
period of 4-14 million years ago (mya). Reconstructing paleoenvironments for
this period is highly relevant to determining whether development of open
landscapes should be considered a pivotal driving mechanism during this period
in human history. Paleohabitat reconstruction can provide proximate causes for
divergence and subsequent radiation of the Hominidae. In particular, Late
Miocene and Pliocene sediments exposed along the eastern flanks of the Tugen
Hills, west of Lake Baringo, have yielded extensive fossil vertebrate
assemblages including 6 of the 11 unequivocal hominoid specimens known from
Africa in this time range. These exposures provide a unique opportunity to
establish a detailed environmental-ecological context in which change in human
fossils over time may be assessed. Preliminary isotopic data and previous
analyses of fossil fauna suggest major alteration of the Tugen Hills habitat
between 6 mya and 9 mya. This research will provide high resolution
stratigraphic, geochemical, and paleontologic data collected from horizons in
the 2-12 mya interval which will be used to reconstruct aspects of paleohabitat
and paleocommunity and to determine more precisely the timing and nature of
environmental change in the Baringo Basin.
