9353933 Hovanesian This course will present the newest technologies of applied
optics needed by college teachers of subjects which utilize optics. Digital and
analog data processing, gaging, video techniques, hologram interferometry, fiber
optics, metrology, canning methods, moire methods, photoelasticity, shearography
and others will be presented by experts. The latest generation of equipment will
be available for planned hands-on experimentation. As a follow-on effort, the
investigators will assist the participants to implement these laboratory
experiments at their home institutions. ***
