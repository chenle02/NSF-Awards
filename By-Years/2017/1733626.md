This award from the Division of Chemistry supports "CHE Workshop: Framing the
Role of Big Data and Modern Data Science in Chemistry", held April 18-19, 2017
in Arlington, Virginia. Profs. Johannes Hachmann, John McLean, and Theresa
Windus of SUNY Buffalo, Vanderbilt and Iowa State University respectively, have
assembled a team to address the potential of big data research and modern data
science in the field of chemistry. The workshop brings together a diverse group
of approximately 45 leaders in the chemical sciences who have expertise in the
development of this field.

The goals of the workshop are to spearhead a broad discussion about data-driven
research, and the tools to enable it. The long-term objectives of the workshop
are to shape this emerging field, and to help pioneer a fundamental
transformation of the discovery process in chemistry. These goals are well
aligned with ideas and needs expressed in the Dear Colleague Letter on Data-
Driven Discovery Science in Chemistry (D3SC), NSF 17-036, which is reflective of
the "Harnessing the Data Revolution" need, recognized as one of the "10 Big
Ideas for Future NSF Investment". The application of big data and modern data
science creates new tools that promise to transform the discovery and design
process in chemistry and thus boost our capacity for innovation. In addition to
the far-reaching technological implications, this development also promises a
significant increase in the return on public and private investments, both in
terms of resources and time.
