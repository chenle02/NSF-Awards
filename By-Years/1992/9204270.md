Margulis will continue his work on different application of the theory of
subgroup actions on homogeneous spaces to number theory and Diophantine
approximations. He will study discrete groups of affine transformations, and in
particular the algebraic structure of cocompact discrete groups of affine
transformations. He will also continue his work on the Zariski closure of the
linear part of an arbitrary discrete group of affine transformations. This
project involves research in ergodic theory. Ergodic theory in general concerns
understanding the average behavior of systems whose dynamics is too complicated
or chaotic to be followed in microscopic detail. Under the heading "dynamics can
be placed the modern theory of how groups of abstract transformations act on
smooth spaces. In this way ergodic theory makes contact with geometry in its
quest to classify flows on homogeneous spaces.
