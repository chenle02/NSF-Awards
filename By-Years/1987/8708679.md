Tomographic methods are used to reconstruct the axisymmetrical distribution of
volumetric absorption coefficients. The method used is interesting and it could
be extended to other tomographic problems in a scattering and emitting medium.
Tomographic methods offer the possibility to use sensitive absorption techniques
in non homogeneous media. This extension to scattering media answers a practical
need. Such formulation, in a versatile computer form, would be very useful in a
number of diagnostics applications.
