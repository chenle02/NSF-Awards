9506483 Parise This research will elucidate the factors that determine the
strength of the H-bond in hydrous minerals and its effects on structure, phase
transition behavior and elasticity. The research approach will systematically
isolate such factors as cation acidity, pressure and temperature as variables in
a compound's ability to form hydrogen bonds and to determine crystal structure
and elasticity as a function of these variables. Studies will include structural
measurements of dihydroxides at high pressure using in situ neutron and x-ray
measurements, elasticity property measurements of the B series of high pressure
hydrous phases using Brillouin scattering, and measurement of equations of state
and dehydration behavior of these compounds and chlorite by in situ x-ray
diffraction measurements.
