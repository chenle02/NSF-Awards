This three-day conference will bring together a diverse group of international
scientists to discuss and evaluate recent advances in understanding the sensory
systems of dolphins and whales. These animals have remarkable abilities and
sensory adaptations for sensory discriminations, echolocation, communication and
navigation, and their cognitive abilities may be quite advanced. This symposium
will be associated with the International Theriological Congress, which deals
with all aspects of mammalian science, providing an unusually broad audience.
The extensive participation of Soviet scientists at this symposium should
provide new levels of interaction and facilitate a stronger global network of
scientists working on cetaceans. The results of the symposium will be published,
and should have a broad impact on scientists of sensory systems, behavior,
animal cognition, marine biology, and ecology; it may have an impact on the
global conservation movement as well, since these animals have become a popular
symbol.
