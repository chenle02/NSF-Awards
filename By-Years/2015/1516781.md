This award provides support for participants to Conference on the work of W.
Hugh Woodin,to be held at Harvard University during March 27-29, 2015. Professor
Woodin has been one of the top figures in mathematical logic since the early
1980's, and he has made important contributions to other areas, both in
mathematics and philosophy. In addition to his many results, Woodin has
introduced a number of important technical methods, and he has been the primary
developer of some of the deepest areas of foundational research. The meeting
will attract a diverse audience, and it will promote awareness and understanding
of Woodin's work and its importance. For younger researchers, it will be an
excellent opportunity to interact with some of the best-known figures in
mathematical logic. Funds are requested to cover the travel expenses of the
speakers and student participants.

The conference will focus on areas to which Woodin has made major contributions
include applications of set theory to analysis, forcing and large cardinals
(especially work on the continuum function), the relationship between large
cardinals and the Axiom of Determinacy, forcing over models of determinacy,
using inner models to prove lower bounds in consistency strength for natural
combinatorial statements via his core model induction technique, building inner
models for the largest large cardinals, the structure of the Turing degrees, and
the philosophy of set theory. Much of this work is unpublished, technically deep
and understood in detail by only small groups of experts. The speakers for the
meeting have been chosen to cover as much of this ground as possible. More
