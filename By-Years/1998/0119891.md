ABSTRACT

THE CSULB GEOSCIENCE DIVERSITY ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM (G-DEP)

Underrepresentation of minorities in the geosciences is a recognized problem,
and little is known about the specific cause of or solutions to the problem. The
California Sate University, Long Beach (CSULB) Departments of Geological
Sciences, Geography, Archaeology, Anthropology, and the Environmental Sciences
and Policy degree program proposes to created an innovative, collaborative
partnership with several community colleges and local high schools to improve
the research and educational experiences of underrepresented students in the
geoscience disciplines.

The G-DEP model leverages the resources arising from of CSULB's involvement in
the Long Beach Educational Partnership. In addition, G-DEP builds on
interdisciplinary activities among CSULB's Geography, Geology, Archeology,
Anthropology and Environmental Science disciplines to create a working prototype
for a comprehensive, integrated Earth Sciences program. Underrepresented
students will be encouraged to learn science by actively participating in
geoscience research. They will be more adequately prepared to become
undergraduates, and more sufficiently supported as they matriculate. With a firm
commitment to dissemination of lessons learned, G-DEP will advance the
literature on models that promote participation for underrepresented groups in
geoscience research and education, particularly for the comprehensive, urban
university.
