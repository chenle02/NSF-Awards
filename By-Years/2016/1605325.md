PI: Kim, Sung Jin &lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1605325&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
proposed research will develop a new sensors that can detect cancer biomarkers
at high sensitivity and at low cost. The principle the sensor design is based
on, a new transduction mechanism, may make it easier to use in practical
application. The sensor can be modified for measuring other biological entities
and can potentially have very broad impact in medical diagnostics, environmental
measurements and food safety.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research focuses
on a new transduction mechanisms and design of biosensing platform using hot
electron energy transfer generated by localized surface plasmon resonance
(LSPR). The proposed biosensor will utilize a LSPR-based hybrid plasmon device
structure consisting of the combination of both metallic nanoparticles (NPs) and
a field effect transistor (FET), thereby engendering highly sensitive label-free
detection of biomolecular interactions. Plasmon FET does not require bulky
optical readout instrumentation, while taking advantages of plasmon based
sensing. Unique characteristics such as electrically isolated plasmonic sensing
surface, on-chip optical-to-electrical conversion and two-color lock-in
amplifier based sensing will ensure robust sensing, an excellent signal-to-noise
ratio, and real-time detection of molecular interaction. This sensor design
allows the reduction in size of sensing area beyond the diffraction limit of
light. Thus, it has the potential to lower cost, highly sensitive and rapid
detection of disease biomarkers. This proposed research will carry out: 1)
development of plasmon-FET sensing platform on a glass substrate; 2) evaluation
using spiked PBS and clinical samples; and 3) a multiplexed sensing
demonstration using four different biomarkers for prostate cancer diagnosis. The
intellectual merit of the proposed activity is mainly the exploration of a new
promising LSPR device using efficient hot electron emission and amplification.
Successful development will lead the multiplexed microchip based sensing
technology for a point-of-care device and a lab-on-a-chip based sensor assay.
During the course of the project innovative materials will be developed which a
focus on nanotechnology in general and nanophotonics and LSPR in particular, as
well as promotion of interdisciplinary research (engineering, biochemistry and
clinical research) for the graduate students, and provide research opportunities
for undergraduate students.
