This project will support the establishment of a computer laboratory in order
to improve the manner in which mathematics is taught by using the computer in a
fundamental way to motivate concepts and involve students in the process of
mathematics research and discovery. It is being funded under the Instrumentation
and Laboratory Improvement (ILI) Program, which has the goal of supporting
projects to develop new or improved instrument-based undergraduate laboratory
courses in science, mathematics, or engineering. The Instrumentation and
Laboratory Improvement Program provides matching support for the instrumentation
necessary to implement undergraduate instructional improvements at U.S. colleges
and universities. In particular, the main objective of this project is to engage
students' interest in mathematics by using the computer to motivate concepts and
to involve students as active participants. The major focus of this project will
be a new course in Chaotic Dynamical Systems which: (1) is designed to appeal to
a wide spectrum of students interested in science and mathematics, (2) is seen
as the precursor of a first-year course that would combine dynamical systems and
calculus, and (3) would bring to a much broader audience the excitement and
beauty of research-level mathematics. Other courses in which the computer is
already used would also be affected by the acquisition of the new equipment. The
long-range goal is the improvement of the participation of women and minorities
in the scientific workforce, as well as the role women play in our society as
mathematically and scientifically literate citizens.
