9500818 Bales This award will offer partial support for the travel expenses to
the Workshop on Processes of Chemical Exchange Between the Atmosphere and Polar
Snow to be convened in Italy in March 1995. The workshop is sponsored by the
International Commission of Snow and Ice of the International Union of Geodesy
and Geophysics, and by the International Global Atmospheric Chemistry Program of
International Geosphere-Biosphere Program. The objective is to summarize,
assess, and improve our understanding of the processes that control the transfer
of chemical species between the atmosphere and polar ice sheets, in order that
the climate record recovered from deep ice cores may be interpreted correctly.
The workshop is timely in that it follows the successful recovery of an ice core
to bedrock in central Greenland, and coincides with the detailed planning of a
deep drilling effort in Antarctica. ***
