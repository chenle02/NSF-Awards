This research is to utilize the Connection Machine, a massively parallel
computer supporting 32,768 linked but otherwise independent CPU's, to compute
the transmission of a guided wave in a low-velocity fault zone. Such waves have
been observed at Parkfield, California, but standard computational codes are not
adequate to model the phenomena. The results can be applied to mapping faults
such as the San Andreas in greater detail than has been possible to date. This
research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
