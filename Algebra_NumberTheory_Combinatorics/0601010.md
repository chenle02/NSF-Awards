The proposers will collaborate on a suite of main projects in the combinatorics,
geometry, and topology of Grassmannians, flag manifolds, and their Schubert
varieties. These varieties are central to questions spanning many areas of
classical mathematics, such as algebraic topology, enumerative geometry, and
representation theory. They hope to resolve some thorny questions about
classification of singularities and topology of Schubert varieties, e.g. the
30-year old problem of the fixed-point-property for Grassmannians. They also
propose several additional projects, continuing some of the PI and co-PI's past
work in algebraic combinatorics. These projects relate to the recently
discovered "cyclic sieving phenomenon", to alternating subgroups of Coxeter
groups, and to critical groups of graphs. Some of these projects are outgrowths
of the PI's past (NSF-funded) REU's.

The appeal of this work is that counting problems, one of the staples of the
field of combinatorics, which seem unrelated to algebra or geometry sometimes
find the key to their solution and/or application in these other areas. This has
been particularly true for the algebraic/geometric objects in this proposal: the
Schubert varieties in flag manifolds and Grassmannians. These objects are the
key to understanding how lines and planes can tilt and intersect at different
angles in the two-dimensional plane, in three-dimensional space, and in higher
dimensions.
