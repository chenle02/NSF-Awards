This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
will assist the Department of Chemistry at the University of Colorado at Boulder
to acquire an automated solid- phase peptide synthesizer and a high performance
liquid chromatograph (HPLC). This equipment will enhance research in a number of
areas including the following: (1) studies utilizing peptides to probe
intermolecular tuning of protein signaling, (2) studies of the structural
ramifications of glycosylation on peptide conformation, (3) synthesis and
characterization of phosphopeptide analogues, (4) structural characterization of
the protein folding intermediates and protein design, and (5) studies of the MAP
kinase signal transduction pathway. The peptide synthesizer and the high
performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC) are used by biological scientists to
make and purify analogs of the natural substrates/effectors of a variety of
proteins.
