A study of the old stellar populations in galaxies will be carried out, mainly
through an analysis of the integrated spectra of elliptical galaxies and
globular clusters. The stellar content of early-type galaxies will be studied
through integrated light techniques previously developed. The main focus will be
to make a comparative study of elliptical galaxies in dense clusters of galaxies
versus galaxies in relatively isolated regions. The effect of environment on the
formation and early evolution of these systems will be evaluated. Related work
will be done on the disks of spherical galaxies. An exploration of the near-
ultraviolet spectrum of elliptical galaxies will also be carried out. Globular
clusters are often considered as crucial test cases for integrated light
studies, but previous work has demonstrated an unexpected degree of complexity
in their integrated spectra. Several projects will be carried out to better
understand this complex behavior. An alternative to studying the old population
in external galaxies is to carry out a detailed study of the collapse and early
chemical enrichment of our Galaxy. An objective prism survey of both galactic
poles will be done. The survey is designed to produce high-quality radial
velocities and atmospheric parameters for a very large number of stars. The
perpendicular physical structure of our Galaxy in density, chemical composition,
and kinematics will be determined.
