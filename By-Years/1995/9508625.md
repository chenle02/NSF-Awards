9508625 Zwanziger Studies will be conducted on the short and intermediate range
structure in several oxide glass systems, based on borate, tellurite, and
phosphate. Structural features of the glass transition will be probed, as well
as the structural features responsible for various optical and transport
properties in these materials. The experimental methods to be used include one-
and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance, Raman scattering, and thermal
analysis. These experiments are expected to reveal significant microstructural
details relevant both to fundamental and applied aspects of glass technology.
%%% Research efforts will be conducted, covering the fundamental and
technologically important issues in borates, tellurides and phosphate glasses
which will impact significantly in understanding the nonlinear optical and
infoared transmission properties of glasses.
