The principal investigator will develop models and conduct computer simulations
of processes that take place in high-temperature metamorphic rocks known as
granulites. The models will incorporate simultaneous operation of both net
transfer and exchange reactions, as well as intracrystalline diffusion in
various zoned minerals. The goal is to reproduce the type of zoning and reaction
histories observed in natural rocks. This will aid geologists in interpreting
the histories of these rocks.
