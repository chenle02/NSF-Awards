Because lack of control and replication impede many software engineering
studies, there is a need to design experiments that take advantage of completed
projects (and the associated data), rather than "live" projects (where the goal
of getting the product out the door may compete with data capture and analysis
goals). The research project involves conceiving, designing and preparing a
collection of large-scale, multi-location retrospective experiments. The
research focuses on four fault identification techniques (requirements
inspection, formal specification, formal design, and fault injection), building
upon existing work by determining which methods are more effective and in what
contexts. In particular, the project seeks evidence about which method is most
effective and/or efficient at fault identification and removal. The research
involves a consortium of industrial and academic partners, all affiliated with
Howard University's Center for Research in Evaluating Software Technology. Where
possible, parts of the experimental design will be tested by running parts of
the experiment with student projects to confirm its feasibility and to help
direct the preparatory efforts. The results should have wide impact, both on the
community of practitioners (who will find the results useful for guiding
resource allocation decisions) and researchers (who will note the feasibility of
doing software engineering field experiments with retrospective data).
