The objective of this study is to improve the capability of the Community
Climate System Model (CCSM) by helping to develop and implement a dynamic
vegetation component into the CCSM land model. The present land model, while
providing detailed information of water, heat, momentum, and carbon dioxide
(CO2) exchanges between land/atmosphere, uses a prescribed vegetation structure
and coverage and thus cannot assess important feedbacks between vegetation and
climate. A dynamic vegetation model, whose vegetation structure and coverage is
most compatible with the land model prescription, has been chosen to integrate
into the CCSM land model. Major-coupled experiments will consist of a pre-
industrial model run, enhanced CO2 experiments, and a paleo-simulation of the
mid-Holocene (6000 years ago). The work is important because it will increase
our understanding of vegetation-climate interactions, on both paleo and shorter
time-scales.
