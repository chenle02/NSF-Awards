This research program consists of three lines of investigation, each
&lt;br/&gt;connected to multivariate analogues of generalized hypergeometric
&lt;br/&gt;functions. The first concerns a family of biorthogonal abelian
&lt;br/&gt;functions associated to elliptic curves that generalize multivariate
&lt;br/&gt;orthogonal polynomials due to Macdonald and Koornwinder. The second
&lt;br/&gt;aspect involves certain multivariate analogues of quadratic
&lt;br/&gt;transformations of hypergeometric functions, which generalize
identities &lt;br/&gt;from the theory of symmetric spaces; related to this is
the study of &lt;br/&gt;natural deformations of permutation actions of Coxeter
groups to &lt;br/&gt;representations of the associated Hecke algebras, some of
which have led &lt;br/&gt;to proofs of multivariate quadratic transformations.
Finally, the &lt;br/&gt;investigator will be studying multivariate elliptic
hypergeometric &lt;br/&gt;(contour) integrals, with a view to understanding the
functional &lt;br/&gt;equations satisfied by such
integrals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Historically, the study of "special functions"
originated in the fact &lt;br/&gt;that quite a few functions of interest in
applications turned out to be &lt;br/&gt;members of a single family, the
hypergeometric functions. The new &lt;br/&gt;family of functions the
investigator is studying is a significant &lt;br/&gt;generalization of this
family, combining several existing &lt;br/&gt;generalizations (each with their
own applications and connections to &lt;br/&gt;other areas of mathematics) under
one roof. In addition to the &lt;br/&gt;potential that new applications may
arise, this investigation should &lt;br/&gt;also lead to a greater understanding
of the existing families.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
