CBET-0828832&lt;br/&gt;Cheng&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal aims to develop
a method that employs functionalized gold nanorods as an imaging and
photothermal agent to target and eradicate macrophages in an atherosclerotic
plaque by near infrared laser irradiation. preliminary studies have demonstrated
two-photon luminescence imaging and optical hyperthermia of activated primary
macrophages in vitro by gold nanorods conjugated with octaarginine (R8)
peptides. By controlling the laser power and irradiation time, they have been
able to induce apoptosis of macrophages confirmed by annexin V staining. The
hypothesis is that laser irradiation of nanorods accumulated in a plaque could
induce apoptosis of macrophages with minimal toxicity to the rest of the body.
This hypothesis will be tested at the in vivo level using ApoE deficient mice
with the following objectives. (1) Functionalize gold nanorods for prolonged
blood circulation time and selective targeting to macrophages in an
atherosclerotic plaque. (2) Determine the blood residence time, biodistribution,
and organ toxicity of functionalized gold nanorods. (3) Optical hyperthermia of
macrophages in atherosclerotic plaques of ApoE deficient mice.
