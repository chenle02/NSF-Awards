The New York Hall of Science provides a plan for the creation of a MICROLAB
Institute to provide training and ongoing supporting microbiology education for
7th grade life science teachers and middle school science supervisors. Over a
period of three years the program plan to model enhancement of the quality of
instruction in the nation's largest school district through (1) training in
content and pedagogy, (2) ongoing peer and instructional support, and (3) the
continuing provision of all materials and equipment for successful classroom
implementation of hands-on curricula. The major goals of the project are:
increase teachers' knowledge of microbiology concepts; change teaching
methodology from rote to interactive; to develop a New York City-wide ongoing
support network; and to stimulate teachers' own continuing development of
materials for activity-based learning. Two hundred teachers and sixty science
supervisors will serve as participants for this project. Cost sharing is
equivalent to 51% of the NSF award.
