ABSTRACT CHAPIN OPP-9523396 A researcher at the University of California will
conduct two workshops to examine trace-gas feedbacks to global climates,
water/energy feedbacks to climate, and the role of vegetation structure and
change in feedbacks to climate. The workshops will address the importance of
biodiversity and vegetation structure to large-scale (regional to global)
processes. The workshops will serve to integrate the results of several separate
high-latitude programs into a comprehensive framework to determine the
interactive roles of vegetation and ecosystem processes in the feedback of high-
latitude ecosystems to global climate. Separate workshops are planned to
summarize the vegetation and water feedbacks to climate. The workshops will
constitute the U.S. contribution to the International Geosphere-Biosphere
Programme effort to coordinate North American high-latitude research in global
change.
