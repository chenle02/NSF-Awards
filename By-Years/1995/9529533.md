ABSTRACT EEC-9529533 Henderson-Kinney There is a great need for field
instrumentation that can address complex questions associated with the
characterization and monitoring of hazardous waste sites. Research at Tufts
University is addressing many of these needs. This is a planning grant to
determine if Tufts University can obtain sufficient industrial support to become
a research site of the New Jersey Institute of Technology's Industry/University
Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Hazardous Waste Management. Tufts
University proposes to plan to become the sixth research site of the Center, the
first outside of New Jersey. Tufts University proposes to expand the multi-
university Center's research agenda by addressing a Field Electrochemical and
Microelectronic Program, A Fiber Optic Chemical Sensor Program, In Situ and On-
site Characterization and Monitoring of Subsurface Contamination Program and a
Field Characterization Program. The researchers are recognized experts in their
fields and can manage the activities of this planning grant.
