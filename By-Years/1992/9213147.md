Most research on the relationship between social forces and the evolution of the
legal profession focuses on the practice of law in corporate law firms. This
study departs from this traditional focus to investigate the changing nature of
the legal profession from the perspective of advocacy lawyering. Focusing on
legal rights lawyers and left activist lawyers, it investigates how lawyers
operating at the margins of the legal profession respond to the norms and
ideology of the legal profession. In addition, the research discerns whether
there are differences in the political ideology and professional norms of legal
rights lawyers in comparison to activist lawyers who practice law with the
explicit goal of advancing the interests of the political left. Also, it
explores how shifts in the larger society influence both types of advocacy
lawyering. Focusing on a sample of lawyers affiliated with the Seattle
membership of the National Lawyers Guild and a sample of attorneys working with
local legal rights organizations in the Seattle area, the researchers employ an
interview protocol to explore relationships among social change, different forms
of advocacy lawyering, and the norms of the legal profession. In addition to
broadening research on the transformation of the legal profession, the study
offers new insights into the ongoing public and professional debates about the
efficacy of rights as a means of promoting social change in the United States.
