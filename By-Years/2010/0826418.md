The objective of the proposed research is to apply innovative nanotechnologies
for creating acoustic emission (AE) sensors for real-time monitoring of
structures. The proposed AE sensors are composed of Nanoscale Active Fiber
Composites (NAFCs) and the project involves the design, manufacturing and
characterization of the sensors consisting of piezoelectric Lead Zirconate
Titanate (PZT) nanofibers. This work will result in advanced acoustic emission
sensors with high sensitivity, excellent conformability and suitability for
being imbedded into or attached on the surface of structures. These sensors are
very cost effective to produce and self-powered and can thus be conveniently
applied for real-time monitoring of civil engineering structures such as
bridges, dams, towers, roads, etc. Networks of NAFC sensors could be used to
detect defects such as cracks in structural elements as well as delamination and
debonding in various composite and sandwich components. In addition, this
project also aims to develop and deploy nanotechnology-related educational
materials and contribute to motivating k-12 students and students from
underrepresented groups to pursue STEM careers. Through this project, the
students will have the opportunity to participate in a stimulating multi-
disciplinary environment in an exciting research field, more students will
benefit from cybertechnology-enabled education modules documented during the
process
