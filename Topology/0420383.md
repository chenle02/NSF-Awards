Abstract

Award: DMS-0420383 Principal Investigator: Haynes R. Miller

This award funds travel, particularly by junior researchers, to an international
conference and summer school on topology to take place in Hanoi, Vietnam, in
August 2004. The focus will be on applications of the Steenrod algebra to
problems in topology and algebra. Three short courses will form a summer school
preceding the conference to introduce students to background material. A number
of the developments to be discussed in the conference grow out of the solutions
of the Segal Conjecture and the Sullivan Conjecture, and topics may include
invariant theory and representation theory of the general linear group,
polynomial functors, Mac Lane homology, topological cyclic homology, the study
of p-compact groups and p-local finite groups, and the use of the Burnside ring
in splittings of classifying spaces.

The conference will bring together mathematicians working in topology,
representation theory, invariant theory, and group theory. The interest in this
work is truly global: at least 21 countries employ mathematicians we intend to
invite. The summer school will attract younger people and enrich the exprience
for them.
