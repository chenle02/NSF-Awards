This award provides support for the acquisition and modification of components
into a microdensitometer system for measuring the intensities of diffracted
x-rays as recorded on x- ray sensitive film. The instrument will be developed
and installed in the Department of Geology and Geophysics at the University of
California at Berkeley. It will be used primarily in the characterization of
materials subjected to ultra-high pressures during laboratory experiments
intended to mimic conditions inside the Earth's deep interior.
