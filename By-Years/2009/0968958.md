This is a proposal to support participation by researchers from the United
States in the thematic semester on geometric, combinatorial and computational
group theory which is planned for the 2010 fall semester at the Centre de
Recherches Math\'{e}matiques (CRM) in Montr\'{e}al. The genesis of combinatorial
group theory at the end of the nineteenth century was intimately involved with
geometric questions, but subsequent developments tended towards algebra and
logic. In the 1980's Cannon, Gromov, Thurston and others produced an infusion of
geometric ideas which shed a great deal of light on earlier results and led to
new research methods known collectively as geometric group theory. The main
themes of geometric group theory involve the large scale geometry of cell
complexes, asymptotic properties of groups, and connections with theoretical
computer science. More recently results on asymptotic properties of groups have
been particularly useful in the cryptanalysis of group based cryptosystems which
occur in postquantum cryptography as possible alternatives to current public key
systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Over the past several years dramatic
achievements in these areas have led to progress on a number of basic and
difficult questions and also to novel connections with other areas of
mathematics and with theoretical computer science. We will bring people from
various branches of mathematics and computer science together to consider new
approaches to open questions in the field. Our major goal is to strengthen the
connections group theory has with other branches of mathematics and to highlight
new promising perspectives. A cornerstone of activities of the thematic semester
will be a collection of workshops covering related themes. These workshops will
be organized to benefit students, postdocs, and young researchers.
