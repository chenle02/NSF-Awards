Development and validation of an adaptive, scale invariant materials model,
based on microstructural&lt;br/&gt;information that will efficiently account for
the material and mechanical behaviors inherent in&lt;br/&gt;composites, is
proposed. Our approach involves: (a) Introduction of an adaptive hierarchical
and multi-scale&lt;br/&gt;computational model, incorporating image analysis to
correlate computational predictions; (b)&lt;br/&gt;Incorporation of
architectural flexibility based on Unit Cell approach; (c) Utilization of
Independent State&lt;br/&gt;Variables that bridge the micro-to-macro scales; and
(d) Account of interfacial mechanisms through&lt;br/&gt;cohesive elements. The
intellectual merit relies on the creation of an interdisciplinary program to
tailor&lt;br/&gt;computational and fundamental material science, that will
ultimately provide the underpinnings for&lt;br/&gt;understanding the mechanics
of reinforced structures such as woven, bio, and nanocomposites.
Broader&lt;br/&gt;Impact: In the area of basic research and education the
innovative and comprehensive approach taken by&lt;br/&gt;this work will promote
other research on composite materials aimed at developing a unified,
scale&lt;br/&gt;invariant model for FRPCs. (B) In the area of industrial
research, this program will affect a wide variety&lt;br/&gt;of industries where
significant gains in microscopic characterization and macroscopic behavior is
often&lt;br/&gt;stymied by lack of knowledge of micro effects and ignorance of
how to bridge the scales.
