Abstract(Kaloshin,1402759): &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides funding to
help defray the expenses of 25 graduate students studying dynamical systems in
the U.S and one of the proposed lecturers for an advanced "Summer School in
Dynamical Systems at Maryland" to be held on the campus of the University of
Maryland in College Park from August 18-25, 2014.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There
will be talks given by the PI, 2 other well-known faculty working at Maryland in
dynamics, some postdoctoral fellows, and an outside research mathematician. All
are established experts in the field. There will be 4 mini-courses on topics of
current interest, mainly drawn from hyperbolic and Hamiltonian dynamics. This
program will train 25 U.S. graduate students in some important topics and
problems in dynamical systems.
