This project is developing a new foundation for workflow and business process
management, called the "artifact-based semantic workflow model", and working in
this context to develop new theoretical results, techniques and algorithms for
specifying, designing, evolving, and implementing workflows. The new foundation
is based on two fundamental premises. The first is to use the artifact-based
approach to workflow pioneered at IBM Research. This approach is data-centric
rather than process-centric, and allows to structure workflows according to the
desired life-cycle of key business artifacts (or entities) that are manipulated
by a workflow. The second premise is to use techniques from semantic web
services to enable the declarative specification of workflows based on the
semantics of the workflow services (or tasks) to be performed and underlying
goals of the business managers. This is fundamentally different from most
current approaches to workflow specification, which are procedural.

A major thrust of the proposed research is to develop technical results (e.g.,
techniques, algorithms, and tools) to enable the automated construction of
workflows, starting from from a specification of the artifacts to be
manipulated, the individual services that might be applied to them, and a goal
to be achieved (expressed using a logic formula rather than as a flowchart).
