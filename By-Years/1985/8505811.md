A wide spectrum analyzer is being acquired for use in a project involving the
nonlinear oscillations of gas bubbles in a fluid. It was discovered that the
frequency components emitted by these bubbles can be described in a theoretical
manner. These analytical results are being tested by acquiring a general purpose
instrument--a spectrum analyzer--to obtain experimental measurements of these
frequency components.
