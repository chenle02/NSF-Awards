The Research Improvment in Minority Institutions (RIMI) program was established
to provide support to strengthen the research environments and capabilities of
predominantly minority institutions or institutions that have substantial
minority student populations. Eligible institutions must also have graduate
programs in science or programs in engineering. Funding is provided for faculty
research in fields of science and engineering supported by the Foundation and
for the acquisition of research instrumentation. California State University -
Los Angeles will use RIMI support to establish a core research facility for
recombinant DNA technology. The investigators will explore the regulation of
neuroactive peptide production and release, the expression of action genes
during development, the regulation of membrane development during the
sporulation cycle of Bacillus subtilis, the structural definition of viral
protein genes in mutant Sendai viruses, and the characterization of gram-
negative anaerobes. Many experiments will utilize cDNA synthesis and molecular
cloning techniques. The principal investigator is a well-trained biologist with
a specialty in neuroendocrinology. He has published several articles in refereed
journals. The Foundation has supported this project because more minorities will
have opportunities to participate in meritorious research in recombinant DNA
technology.
