This awards supports the research of Professor I. Dolgachev as principal
investigator and Dr. V. Lunts as a postdoctoral associate to work in algebraic
geometry. Professor Dolgachev will study the Scorza invariant of curves in
projective space, as well as the connection between certain hypergeometric
functions and moduli spaces. Dr. Lunts will work on characteristic varieties of
Verma modules on flag varieties, the hard Lefschetz theorem and the cohomology
of toric varieties. This research is in the field of algebraic geometry, one of
the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which blossomed to the point
where it has, in the past 10 years, solved problems that have stood for
centuries. Originally, it treated figures defined in the plane by the simplest
of equations, namely polynomials. Today, the field uses methods not only from
algebra, but also from analysis and topology, and conversely it is extensively
used in those fields. Moreover, it has proved itself useful in fields as diverse
as physics, theoretical computer science, cryptography, coding theory and
robotics.
