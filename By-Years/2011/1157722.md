INTELLECTUAL MERIT Mitochondrial ribosomes synthesize a small, but functionally
important subset of proteins. Although evolutionarily related to bacterial
ribosomes, mitochondrial ribosomes display some mechanistic and compositional
differences from their prokaryotic counterparts. Mitochondrial ribosomes are
entirely membrane-anchored, whereas in bacteria the ribosomes cycle between
soluble and membrane-anchored populations. The mitochondrial ribosomes display a
higher protein:rRNA content and this is largely attributed to (i) the presence
of "mitospecific" extensions on many ribosomal proteins in addition to their
bacterial homology domains, and (ii) the presence of novel mitochondrial-
specific ribosomal proteins. The role of the mitochondrial-specific ribosomal
proteins/domains in ensuring that the assembly and activity of the ribosomes is
tethered to the membrane is largely unexplored and represents a long-term goal
of this research. The elucidation of mechanisms of mitochondrial ribosome
assembly and regulation have important implications for the fundamental cellular
questions concerning protein translation systems and will address how
mitochondrial ribosomes have evolved in composition and function from their
prokaryotic ancestors. This research project will directly address how the
mitochondrion coordinates its translational activity with the biogenesis of the
oxidative phosphorylation system, a process which requires the uniting of
proteins encoded by nuclear genes with the mitochondrial gene products.

BROADER IMPACTS A major objective of this project is to continue to provide
innovative and transformative research opportunities for both undergraduate and
graduate students at Marquette University. The proposed research activities will
provide a training platform for student researchers in many aspects of molecular
biology, genetics, biochemistry and cell biology. Undergraduate students, by
working alongside graduate students, will become active members of a close
scientific research and mentoring community. Students will also be encouraged to
present their work at national research meetings and to publish their findings,
goals which will also hone their scientific writing and communication skills. By
exposing students to the excitement of inquiry-based biological research early
during their undergraduate tenure, it is hoped to increase the number of
students electing scientific research careers following graduation. Finally,
exposing students to innovative research in closely mentored research
environment will be instrumental for increasing their engagement, awareness, and
appreciation for the importance of scientific discovery and rigor in society
today.
