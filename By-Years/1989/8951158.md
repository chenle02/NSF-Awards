During the past decade, there have been significant technological advances in
analytical instumentation. Cal State L.A.'s special concern at this time is the
strong need to improve science education and hands-on, instrumentation-based
laboratory instruction for undergraduates who are not necessarily chemistry
majors but need certain chemistry skills for advancement in their own fields. In
our experience, non-chemistry majors, like their counterparts in chemistry, gain
a far better understanding of chemistry concepts and the potentials of modern
science when they use up-to-date instrumentation for hands-on laboratory
experiments. This project utilizes a computerized fluorescence spectrometer to
be used mainly by students per year. The relative ease in the operation of the
spectrometer at this level in the chemistry curriculum catalyzes a group of non-
chemistry majors to grasp the excitement of science and increases the students'
confidence in their ability to preform experiments and improve their attitudes
toward studying science for the accomplishment of their professional goals. The
institution is matching the NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.
