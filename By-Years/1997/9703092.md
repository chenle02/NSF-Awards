The research plan in this CAREER project focuses on new challenges in the robust
control of linear and nonlinear, passive and non-passive systems. There are two
main research objectives. One of the objectives is to extend and generalize the
existing robust stability results for multibody nonlinear flexible spacecraft to
include a broader class of systems and develop synthesis methods for dissipative
controllers proposed for such systems. The other objective is to develop new
robust control methodologies for open-loop stable nonpassive, open-loop
unstable, and non- minimum phase systems. Extensions of passivity based
techniques and development of new robust control methodologies for such systems
are pursued. In particular, the new methodologies using Generalized Predictive
Control (GPC) techniques are developed. First, an investigation of GPC
controllers for linear time-invariant (LTI) single-input single output
nonpassive systems is carried out. Subsequently, the extensions to LTI multi-
input multi-output and nonlinear non-passive systems are considered. `Proof-of
concept` laboratory setups, which can represent a class of linear and nonlinear
nonpassive systems of interest, are also developed. These systems can be used
not only as benchmark systems for numerical simulation and experimental
validation of new control methodologies, but also as laboratory experiments for
education. Besides involving undergraduates at various levels of research work,
a well structured industry-university cooperative education plan for
undergraduates, and a plan for providing advance education opportunities for
high school students is designed. Three new graduate courses in the area of
controls are developed to help build a strong controls program in the Department
of Mechanical Engineering. An innovative study abroad program for an
international collaborative education is also formulated.
