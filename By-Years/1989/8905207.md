The principal investigator will study several problems from the theories of
partial differential equations and differential geometry. He will construct
complete Riemannian manifolds with special holonomy and study their relationship
with the physical theories of "supermembranes" and "supergravity." Degenerate
partial differential equations which arise in the geometry of 3- manifolds and
the theory of exterior differential systems will be the subjects of two further
investigations. The interplay of ideas between the physics of gravitation and
subatomic particles, and the mathematics of differential geometry and geometric
partial differential equations, has become intense in recent years. Geometric
structures which have been under development for many decades are now
sufficiently powerful to handle many new problems of modern physics. The
principal investigator will solve a problem in holonomy of Riemann manifolds
which relates to recent theories of "supergravity."
