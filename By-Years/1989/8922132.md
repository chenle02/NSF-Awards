In the Northern Hemisphere winter, most of the synoptic scale storm activity is
observed in two widely-separated midlatitude stormtracks, along the east coasts
of Asia and the United States. There is evidence that the variability in wave
(or storm) activity and the position of the stormtrack are related to low
frequency variability of the basic flow in which they are embedded. Further, it
appears that the waves influence the evolution of the basic flow pattern. While
much evidence has been gathered in an averaged sense, there is still a need to
understand the time evolution of the interactions. The purpose of this research
is to investigate the time evolution of synoptic scale waves and along the major
stormtracks and to relate it to low-frequency changes in the basic flow,
specifically the structure of the jetstream. The study employs a 30-year data
set. This research has important implications for improving medium and long
range weather forecasting. If time permits, the PIs will also examine the
relationship between the low-level easterly jet over Africa and the so-called
easterly or African waves.
