This is a continuation of a project to develop and operate air Cherenkov
telescopes at South Pole Station for the purpose of studying discreet
astrophysical sources of very high energy (VHE) gamma rays. The project is
called Gamma-ray Astronomy at South Pole (GASP). The primary instrument consists
of an array of parabolic mirrors, with photomultiplier tubes at their foci,
which can detect light from VHE interactions in a small volume of the
atmosphere. The experiment is expected to shed light on the origin of cosmic
rays and possibly on sources of exotic radiation, if such radiation exists. GASP
complements the pre-existing South Pole Air Shower Experiment (SPASE), which is
operated by the Bartol Research Institute of the University of Delaware and
Leeds University (UK), and extends downward by two to three orders of magnitude
the energy threshold of SPASE. SPASE can survey most of the southern sky, and
GASP will be able to focus on small regions of suspected activity. The location
at South Pole allows GASP to view a single object for extended periods (weeks to
months) through a constant thickness of atmosphere, while mid-latitude locations
allow only a few hours of viewing at a time of a given object. The Polar
location also means that the very interesting high declination southern sky is
always within view, which gives GASP a great advantage over any mid- latitude
observatory. The project is a collaboration of the University of Wisconsin,
Purdue University and the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory. It is jointly
funded by NSF's Office of Polar Programs and the Smithsonian Astrophysical
Observatory.
