In a growing number of fields, scientists are leveraging computational
techniques to make discoveries by collecting, integrating, and analyzing large
data sets. But while the proliferation of data has created new opportunities for
research, the cyberinfrastructure on university campuses has not kept pace. The
labs where data are generated are typically not co-located with the compute
clusters used to analyze them, but few campus networks optimize for bulk data
transfer. Most campus networks offer "best effort" delivery and do not employ
advanced traffic engineering schemes that could provide better service for
science flows. Part of the reason for this failure to employ advanced traffic
engineering is it makes managing the network much more difficult. In order to
reduce the management difficulty and realize the full potential of
cyberinfrastructure better tools are needed. This project addresses the tool
issues by transitioning prototype implementations of Frenetic which provides a
high-level language for expressing and composing network policies, and SoNIC
which is a toolkit building precisely controlled network interfaces and
associated measurement tools. This work will be done in the operational context
of a new research network between Cornell University's main campus in Ithaca and
its medical campus in New York City. As a driving application, the project is
focusing on the efficient transfer of genomic sequencing datasets, which often
run to tens of terabytes and are rapidly growing in size. The project gives
scientists a practical tool for transferring data over the wide-area network
while transitioning the Frenetic and SoNIC systems from prototype
implementations into high-quality open-source systems.
