A numerical model of the wind-forced circulation of the Indian Ocean will be
coupled with a photosynthesis-irradiance model to investigate the intense
upwelling and associated primary production that is observed in the northwestern
Arabian Sea during the southwest monsoon. Extensions of the model are underway
to include explicit mixed-layer processes. The newly constructed photosynthesis-
irradiance model will be coupled to the physical model to allow a more indepth
investigation of the upwelling process and its effect on sea surface temperature
(SST), biological primary production, and the oceanic carbon budget in this
region. The coupled model will provide a mechanism for integrating satellite
altimeter, SST and ocean color data into a common coherent framework for
analysis and interpretation. The model will be used in the design of the
forthcoming JGOFS Arabian Sea Process Study by quantifying the expected
variability, using model data to test sampling schemes, and by providing "quick-
look" estimates of present conditions. The model will also be useful in the
analysis of observations, allowing interpretation of point measurements in a
broader framework in both space and time.
