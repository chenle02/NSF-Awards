Expediting computations by operating in the quantum mechanical regime
is&lt;br/&gt;an intriguing idea. Apparently, some problems can be solved much
faster by&lt;br/&gt;quantum algorithms than by any randomized algorithm. The
main thrust of&lt;br/&gt;this proposal is to derive design methods for fast
quantum algorithms, and&lt;br/&gt;to study various applications such as pattern
recognition and communication&lt;br/&gt;problems. The main objectives of the
proposed research are&lt;br/&gt; the development of design methods for quantum
circuits;&lt;br/&gt; the development of design principles for quantum
algorithms;&lt;br/&gt; the application of such methods to pattern recognition
applications;&lt;br/&gt; and the development of primitives for quantum
communications.&lt;br/&gt;The project is integrated with an educational plan
which supports the goals&lt;br/&gt;the the PI's department. The objectives of
the educational plan are&lt;br/&gt; the further development of a course on
quantum algorithms;&lt;br/&gt; the development of a new course on randomized
algorithms;&lt;br/&gt; the development of experimental components and new
material for&lt;br/&gt;courses in Information, Secrecy, and
Authentication;&lt;br/&gt; an outreach component which explains and animates
quantum algorithms&lt;br/&gt;and protocols in the form of a virtual
tour.&lt;br/&gt;The educational plan includes the continued improvement of the
course materials&lt;br/&gt;for the above courses.&lt;br/&gt;The PI will organize
an interdepartmental Quantum Computing Seminar&lt;br/&gt;and two mini-symposia
so that students, faculty, and participants from local&lt;br/&gt;industry get
informed about the latest research in quantum computing.&lt;br/&gt;The project
provides opportunities for one undergraduate student and two&lt;br/&gt;graduate
students to participate in the research.
