During the past three years, a lecture/laboratory course on the Chemistry of Art
has been developed with support from NSF (DUE/CCD). This is a materials-science
course on the fabrication, examination, conservation and authentication of
artifacts and it is an attractive and effective means of teaching science to
non-scientists. Experience gained during the development and initial
dissemination of the course structure and content are being used to develop a
text. Case studies for the course (e.g., on the Sistine Chapel ceiling) are
being completed for publication on CD-ROM. The first CD-ROM will present, in
collaboration with the National Gallery of Art, a restoration archive for The
Feast of the Gods, by Bellini/Dosi/Titian,, a famous "triple Decker" of three
paintings on a single canvas, one on top of the other. The development of these
course materials will be guided by formative and summative evaluation. The
pedagogical program has spontaneously spawned an attractive research program,
involving undergraduates... and this will continue to be developed. Projects
underway include (i) tracing artistic influence through pigment analysis, (ii)
authenticating a disputed Impressionist painting, and (iii) assessing
restoration rough computer imaging.
