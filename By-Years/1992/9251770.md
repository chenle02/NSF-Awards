The Science Department is purchasing a automatic purge and trap/dynamic
headspace sampler to add to its existing gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer
system. This equipment allows for the introduction of Environmental Protection
Agency protocols into appropriate areas of the science curriculum. These
protocols call for the measurement of volatiles and semi- volatiles in complex
matrices while avoiding costly, time- consuming extraction and cleanup. Students
are first introduced to the equipment in a special course in instrumental
analysis where they perform experiments involving the analysis of air samples,
petroleum products, plastics, foods and drugs. In the organic chemistry course,
students separate volatiles from a synthetic preparations. Other courses in
which the instrument is used include toxicology, biochemistry, and engineering
hydrology.
