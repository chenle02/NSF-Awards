The first project deals with energy minimizing maps to the Weil-Petersson
completion of Teichmueller space. The proposed research will establish
sufficient regularity for higher dimensional domains so that harmonic map theory
may be used to answer rigidity questions. The second part of the proposal
continues work on the Yang-Mills flow on higher dimensional Kaehler manifolds. A
special focus is a comparison of the analytic singularities which occur along
the flow with the algebraic singularities associated to Harder-Narasimhan
filtrations of holomorphic vector bundles. The third project consists of topics
related to representation varieties of surface groups. Included is a study of
properties of the energy functional on Teichmueller space defined by harmonic
maps associated to surface group representations. Results in this direction will
have implications for the dynamics of the mapping class group action on the
moduli space of representations.

A significant branch of mathematical inquiry has been the relationship between
the geometric, analytic, and algebraic properties of manifolds. Manifolds are
higher dimensional generalizations of curves and surfaces, and they appear in a
variety of situations in pure and applied mathematics. The research projects in
this proposal will further our understanding of some of these objects. The
equations studied -- energy minimizing maps and the Yang-Mills flow -- have
their origins in the mathematical description of the physical world. They are
therefore of great importance to both mathematicians and physicists.
