The principal investigator will study the stability of geometric inequalities,
a branch of integral and convex geometry. In particular he will investigate the
stability of symmetrization procedures and analytic inequalities, and duals of
Brunn- Minkowski theory. These studies will require the understanding of
ellipsoids and cap bodies. This project involves mathematics at the overlap
between geometry and probability theory. A typical problem might be to find the
probability that a random line in two dimensions intersects a given square or
other convex polygon. Solutions to these problems have a variety of applications
in Operations Research and other applied areas. This investigator will continue
his studies of similar problems in higher dimension.
