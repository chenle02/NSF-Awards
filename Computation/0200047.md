This proposal focuses on problems in q-series and partitions. There are five
separate parts of this work. The first part considers research tied to
applications of the construction of representations of Lie algebras. Next the
investigator looks at new q-series methods related to special problems in number
theory. The third part discusses applications of the Omega software package
(http://www.uni-linz.ac.at/research/ combinat/risc/software/Omega/) which is
being developed by the investigator in collaboration with colleagues at Linz.
The focus in this latter section is on mutli-dimensional partitions. The fourth
section is devoted to the study of Bailey chains and a consideration ofhow
recent discoveries of the investigator may lead to new applications of this
concept. The proposal concludes with consideration of three major unsolved
problems in the theory of partitions: (1) the Friedman-Joichi- Stanton
conjecture, (2) the Borwein conjecture and (3) the Okada conjecture. Each of
these three conjectures has been around for some time.

The theme of this proposal put succinctly might be: Building bridges from
partitions and q-series (two intrinsically deep and charming but sometimes
rather introverted topics) to several branches of mathematics and science. The
first two sections are devoted to relating this work to representation theory
and number theory, two branches of mathematics; in each instance, it is clear
that this interaction will not only enrich the object fields, but also will
provide new insights for partitions and q-series. The work on the Omega package
has great potential. Here the investigator and his collaborators have found
numerous instances where research discoveries have gone from being unthinkable
to easily reached. The possible applications to multi-dimensional partitions
should lead to insights in combinatorics and, hopefully, the combinatorial
aspects of physics. The work on Bailey chains in the past has had profound
impact on statistical mechanics in physics. The more this method is advanced,
the more we may expect these mutually beneficial applications to continue. The
final section on three unsolved problems appears, at first, to be a purely
internal study. However, as has often happend in the past, whenever new methods
are discovered to solve really hard problems, there is almost always a spillover
into vital applications.
