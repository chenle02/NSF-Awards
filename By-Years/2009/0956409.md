PI: Z. Renee Sung, co-PI Daniel Zilberman IOS-0956409 EMF-mediated epigenetic
mechanisms in Arabidopsis

EMF genes encode chromatin proteins that are master regulators of Arabidopsis
development, including the regulation of flowering time. This project studies
how the two EMF genes keep plants from flowering. Maintaining floral repression
is critical for vegetable crops such as cabbage. A genome-wide approach
employing ChIP-chip technology will enable comprehensive identification of
EMF/PcG target genes and characterization of the roles of EMF1 and EMF2 in
establishing histone methylation (H3K27me3) and transcriptional regulation. A
molecular genetic approach will be employed to investigate the function of
EMF1-target gene interaction. This project will uncover the EMF-regulated
genetic network that controls vegetative development, and the role EMF1 plays in
epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Data will be made available to the
public via Gene Expression Omnibus (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/), a curated
online resource maintained by NCBI. The proposed research will provide training
opportunities in developmental genetics, chromatin biology and genomics for a
postdoctoral fellow and student researchers, including students from
underrepresented and disadvantaged backgrounds.
