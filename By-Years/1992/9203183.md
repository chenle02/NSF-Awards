Research on the controlled growth of Si and Ge nanocrystals in epitaxial
fluoride on Si substrates using Si MBE techniques will be conducted. The linear
(including photoluminescence) and nonlinear optical properties of these
nanocrystals will be studied, along with fundamental efforts to understand and
control the optical properties of these nanocrystals. With this information, the
potential usefulness of this material will be evaluated for a variety of
applications. The research is motivated by the need to fabricate new opto-
electronic materials which are easily compatible with silicon Very Large Scale
Integration (VLSI) and which can either produce visible light or have large,
nonlinear optical coefficients. We are particularly motivated by the recent
demonstration of visible light photoluminescence from porous Si, and believe the
work proposed here will give an opportunity to make much more controlled
nanocrystal structures and will present more opportunity for electro-
luminescence device structures than porous Si if the proposed mechanism of
quantum confinement in Si nanocrystals proves to be valid. We are also motivated
by recent theoretical and experimental work showing that quantum dots of
semiconductors can have very large nonlinear optical properties. %%% Fundamental
studies of the epitaxial growth and the optical properties of very small
crystallites (nanocrystals) will be carried out. These nanocrystals will be
fabricated with techniques potentially compatible with silicon Very Large Scale
Integration (VLSI), and may lead to the fabrication of new opto-electronic
materials allowing monolithic fabrication of devices which utilize VLSI digital
processing and optical communication and/or processing for faster, more
efficient computing and information processing in the future.
