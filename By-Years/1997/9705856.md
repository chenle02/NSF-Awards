All animals, including humans, are selective about the food they eat, (i.e.,
they chose particular items for food from a suite of resources that are
potentially available to them). Much is unknown about the cues and criteria that
animals use to choose adequate diets. This is especially true among plant-eating
primates with simple stomachs (e.g. howler monkeys), who must choose a diet that
is not only adequate in energy, but that also has an adequate mix of nutrients
and low levels of toxins and indigestible carbohydrates. Wild howlers eat from
the leaves of particular trees but ignore those of other trees of the same
species. This study aims to identify the factors that govern such intra-specific
food choices. It is an initial step toward understanding factors that govern
choices across many food species. Trees of the same species that are used and
ignored will be compared for: 1) chemistry (nutrients, structural carbohydrates,
and toxins), 2) location, shape and structure, 3) productivity, 4) abundance,
and 6) danger of predation. An understanding of the criteria these primates use
to choose adequate diets will contribute to a greater understanding of their
ecological needs and of their complex behavioral adaptations to a forest
environment.
