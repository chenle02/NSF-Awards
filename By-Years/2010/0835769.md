This REU site combines an on-going archaeological research project with training
for undergraduates. Intellectual Merit - Current research is focused on
understanding the relationship between the natural and social environments,
agricultural development, the elaboration of social complexity, and the
distribution of human settlements in North Kohala, Hawai'i Island. Results of
previous work have established that the expansion and intensification of dry
land farming on the drier, western slopes of Kohala were occasioned by soil
nutrient availability, rainfall distributions, and the innovation of new
agricultural technology. New research will examine how the system of dry land
agriculture articulated with farming practices on the wetter, eastern side of
Kohala in both large and small valleys and ridge tops. The expansion of
leadership roles in both secular and religious realms will be studied,
particularly the ways in which labor was mobilized, provided for defense, and
signaled chiefly competitive ability. Broader Impacts - This work integrates
research and education, training students in contemporary archaeological and
historical approaches. It does so with the recognition of the ethical
obligations that archaeologists have to employ the least destructive analytical
tools to complete their research, and to report on the findings of their
analyses in a timely manner.
