Dr. Winston Anderson is the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) Professor at
Howard University (HU). He has devoted the last 44 years of his academic life to
the intellectual enhancement and mentoring of African Americans and other
underrepresented groups from K-12 to postdoctoral levels of education. To that
end, he has leveraged his HHMI Professor Award to provide research opportunities
for HU students. His 12-point mentoring program focuses on K-12 education, early
identification of gifted students and their recruitment into the Howard Hughes
Medical Research Scholars program at HU. As the Principal Investigator of
Rockefeller and PEW Foundation awards for ten years, he established Howard
University-Rockefeller (HUROC) centers for the summer biomedical sciences
training of high school students at 26 sites throughout the U.S. More than 1,200
high school students participated in summer research, and more than 70% of the
HUROC and PEW Pre-College Science and Mathematics trainees pursued university
careers. Approximately 200 undergraduate science and mathematics students
received exposure to state-of-the-art research in the sciences under his
Research Careers for Minority Scholars grant from the National Science
Foundation and his Minority Biomedical Research Scholars grant from the National
Institutes of Health.
