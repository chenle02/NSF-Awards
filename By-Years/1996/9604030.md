PI: DAVID ACKERLY PROPOSAL: IBN96-04030 This project will investigate the
physiology, growth and population biology of palms in the genus Chamaedorea. In
Guatemala and southern Mexico, the leaves of these species are harvested by
local communities for sale as greenery in the international florist industry.
The research will address the effects of leaf harvesting at three different
levels: 1) individual leaf physiology and carbon gain, 2) plant growth and leaf
production, and 3) population dynamics (e.g. seed production, and mortality).
Long-term experiments with different levels of leaf removal will be established
in the field, at the Chajul Biological Reserve in southern Mexico, and in the
greenhouse at Stanford University. This research will provide a significant
contribution to ecological research by linking leaf, individual and population
responses in a single experiment system. In addition, the results will be used
to evaluate the sustainability of leaf harvesting practices at the individual
and population level. Sustainable harvesting of Chamaeodorea palms will
contribute to rain forest conservation by providing an economic incentive for
maintaining the population and the forest environment in which they occur.
