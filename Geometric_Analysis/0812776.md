Geometry and topology, always central areas or research in mathematics, have
experienced tremendous developments in recent years. In particular, the fields
of geometric analysis, low-dimensional topology, gauge theory, symplectic and
contact geometry, Gromov-Witten theory and Teichmuller theory have all
flourished. Another important theme in recent years has been the interaction
between geometry/topology and physics. The next Great Lakes Geometry Conference
will bring experts to the University of Michigan to exchange ideas on important
recent developments in these areas.

The Great Lakes Geometry Conference is a well-established international
conference series. The aim of this conference is to bring together distinguished
speakers in a variety of areas in geometry, topology and mathematical physics
which will benefit students and early career mathematicians at the University of
Michigan and other Midwestern institutions.
