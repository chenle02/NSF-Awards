9610280 German New research on supersolidus liquid phase sintering (SLPS)
addresses three topics. The first examines microstructural evolution during
heating and sintering. A current model of the process makes assumptions on the
rate of grain growth, liquid film thickness, shrinkage rate, semisolid particle
viscosity, and causes of distortion. These assumptions are addressed by
experimentation performed on model systems using microstructure measurements
from quenched samples and in situ testing. The goal is to increase the model
reality and to recognize any behavior between systems. The second topic is the
prediction of final component size and shape. A computational prediction for the
loss of structural rigidity as liquid spreads on the grain boundaries needs
verification. Furthermore, gradients in grain size, particle size, packing
density, substrate friction, and heat transfer need to be included in the final
component size and shape predictions. The third activity extends the model to
several other processing conditions (bimodal-sized powders, powders of differing
compositions, high viscosity systems, reactive systems). %%% Success in this
research should positively impact the use of the SLPS process to produce full
density, complex shapes via powder metallurgy. A research target is tool steels
where there are opportunities to use SLPS in the near net-shape production of
high performance tooling. ***
