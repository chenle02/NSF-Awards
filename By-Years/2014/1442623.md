1442623&lt;br/&gt;Wei&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports development and
testing of a distributed coaxial cable strainmeter that has the potential to
offer high accuracy (~ ppm) and high temporal resolution (~1 sec) measurements
with unprecedented high spatial (~ 10 m) resolution over kilometers. The concept
will rely on tests of coaxial cables that have been imparted with periodic
electromagnetic impedance discontinuities (a Bragg grating) which allow for weak
reflections of a pulsed input of an electromagnetic wave through the coaxial
waveguide or implanted reflectors within the coaxial cable that will enable a
coaxial strainmeter based on Fabry-Perot interferometry. A vector network
analyzer then is then used to analyze transmission and reflection spectra. The
PI would also explore novel signal amplification techniques to reduce losses
from returned EM pulses along longer lengths of cable with multiple sensors
points along the length of the cable. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The potential of the
coaxial cable based strainmeter to survive large deformations (5%) and strong
lateral collision/impact, may provide valuable and otherwise inaccessible
information under certain extreme conditions where fiber optic based strain
technologies may fail (e.g., landslides, subglacial deformation, steel structure
deformation). The development will engage a graduate student to assist with: 1)
development of new modelling methodology for device design and optimization, 2)
explore hybrid software-hardware signal processing technology; and 3) build a
portable prototype coaxial strainmeter; and 4) characterize the prototype?s
performance in the laboratory and in the
field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***
