This SBIR Phase II project is to further refine the concept of laminated lumber
and to extensively test the resulting material. Earlier studies have shown that
lamination increases strength and reduces some types of warping at the expense
of introducing more complex deformations during drying. If successful the
project will permit the use of lower grade woods in construction applications.
