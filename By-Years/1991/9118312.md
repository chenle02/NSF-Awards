Research will focus on the biochemical and molecular mechanisms by which the
marine copepod Tigriopus californicus responds to changes in environmental
salinity. This species, like many others, is known to accumulate high
intracellular concentrations of proline, a non- essential amino acid. The
mechanisms regulating proline synthesis in response to osmotic stress in higher
organisms remain to be determined. Previous work has shown that one regulatory
site for induction of proline synthesis lies within the first two steps of the
pathway between glutamate and proline; the current work will concentrate on this
pathway. The goals of the proposed work are to elucidate the molecular
mechanisms underlying this regulation and to determine why such regulation fails
among some interpopulation hybrids. Primary objectives are: (1) to isolate
(clone) the genes encoding the first two enzymes in the proline synthesis
pathway, (2) to determine the normal pattern of regulation of these genes during
osmotic response, (3) to screen interpopulation hybrid lines for aberrant
regulation of proline synthesis at the biochemical level, and (4) to use the
cloned genes as probes for determining the mechanism underlying hybrid breakdown
in proline synthesis.
