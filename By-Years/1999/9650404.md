A Geographic Information System laboratory will be developed to support broad
applications in the Dept. of Geography and Planning, and in the associated
physical, life, and social sciences. This project also provides a number of
opportunities for undergraduate students to work directly with faculty members
on research projects making use of GIS or related spatial analysis techniques
using state-of-the-art PCs and peripherals. The ultimate goal is to prepare
students better for quality professional service and technical jobs in today's
highly competitive marketplace. In addition to improving the applied technical
course offerings in geographic information systems (GIS) for students of the
social and behavioral sciences, the department aims to satisfy an increasing
demand for course work in GIS among students of law enforcement. Additional
undergraduates from other colleges may benefit from an enhanced teaching
laboratory for GIS and Spatial Analysis. Secondary instructional objectives
focus on the ability to offer technical workshops for individuals in law
enforcement and related public safety and service professions. Summer workshops
in GIS can be held for individuals in the teaching profession wishing to
increase their general knowledge of this rapidly changing spatial information
technology and, perhaps, for recertification requirements as teaching standards
change in light of new Federal and state laws. Service objectives include the
potential use of GIS technology for outside applied studies in cooperation with
city, county, or state agencies, which may also actively involve undergraduate
students. A number of ongoing and potential service/research projects have been
identified where a strong level of support for an expanded GIS laboratory is
indicated.
