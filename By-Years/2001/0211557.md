This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project proposes to apply
cavity-enhanced spectroscopy to Capillary Electrophoresis (CE). CE typically
relies on absorption spectroscopy to detect analytes eluting from a separation
column. Although this detection method is very useful, the capillary's short
absorption pathlength has limited its sensitivity, forcing the development of
more complex detection schemes. Preliminary results suggest that an optical
cavity can be used to enhance this absorption sensitivity by a factor of hundred
to over ten thousand. The aim of this proposal is to interface a CE column to an
optical cavity and demonstrate the enhanced detection of various biological
samples. Due to the increasing popularity of CE in biochemical research, the
commercial applications of this technology continue to grow. It is currently
used to analyze DNA fragments, proteins, and various drugs. Moreover, it is also
being considered as an alternate to gel electrophoresis for DNA sequencing and
is a leading prospect for lab-on-a-chip technologies.

The commercial applications of this project are in genomic sequencing, medical
diagnostics, and drug screening.
