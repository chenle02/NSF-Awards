This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
Program, addresses the question of the detailed dynamics of molecules
photoexcited while adsorbed on transition metal surfaces. A nanosecond tunable
pulsed laser system is used to initiate photodesorption, photofragmentation, and
photoreaction of adsorbate molecules such as methane, nitrogen, and carbon
monoxide adsorbed on the Pt(111) surface. Angle resolved time of flight mass
spectrometry is used to examine species desorbing into the gas phase, and
surface analytical tools are used to examine changes to the substrate. Electron
mediated photoprocesses will be examined by the use of alkali adsorbates to
lower the work function of the metallic substrate. Detailed information obtained
in this research will be useful for our growing understanding of heterogeneous
catalysis and photoassisted electronic materials processing. The interaction of
light with adsorbed molecules forms the primary focus of this research project
supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program. Laser initiated
processes such as desorption, fragmentation, and reaction will be probed by
examining the gas phase product of the process as well as changes to the
metallic substrate. Insights into the operation of heterogeneous catalytic
systems, as well as mechanistic information about laser assisted processing of
electronic materials, should result from these studies.
