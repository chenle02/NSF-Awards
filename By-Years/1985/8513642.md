This project is concerned with two areas of importance in the development of
bioprocesses for the production of high and intermediate-value biochemicals. The
first concerns the use of aqueous two-phase polymer systems for the recovery of
fermentation products. The research is directed at obtaining the molecular
thermodynamic properties of these solutions and developing predictive models for
phase behavior and partitioning of solute molecules between phases. The second
area concerns the use of non-aqueous solvents for enhancing substrate solubility
in enzymatically catalyzed reactions. Supercritical carbon dioxide, alone with
selected entrainers, is used as a solvent for studying the kinetics of several
commercially important reactions: cholesterol oxidation, interesterification of
lipids, and various hydrolytic reactions which can be run "backwards".
