An idea which has emerged in biological oceanography is that pigment
fingerprints, that is, the types and quantities of carotenoids and chlorophylls,
can sometimes be used to determine the types of organisms present in a water
sample. This method has been proposed for the ultraphytoplankton, where the
organisms are too small to be identified by light microscope techniques. Dr.
Fawley proposes to determine if pigment fingerprints correlate with a
biochemical character, the light-harvesting complex type, for the coccoid green
ultraphytoplankton. Preliminary evidence indicates that some coccoid green
ultraphytoplankton have a light-harvesting complex similar to that found in some
green algae while others do not. Results should provide evidence whether or not
pigment fingerprints indicate valid taxonomic units. In addition, these results
may suggest that some organisms should be included in existing taxonomic groups
in the green algae, potentially resulting in taxonomic revisions.
