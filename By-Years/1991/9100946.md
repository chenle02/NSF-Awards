This project is designed to expose ten undergraduate students, chosen from
several Central Florida Institutions, to one year of research experience in the
development and applications of lasers. Seven internationally recognized faculty
in the Center for Research in Electro Optics and Lasers (CREOL) will act as
Research Supervisors in this project. CREOL is a world leading center of
excellence in optics, laser development and laser-related sciences. This program
will be enhanced by: (1) an introductory course in the basic principals of
optics and lasers, taught by three principal investigators; (2) the offering of
a course on laser systems; (3) weekly research seminars organized specifically
for the REU students; (4) weekly industrial visits and seminars, provided by the
numerous optics and laser companies in the Orlando area; (5) attendance at the
annual SPIE Orlando optics conference, including attendance at one of the many
short courses; and (6) continuous monitoring of the students' progress by the
principal investigators. Most of the activity will take place in the summer
term, with the students continuing part-time in the fall and spring. The primary
emphasis of this program is on encouraging more talented undergraduate students
from the Central Florida region to pursue graduate studies in the field of
optics and lasers.
