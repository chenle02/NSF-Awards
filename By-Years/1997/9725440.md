9725440 Johnson This project focuses on the exhumation history of the Grenville-
aged Adirondack basement. Recent studies pint to the importance of shear zones
in the exhumation of the Grenville-province. This project is to study the field
relationships, mineral assemblages, mineral and bulk-rock chemistries, fluid
inclusions, 40Ar/39Ar cooling ages and U/Pb ages from discrete shear zones
within the Dana Hill Metagabbro and adjacent Diana Syenite Complex in the
Carthage-Colton Mylonite Zone in the Northwestern Adirondack Mountains. The
goals of the proposed research are to determine the pressure-temperature
conditions of a number of temporally distinct deformational events. These data
will be used to evaluate the late to post-Grenville uplift/exhumation path for
the region and to provide a better understanding of the role of the Carthage
Colton Mylonite Zone in this exhumation history.
