Today's microprocessors are much more remarkable in their similarities than in
their differences, this is not likely to change for the foreseeable future. By
combining a fixed set of datapath components with FPGA-implemented interconnect
and control, complex systems can be constructed that emulate different
microprocessor architectures. This research attempts to identify target
applications for which special-purpose processors can offer performance gains.
Current areas of investigation include gene sequence analysis and multimedia
systems. The objectives of this research are the completion of a quantitative
study of the utility of FPGAs in the prototyping of large heterogeneous digital
systems, and the development of new FPGA architectures based on this study. The
methods employed consist of: (1) the implementation of custom microprocessors
and general emulation systems on FPGAs; (2) quantitative analysis of these
designs; (3) measurement of performance, power consumption, and other relevant
parameters of these designs; and (4) use of results to develop new FPGA
architectures better suited to the prototyping of complex digital systems.
