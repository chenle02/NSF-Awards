The PIs at Otterbein College will conduct a self assessment in the areas of
bias/climate, service obligations, work-life balance, and issues surrounding
invisible women (e.g., adjunct, part-time, those not well integrated into
departments.) They will use existing data sources as well as subscribe to the
COACHE survey. They will interview women who have left Otterbein, and convene
focus groups of invisible women. They plan to institutionalize some data
collection efforts. In addition they will utilize the existing mechanism of
Professional Learning Communities to bring ADVANCE topics to the faculty.
Otterbein is a PUI and aligns their activities well with the specific needs of
PUIs. In particular the focus on ?invisible women? is very relevant as many
institutions are increasing their non-tenure-track faculty, especially PUIs.
Results could prove to have national significance.
