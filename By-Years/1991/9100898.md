This project will support 10 students to work on a variety of projects in
computer vision utilizing researchers from the University of Central Florida,
the University of South Florida, and Stetson College. The student participants
engage in a intensive 12 week summer program which includes a 6-week course in
computer vision, followed by two short courses in programing, followed by 4
weeks of research. The research component is continued throughout the following
academic year. Students work in a variety of areas such as combining stereo and
shape from shading, neural controllers for robotic arms, range image aspect
graphs, and modeling of non-rigid object motion. //
