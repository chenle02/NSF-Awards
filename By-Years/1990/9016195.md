Funds are requested to aid in the creation of a video archive of fossil and
recent carnivoran skulls, from which skull shape data will be acquired
photogrammetrically. Description of skull shape by a statically determinate
truss network of short distances will avoid several problems of many previous
morphmetric data sets. ANalysis of variation in skull shape within species will
be used to derive shape characters suitable for cladistic phylogenetic analysis.
Mapping of skull shape characters onto independent hypotheses of caniform
phylogeny will permit the analysis of several problems: (1) the coevolution of
skull shape characters, (2) the coevolution of skull shape with functional
traits, and (3) the relationship between within-population covariance and
directions of evolutionary change. Data on well-preserved fossil skulls of
carnivorans and creodonts will be crucial to these analyses, in order to
establish the primitive states of skull shape characters. Analysis of skull
shape should also provide new evidence for the taxonomic affinities of
problematic fossil taxa.
