This research project will be carried out by and interdisciplinary team of
archaeologists, physical anthropologists, geomorphologists, and community
members. The research team will excavate the Nuvuk cememtary at Barrow, Alaska
and analyze the physical remains, in order to explore the relationships between
the ancient inhabitants of the Arctic region,the Thule Culture, and contemporary
populations. This project is a model of community collaboration, both in the
research itself, through the participation of local high school students in the
excavation and data analyses, as well as the interenest and support of the
community of Barrow for DNA and metromorphic analyses of the ancient remains. In
addition, this research is urgent because the cemetary is at risk of totally
eroding with each Fall storm season, threatening the loss of the human remains.
