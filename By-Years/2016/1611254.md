The overall goal of this proposal is to introduce a new multi-disciplinary
foundation for see-through imaging with everyday RF signals using unmanned
autonomous vehicles. See-through imaging with everyday RF signals can
considerably impact many different areas such as search and rescue operations,
surveillance and security, detection/classification of occluded objects,
infrastructure assessment, medical imaging, and archaeological exploration, just
to name a few. Robotic networks, on the other hand, can have a tremendous impact
in many different areas such as disaster relief, emergency response,
environmental monitoring, surveillance, and security. This proposed work at the
intersection of RF sensing and robotics can considerably advance the state-of-
the-art in RF sensing by jointly and successively optimizing robotic path
planning and RF imaging, and can thus have a transformative impact on our
society. The proposal also has a significant educational component targeting
under-represented students.

More specifically, in this research effort, a new multi-disciplinary paradigm is
proposed to equip a number of unmanned vehicles with see-through imaging of
completely unknown areas using everyday RF signals. Along this line, the first
major task focuses on the interplay between motion patterns and RF imaging
performance, in order to understand and mathematically characterize robotic
motion patterns most informative for RF imaging. The second task then develops
the foundation of jointly and successively co-designing the path planning and
imaging of the robots while considering the dynamics of the vehicles,
environmental navigation constraints, motion energy budget, and operation time.
Finally, the proposed theories and design paradigm are extensively validated
with ground and aerial vehicles. Overall, the proposed research can make a
significant contribution to enhancing the state-of-the-art in both RF imaging
and robotics.
