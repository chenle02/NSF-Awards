This grant aims at achieving deeper understanding of the direct and indirect
extratropical response to tropical SST anomalies. The novelty here is to examine
the global response to tropical SST anomalies as a slowly evolving dynamical
process (instead of a steady process as in the previous studies). The indirect
response includes the process of organizing extra tropical transient eddies in
to stormtrack anomalies and the subsequent symbiotic development of the
anomalies in both large-scale quasi-stationary waves and storm tracks. In
practical terms, this research is important for improving seasonal to
interannual climate forecasting by dynamical physical methods and, in
theoretical terms, this is basic research that leads to a better understanding
of dynamical processes at work in the long range evolution of climate and
weather.***
