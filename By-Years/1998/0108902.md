David McMillan of Purdue University is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic,
and Organometallic Chemistry Program to conduct research on photochemistry of
complexes of late transition elements and DNA. The proposed research will use
photochemical methods to gain understanding of binding of late transition metal
porphyrin complexes to DNA and to devise methods to direct that binding. The
research will also develop porphyrin and polypyridine complexes of late
transition series elements as novel photosensitive probes for technologically
important uses.

Many late transition series complexes feature open coordination positions. The
chemical flexibility engendered by such vacancies can be exploited to gain
otherwise unattainable understanding of interactions between metallic species
and DNA. Photochemical processes involving complexes of late transition metals
with DNA have considerable potential for producing new agents for photodynamic
therapy, as well as in clarifying factors influencing the binding of metallic
species to DNA.
