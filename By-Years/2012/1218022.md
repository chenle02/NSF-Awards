The recently-ratified C and C++ standards, "C11" and
"C++11"&lt;br/&gt;respectively, add a concurrency model that supports
writing&lt;br/&gt;high-performance, portable code for machines with multiple
processors.&lt;br/&gt;The concurrency model, however, is large and complicated;
it is not&lt;br/&gt;particularly easy for compiler and library developers to get
all of&lt;br/&gt;its corner cases right. Errors in implementing the new model
can&lt;br/&gt;introduce bugs into important pieces of software, such as
operating&lt;br/&gt;systems, web browsers, web sites, database engines, and
embedded&lt;br/&gt;systems, all of which are written, at least partially, in
concurrent C&lt;br/&gt;and C++.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI's previous work on
randomized testing for C compilers uncovered&lt;br/&gt;more than 450 bugs in
production-quality compilers, most of which were&lt;br/&gt;fixed by compiler
developers. The PI's current project extends this&lt;br/&gt;research agenda to
support stress testing of implementations of the&lt;br/&gt;C11 and C++11
concurrency model. The intellectual merit of this work&lt;br/&gt;stems from the
need to generate random, but standards-conforming,&lt;br/&gt;concurrent code;
the need to synthesize "test oracles" that can&lt;br/&gt;automatically ascertain
the success or failure of a test case; and,&lt;br/&gt;the need to develop
"hostile" simulators for flushing out errors in&lt;br/&gt;compiled concurrent
code.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expected impact of the PI's work is to
significantly reduce the&lt;br/&gt;period during which implementations of the
C11 / C++11 concurrency&lt;br/&gt;model are flaky and immature, and to reduce
the lifetime of compiler&lt;br/&gt;bugs that are introduced during ongoing
development.
