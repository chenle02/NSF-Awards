9408243 Stahl In this project the structure of microbial communities of Lake
Michigan anoxic sediments is being characterized using molecular methods (RNA
sequencing and DNA probes), culture-based techniques, and measurements of rates
of reduction of alternative electron acceptors. This research will identify and
quantify the most abundant microbial populations at different depths in the
sediments and relate them to depth-associated changes in redox state and
respiratory mode. This research will greatly improve our understanding of the
relationship between microbial community structure and anoxic microbial
biogeochemical activity, such as anoxic respiration, sulfate reduction, metal
reduction, and methanogenisis. These studies should also contribute to
establishing the connections between sediment and water column activities. The
results of this study will have application in understanding aquatic ecosystem
function and in aquatic pollution studies.
