In addition to measurements on molten core materials, the PI will measure
compressional and bulk wave velocities of preheated samples of selected mantle
minerals and analogs, including MgO, MgA12O4, A12O3 and CaTiO3 (in the
perovskite structure). He will conduct more measurements on core materials and
to increase the present 2-4% accuracy of these types of measurements by
upgrading recording electronics to the state-of-the-art. Such measurements are
required because at present the high-temperature, low-pressure measurements of
parameters, for the above mantle minerals are discrepant with variations
inferred from seismic tomography and correlations of the velocity structure with
the low order harmonics of the geoid.
