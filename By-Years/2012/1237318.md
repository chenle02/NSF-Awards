This Innovation-Corps proposal builds on previous support and is designed to
commercialize ongoing research focused on tailored messaging systems involving
severe weather events. Success rates of messaging systems have yielded
disappointing rates in previous events due to a "one size fits all" approach to
broadcast strategies. Extant communication research has concluded that tailored
messages have the best chance for influencing behavior and educating receivers.
This effort investigates the potential to commercialize the research previously
conducted to provide tailored communications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Improved
communication of hurricane information promotes more effective protective
decision-making thus saving lives and property; the team employed demographic,
socioeconomic, physiological, and psychological data to improve the accuracy and
efficacy of advisories and warnings for weather systems. There is now an
opportunity to make these scientifically optimized systems available to the
public. The I-CORPS proposal to examine commercialization potential extends the
scientific knowledge gained from the previous studies to improving communication
platforms, which is a potential commercial as well as humanitarian opportunity.
