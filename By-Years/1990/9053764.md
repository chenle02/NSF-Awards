Indiana University of Pennsylvania will develop a model laboratory course on
computers and computer interfacing for middle and secondary science education
majors. The project will extend activities developed by the in-service computer
interfacing workshops at the University to pre-service teacher preparation. The
computer applications will cover all fields of science including biology,
chemistry, physics, and earth science. Curricular materials and videotapes will
be produced by the project for national dissemination. The University's cost
sharing will be 64% of NSF's contribution.
