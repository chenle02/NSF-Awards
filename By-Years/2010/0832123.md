This grant provides funding to organize the 2009 CMMI Grantees and Research
Conference in Honolulu, Hawaii, on June 22nd -25th, 2009. The goal of the
conference is to provide a forum for the Division of Civil, Mechanical and
Manufacturing Innovation grantees to showcase their research outcomes and
network with researchers from the Far East and Pacific-Rim regions to foster
closer international cooperation in research and education. The conference will
consist of keynote presentations, plenary sessions, workshops, poster sessions,
breakout sessions, social activities and informal interactions, which will
result in seeding new partnerships and generating cross-disciplinary research
ideas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference theme draws attention to the ever-
changing landscape at the frontier of science and technology research across the
globe. It will enable researchers and educators from across the Pacific Rim to
discuss their activities and form collaborations, and will likely result in an
advanced pace of research across the fields supported by the Division of Civil,
Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation.
