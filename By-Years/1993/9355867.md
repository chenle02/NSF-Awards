9355867 Brazziel This project is concerned with describing institutional
programs in higher education that promise to increase the number of minorities
in the science and engineering doctoral programs. The PI promises to investigate
4 year college programs that have been successful in promoting minority students
through the science and engineering fields toward higher degrees. The study
would be conducted by data analysis of the NAS doctoral record files
supplemented with data from the Astin CIRP. Then the PIs would conduct an on
site investigation of 10 colleges to describe their programs qualitatively. The
PIs propose to do this study within 3 months. ***
