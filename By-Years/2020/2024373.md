The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project will benefit the 30 million disabled survivors
of stroke, spinal cord injury, and traumatic brain injury around the globe.
Making assistive robots more affordable and easy to use is important for this
market, projected to grow to $1.2 billion in 2024. The proposed wearable
technology will enable effective communication and control of robots designed to
assist patients with activities of daily living, which will help patients
improve quality of life, lower costs for long-term care, and preserve physical
and mental health with increased activities. The data may be used to monitor
rehabilitation and deterioration progress, which could encourage patients to
exercise more frequently and enable more personalized
treatment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
Phase I project will explore the feasibility of commercializing a lightweight
and compact optical sensor band for detecting commands from disabled users and
controlling assistive robots. Most commercially available human-robot interface
options are not practical or reliable for chronic hemiparetic patients due to
the diverse and evolving patient conditions. The research objective involves
designing an optical sensor array to capture muscle activities and developing an
adaptive muscle synergy-based classification algorithm to convert optical data
to user command. The project will optimize the configuration for near-infrared
emitters and phototransistors to efficiently monitor muscle activities on the
forearm. Advanced signal processing and machine learning techniques will be used
to filter the data collected from multimodal sensor inputs to ensure robust
performance regardless of user conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
