This proposal is concerned with the development of a systematic approach to the
study of the analytic and geometric properties of random fields and stochastic
partial differential equations (SPDEs). Special emphasis is placed on Gaussian,
stable, and Levy random fields such as the Brownian sheet and additive Levy
processes, as well as the solutions of SPDEs that are driven by Gaussian or Levy
noises. The mentioned examples are random fields that arise naturally in various
areas of pure and applied mathematics, mathematical oceanography, stochastic
hydrology, geostatistics, and mathematical as well as statistical physics. The
proposed research plans to gather and develop probabilistic, analytic, and
geometric tools that will lead to a deeper understanding of the analysis and
geometry of various random fields. The Proposers believe that these tools will
have sufficient novelty to solve a number of long-standing open problems in the
theory of random fields, and also further promote their further applicability.

In their past investigations, the Proposers have developed potential theories
for additive Levy processes and the Brownian sheet, and used them to resolve
several outstanding open problems in the theory of Levy processes and the
analysis of the Brownian sheet. The Proposers have developed ideas, based in
geometric-measure theory, for investigating non-Markovian Gaussian and stable
random fields. And they have introduced renewal-theoretic techniques for the
asymptotic analysis of solutions to a large class of parabolic stochastic PDEs
driven by singular random noises. The Proposers plan to continue their
investigation of precise quantitative connections between random fields,
potential theory, stochastic PDEs, and the geometry of random fractals. And they
believe that further pursuit of these connections will ultimately yield novel
insights into the structure of random fields and related stochastic PDEs.
