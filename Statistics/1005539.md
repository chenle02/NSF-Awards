This research project is to reconstruct high-dimensional sparse signals based on
a small number of measurements, possibly corrupted by noise. More precisely,
four of the main objectives of the program are: 1) further weaken the conditions
and strengthen the results of current methods. The investigator aims to push the
boundary of the field by developing new theoretical tools to analyze the current
algorithms; 2) analyze the connections among different methods to get a deeper
understanding of the nature of sparse signal recovery problem; 3) extend the
research to multichannel setup which involves simultaneously recovery of a set
of signals; 4) develop courses for both graduate student and undergraduate
student. Build research projects for graduate students. Make the undergraduate
students at least be aware of the possible limitation of classical methods and
suitable alternatives.

Due to advances in science and technology, scientists and engineers are now able
to collect and process enormously large data sets of all kinds. Such data sets
pose many statistical challenges not encountered in smaller scale studies. One
of the key problems in this area is the reconstructing of high-dimensional
sparse signals, which is a fundamental problem in signal processing. This and
other related problems have attracted much interest in a number of fields
including applied mathematics, electrical engineering, statistics, finance, and
bioinformatics. The proposed research will benefit applications in these
scientific areas, for instance the compression of audio, images, and video
signals and the analysis of microarray data. It is also of critical importance
in linear regression, signal modeling, and machine learning.
