In view of the rapidly growing applications of ultrasound and optics (lasers in
particular) in research, industry, and medicine, it is imperative to give
students some hands-on experience with these techniques. Ultrasonic and optical
waves are alike in the sense that they both belong to wave-related phenomena.
This project funds the purchase of the equipment necessary to develop a modern
undergraduate laboratory in wave-related phenomena, which can eventually replace
obsolete equipment in the Mechanics and Optics Laboratory. In this laboratory,
four novel experiments that cover basic linear and nonlinear wave phenomena are
taught. They are (1) interaction between light and sound; (2) ultrasonic Doppler
effect used in medicine; (3) radiation force and optical tweezers; and (4) chaos
and solitons. The primary purpose of these experiments is to teach students
physical principles. Students also learn how to apply these principles to
challenges in real life. Additionally, students have the opportunity to learn
computerized data-acquisition and analysis techniques, which are essential for
success in the present-day workforce.
