Recent wearable biosensors are built on flat, rigid films. The boundary of these
biosensors causes an inflammatory response and inaccurate measurements that
challenges long-term use and reliability. This proposal aims to develop a soft,
bio-integrated monitoring system that recapitulates the properties of native
tissue. The flexible, stretchable, porous, and fiber-based biosensors will be
designed and validated to critical biomarker concentrations in real time. The
educational aspects of the project will focus on creating science-based toys to
understand biomedical engineering fundamentals with inexpensive materials. These
will be coupled with new educational modules. Undergraduate students and local
teachers will help design, test, and disseminate the educational
materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The polymeric substrates of conventional
wearable biosensors impede free mass transfer, create shear stress, cause
artificial accumulation or depletion of biomarkers, and block heat dissipation,
which is a significant challenge in chronic biomedical analysis. This CAREER
project aims to advance soft bioelectronics on the artificial extracellular
matrix (e-ECM) substrates that consist of an ultrathin, nanofibrous stretchable
platform. The proposed e-ECM biosensors can monitor ions, metabolites, biogases,
and cytokines for in situ, real-time monitoring under mechanically and
chemically hyperdynamic conditions. If successful, this project will achieve new
design rules for sustainable and reliable sensing systems for long-term
biomedical sensing. The educational objective of the project is cultivating a
STEM identity for elementary students through remote-learning biomedical
engineering crafting programs emphasizing biomedical devices using fidget toys.
The approach relies on developing online hands-on project modules with
accessible and affordable materials, having the modules assessed by educational
workshops with local STEM teachers, and disseminating the programs to local and
global communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
