X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) is a new experimental technique with
tremendous potential for site-specific characterization of metals in clusters
and complex proteins. Dr. Cramer proposes to conduct the first-ever XMCD
measurements on carefully selected paramagnetic transition metal complexes, and
to compare the experimental results with recently developed theoretical
simulation programs. XMCD experiments will then be conducted on small proteins
with known metal sites, and the results compared with data from other methods
such as Mossbauer and EPR. With the experimental and theoretical basis of XMCD
established, he will apply the technique to magnetic and structural questions
about metal centers in the metalloenzymes nitrogenase, hydrogenase, and
photosystem II. To conduct these experiments, he will employ circularly-
polarized soft x-rays emitted as synchrotron radiation from electron storage
rings such as the National Synchrotron Light Source. Samples will be placed in
the strong magnetic field of a superconducting magnet. Photoabsorption will be
measured directly by the transmission method on thin films, and indirectly using
sample photocurrent or fluorescence detection techniques. Site-specific
characterization of metals in nitrogenase, hydrogenase, and photosystem II will
allow better understanding and synthetic modelling of their important catalytic
activities. The development of this new technique will also provide the
bioinorganic community with a new tool for magnetic and site- specific
characterization, and the XMCD techniques will be generally applicable to nearly
all paramagnetic transition metal complexes.
