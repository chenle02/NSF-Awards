Austin-Smith SBR 9510877 Despite extensive research devoted to the study of
collective decision making, relatively little is known about the decision making
under conditions of uncertainty. In a world in which decision makers have the
same fundamental preferences but operate in a situation where information is
scarce and unequally shared, group members may disagree with respect to the
available alternatives as a result of informational asymetries. Under such
conditions, the Condorcet Jury Theorem concludes: majorities are more likely to
select the "correct" alternative than any single individual when there is
uncertainty about which alternative is in fact the best. This proposal seeks
funding to investigate the properties of the Condorcet Jury Theorem. It will
develop a theory of collective decision making under a judgment-based model of
democracy. Game theoretic analyses will help inform the strategic considerations
under which the impact of the jury theorem can be assessed. The crucial role
played by information aggregation in conditions of uncertainty will be
highlighted.
