This is continuing work on cross-linguistic generalizations and principles of
historical syntactic change based on research in three Eurasian language
families: Finno-Ugric, Indo-European, and Caucasian; and three Mesoamerican
families: Mayan, Uto- Aztecan, and Mixe-Zoquean. Specific goals are 1)
characterization of syntactic evolution (mechanisms of change, implementation of
change, concomitant change in other parts of the grammar), 2) statement of
formal constraints on syntactic change, 3) determination of what sort of
syntactic changes are possible, 4) explanation of change, and 5) relation of the
current work to various competing theories of grammar. This project has already
generated nearly a dozen publications and an even larger number of public
presentations, and the investigators are now at work on a major volume which
will contain a comprehensive treatment of diachronic syntactic change. This work
will meet a basic need in linguistics, where there is only one other treatment
of the topic, published six years ago and of more limited scope. Both
investigators are accorded profound respect from their colleagues, in particular
for the clarity of their presentation of data and of their argumentation.
