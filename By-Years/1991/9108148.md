This project is concerned with research in algebra and number theory. One of
the principal investigators will work on the computation of Galois groups and
K-admissibility questions. He also expects to work on some related questions
concerning group characters. The other principal investigator will work on Lie
algebras of prime characteristic. In addition to sharpening his results on
realizations of generalized Witt and contact algebras, he plans to study other
algebras of Cartan type. Structural questions are a second part of his program.
The research supported by this award spans a variety of topics in algebra and
number theory. The results have implications for many different areas of
mathematics and physics.
