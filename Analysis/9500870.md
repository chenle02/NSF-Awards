9500870 Cowen The investigator proposes to study the structure of bounded linear
operators on the Hardy and Bergman Hilbert spaces and related problems of matrix
theory, approaching problems on concretely presented operators and their
applications in order to gain insight into more general problems. In particular,
he will continue his investigations of composition operators, slant Toeplitz
operators, and related problems from matrix analysis. The project will also
involve the direction of research of several undergraduate students in matrix
analysis and its applications to some engineering problems with the goal of
attracting young people to graduate study and research in mathematics. In this
project, the investigator and his graduate students will work on several
fundamental questions about composition operators on Bergman and Hardy spaces
including investigation into the explanations for unexpected circular symmetry
in most composition operators and seeking ways to break operators into simpler
components when the symbol is a function of several variables with special
structure. Further, the investigator and his graduate students will investigate
the spectral theory of slant Toeplitz operators, a class of weighted composition
operators with applications to smoothness criteria for wavelets. These projects
will use tools from the theory of operators on Hilbert space and the theory of
analytic functions in one and several variables and will build on the
investigator's experience in the study of Toeplitz operators and composition
operators. ***
