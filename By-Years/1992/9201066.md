Social structure functions to assign people to specific positions that have
differential levels of prestige and power associated with them. Persons'
perceptions have been studied in laboratory experiments and found to vary
according to the differential prestige and power they hold as members of
positions in specific social structures. This doctoral dissertation project will
study the extent to which perceptions vary with position within the context of a
currently existing and ongoing social structure. Data will be collected from
individuals at all levels of the organizational structure of the Jobs
Opportunities and Basic Skills program in Indiana by conducting personal
interviews or by means of mail questionnaires. This project will contribute to
an important area of interface between social psychology and sociology; namely,
perceptions and social position. It will provide a test of theory on
differential perceptions of people in varying positions within the context of
real-life social positions of prestige and power. It also will provide an
excellent opportunity for a promising young scholar to continue to develop
independent research skills.
