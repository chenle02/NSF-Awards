Professor Zhang will study the double cover conjecture together with related
problems. These include cycle cover problems and the integer flow problems for
families of graphs containing no subdivisions of the Peterson Graph. Graph
Theory go back perhaps two hundred years, but only in the last half-century has
the field become an active, fertile, and flourishing branch of mathematics. A
graph is a network of lines ("edges") joining points ("vertices"), thus the
language of graphs becomes a natural way of describing interrelationships among
separated objects. Graph Theory figures most prominently as an essential tool in
Communications Theory and Computer Science.
