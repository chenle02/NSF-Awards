Understanding the atmospheric boundary layer and the effect it has on cloud
growth is a fundamental meteorological problem that is important to a broad
range of atmospheric questions ranging from venting of pollutants to the free
atmosphere to the effect of cloud cover on climate. Observations (especially
those from meteorological satellites) have clearly shown that clouds can form in
distinctive and very organized patterns over expansive areas. For several years
Dr. Agee has investigated well-organized mesoscale convective cloud patterns
which result from the thermally-driven convective boundary layer over both land
and water. The principal investigator will continue his work in this area using
previously collected observational data, numerical models and theoretical
studies to establish criteria for determining the onset, causative mechanisms
and morphological characteristics of convection and to continue development of
an observational classification system for thermal atmospheric convection.
