This proposal, "Mono-Ion Research IV: Penning Trap Mass Spectrometer" is for the
development of the world's most precise and accurate mass spectrometer. Using
only rf methods for observing the normal mode frequencies of a single isolated
ion, bound to a small electromagnetic cage called a Penning trap, it has become
possible to measure masses of low mass-to-charge ions relative to a highly-
charged carbon ion with a precision that now exceeds five parts in 1010 for a
single day's run. The fundamental goal of such a high precision instrument is to
increase the consistency and accuracy of the fundamental constants of nature.
The immediate objectives will involve: using the accurate mass measurements to
"weigh" chemical bonds, electron ionization energies, and nuclear excitation
energies; improve the measurement accuracy of the electron's atomic mass by an
order of magnitude; measure light-ion masses to one part in 1010 or higher
accuracy and determine neutron separation energies of selected light ions by
measuring consecutive isotopes of the given element; and refine the measurement
of the tritium--helium-3 mass difference to an accuracy of 0.3 eV.
