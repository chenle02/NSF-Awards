The increasing resistance of pest insects to convenional insecticides and
public concern about environmental contamination mandate the search for
effective and safe pest control methods. One hope for the future depends on
designing new selective methods of insect control by exploration and
exploitation of those biochemical and physiological processes which are unique
to insects. In an effort toward this goal Dr. Giebultowicz is studying
physiological processes which, when disrupted, cause sterility in male moths.
She has discovered and investigated the rhythms of sperm release from the testis
and rhythmic secretory activity in the reproductive tract of the gypsy moth.
These rhythms are necessary for post- testicular sperm maturation and their
disruption results in sterile insect males. Timing of sperm release is
controlled by a biological "clock" located in the testis and that rhythmic sperm
release persists in testis cultured in vitro. This finding provide a unique
opportunity to identify and study molecular correlates of the rythms associated
with sperm maturation. Proteins involved in the circadian rhythm of sperm
release will be characterize by electrophoretic protein separation, generation
of antisera and subsequent investigation of the role of specific proteins in the
rhythmic sperm release. Separation and purification of proteins would provide a
first step toward resolving molecular basis for biological clock controlling
rhythmic release of sperm in insects. Partial sequencing of selected proteins
and synthesis of specific peptides might lead to the isolation and
identification of genes involved in the mechanism controlling sperm release. In
future, she plans to clone such genes and to attempt introducing them into
insects using pest-specific baculoviruses which are harmless to other living
organisms. In this way sperm release could be disrupted and pest moths in the
field would become sterile.//
