Dr. Thomas Stephenson is supported by a grant from The Experimental Physical
Chemistry Program to study the spectroscopy and dynamics of van der Waals
complexes formed from rare gases and halogen diatomics. The method to be used in
these studies, called optical-optical double resonance spectroscopy, is capable
of providing detailed information on the nature of rotational and vibrational
energy transfer in these systems. Such studies provide fundamental information
on weak intermolecular bonding forces. Two sets of complementrary experiments
will investigate the role of rotational degrees of freedom in the dynamics of
rare gas/halogen systems using optical-optical double resonance spectroscopy.
The first set of experiments will explore the rotational energy distributions
resulting from vibrational predissociation of complexes involving neon with
mixed halogens such as iodine chloride and bromine chloride. These so-called
"half-collision" experiments provide detailed quantum state distribution
information on dissociation products. The second set of experiments involve
state-to-state dynamics of collisions between rare gas atoms and bromine
molecules. The energy transfer for this collision process will be studied as a
function of electronic state of the bromine molecule.
