This is a proposal to perform a thorough study on lava flows from two important
intra-plate volcanic chains: Samoa and Guadalupe. Those localities were selected
because they have extraordinary Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic compositions, suggesting they
retain an unusually recognizable record of the processes responsible for mantle
heterogeneity. Limited analyses demonstrate that these two localities are
equally distinctive wit respect to helium: Samoa and Guadalupe have,
respectively the highest and the lowest 3He/3He ratios found in mantle derived
rocks. Excellent samples from both Samoa and Guadalupe have been obtained
specifically for this work. In collaboration with several other investigators,
the most important of these will be thoroughly studied. This includes
petrographic and petrologic characterization, measurements of Sr, Nd, Pb, and He
isotopes, and a limited number of Ar age determinations. The proposed work is
new because it involves a very complete study of He systematics on well-
controlled samples.
