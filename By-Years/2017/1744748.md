This award funds Student Travel Fellowships for US students attending a workshop
on the intersection of Security and Privacy with Computer Vision at the IEEE
Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR). It helps cover the
travel expenses and conference registration fees for these students, making it
possible for them to attend the workshop and the conference, and to discuss
their work or recent advances in the field with other attendees of the workshop
or conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop brings together privacy,
security and computer vision experts to discuss how to better understand the
potential threats of computer vision to people's security and privacy, as well
as the potential opportunities and applications for enhancing them. The workshop
also helps spark interest among young researchers in the important emerging
intersection between privacy and security and computer vision.
