The Iowa State University Herbarium has recently acquired the mycological
herbarium of the University of Iowa, which formerly occupied nearly 30 standard
herbarium cases at that institution. This historically important collection
contains specimens collected throughout the Western hemisphere by such well-
known mycologists as T. H. Macbride, B. Shimek, G. W. Martin and A. P. Morgan.
The collection is also rich in type specimens. This project will provide funds
to integrate the University of Iowa specimens into the Iowa State herbarium. In
order to make the specimens accessible for use, they will be repacketed, the
labels replaced, the numerous types verified and segregated, and the collection
properly stored.
