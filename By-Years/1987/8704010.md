This proposal provides an improved computational environment for
supercomputers. Such tools for supercomputers help scientists and engineers
create better models for a large number of complex problems. One such tool
called CLAM has already been demonstrated as a useful product and phase II of
this proposal implements CLAM on Cray X/MPs, one of the fastest machines yet
available. The whole idea behind CLAM is to automate a number of important
computer facilities so that a scientist code is optimized and the programmer's
time has been shortened.
