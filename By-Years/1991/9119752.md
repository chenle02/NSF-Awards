In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division,
Professor Michael Bowers of the University of California, Santa Barbara, will
study the structure, energetics, and reaction mechanisms of organometallic and
cluster ionic systems. Metal-ligand bond strengths will be obtained as well as
photodissociation dynamics data. The newly developed techniques of Ion
Structural Chromatography and Electronic State Chromatography will also be used
to obtain structural and bond-energy information. %%% Ion-molecule reactions are
known to be important in defining the composition of the outer part of the
earth's atmosphere as well as in controlling the chemistry of interstellar
clouds, flames, plasmas, and discharges. An investigation of the processes
involved in ion-molecule interactions may also be important for understanding
cluster formation in gaseous or condensed phases. This project will study a
variety of structural and dynamical processes which will aid in a fundamental
understanding of many of these phenomena.
