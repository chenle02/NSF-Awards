This project is designed to understand the important connections that occur
among different parts of the aquatic ecosystem including those from uplands to
the riparian zone, from the riparian zone to surface waters, from streams to
lakes, and from lakes to their outlets. Twelve scientists from seven
institutions have collaborated for 20 years on this research; this project will
continue long-term studies and experiments on the arctic aquatic environment.
Some of these long-term experiments will be continued and combined with surveys,
detailed process studies, and modeling to answer major questions about the
linkages among ecosystems. The products of the research will be incorporated
into several models including a hydrology-plant-soil model, a stream nitrogen
model, a lake process model, and a fish energetics model. Through these models
the present synthetic view of these aquatic ecosystems will be formalized;
modeling will also aid in identification of research gaps and prediction of
effects of perturbations. This research is especially relevant for the
fundamental understanding of all aquatic systems because the systems studied are
among the last pristine aquatic systems, they have relatively simple food webs
that are amenable to experimentation, and they exist in extreme environments
that require special adaptations by the organisms that inhabit them.
