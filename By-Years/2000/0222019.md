The 2002 GONG Meeting and the 12th SOHO Workshop will be held jointly, October
27-31, 2002, at Big Bear Lake, California. This workshop will focus on the study
of the interior of the sun from a seismic perspective and also the prospects for
similar study of other solar-like stars. It will also provide an unique
opportunity to invite the scientific community to pause and reflect on the
status of this fertile field of study, just past the first solar maximum since
the deployment of the GONG network and the successful operation of SOHO.
Significant time will be devoted to working group sessions, where outstanding,
unresolved or controversial issues will be discussed.
