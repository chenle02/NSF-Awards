9422701 Weymouth This award is made in support of the NSF initiative ENG-CISE-
IITA94, National Challenges. It is a joint initiative between the Engineering
Directorate and the Computer Information and Engineering Directorate. A
collaborative test bed will be developed to support consultations between
geographically distributed primary care pnysician and radiologic specialists and
sub-specialists in tertiary care hospitals. The focus will be on the design,
implementation, and the evaluation of a prototype system for synchronous and
asynchronous viewing of medical images over a distance. This project will
simultaneously address three research issues: adaptation of conventional medical
dianostic practice to remote collaborative technology; creation of a toolkit of
computer applications to facilitate adaption of these practices; and assessment
of the impact of remote collaborative technology on medical diagnostic practice.
These three aspects of the study reinforce each other through the use of rapid
prototyping strategy. A working system will be delivered to physician users
early in the project and then maintianed on a frequent cycle of user feedback,
responsive redesign, and systematic evaluation. To be successful, rapid
prototyping approach requires the ability to correctly determine initial user
needs, the ability to quickly evolve technology to meet these requirements, and
continuously monitor whether deployed technology is satisfactory. Therefore,
this project team will be multi-disciplinary, encompassing physicians who will
ofer expert input into the design and development process, computer scientists
familiar with user-oriented aplplication development, and social scientists
trained in the assessment of the impact of technology on work practices and
routines.
