This research is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of mass spectrometry. The goal of this project is to assess and
identify factors which affect the sensitivity of matrix-assisted desorption
ionization (DI) mass spectrometry. The objective is to learn how to tailor
matrix properties to obtain optimum sensitivity for a given sample. Particular
emphasis will be placed on understanding the role of water as a co-solvent in
flow-fast atom bombardment (flow-FAB) measurements. The importance of the
primary atom beam characteristics (flux, mass, and energy) in FAB measurements
will also be assessed. This research is designed to better understand how the
sample composition affects the ionization of specific components. This
information can be used to design specific sample compositions which will permit
components to be determined at lower concentrations.
