The overall objective of this project is the creation of a framework for the
planning of complex tasks (involving temporal and spatial hand-object
relationships) in dexterous manipulation. The hand-object interaction will be
exploited to direct a goal oriented manipulation strategy which can produce the
functionality required for a general purpose manipulation system. The proposed
approach provides an effective integration of the hand and the object. It
recognizes the independent nature of the forces that the object`s surface may
transmit, and the manipulator`s ability to generate those forces. The proposed
control architecture is based on Minsky`s Society of Mind paradigm. The
manipulation problem is decomposed so that discrete "agents" can plan the
optimal placement of finger contacts on an object. The goals of the different
agents are rationalized at a higher level so that a coherent hand strategy is
achieved. Although this architecture can, in principle, be applied to any
dexterous hand, the Utah/MIT hand has been specifically targeted for
experimentation.
