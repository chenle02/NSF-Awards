A novel approach has been proposed to obtain closures for the Reynolds stress
(i.e., hydrodynamic dispersion) and the interphase drag force terms for
moderate-to-high Reynolds number flow in packed-sphere beds. The approach is to
obtain closures based on a judicial application of the method of matched
asymptotic expansions for flow over a simple geometry (which is a sphere in this
case) at different flow regimes. The inner solution will be used to evaluate the
interphase drag force while the outer solution will be used to evaluate the
Reynolds stress terms. With this approach, explicit expressions for these terms
as an asymptotic series of the Reynolds number can be obtained. The adjustable
constants in the asymptotic series, which will take into consideration the
effect of the interaction of spheres, will be determined by a comparison of
theory and experiments on pressure drop data. The success of this research may
open new avenues of research for fracture media flow in petroleum and geothermal
reservoirs, as well as for flow over rod bundles in nuclear reactors.
