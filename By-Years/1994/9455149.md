This project is to engage undergraduate faculty in a set of activities that will
prepare them to teach courses or course modules on ethical and professional
issues in computing. Twenty-five undergraduate faculty from a diversity of
disciplines and types of institutions are participants. They are required to do
pre-workshop assignments; attend a 5-day workshop during the summer, participate
in an on-line forum, and attend a two day follow-up meeting in February. The
activities are designed to address pedagogical issues as well as subject matter.
The subject matter topics to be covered include proprietary rights in computer
software, privacy, responsibility and liability, hacking, risk and reliability,
democracy, access, and autonomy, and professional ethics for computer
professionals. The project responds to the growing need for faculty trained in
this area as the accreditation requirements in computer science and engineering
recommend coverage of "social, ethical, and professional issues in computing."
