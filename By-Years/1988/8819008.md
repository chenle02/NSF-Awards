Biopolymers serve as physical barriers of plants and protect them from adverse
environmental factors including pathogens. Two biopolymers, cutin and suberin,
are being investigated by chemical and 13C- NMR methods during plant
development. The biosynthesis of these natural products is being studied using
enzymology and recombinant DNA approaches. The regulation of the enzyme cutinase
is being studied at the gene level by fungal transformation and deletion
analysis. The enzymes that degrade pectin will also be similarly studied and
their role in fungal pathogenesis will be studied by gene disruption. This
project provides basic information on the biochemistry and function of the
defensive barriers of plants. This information is needed to devise ways to
improve plant protection and production.***//
