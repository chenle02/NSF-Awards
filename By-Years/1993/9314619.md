9314619 Lomax This is a SGER (small grant for exploratory research) award to
obtain crucial preliminary data for the future investigation on the mechanisms
of interaction between the two plant hormones, auxin and cytokinin. Auxin and
cytokinin are two of the most important plant hormones. They are integrally
involved in most steps in plant growth and development. There is a long history
of research in this area, however, as yet we know nothing about how the two
hormones interact with each other, how the ratio of the two is measured by the
plant, and surprisingly little about the mode of action of either hormone.
Recently, Dr. Lomax has discovered that a mutant of tomato, the diageotropica
(dgt) mutant which is insensitive to auxin, has elevated cytokinin levels as
compared to wild type plants. Dr. Lomax hypothesizes that elevated cytokinin
levels produce phenotypic effects which mimic an auxin-insensitive phenotype.
She proposes that expanded studies on the biosynthesis and metabolism of
cytokinin and the regulation of auxin responses in dtg may yield significant new
insight into the interactions of these two important hormones. This is an
exploratory research into an important subject which has not been amenable to
more conventional approaches. It is expected that if successful, the results of
this study may provide an emerging opportunity to determine the mode of action
for both auxin and cytokinin. ***
