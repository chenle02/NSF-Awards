This connection to NSFNET improves the instruction and research capabilities of
essentially every department on the Middlebury College campus. Typical
applications include the exchange of two-dimensional images among members of an
undergraduate astronomy consortium; interactive login by upper- level computer
science students on a parallel processing machine; and improved access to
databases such as MEDLINE, Chemical Abstracts and the MLA International
Bibliography. Further, Middlebury's specialized library collections, such as
that at the Institute for Northern Studies, is now available to off-campus
scholars. The connection aids Middlebury's recruiting of the high- caliber
faculty they need to maintain and improve their academic programs. The link is a
critical resource for research and instruction.
