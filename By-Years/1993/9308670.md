9308670 Martin The specific aims of this proposal are to test and to further
refine an emerging structural model for promoter recognition and to extend that
model to include mechanistic detail regarding the early stages of transcription.
The incorporation of functional group substitutions in the protein allow
detailed probing of critical protein-DNA interactions in 3 areas of the
promoter: a proposed duplex recognition domain upstream, a single stranded
region near the start site, and the poorly understood transition region in
between. A variety of approaches will be applied to this system to complement
well-established kinetic studies and to provide a better understanding of the
chemical nature of specific interactions. Titration microcalorimetry will be
developed to probe protein - DNA binding interactions in more detail. Specific
chemical incorporation of nonperturbing photoactivatable nucleotides into
promoter DNA will provide much needed direction to further protein mutagenesis
studies. %%%% The goal of this research is to understand the enzymology of
transcription, including the chemical basis of transcript initiation. The T7
family of RNA polymerses present an ideal model system in which to study not
only the fundamental aspects of sequence-specific macromolecular interactions,
but also the basic mechanisms of polymerases. The effects of simple chemical
modifications in the DNA and the protein will be determined, in order to refine
our understanding of the recognition interface. ****
