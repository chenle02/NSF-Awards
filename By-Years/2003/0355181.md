This award provides support to investigate the internal structure and dynamics
of the proton and neutron, and of the lightest nuclei in nature: deuterium and
helium. The investigation will be based on experimental studies of high-energy
electrons scattering off hydrogen, deuterium, tritium and helium nuclei. The
proposed research will use the high-intensity, high-energy electron beam of the
Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility to bombard nuclei in cryogenic
target environments and to study the nuclear reaction products with particle
detection devices using superconducting magnets and subatomic particle
detectors. The results are expected to provide fundamental information on the
distributions of the three quarks inside the proton and neutron, on the quantum
mechanical wave functions of deuterium and helium, and on the mechanism of the
interaction of the proton and neutron constituents of these two light nuclei.
The expected experimental data from the proposed investigation will offer
valuable input to our understanding of the structure of the proton and neutron
in terms of their three quark constituents and to the establishment of a
consistent modern theory describing the simplest nuclear systems.
