This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial biology for
FY2004. The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of
protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are
not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides
opportunities for recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in
microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of
established scientists, and to broaden their scientific horizons beyond the
research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These
fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their
research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves
of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign
locations.

The research and training plan is entitled "Elucidation of phosphonic acid
biosynthetic pathways in Streptomycetes." The proposed research is a combination
of genetic and biochemical approaches to identify and characterize the
biosynthetic pathways of phosphonic acid natural products produced by
Streptomyces species. The techniques developed during this work are being
applied to the identification of novel biologically produced phosphonic acids.
The training goals are to learn techniques for both the cultivation and the
genetic manipulation of Streptomyces species and related Actinomycetes.
