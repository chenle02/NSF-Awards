This award supports the renewal of the Research Experiences for Undergraduates
(REU) site in Physics at Indiana University. The site will support ten
participants for ten weeks to carry out experimental and theoretical research
projects in a broad range of areas in the IU Physics Department and the IU
Center for Exploration of Energy and Matter (CEEM). Research topics in a wide
range of projects will be available, including experimental and theoretical
research in accelerator physics, biophysics, condensed matter physics,
elementary particle physics, materials physics, medical physics, and nuclear
physics. Special programs for the students include orientation sessions, weekly
seminars on current research in physics, discussions on professional development
and scientific ethics, and progress presentations. At the conclusion of the
program, the students will present their results in talks at a closing symposium
and develop a way to share their results to a technical audience. They will also
be encouraged and supported to present their work at professional meetings in
the following academic year.
