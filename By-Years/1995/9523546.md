9523546 Altan This award supports the, October 10-11, 1995, "Advanced Technology
for Die and Mold Manufacturing Conference" in Columbus, OH. It will be co-
sponsored by the NSF Engineering Research Center for Net Shape Manufacture. It
has the moral support of the International Institution for Production Research
(CIRP), and Modern Machine Shop Magazine. Several international speakers on die
and mold manufacturing technologies from Europe and Asia are CIRP members and
their travel will be supported by this grant. Modern Machine Shop Magazine will
promote the conference in its monthly publication. Rapid and accurate die and
mold making is a key to agile manufacturing and competitiveness, with many
significant research opportunities such as: representation of contoured mold
designs, machine tools with the controls and equipment to produce the designs,
innovative finishing and surface treatment, and design and simulation
applications that incorporate The thermo-mechanical models of the processes that
use this type of tooling.. This conference provides a unique opportunity for the
research community to focus on this technical problem and interact directly with
the down stream users of the research developments. ***
