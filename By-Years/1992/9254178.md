Lehman College plans to address the problem of poor student preparation and the
alienation of incoming students from mathematics and science by converting, as a
model, one section of 45 to 50 students in the present core sequence required of
incoming students (quantitative reasoning and natural sciences) to a two-
semester combined mathematics-science course based on the inquiry-discovery
method. A series of laboratory experiences will be developed in which the
students are given tasks requiring higher-level thinking, but are not given
explicit directions as to how to do them. The method requires the students to
work in small groups with a tutor. The tutors will be science education students
taking a specially-designed advanced education course in which they will learn
the scientific concepts and develop experience with the inquiry/discovery method
of learning.
