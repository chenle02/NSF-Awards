Multidisciplinary research in the Middle Awash, Ethiopia, is revealing important
new dimensions of human origins and evolution. This funding supports
paleontologists, geologists, and geochronologists. These project scientists are
coordinating their efforts to reconstruct environments and to document physical,
biological, and technological change in Africa over the last six million years.
Data on topics as diverse as global climatic change (revealed by connections
with adjacent deep-sea drill cores from the Arabian Sea and Gulf of Aden), the
paleohabitats of the earliest hominids (revealed by isotopic studies, fossil
pollen, and micromammals), and the geological evolution of the Horn of Africa
(revealed by stratigraphic and geochronological work on the volcanic rocks
interbedded with the fossiliferous sediments) will be generated by the project.
Research targets include the oldest hominid-bearing sediments in Africa, at
Aramis, Sagantole, and Kuseralee Dora. The team will excavate sediments of the
Central Awash Complex in an effort to recover human ancestor remains from
between volcanic rocks dated to 4.4 and 5.2 myr. Reconnaissance of the western
margin of the study area has revealed even older sediments. A major effort will
be made to date these rocks radiometrically, and to extract faunal remains from
them, including even older hominid fossils that should approach, and possibly
predate, the human/ape divergence. The research project has established that the
Miocene and Pliocene sediments of the Middle Awash are the most important in the
world for revealing the earliest stages of the human career. The hominid fossils
already recovered there are over twice as old as those from the bottom of
Olduvai Gorge, and over a million years older than Lucy. The proposed three
years of research will gather comprehensive paleontological data sets for these
areas from precisely controlled spatial, temporal, and environmental contexts.
This research will open new windows on the deep past.
