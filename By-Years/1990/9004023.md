This award provides one-half of the funding needed to upgrade an X-ray
diffractometer used by the Department of Geology at the University of Illinois.
The University is committed to providing the remaining funds needed. The
improved x-ray diffraction system will be used by several research programs that
need to identify the mineralogy of sedimentary rocks, which typically exhibit
X-ray diffraction patterns with numerous and broad overlapping peaks. The
instrument upgrade includes incident beam slits for better resolution and the
automation hardware and software for diffraction profile fitting procedures
(Rietveld refinement) that will allow accurate determination of diffraction peak
intensities, positions and shapes. Current projects that will make immediate use
of the improved capabilities include research on the origin of coal, carbonate
diagenesis, paleoceanography, and the mechanism of mineral-water interactions.
