This award by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
supports research by Professor Jack R. Norton in the Department of Chemistry at
Columbia University to facilitate the synthesis and manufacture of compounds of
interest to the pharmaceutical industry. The rates at which zirconaziridine
enantiomers interconvert will be measured and reactions of metallaaziridines
with epoxides and aziridines will be developed. In addition, the one-electron
chemistry of alkyl complexes similar to those that serve as precursors for
olefin polymerization catalysts will be investigated. The electrochemistry of
boranes and related alumoxanes will be explored in order to determine whether
single-electron transfer is involved in catalyst activation by these compounds.
The effects of small amounts of reducing agents on catalytic olefin
polymerization will be determined.

New reagents and methods will be developed to better understand and improve the
synthesis of pharmaceuticals and polymers.
