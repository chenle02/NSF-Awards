Recent work on the foundations of monetary economics has emphasized the
conceptual weakness of traditional treatments of money in macroeconomic theory,
but has not done much to correct those weaknesses. Until they are corrected, the
important critical contribution of the rational expectations revolution will not
have provided us with a satisfactory alternative with which to address major
issues concerning monetary policy. The goal of the proposed research is to
develop some new theories of monetary economics, by taking seriously the notion
that money is an object that helps to overcome frictions in the exchange
process; that is, money is a medium of exchange. Although the medium of exchange
role of money was emphasized by the classical economists, formal modelling of
this function has been elusive. The dominant paradigms in monetary economics
today,, including overlapping generations models and cash-in-advance models, do
not capture this function of money very well. While they have clearly proven to
be very useful in addressing many substantive issues in money and
macroeconomics, it is fair to say that these paradigms fail to provide an
endogenous explanation of how objects come to be used as media of exchange, and
therefore they are not able to address many fundamental issues of monetary
theory and policy. This project will develop a framework related to equilibrium
search and matching models. It will be used to explain the role of money
endogenously and explore theoretical and policy implications.
