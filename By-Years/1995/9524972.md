9524972 Sheng Machining processes that are energy-efficient and environmentally
conscious are both an ecological goal and a competitive advantage. This research
will develop an analytical approach and methodology for making the trade-offs
between the traditional manufacturing parameters of production rate, quality and
flexibility and the new paradigms of energy and waste minimization. The key
concepts in this research are: environmental indicators for characterizing
machining waste streams, second law thermodynamic concepts to indicate
manufacturing process efficiency, process models to assess operational
decisions, and the impact on the environment of component design and processing.
The research will be performed by an interdisciplinary team with expertise in
design, processes, thermodynamics, process planning, environmental evaluation,
and risk assessment. Active involvement and support by industry, and a plan for
the dissemination of the latest results on the World-Wide Web will ensure
transfer of research results. The immediate impact of this research will be on
the discrete parts manufacturing industries, providing the planning and design
tools to be competitive in global markets. ***
