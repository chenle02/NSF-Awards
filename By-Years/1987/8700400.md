The proposed studies deal with the neurobiological role of the gonadal steroids
in the differentiation and development of the rodent cerebral cortex. Using
primarily a tissue culture approach, the experiments are designed to define
ontogenetic aspects of the cortical estrogen receptor and to characterize the
importance of receptor/estrogen interactions for the normal development of both
the receptor and the receptor.containing cells. Dr. Toran.Allerand will examine:
(1) the effects of estrogen on defined cell populations (neurons and neuroglia),
and (2) estrogen regulation of genes encoding cytoskeletal proteins and the gene
products associated with neurite growth. The results of this research will yield
important new information on the neurobiological role of cortical estrogen
receptors. The planned experiments offer a novel approach to a better
understanding of the epigenetic influences which normally modulate cerebral
cortical development, with relevance for the genesis of congenital disorders of
neural development.
