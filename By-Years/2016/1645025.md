This CISE Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site award renews an
exemplary REU site at the University of South Florida. The site includes a
strong research component combined with professional development opportunities
for the participating undergraduate students from across the nation. Students
will have the opportunity to explore research topics related to ubiquitous
sensing, which includes current topics such as fixed and mobile sensing
networks, location-based services, participatory sensing, and human-centric
sensing applications. Students will learn to use a variety of techniques
including visualization and data processing techniques and algorithm development
to visualize large amounts of data and track movements of people in real time.
This site also will also explore operation of the site, including its research
and professional development opportunities in a foreign country, Spain, to offer
students a global perspective to computing and the impact of their
work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The is project is led by an outstanding team offering
state-of-the art facilities and professional mentors to guide undergraduates in
explorations of problems related to ubiquitous sensing. Ubiquitous sensing is an
area of current interest that is well-suited to undergraduate research
productivity. Students will learn how to use current tools and techniques to
solve those problems that have direct impact on people, particularly in the area
of health care. The students will participate in research and professional
development activities all designed to achieve the goals of retaining and
graduating undergraduate students in computer science and engineering,
recruiting students from groups traditionally under-represented in computing
fields, and increasing recruitment of students into graduate programs.
