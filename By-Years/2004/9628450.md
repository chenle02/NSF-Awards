HRD - 9628450 Hernandez New Mexico State University This project proposes to
continue the operation of the RIMI Laboratory for Logic and Databases,
established in 1993 with support from RIMI funds (HRD 9353271). The laboratory
supports an environment where research activities in the areas of logic
programming and deductive databases can be carried out. Under the umbrella of
this laboratory research on theoretical and practical aspects of Query
Optimization and Parallel Logic Programming will be pursued. Query Optimization
deals with efficient processing of database queries. Research will be carried
out on devising techniques that may take data-dependencies into account to
transform a given database program into a more efficient one. Parallel Logic
Programming deals with implementation of systems that can exploit parallelism
from logic programs. A system based on Shared Paged Binding Arrays will be
developed on a multiprocessor to implicitly exploit or-parallelism and and-
parallelism present in logic programs. One of the principal objectives of this
laboratory is to attract, retain, and help minority graduate students to obtain
Master's and Ph.D.s in Computer Science. Enticing minorities to pursue graduate
studies, in particular Ph.D.s, is extremely difficult. However, we believe that
with our first-class research program and facilities, in which minority students
can participate and feel an integral part of, this can be readily accomplished,
as it has been demonstrated by our success under the current RIMI grant that
allowed us to initially establish the laboratory.
