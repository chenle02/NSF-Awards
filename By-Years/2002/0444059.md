AST 0206286&lt;br/&gt;Blandford&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is now considerable
evidence that at least eighty percent of the matter in the Universe is in a dark
form that cannot be seen directly, using astronomical telescopes. This dark
matter is found on scales spanning six decades, from the cores of galaxies to
the size of the Universe. One of the best ways to probe the distribution of this
dark matter is to use gravitational optics - the measurement of the small
deflections of light rays induced by the gravitational force from the dark
matter itself. By measuring these light deflections, we can infer the properties
of the dark matter. Over the past two decades, Dr. Blandford and his
collaborators have devised a suite of specialized techniques to detect dark
matter over this wide range, from cores of galaxies to scales up to 106 times
larger. This project will contribute to the development of several of these
techniques and will implement them in three cases where data already exists that
can be used for this purpose. These will be used to construct an integrated,
observationally based description of the distribution of dark matter in the
universe that can be used to compare with theoretical calculations.
