Professors Eric P. Grimsrud and Walter B. Knighton are funded by the Analytical
and Surface Chemistry program for work on drift tube reaction mass spectrometry.
The PI's seek to improve the performance of mass spectrometry for rapid trace
measurement of volatile components in the atmosphere. An effective strategy for
creating ions of trace components without saturating the mass spectrometer with
an oxygen or nitrogen gas signal is ionization with the hydronium cation in a
flow or drift tube before the mass spectrometer. In this proton transfer gas
phase reaction, most trace components can be selectively and quantitatively
ionized. However, the hydronium cation ion source is not without problems,
principally water cluster formation and excessive fragmentation of the trace
component. For these reasons, additional work is proposed on interrelated
instrument parameters of drift tube pressure, flow velocity, and pressure as
well as reaction rate studies for proton transfer from the hydronium ion to
various trace components. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drift tube reaction mass
spectrometry is a general technique by which the volatile organic compounds
present in ambient air or human breath can be directly determined in real time
without the time lag associated with more conventional methods of analysis.
Improved methods such as these are needed for applications ranging from medicine
to national security.&lt;br/&gt;
