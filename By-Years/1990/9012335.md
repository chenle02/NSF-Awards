This award will support a distinguished cultural anthropologist, who has
published widely on the ethno-ecology of the Philippines, in a study of the
local knowledge of Asian rice (Oryza Sativa). The investigator will record how
multiple and interlocking categorizations and evaluations of rice are structured
and how such cognitive and associated behavior patterns are employed in an
integrated fashion under varying environmental conditions. Aided by prior
linguistic and ethnoecological research, this project will examine in detail the
everyday as well as the extraordinary handling of rice both as biotic resource
and as cultural artifact. The investigator will consult with colleagues at the
International Rice institute on the long-term stability and change in rice germ
plasms. This research is important because rice is one of the world's great food
crops, and yet a detailed scientific study of the full range of knowledge and
practice associated in a culture with this crop has not been done. This case
will be a benchmark for comparative studies of the knowledge and uses of rice
and will help planners develop programs to maximize and sustain valuable
diversity.
