This grant is in the general field of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of surface chemical studies of oxidic materials. Professor J. H.
Lunsford will continue his studies of the transformation of methane to higher
hydrocarbons over oxidic catalysts. A major focus of this work will be on the
role of additives and promoters which affect the kinetics of methanation. In
particular, magnesium and sodium oxide catalysts will be studied. The role of
the surface oxide and peroxide constituents is examined in understanding the
rate limiting step in coupling of methyl radicals. Professor Lunsford's previous
work was considered ground breaking in the discovery of this key intermediate in
methanation. Spectroscopic probes (electron spin resonance and x-ray
photoelectron) of the surface oxide structure and composition will be used. A
new study of complex oxidic structures based on perovskites and solid solutions
of zirconium and calcium oxides will be initiated. These studies will help
develop novel catalysts for this important industrial process.
