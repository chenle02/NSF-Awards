The second annual joint Principal Investigators meeting for the Big Data program
and the Big Data Hubs and Spokes program provides updates to progress on
intellectual objectives and information sharing. The meeting will promote
interaction between the participants in these programs, facilitate
collaborations, expose students to the latest research, and situate the programs
within the larger big data ecosystem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting will be a
three-day meeting that includes one day dedicated to each program and a third
day shared between the two. The agenda includes breakouts, panel discussions,
lightning talks, and poster sessions to encourage intellectual engagement across
the programs, thus setting conditions for new projects and multi-disciplinary
activities. The meeting will produce a report that highlights outcomes for
broader dissemination and sharing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
