A new paradigm for dealing with the dynamics of totally constrained theories
like general relativity will continue to be developed both at a classical and
quantum level. The paradigm consists in constructing discrete theories such that
the continuum theory of interest arises as a well defined limit. The specific
proposal for constructing the discrete theories, called "uniform
discretizations" has several attractive features. In particular the discrete
theories are free of constraints and therefore avoid many of the hard conceptual
problems that complicate traditional quantum gravity, and nevertheless manage to
provide a well defined limit in which one recovers the continuum theory of
interest. A paradigm emerges that is analogous to that of lattice gauge theory,
where discrete theories are used in a limiting procedure to define a continuum
theory of interest. This approach has already been applied successfully in some
situations where the space-time has some spatial dependence (i.e. more
complicated than homogeneous cosmologies) but without genuine degrees of
freedom, most notably providing a characterization of the complete space-time of
a non-singular loop quantum gravity black hole. This NSF award will focus on
applying the paradigm in situations of increasing complexity. This includes the
collapse of scalar fields to form black holes and related models. It is also
proposed to further other topics related to the dynamics of quantum gravity like
the problem of time and the issue of measurement in quantum mechanics. This
research program also aids in the creation of human resources in US physics
through the training of a postdoctoral researcher and provides the possibility
that the discretization techniques introduced here may have applicability in
other areas of science and engineering as well.
