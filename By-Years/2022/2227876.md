Complexity Theory is the study of resources (time, memory, number of processors)
needed to execute computational tasks, whose main goal is to classify
computational problems as feasible (i.e., problems that can be solved
efficiently) or as infeasible (i.e., problems that cannot be solved
efficiently). Probabilistically Checkable Proofs is a sub-area of Complexity
Theory that extends this study to the realm of approximation problems and shows
that for many computational tasks, even coming up with an approximate solution
may be computationally infeasible. Nowadays, results from this area are also
used in real-life applications in non-centralized systems such as blockchains
and cryptocurrencies. The goal of this project is to further develop the theory
of Probabilistically Checkable Proofs and address new, as well as long-standing,
challenges in the area. The project combines various branches of computer
science and mathematics and may impact other scientific fields. The project's
activities include course development, mentoring, and workshop organization.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In more detail, this project focuses on studying
satisfiable constraint satisfaction problems. The class of constraint
satisfaction problems (CSPs in short) is one of the most fundamental classes of
problems in complexity theory. An instance of a problem consists of a collection
of undetermined variables, as well as a collection of constraints imposed on
them; the goal is to find an assignment to the variables that satisfies as many
of the constraints as possible. What is the best, most efficient approximation
algorithm to this problem, provided that a solution that satisfies all of the
constraints exists? This project is driven by this meta question, aiming to
create new tools as well as form new connections with other mathematical
areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
