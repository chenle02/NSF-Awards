Actin, a major cellular protein, plays a key role in motion and force generation
in muscle and non-muscle cells. The regulation of actin's diverse cellular
functions involves specific interactions with many actin-binding proteins. These
interactions depend on the equilibration of actin monomers (G-actin) and
filaments (F-actin) among different conformational states. The objective of this
research is to understand the dynamics and structural states of actin and their
role in the actin-based processes. The specific aims of this project include:
(i) mapping the intermolecular interfaces in F-actin and the dynamic changes at
these interfaces; (ii) elucidating the functional role of the interface
dynamics; (iii) determining the structural basis of F-actin severing by cofilin,
a major cellular actin remodeling protein; and (iv) testing the model of the
ADP/ATP dependent switch between the open and closed nucleotide cleft
conformations of the actin monomer. Investigations of the functional role of
interface dynamics will include measurements of: (i) interface perturbation by
actin binding proteins, and (ii) assays of changes in motion generation with
myosin and in the interaction with other proteins due to cross-linking
constraints on the interface dynamics. These aims will be pursued through
multidisciplinary and collaborative studies (using wild type and mutant proteins
with cysteinyl residues engineered for labeling with fluorescence and spin
probes) involving cross-linking, electron microscopy, fluorescence, mass
spectrometry, electron paramagnetic resonance, kinetics, and single molecule
measurements.

The broader impact of this project will be in advancing the discovery and
understanding of basic cellular processes while providing interdisciplinary
training in the chemistry/biology interface to students at all levels -
including summer trainees from underrepresented groups at the local colleges -
and preparing them for academic and industrial careers.
