Work is planned on problems in the calculus of variations. Specifically, the
principal investigator is concerned with the regularity and existence of
minimizers of integral functions whose integrands exhibit a certain type of
singular behavior. Fundamental to existence theory is a result of C.B. Morrey
which isolates the notion of quasiconvexity as an essential ingredient for
existence. A stronger property formulated by L.C. Evans called strict
quasiconvexity guarantees partial regularity of minimizers. It has been pointed
out in recent literature that in studies of equilibrium boundary value problems
in nonlinear elasticity that the growth conditions required to guarantee
regularity is too restrictive to include realistic models for hyperelastic
materials where the functional being minimized (i.e. its integral) corresponds
to stored energy. This problem occurs in particular when one is dealing with
compressible materials. Work will be done with integrands exhibiting
unboundedness, subject only to the restriction that the determinant of the
gradient of admissible functions (representing hydrostatic pressure) be
positive. Existence of minimizers is not a problem in this context but
regularity is. The variational problem yields an Euler equation but it is not at
all clear that a minimizer is even a weak solution of this equation. Work to
date suggests nevertheless that a careful analysis of admissible variations will
yield the desired regularity. This research is expected to find applications in
the study of nonlinear elasticity and incompressible fluid flow.
