This is a proposal to purchase an image plate detector for x-ray crystallography
of proteins. Image plate detectors are a new technology poised to revolutionize
protein crystallography as electronic detectors did in the 1980s. They combine
the best features of both electronic detectors and photographic film. They have
superior signal to noise ration at low count rates, which is essential for
protein crystals. They have linear response over a wide dynamic range. Most
importantly, they have superior spatial resolution compared to electronic
detectors and can be manufactured in large format. Experimentally, these
advantages allow the image plate to be placed close to the crystal so that a
large angle is subtended and many more reflections are recorded simultaneously.
The proteins being studied are molecules that function biologically as enzymes,
DNA repair enzymes, antibodies, antigen complexes, proteins, determinants of
pathogens, photoactive receptors, electron transfer center, oxygen binding
proteins, growth factor receptors and receptor complexes, and folate cofactor
enzymes involved in purine biosynthesis.
