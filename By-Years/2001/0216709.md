Many nutrients, natural toxins, and manmade toxins and drugs are hydrosoluble
(soluble in water). Efficient transport of hydrosoluble chemicals across the
vertebrate small intestine is generally thought to depend on membrane transport
proteins (mediated transport), but some birds can efficiently transport
hydrosoluble chemicals through the gaps between cells (i.e., by a passive
paracellular pathway). This research will (1) test the generality of this
finding in other birds, mammals, and reptiles spanning a broad size range (0.05
kg - 50 kg), (2) test mechanisms that may explain differences among species in
the importance of paracellular transport of hydrosoluble chemicals, and (3)
determine hydrosoluble absorption of toxins by the paracellular pathway.
Physiological, pharmacokinetic, and microscopy techniques will be used to test
these hypotheses. The differential absorption of carbohydrate probes, which
range in size from 150 -666 Daltons, will be used to assess how the gap between
cells restricts transport according to molecular size. Differences in the
absorption of two forms of glucose (D- and L-glucose) will provide information
about the relative rates of glucose absorption by the mediated versus passive
pathways. The effects of a nutrient (sugar) in the gut on absorption will be
determined. Intestinal tissues will be examined via light and electron
microscopy to characterize structural features (e.g., intestinal surface area
and density of tight junctions at the gaps between adjacent cells) that may
contribute to variation in paracellular absorption. Another study will measure
absorption of a man-made hydrosoluble toxin (the herbicide glyphosate) and a
natural hydrosoluble phytochemical (anthocyanin) in two species. Movement of the
toxin glyphosate along the paracellular path between (not through) intestinal
cells will be directly observed using autoradiography. The proposed studies have
important implications for vertebrate ecology, digestive physiology,
evolutionary physiology and ecotoxicology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
