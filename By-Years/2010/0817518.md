The Kibena language is spoken by approximately 670,000 people living in southern
Tanzania. Kibena is largely undocumented, and there is no usable, detailed. By
means of an NSF grant to Dr. Claire Bowern of Rice University, Ph.D. candidate
Michelle Morrison will document Kibena texts and produce a grammar. This
preliminary grammar will include an analysis of the sound system of the
language, descriptions of word, clause, and sentence structure, and a discussion
of various aspects of Kibena at the level of discourse and conversation. Rather
than relying primarily on elicited data ("How do you say X in Kibena?"), this
project will utilize larger texts and conversations in an effort to study Kibena
in its most natural form. Therefore one of the outputs of this project will be
the compilation of a corpus of audio and video recordings. Materials in the
corpus will be transcribed, with translations provided in both English and
Kiswahili (the national language of Tanzania), in order to facilitate access by
other researchers interested in the language.

The Bena people are interested in increasing the profile and use of Kibena,
particularly with regard to written materials. The Committee for Promoting Bena
Culture (PBC, formerly Kibena Language Committee) has requested the production
of a "grammar book" of their language which they plan to use to aid in the
production of written materials. This project includes the production of a
simplified grammar, which will be written in Kiswahili in order to facilitate
access by adult Kibena speakers. This grammar will be aimed at facilitating the
production of written materials. In addition, this project provides for the
production of a book of stories (histories, folk tales, etc.). This book will be
aimed at speakers with basic functional literacy. Copies of all materials
resulting from this project will be provided to the PBC and efforts will be made
to ensure the usability of project materials for the production of Kibena
language materials.
