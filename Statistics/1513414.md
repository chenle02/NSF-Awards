In many application areas, high-throughput devices enable one to gather
thousands and sometimes millions of measurements in very short periods of time.
This research project addresses statistical problems that arise from Big Data
areas such as brain imaging, genomics and genetics, and social networks. The
research contains several components: (a) collect and clean large-scale data
sets for social networks; (b) develop new models, methods, and theory for
analyzing large social networks; and (c) develop new methods and theory for
analyzing genomic and genetic data and brain imaging data. The research will
have impact in cancer research, neuroscience, and social sciences.

The flood of high-throughput measurements is driving a new branch of statistical
practice called Large-Scale Inference. This research project aims to exploit
various types of sparsity (for example, signal sparsity, graphical sparsity,
sparsity in eigenvalues and leading eigenvectors) to address (a) network data
collection and preprocessing, (b) statistical modeling for different types of
networks, (c) computationally feasible approaches to precision matrix
estimation, (d) cancer classification and clustering, and (e) sparse principal
component analysis and post-selection random matrix theory. The research will
lead to new data sets and new methods and theory in analyzing data in
application areas such as social networks, genomics and genetics, and brain
imaging.
