During this PYI Grant period, the primary focus of the research will be on
advanced control system design for autonomous underwater vehicles. A real time
3-D graphic simulator will be developed to study the theoretical characteristics
of the design. A coordinated adaptive control system for the vehicle and its
manipulator will be designed by simulation and experiment.
