Interstellar Astrochemistry. Dr. Herbst will continue a research program in
which he seeks to understand and utilize chemistry to explain and guide
astronomical observations of molecules, and to better our understanding of
interstellar and circumstellar objects. The astronomical regions of interest
include carbon rich circumstellar shells, hot molecular cores, reflection
nebulae, novae, cold interstellar clouds, translucent clouds, and disks around
young stellar objects. During this award period a wide variety of modeling
studies will be pursued, to be backed up with improvements to the group's
standard models. A significant portion of the research time is spent on
theoretical studies of relevant gas-phase and surface processes. ***
