This award will provide partial support for an equipment upgrade to the
University of Kentucky electron microprobe laboratory. The electron microprobe's
capabilities for rapid quantitative chemical analysis of solids with micron-
scale spatial resolution will be made available on a campus-wide and regional
basis in support of research projects and graduate instruction. The instrument
is housed in the Department of Geological Sciences and will also be used by
faculty and graduate students in Materials Science and in Physics as well as the
research staff of the Kentucky Geological Survey. Research topics will include
the study of metamorphic terranes, lower crust xenoliths, coal studies, thin-
film analysis, and characterization of high-temperature superconducting
compounds.
