This research, supported by a National Science Foundation Young Investigator
award, will incorporate and apply ideas and techniques from representation
theory, group actions and homotopy theory to analyze the cohomology and other
topological invariants of finite and arithmetic groups. The National Science
Foundation Young Investigator award recognizes outstanding young faculty. This
award recognizes the recipient's strong potential for continued professional
growth as a research mathematician and for significant development as a teacher
and academic leader.
