9415485 Adams Dr. Adams will continue laboratory studies of the products of the
dissociative recombination of terminating interstellar ions that are implicated
in molecular synthesis in interstellar clouds. Vibrational state populations of
the molecules will be determined whenever possible. The combined data on the
products will be used in limited models of molecular synthesis in interstellar
clouds to predict abundances of species for which interstellar detections are
available.
