Description: This project supports participation by three U.S. persons in a
workshop on Image Processing to be held in Pune, India in July 1991. The host
institute is the Inter-University Center for Astronomy and Astrophysics. The
U.S. participants include two scientists and one data processing expert who will
present lectures on image processing associated with observational astrophysics
activities. These activities have greatly increased in India with the
construction of several telescopes including the 2.3 meter Vainu Bappu Telescope
(VBT). The areas of the expertise of the three participants complement each
other. Scope: The IUCAA is the focus of astronomical and astrophysical research
in India. It is under the University Grants Commission and is to provide
facilities to all university and other researchers in the field. It is likely
also to facilitate cooperation with foreign astronomers, including U.S.
scientists. The support provided by this project will enable Indian scientists
to improve their observations and to provide better defined data to the world
scientific community. The project fits the U.S.-India Cooperative Science
Program objectives.
