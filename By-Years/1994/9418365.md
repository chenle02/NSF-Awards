9418365 Thebaut This Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) is
being funded as a multi-site research Center. Purdue University and the
University of Florida is adding the University of Oregon (including Oregon State
University, the Oregon Graduate Institute of Science & Technology and Portland
State University) as research sites in the I/UCRC for Software Engineering
(SERC). Seven companies will join SERC inconjunction with the University of
Oregon becoming an additional research site in the Center. The Center's research
agenda will be increased by research projects on "Time Insensitive Binary to
Binary Translation; "Entropy-Based Measure of Software Complexity and Its
Application to Software Testing", "Visual Programming Languages", "Human
Computer Interaction", and "Software Engineering Tools for the Construction of
Network Applications." The researchers of involved with the Center are qualified
to perform the research projects. The Center has been coordinated with Dr. Bruce
Barnes, Program Director of the Computer Computation Research Program at NSF.
The Program Manager recommends the University of Florida be awarded $25,000 for
the first year of a five year continuing award. Near the end of each 12-month
period, the Program Manager and/or the Division Director of the Engineering
Education Centers Division will review the progress of the Center on a number of
renewal criteria, including the following: 1) the extent to which the
industry/university interaction is developing; 2) the extent to which the
support base is developing; and 3) the extent to which a robust research program
is developing. If the review is satisfactory, the Program Manager will
recommends support for the next period of this continuing award.
