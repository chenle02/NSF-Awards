The Creating Momentum through Communicating Mathematics GK-12 project will
enrich the mathematical experiences of graduate student Fellows from San
Francisco State University, as well as teachers and students from four San
Francisco public schools. A key goal is to strengthen Fellows' communication,
teaching, outreach, and teamwork skills by immersing them in mathematics
classrooms and the San Francisco Math Circle (an after-school program). A second
key goal is to make mathematics, especially algebra, and its career connections
more relevant and explicit for 6-12 grade teachers and students. The project
will enhance the preparation of Fellows for Ph.D. programs, particularly among
underrepresented minorities. The project contributes to meeting societal demand
for mathematicians who can explain their work and its significance, not only to
each other, but to the general public. By developing mathematics seminars
focused on communicating research, the model provides innovative strategies for
invigorating mathematics education in graduate school. Moreover, it serves
middle and high schools needs for making algebra more accessible and relevant.

Our project will integrate graduate research with math teaching at middle and
high schools. It will strengthen the recruitment of underrepresented minorities
into our M.A. program, as well as their preparation for and entry into Ph.D.
programs. Our project will result in institutionalization of two new courses. By
working with the California State Universities and with the Mathematical
Sciences Research Institute, broad dissemination of the project's partnership
model involving graduate students, teachers, mathematicians, and 6-12 grade
students will be ensured.
