This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award from the Major Research
Instrumentation (MRI) program, Kevin D. Revell and colleagues Edie J. Banner and
James R. Cox from Murray State University will acquire a 400 MHz NMR
spectrometer to support research in designing nitrogen-containing heterocyclic
scaffolds for application to natural product synthesis, synthesis and
characterization of conjugated oligomers for application in organic photovoltaic
devices, as well as probing interactions of aromatic systems in
proteins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is
one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the
structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to
characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the
dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-
art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier
research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic
organic/inorganic chemistry, biochemistry and energy research. This instrument
will be an integral part of teaching as well as research.
