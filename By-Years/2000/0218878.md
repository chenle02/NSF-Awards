The constantly increasing congestion in the sea lanes and air traffic lanes
raises the risk of ship collisions and aircraft collisions. This danger was
tragically illustrated in a recent air disaster over Germany. This research
seeks to reduce the collision risk via the development of a high-performance,
robust, real-time collision avoidance algorithm. The research approach is based
on the combination of an offline optimization algorithm generating the structure
of the solution and an online algorithm approximating the solution in real time.
The collision avoidance problem is formulated as a maximin problem of Chebyshev
type: the objective is to maximize with respect to controls the timewise minimum
distance between the host vehicle and an intruder. A multiple-subarc version of
the sequential gradient-restoration algorithm is being developed to solve
numerically the optimal control problem. Because it is not feasible to compute
the optimal trajectory in real time, a collision avoidance guidance algorithm is
being developed to approximate the optimal trajectory in real time. This
algorithm partitions the collision avoidance maneuver into an avoidance phase
and a recovery phase. For the avoidance phase, the time interval for which
saturation control can be applied is determined so as to quickly escape from the
collision danger. During the recovery phase, the host vehicle is maneuvered back
to the assigned path via a feedback restoration algorithm. To rapidly
disseminate the research results and foster education in the fields of
optimization, guidance, and system safety, an online demonstration of the
algorithm is being developed. This software will allow remote users to simulate
ship/aircraft maneuvers with the aid of animated graphical displays and will
help the development of collision avoidance instrumentation for ships and
aircraft. The research results will also be relevant to the orbital debris
avoidance for spacecraft.
