9722191 Williams Breeding programs have typically neglected, due to its
inaccessibility, modification of the root system. No direct selection is
possible for the improvement of, e.g., root structure or architecture. Selection
schemes are indirect. Arabidopsis is an ideal model in which to identify the
genes controlling root architecture. To identify roots with abnormal rates of
lateral root formation, M2 mutagenized seeds will be screened. Only those plants
in which the growth rate and morphology of the primary root is not altered will
be pursued. An extensive genetic analysis of the remaining mutants will be
carried out, including backcrosses into the wild type, and construction of
double mutant combinations. Selected loci will be cloned. In addition, conserved
regions of select genes will be used for the amplification of a lateral root
cDNA library. The expression pattern of the root-specific genes and the function
of the encoded gene products will be ascertained. The proposed work will be
conducted primarily by undergraduate students, in summer programs and in
required senior research projects. A better understanding of the plasticity of
lateral root formation and of genes involved in lateral root formation will
result from this project.
