The objectives of this research are to resolve the mechanistic and evolutionary
causation of selective predation by stream dwelling stoneflies and measure the
lethal and sublethal costs of disturbance by mayflies, feeding rates, growth
rates and fecundity. Videotaped behavioral observations, and predation trials
will test for frequency-dependent prey selection, induction of feeding
preference, responses of predators and prey to hydrodynamic clues, and the
"threat sensitivity hypothesis", which states that predator-avoidance behavior
esculates with risk of predation. Replicated circular stream channel experiments
will test for microhabitat overlap of predators and prey, enable comparison of
growth rates and fecundities of stoneflies. Choice chamber experiments will test
effects of predators on mayfly use of periphyton resource patches. Functional
response and benthic data will be used to determine the potential impact of
lethal and sublethal effects of stonefly predation on prey population dynamics.
The key contributions of the research will be tests of new hypotheses on
behavioral mechanisms underlying patterns of selective predation and predator-
avoidance and the first known experimental study of why natural selection might
have favored certain predator and prey behaviors.
