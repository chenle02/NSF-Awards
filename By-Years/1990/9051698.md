A new laboratory course, Discovering Physics, will be enhanced by the purchase
of equipment for student measurements of wave phenomena in different contexts
and for measurements of electrical and magnetic phenomena. These topics have
been chosen for their accessibility and interest to non-science majors and their
importance in physics. The course is taught using a discovery approach with a
minimum of lectures and an emphasis on a guided approach to student discovery of
important physical principles. Funds will be used to purchase sufficient
equipment for additional students and for more sophisticated equipment that will
yield more precise quantitative results and reduce one layer of student
confusion. The course is oriented especially toward students planning to become
elementary school teachers, uses much of the same equipment and philosophy that
most education experts claim should be used in the elementary school classroom,
and has a fifty percent enrollment of female students. Since there are no
available textbooks for a course of this type, a university-level modular
Discovery Workbook will be produced that can be made available to students as
they learn.
