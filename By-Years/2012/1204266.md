The Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) region of the Southern Ocean is undergoing
some of the most dramatic warming on the planet, leading to dramatic changes in
ecosystem structure and function. Past research has indicated that these shifts
are affecting the phytoplankton community, but little is known regarding how
specific organisms are changing in abundance and activity. This research will
develop a microarray tool to track changes in the presence and absence of
different microbes as well as the activity of these organisms. This will lead to
greater insight into the ecosystem processes that are currently affected by
environmental change in the WAP, as well as a way to predict future shifts.
Results will be widely disseminated through publications as well as through
presentations at national and international meetings. In addition, raw data will
be made available through open-access databases. This project will support the
research and training of a post-doctoral fellow. As well, the microarray
developed for this work will be made available to other research groups to
facilitate a greater understanding of shifts in community structure in the
Southern Ocean. Researchers on this project will participate in outreach
programs targeting K12 teachers as well as high school students.
