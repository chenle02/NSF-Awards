Deployment is a fundamental issue in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). In many
missions today, sensors are deployed deterministically in a planned manner.
Instances include airport/harbor monitoring, intruder tracking on government
property, etc. This project studies optimal deployment patterns in WSNs, which
are those patterns that achieve desired coverage and connectivity requirements
with the fewest sensor nodes. Knowledge of these patterns can help avoid ad hoc
deployment to save costs, minimize message collisions, improve network
management, etc. However, exploration of these patterns is difficult and far
from mature in WSNs. This project comprehensively studies them in both
theoretical and practical settings for WSNs in 2- and 3-dimensional spaces.
Three major research tasks are carried out: (1) exploring optimal deployment
patterns for 1-coverage and k-connectivity in 2-dimensional space; (2) exploring
such patterns for connected m-coverage (m > 1) in 2-dimensional space; (3)
exploring such patterns for connected coverage in 3-dimensional space. If
successful, this project will result in a set of optimal deployment patterns in
theoretical and practical settings to achieve multi-coverage and multi-
connectivity in 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional spaces with different ratios of
sensor communication range to sensing range. The research can help establish
theoretical foundations and practical guidelines for planned deployment not just
for WSNs, but also for other wireless networks, such as mesh and cellular
networks. In addition, the research results will broaden understanding of
applications of computational geometry and topology in computer networks.
