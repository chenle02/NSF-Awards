This project provides the Computer Science Laboratory with increased strengths
in UNIX, data communications, graphics, and basic computer power. In acquiring
state-of-the-art UNIX workstations, students will be provided with graphic
interface/windowing platforms and an opportunity to stay on the main sequence of
UNIX development, as well as greater capabilities in Internet communications,
network file systems, and object oriented programming. The acquisitions in data
communications will allow students year-round access to a Novell network and a
distributed database management system, as well as opportunities to perform
commercial programming in a network environment using both database and Novell
application programming interfaces. The system will be utilized by both computer
science and chemistry majors. Chemistry majors will be able to investigate
computational chemistry, e.g., molecular modeling, of nontrivial molecules plus
subsequent visualization; computer science majors will utilize the system
throughout their curriculum, in courses including data structures, digital
communications, database management, and operating systems.
