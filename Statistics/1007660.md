Quantile regression has shown great promise in censored data analysis. The
investigator proposes to broaden the scope of censored quantile regression by
developing methods that can accommodate practical situations where censoring
mechanism is more complicated than univariate random censoring. Part of research
goals for the 3-year plan are: (1) to develop quantile regression methods in the
presence of dependent censoring which can provide semiparametric sensitivity
analysis of regression quantiles or joint inference on conditional quantiles of
the response and response?censoring dependency; (2) to derive a new formulation
of doubly censored regression quantiles based on a stochastic integral equation
and provide practical remedies for addressing the associated identifiability
issues; (3) to develop publicly available software which implements the proposed
cutting-edge statistical methodology. The investigator plans to provide rigorous
asymptotic studies for the proposed methods utilizing theory in empirical
processes, stochastic integral equation, and functional analysis, and other
statistical and probabilistic techniques.



The proposed research will have significant impact and many applications in
diverse fields including biomedical research, economics, and public health
studies. For example, the methods to be developed can appropriately address the
problem of nonrandom patient dropout in clinical studies, or account for the
occurrence of event before study entry as well as no observation of event by the
end of follow-up in many registry studies of chronic disease, thereby
contributing to improving disease treatment or prevention. The investigator
plans to integrate the results from the proposed research with education through
student mentoring and course teaching, which may involve undergraduate students,
and to widely disseminate the proposed research via publications, conference
presentations, seminars, Internet postings, and free software.
