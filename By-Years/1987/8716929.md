Electrical energy, whether in batteries or biological systems, accomplishes work
through oxidation-reduction. This reaction occurs by transferring electrons or
atoms between molecules at slow or rapid rates depending on several factors.
This research is focused on determining how slowly or rapidly the transfer
occurs for the simplest molecules that can participate in the reaction. In the
previous grant period such molecules as the industrial bleach chlorite and the
atmospheric component nitric oxide have been investigated. The results have led
to a significant improvement in the understanding of this reaction. The proposed
research extends the studies to additional molecules including such common
varieties as the oxygen we breathe and hydrogen peroxide and more unusual
molecules such as BrCN. The factors influencing the speed of the reaction such
as the solvent in which it takes place will also be investigated.
