As biomedical technology has progressed, it has become increasingly important
to develop materials for internal use in the body, either as prostheses or as
drug delivery devices, or as interfaces with body solutions like blood. The
objective of the State/Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for the
Enhancement of the Biology/Biomaterials Interfaces at the University of Texas at
San Antonio is to perform studies concerning the mechanisms which are involved
in cellular response to biomaterials as well as to design and develop new
materials and prototype devices. The major research topics include: (1) response
of cells to hydrostatic pressure and materials, (2) bioresorption of
biodegradable materials, (3) cardiac prostheses calcification and colonization,
(4) bacterial biofilm formation, (5) drug delivery from oxide forming metals,
(6) electrochemical integrity of implants, and (7) tissue adaptation to
materials. The research will be carried out in collaboration with a number other
institutions in the area. Twenty large, medium and small companies will be the
initial members of the industrial partnership. Technology transfer will occur
through information exchange, and test and evaluation performed by the
companies.
