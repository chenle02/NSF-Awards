This grant will support a two-and-a-half-day long workshop on Computational
Audition, bringing together top scientists from a broad range of disciplines.
Computational audition, the study of how information can be derived from sound
in both biological organisms and in machines, is an emerging field. The topic is
broad, encompassing a diverse group of scientists including neuroscientists,
psychologists, psychophysicists, speech scientists, computer scientists, and
engineers. The field of computational audition has the potential to be a model
of interdisciplinary research with a great deal of intrinsic intellectual
interest. It is primed to become a hotbed of scientific growth, and this meeting
will help the field evolve toward that goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts&lt;br/&gt;Computational audition is important both for developing new
technological applications as well as for finding new clinical treatments
(because understanding the basis of normal hearing will help treat hearing
impairment). And yet by comparison to many other related fields, its potential
is underexplored. For instance, research on human and machine perception has
been dominated to a large extent by vision, with hearing neglected by
comparison. This workshop will nurture the development of interdisciplinary
research in computational audition that will capitalize on this potential.
