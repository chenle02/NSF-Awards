This proposal addresses a new concept of forming abrasive- waterjets that may
prove to be another breakthrough in machining technology. Premixed slurries will
be directly pumped up to 55,000 psi to form jets with a power density an order
of magnitude higher than current abrasive-waterjet systems. The potential
advantages of direct-pumping nozzles include: 1) high energy transfer
efficiency, (2) capability of forming abrasive- dense jets, and (3) capability
of forming jets with diameters as small as 0.003 inch (versus 0.030 inch for
current abrasive- water jets). An experimental setup will be prepared, and an
experimental investigation will be conducted to recognize some features of the
flow characteristics of high-pressure slurry jets and their machining
capabilities. In addition, a technical and economical analysis will be
conducted. The overall feasibility of high-pressure pumping of abrasive slurry
will be assessed and areas of future investigation will be determined.
