collaboration with the corporate members; undertake research, development, and
evaluation projects on behalf of the corporate members; disseminate to the
members findings of health services research; identify and disseminate to the
members successful innovations and management practices from other health care
organizations; and identify and disseminate to the members relevant research
findings, successful innovation, and management practices from other industries.
