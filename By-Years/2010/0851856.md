This award provides support to undergraduate students in science and engineering
disciplines, in particular underrepresented women and minorities with cohort and
high-quality research experiences in an interdisciplinary area of information
technology and automotive engineering. The program is run in an eight-week long
intensive summer research camp involving ten students per year. The program is
cross-disciplinary, involving twelve participating faculty mentors from three
departments: Electrical and Computer Engineering, Computer Science, and
Biomechanical Engineering. The program seeks to improve students' skills in
applying the scientific method to hands-on research and train each student in
modern research techniques; lead students to greater independence in pursuing
their research interests; and strive to increase the participation of women and
underrepresented minorities who enter and complete graduate programs in science
and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The students will be matched with suitable
mentors to participate in a wide range of individual research projects in the
fields of computer modeling and simulation in vehicle safety study, embedded
systems and computer-based control in vehicles, vehicular networks, telematics
applications, and reliable and secure mobile Internet services. The program
integrates meaningful interdisciplinary research and active learning experience
into undergraduate education to promote retention of students in science and
engineering, and motivate them to continue to graduate schools. The program
benefits society at large by contributing to developing an educated computing
workforce capable of quickly putting new ideas to work in innovative ways that
serve the needs of the populace and begin to take better advantage of flat world
realities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
