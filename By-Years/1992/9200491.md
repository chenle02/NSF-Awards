This REU site focusses summer research efforts of ten talented undergraduates on
projects relating to synthesis and processing of advanced engineering materials.
The faculty team assimilated for this research spans the Aerospace/Mechanical
Engineering and Manufacturing Engineering departments. Participants will be
selected primarily from two groups: 1) former participants in a college-funded
Freshmen Research Opportunity Program, 2) undergraduates at schools
participating in 3/2 cooperative agreements.
