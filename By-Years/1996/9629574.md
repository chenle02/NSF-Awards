9629574 Smedley The goal of the research is to develop a new class-D power
amplifier system based on the One-Cycle Control technique and to realize circuit
integration. The new power amplifier should have low power loss, low EMI, and
low distortion, wide bandwidth, large input and output dynamic range, robust
performance, and simple circuitry. The research proposed here serves as
preliminary research and planning activities in line with the goal. In this
period, theoretical and experimental study will be conducted to further improve
the ripple rejection capability in the high frequency range, to create low noise
high speed differential integrator for One-Cycle Control to minimize the
distortion, to find suitable method for soft switching to eliminate EMI and
increase the power level, to investigate simple and effective input current
shaping circuit to achieve unity power factor, to optimize the circuit
configuration, and to provide engineering design information for realizing
integrated circuit chips. ***
