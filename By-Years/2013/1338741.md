This award is being used to convene an inaugural workshop to explore the many
dimensions of ethics education for the geosciences (GeoEthics). A major goal of
this workshop is to begin to develop a community of scholars interested in this
topic and to develop the foundations of a GeoEthics curriculum. This workshop
will be on the scale of the On the Cutting Edge "emerging theme" workshops,
which are designed to be catalytic events to bring together innovators and early
adopters to: a) survey, aggregate, organize and disseminate the instructional
resources that are currently available, and b) develop work plans for next steps
in recruiting and developing additional resources that are needed. The 3.5-day
workshop will be held in the summer of 2014 at Montana State University, with
~35 participants from the geoscience research and education communities, as well
as the STEM ethics education community. The Science Education Resource Center
(SERC) at Carleton College is providing on-line support for the workshop and
related content. This workshop is viewed as the first step in developing a more
significant program - and related resources - for teaching GeoEthics across the
geoscience curriculum.
