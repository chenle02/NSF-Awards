The atmospheric channel for optical communication is hostile due to high
attenuation during bad weather conditions and due to fading over long
atmospheric paths. One way to improve the reliability and usefulness of these
types of systems is through the use of coding to reduce the error of the decoder
bits at the receiver. Based upon the use of interleaving of simple codes, the
problem of long fades which cause a large number of errors spanning thousands of
consecutive received bits has been investigated. To determine what improvements
in system performance can be obtained with realistic interleaving, a series of
experiments were carried out. The results of these measurements indicated that
substantial interleaving would be needed to obtain acceptably low error
probability performance. It is the objective of this research to employ a
concatenated coding scheme to obtain satisfactory performance with a much
smaller amount of interleaving.
