0808738&lt;br/&gt;Bischof&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides partial support for the
Nano and Multiscale Frontiers in Biological Heat and Mass Transfer Symposium,
which will be held as part of the ASME Summer Bioengineering Meeting on Marco
Island, Florida, June 25 - 27, 2008. The purpose of this meeting is to stimulate
the biotransport research community, which has traditionally focused on
macroscale problems such as blood perfusion and thermal biology, to explore new
areas involving challenging problems over multiple length scales.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With respect to the intellectual merit of the conference,
a number of diverse speakers will appear at this symposium. These speakers
include international experts in lipid-protein interactions, biomass transfer,
biophotonics, and cellular- and tissue-level transport. The attendees will be
exposed to these and other topics that are not often addressed at bioengineering
meetings. This symposium builds on a 2004 NSF/NIH biotransport workshop that has
had a great impact on this community, and it is expected that further
collaborations and advances will result from this meeting.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the conference include bringing
together junior and senior researchers in the emerging field of biotransport,
which has the potential to bring about improved fundamental understanding of
biological transport mechanisms that could lead to improved human health and
quality of life. An educational component will be provided, and dissemination
will be enabled by a special issue of the Journal of Biomechanical Engineering.
The NSF funds will be used to support both junior and/or underrepresented
faculty, and to partially offset the expenses of the invited
speakers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
