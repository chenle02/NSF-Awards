INTERFACE is an annual, national interdisciplinary conference devoted to the
study and discussion of the interrelationship between the sciences,
technologies, and humanities. Created in 1976, INTERFACE is co-sponsored by the
Humanities and Technology Association and the Humanities and Social Sciences
Department of Southern College of Technology. The conference provides a forum
for the examination of new and ongoing problems and issues that cut across the
natural and physical sciences, technology, the social sciences, and the
humanities. This examination includes the ethical considerations that must be
addressed when such issues and problems are raised. The conference attracts
experts in such fields as physics, chemistry, ethics, literature, history,
engineering, computer science, sociology, and the fine arts. This modest award
will help INTERFACE to support some administrative and special publication costs
associated with the conference, while its directors developing plans to make it
self-sustaining in future years. There are very few professional settings where
discussion of interdisciplinary research interests is possible. This conference
is one of them. The organizers and host organizations have a track record of
success. This modest request will enable the project organizers to develop plans
and activities that will give the conference more visibility and a better base
of long-term support. Results will improve interdisciplinary communication. A
one year award is recommended.
