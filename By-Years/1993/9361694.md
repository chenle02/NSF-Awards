9361694 Mateja This project is using the pioneering of the past 25 years and
combining the use of computers and a new piezoelectric material to conceive an
array of 14,000 nodes that can produce the dimple for tactile sensation. The
project also answers the need for Descriptive Video Service (DVS) to persons
with visual impairment. The project is called VISual to TActile CONversion
(Vistacon) Vistacon can be an affordable and personal system for the blind. It
is based on the concept of coupling a video cassette recorder (VCR) to a digital
converter/controller that drives a state-of-the-art film platen in a variety of
direct tactual modalities. In phase I the project staff intend to determine the
feasibility of three technical issues: 1. the technical merit and efficacy of
using piezoelectric film to produce the standard Braille dots as graphic
elements. 2. response times and tactile readability of the graphic elements
through a test system. 3. real-time access of graphics, pictures, symbols, and
text in an electronically erasable medium ***
