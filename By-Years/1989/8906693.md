Dr. Tamara A. Ulibarri has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Ulibarri's doctoral degree was from the University of California
at Irvine under the supervision of Professor William J. Evans. Dr. Ulibarri
intends to continue research at the California Institute of Technology under the
sponsorship of Professor Robert Grubbs. Dr. Ulibarri's area of postdoctoral
research will be in the synthesis of conducting polymers by 1,4-polymerization
of dienes and by ring opening metathesis. Critical to the synthesis is the
design of specific catalysts. The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry
Program is viewed as important infrastructural program designed to broaden the
knowledge and experience of new Ph.D's and attract them into meaningful careers
in contemporary chemical research and teaching.
