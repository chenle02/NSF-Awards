A Novel Multimodal Approach for High-Resolution Brain
Research&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research program is to
develop a novel methodology and analytic strategy for simultaneous high-density
intracranial electrophysiological recording, electrical brain stimulation, and
optogenetic activation/deactivation during high-field functional magnetic
resonance imaging, and to apply this integrated methodology to investigate
neural mechanisms that mediate sensory processing and selective attention in
macaque. The project will advance discovery and understanding while promoting
teaching and training by involving graduate students and postdoctoral scholars
in undergraduate research supervision related to the project. Because selective
attention is a core cognitive process, elucidating attentional mechanisms close
relatives to humans such as the macaque remains a high priority in efforts to
understand, diagnose and treat psychiatric conditions that involve deficits in
attention, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism,
obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and schizophrenia. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All
of our conscious perceptions and cognitive actions depend critically on the
neural computations performed by cortical circuits, the network of connections
made by neurons in the cerebral cortex. Given the central importance of cortical
circuits in mediating complex behavior, it is critical that we have the tools
necessary to study these circuits during behavior. No single method of recording
brain activity is yet able to characterize both the functional anatomy and rapid
temporal changes in neuronal activity with both high spatial and temporal
resolution. However, by the integration of different methods with either high
temporal or high spatial resolution, this research will develop tools capable of
providing a view of the time course and functional anatomy of brain circuits
supporting behavior.
