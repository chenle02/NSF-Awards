The main goal of this project is to study the solutions to a wide class of
equations that can best be described as nonlinear waves. These mathematical
equations model a broad range of physical phenomena in our universe and even in
our daily lives, including the water waves at the surface of our oceans and the
quantum-mechanical interaction of multi-particle systems, as well as, on a
broader scale, gravitational waves and their evolution in the proximity of black
holes. The common feature in these models lies in the strength of the wave
interactions, which drastically affects both their short-time and long-time
behavior. Phenomena to be studied include both short-time breakdown of waves, as
well as long-time persistence and/or dispersion and decay of waves.

The objective of this project is to attack a broad array of challenging problems
within the field of nonlinear dispersive equations. The equations to be
considered range from semilinear to fully nonlinear, and the types of properties
to be investigated span from short-range to long-range behavior, from scattering
to blow-up questions. The research connects ideas and methods in partial
differential equations to geometry, harmonic analysis, complex analysis, and
microlocal analysis.
