The spiders of the world are a diverse and ecologically important group of
organisms, living in nearly all terrestrial habitats and constituting
significant predators in these communities. Taxonomically they are disposed into
105 families, and one of the largest and most comprehensive collections of
spider specimens is housed at the American Museum of Natural History.
Researchers there are employing modern molecular methods to conduct DNA
sequencing of targeted genes, to gain data useful in the phylogenetic analysis
of evolutionary relationships among these families and with potential arthropod
relatives. Target loci include the 18S ribosomal genes, the histone H4 genes,
and the nuclear ubiquitin genes. Morphological characters also are being studied
and are to be integrated with the molecular results in a combined analysis. A
reliable phylogeny of the spiders will facilitate future studies of their
geographical distributions, modes of speciation, and ecological specializations.
