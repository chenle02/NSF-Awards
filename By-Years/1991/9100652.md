Description: This project provides support for Dr. Ling to travel to Pakistan
and to conduct preliminary investigation with scientists from the Geological
Survey of Pakistan in Karachi and Quetta. The field work seeks to recover
siliceous microfossils, which would be the first such recovery from that region.
The ophiolites in Pakistan represent a part of the major geosuture, and the
results would provide a basis for direct comparison with those from India and
Indonesia where similar analyses are currently underway with collaboration of
international scientists. These combined data will contribute toward temporal
and spatial interpretation of tectonic history of the entire Southern and
Southwest Asia. Scope: The collaboration between the U.S. scientist and the
Pakistani geologists provides for a more effective research and a better use of
resources. Dr. Ling's participation will help the Pakistani scientists improve
their own investigations. This project meets the objectives of the Science in
Developing Countries Program.
