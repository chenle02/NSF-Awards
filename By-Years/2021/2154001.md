The project covers a number of topics in mathematics with focus on the study of
new high dimensional phenomena, in probabilistic, geometric, and information-
theoretic aspects. The core part of this investigation deals with the
concentration of measure phenomena for probability distributions on
multidimensional Euclidean spaces, including their relationship with the
asymptotic behavior of smooth functionals of a growing number of dependent
random variables. Being the subject of many exciting developments over the last
three decades, the concentration tools help explore most essential properties of
general complex systems where the randomness of a large number of small parts
results in a stable limit behavior. This research area is deeply connected to
many challenging mathematical problems and has numerous applications in other
fields such as statistics, information theory, computer science, machine
learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a general far-reaching goal, the project aims
to explore the role of the growing dimension as a unifying source in high-
dimensional models and its influence on the entire time evolution of random
processes. The project will have a broader impact by creating new promising
connections between different mathematical fields, and providing them with
powerful interdisciplinary tools. The project will also have an important impact
on education in mathematical sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More specifically,
the project deals with advanced concentration techniques that will be developed
in the framework of spaces with many symmetries such as Grassmanian manifolds.
With new tools, one of the targets of this investigation is the circle of
problems about the concentration of distributions of weighted sums and quadratic
forms of dependent random variables under correlation-type conditions. The PI
intends to explore refined concentration properties of high dimensional
projections of convex measures, including new integral geometric characteristics
that are responsible for spectral gap and isoperimetric constants. Part of the
project is devoted to the central limit theorem in terms of the Renyi divergence
and relative Fisher information, and to the Edgeworth-type expansions in the
area of Poisson approximation. The project also deals with transport
inequalities and their applications to matching problems. The themes of this
project concern either long-standing open problems or challenging questions
related to recent developments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
