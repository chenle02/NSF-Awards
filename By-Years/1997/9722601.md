The Milagro experiment consists of a huge tank of water. High energy gamma rays
or photons produce bursts of light in the water which are detected. The
energies, rates and origins of these gamma rays give information on the
formation of galaxies. The experiment will also look for gamma rays associated
with the interactions between a black hole and its surroundings. This researcher
is supervising the construction of the detector and is also working in the data
acquisition system.
