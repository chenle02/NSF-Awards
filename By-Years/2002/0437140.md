Small-scale, convectively-forced, ducted gravity waves are characterized using
2D and 3D nonlinear numerical models, with the goal of comparing model gravity
wave phenomena to data from altitudes where gravity waves are commonly imaged. A
preliminary task characterizes the structure, directionality, and effect of a
thunderstorm generated gravity wave when ducted into the mesosphere and
ultimately to about 87 km (the airglow layer). A second task characterizes the
morphology of atmospheric "bore-like" waves as a general phenomenon within an
idealized atmosphere. The applicability of that general model to observed
mesospheric bores is investigated. A final task determines how linear and
nonlinear gravity wave phenomena perturb both the OI 557.7 nm and OH Meinel
airglow layers.
