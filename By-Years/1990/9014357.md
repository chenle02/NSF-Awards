The primary objective of this U.S.-Hungary research project between Dr. John
Rohrbaugh of the State University of New York, Albany, and Dr. Janos Veesenyi of
the International Management Center, Budapest, is to undertake a structured
examination of multi-party conflict resolution. Using case studies, the
researchers will employ cross-cultural comparative analyses of negotiation
support systems. Results are expected to contribute to our understanding of ways
to assist multi- party negotiation which subsequently may prove useful to
practitioners in conflict management in a variety of contexts. This project in
decision and risk management science fulfills the program objective of advancing
scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States and
Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool research resources in
areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
