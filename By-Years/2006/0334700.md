Support is proposed for minority/HBCU undergraduate student travel assistance
for the 2003 IEEE Nanotechnology Conference. The conference, which has been held
twice previously, brings together researchers focused on developing
nanotechnologies and applying these technologies to electronic, magnetic and
photonic devices and systems. The requested support will be used to provide
travel and per-diem stipends for minority undergraduate students who wish to
enhance their educational experience and develop an understanding of
nanotechnology by attending the conference. Priority will be given to those
undergraduate minority students involved in nanotechnology programs through
summer research experiences and other extracurricular projects. The broader
impact of the proposed program includes involvement of minority undergraduate
students in a technical conference hosted by a major professional society. In
addition to technical exposure, this experience will provide the opportunity to
interact with a broad range of researchers involved in the nanotechnology field
and will provide minority undergraduate students a more informed background with
which to make decisions regarding future studies.
