9506674 Harms This project will map at 1: 25,000-scale part of the Dorsey
terrane and adjacent rocks in northern British Columbia/Yukon territory, Canada.
The structural and stratigraphic data will provide the basis for comparison and
correlation of the Dorsey terrane with the distal continental margin of North
America, displaced distal continental margin fragments, or truly exotic terranes
that contain similar lithologies. The results of this project will provide a
greatly improved model for the paleogeographic setting of the western edge of
North America during the Paleozoic. In addition, the data will be integrated
with the Canadian Lithopropbe project to study the deep crust in northern
British Columbia, and will thus help constrain tectonic models for this region
of North America. Undergraduate students will be involved in this research
project at every stage.
