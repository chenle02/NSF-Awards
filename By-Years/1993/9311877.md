9311877 Allen This is the first year of a three-year continuing award. The
research focuses on strategies for automatically determining sensor parameter
values for planning of sensor tasks. This will enable value selection and
tailoring to match task requirements, thereby supporting more flexible and
reliable autonomous operation of sensor systems. Building on a Machine Vision
Planning system (MVP) already implemented at Columbia University, the new
research will extend this framework, and support experiments with the system in
static and dynamic environments. Three main thrusts of the research are: 1)
improving the performance of the optimization approach to finding admissible
viewpoints; 2) extending static sensor planning results to dynamic
environments;and 3) extending MVP to sensor systems other than vision (tactile,
range, and proximity).
