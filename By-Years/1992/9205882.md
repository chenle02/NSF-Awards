The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) sponsors an
International Conference on Chemical Thermodynamics every two years. This is the
premier international meeting in this area. The location of the Conference is
different for each meeting. The 1992 meeting will be held at Snowbird, Utah. The
Conference will be a joint meeting with the 47th annual meeting of the
Calorimetry Conference. The Department of Chemistry of Brigham Young University
will be the local host for the conference. The National Science Foundation,
through both the Division of Chemical &amp; Thermal Systems and the Division of
Chemistry, is contributing to the support of the scientific program of the
conference.
