9627829 Frost This pilot study will concentrate on the relations of the LTV mine
in the Biwabik iron formation. With increasing grade, individual siderite layers
in the aureole become oxidized to magnetite. The PIs will attempt to determine
the process by which this oxidation occurred. Carbon and oxygen isotopes will be
used to determine whether the formation of the magnetite was preceded by simple
oxidation or by formation of metastable methane. Each process should produce a
distinctive isotopic signature. Ion microprobe analyses of the silicates and
carbonates will be performed o determined the temperature and fluid compositions
that were present at the time of oxidation. The magnetite-hematite relations in
low grade rocks will also be investigated.
