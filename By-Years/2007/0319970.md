This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate the
feasibility of the development of a novel software tool for integrated model-
based control design for Rapid Thermal Processing (RTP) systems. The use of
advanced model-based feedback control has become essential to meeting the
increasingly stringent specifications for semiconductor processing. Phase I
activity will be a feasibility study consisting of development of techniques for
model order reduction and for speeding up Monte Carlo ray tracing calculations,
specification of the software architecture, and closed-loop simulation of a
generic RTP chamber using the proposed framework. In Phase II, the software
prototype will be fully implemented. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The final result of
this focused effort will be a software package that will be used by
semiconductor process engineers and design engineers at semiconductor equipment
companies that manufacture RTP systems. Subsequently, the RTP the capabilities
of this tool will be extended to encompass other processes for the semiconductor
and advanced materials industry such as CVD, etch, CMP, etc. The total market
size exceeds $10 billion.&lt;br/&gt;
