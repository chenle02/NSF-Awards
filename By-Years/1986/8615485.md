The principal objectives of the research program are to produce a large,
complete, well defined, and carefully controlled sample of bright quasars; to
obtain slit spectrophotometry and imaging observations for purposes of
statistical investigations as well as studies of physical and chemical gas
properties; and to carry out detailed theoretical analyses of the emitting and
absorbing clouds between us and the quasars. The new quasars are to be detected
by means of their optical spectral line characteristics. A fully automated
object selection procedure and provisions for obtaining more detailed
observations of selected objects at available telescopes are important
improvements over previous surveys. Major contirbutions to astronomy can be
expected through increased understanding of: 1) the brightness and other
relationships for various types of active galaxies, 2) the broad- absorption-
lines in quasar spectra, 3) the quasar redshift and brightness distribution, and
4) possible correlations in the redshifts of close quasar pairs. This survey of
quasars and emission-line galaxies will complement observations being carried
out by other groups of astronomers.
