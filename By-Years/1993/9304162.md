This award provides 50% of the funds required for the purchase of a
differential scanning calorimeter and a dilatometer/viscometer that will be
housed and operated in the Department of Geological Sciences at the University
of Michigan. The University of Michigan is committed to providing the remaining
funds necessary for this equipment acquisition. The equipment is to be used for
the measurement of heat capacity and other thermodynamic and transport
properties of silicate minerals and liquids of interest in research on the
chemical and physical processes taking place in the Earth's crust and mantle.
