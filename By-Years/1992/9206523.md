This study will obtain samples paleomagnetic analysis from interbedded volcanic
and carbonate sedimentary rocks in western Guangxi Province, southern China, in
order to better define the Apparent Polar Wander Path for the South China block
during the Paleozoic. Previous models for the rifting of the South China block
from Gondwanaland place the rifting event in the Devonian, but preliminary new
data suggest it may have begun much earlier. The results of this study will be
important for plate reconstructions for the Paleozoic and will greatly improve
our understanding of the tectonic evolution of this region.
