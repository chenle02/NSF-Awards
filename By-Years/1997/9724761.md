9724761 Knox This award supports a 9 month National Science Foundation
Dissertation Enhancement award for Dr. James Knox in the Department of Geology,
University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan. Dr. Knox's student, Mr. Michael Grossman,
will work with Dr. Nobuyuki Yonekura, Professor of Geology, on a research
project entitled, "Extreme Floods, Typhoon Occurrences, and Climate Change in
the Ara River Basin, Japan." The proposed research will examine the history of
extreme floods in the Ara River basin in Japan and, through data analysis, the
probability of their future recurrence. Current theories suggest that extreme
floods in the region (and elsewhere) may be a direct result of human-induced
global climate change and not a continuation of patterns occurring in previous
eras. The proposed research will test global change theories by comparing past
and present fluvial system data from the Ara River basin, with a specific
emphasis on the hypothesized relationship between climate change-induced typhoon
activity and regional flooding. Results of the research will offer insight into
whether global climate change is indeed the primary determinant involved in
apparent changes in fluvial regimes, and will provide empirical rationale for
similar research in other regions throughout the world. ***
