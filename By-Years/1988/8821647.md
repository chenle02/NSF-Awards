This award provides travel support to ten senior graduate students and recent
Ph.D.'s from U. S. institutions to attend the International School on
Atmospheric Radar (ISAR) to be held at Kyoto, Japan, 23.28 November 1988. The
ISAR is sponsored by the Society of Geomagnetism and Earth, Planetary and Space
Sciences, the Meteorological Society of Japan, the ICSU Scientific Committee on
Solar.Terrestrial Physics, and the Union Radio Scientifique International. The
object is to provide an international forum for learning and discussing the
VHF/UHF radar technique and applications and atmospheric sciences. A selection
committee has been formed and the criteria will be based primarily on the
applicants' educational background and their potential for further research in
this discipline.
