The research proposed here centers around the simulation and computer aided
design (CAD) of nonlinear analog circuits and systems with large signal
excitation, and of circuits with mixed analog and digital signals (e.g. analog-
to-digital converters). While there are many excellent schemes for simulation
and CAD of digital circuits, there are no satisfactory methods for the analysis
of large-signal analog circuits. Currently there is a trend towards monolithicly
integrating analog circuits to obtain the same performance, cost and reliability
improvements obtained with digital circuits. This can only be achieved if new
and accurate computer aided design techniques are developed. The research to be
supported by this award will develop and experimentally verify novel nonlinear
frequency-domain and nonlinear z-domain simulation techniques and apply them to
a CAD environment.
