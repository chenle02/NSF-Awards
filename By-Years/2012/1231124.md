This award supports participants to EAAI-12, the Third Symposium on Educational
Advances in Artificial Intelligence. EAAI-12 will be collocated with the Twenty-
sixth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-12), to be held July
22-26, 2012, in Toronto. EAAI will be held on July 23 and 24. The goals of
EAAI-12 are to expand the educational relevance of and benefits to researchers,
educators, graduate students, and all others who may be interested within the
field of Artificial Intelligence (AI).

EAAI-12 provides a venue for researchers and educators to discuss pedagogical
issues and share resources related to teaching AI and using AI in education
across a variety of curricular levels (K-12 through postgraduate training), with
a natural emphasis on undergraduate and graduate teaching and learning.
Materials to be presented, discussed, and shared by participants include: model
AI assignments with innovative ready-to-adopt materials; syllabi, project ideas
and pedagogical strategies related to teaching AI; multi-disciplinary curricula
highlighting the use of AI in other contexts (e.g., computational biology,
cognitive science, computational economics, philosophy); and resources for
teaching specific subareas or topics within AI (e.g., machine learning, game
playing, natural language processing, robotics, computer vision). There will be
a keynote lecture discussing recent experience with on-line AI classes at
Stanford University. The EAAI symposium will seek to make available
contributions from the symposium. Intellectual Merit and Broader Impacts of
EAAI-12 include enhancements to the teaching, learning, and understanding of AI,
the fostering of stronger research in AI, and increased participation of
talented researchers and teachers in AI and more widely those in Computer
Science and STEM disciplines.
