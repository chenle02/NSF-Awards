The overall objective of this research project is to elucidate the chemical
structure and the mode of action of endogenous ligands for benzodiazepine
(BZ)/GABA receptors with a special focus on their role in the regulation of
GABAergic transmission. More specifically, the plan is to perform the following
studies: 1. Endogenous ligands for benzodiazepine receptor(s) (BZR) will be
purified so that sufficient quantity of the purified endogenous ligands can be
obtained for functional analysis and structural determination. 2. Ligand binding
studies and behavioral tests will be conducted to determine the specificity and
the mode of action of endogenous ligands, e.g. agonist, antagonist, of inverse
agonist of the central type BZR. In addition, the effect of endogenous ligands
on the GABA binding site, barbiturates binding site, and the Cl.. ion channel
will also be investigated. 3. Purified endogenous ligands as haptens will be
used and conjugated to a carrier protein (e.g. bovine serum albumin or
hemocyanin) to serve as antigen for the production of polyclonal and monoclonal
antibodies. These studies are important for understanding the ligand binding
characteristics and competition for receptor sites on nerve cell membranes.
