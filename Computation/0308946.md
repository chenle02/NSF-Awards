The proposed project is for an interdisciplinary research program on
mathematical modeling and computational simulation for fuel cell dynamics.
Support is requested for the PI to spend one whole year time with the Penn State
Electro-chemical Engine Center (ECEC) that conduct fundamental and applied
research on fuel cells and other advanced batteries. Through daily interactions
with researchers at ECEC led by Dr. Chaoyang Wang, the PI expects to gain
sufficient first hand experiences with fuel cell technology and to aquire both
theoretical and practical knowledge on why and how a fuel cell engine works.
With these experiences and knowledge, the PI hopes to be able to effectively
collaborate with researchers and engineers on mathematical and computational
studies of fuel cells. The complicated multiscale, multiphysics, and
multicomponent features of fuel cells make it a uniquely challenging
multidisciplinary research project and the underlying simulation difficulties
provide challenging practical tests for basic research of computational methods
such as grid adaptation, multigrid methods and parallel computing. In return,
the advanced numerical algorithms are expected to significantly improve the
computational efficiency for fuel cell simulations. In particular, the multigrid
method (together with sophisticated grid adaptation) on which the PI has much
expertise will be a major algorithm to be applied and studied for fuel
simulations and a new numerical simulator based on specially tailored adaptive
multigrid methods is planned to be developed for fuel cells in collaboration
with Dr. Wang's group and their industrial partners.

This IGMS project is jointly supported by the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary
Activities (OMA) and the Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS).
