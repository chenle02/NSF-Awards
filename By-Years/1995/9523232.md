9523232 Antonsson This award provides funding to develop a set-based approach to
formalizing negotiations and trade-offs in the engineering design process,
particularly where many engineers and many groups are involved in decision-
making. This is commonly the case for large and/or complex engineering systems.
This work builds on the method of imprecision and a recently developed set-based
approach, and seeks to create a combined approach for preliminary engineering
design that will permit formal negotiation among groups with conflicting goals.
The research approach will make use of the mathematics of fuzzy sets. If
successful, the results of this research could reduce engineering design time
and increase design quality, particularly for large and/or complex engineering
systems. One outcome will be the increased level of concurrence or overlap of
work that might otherwise be done sequentially in the engineering design
process. This could significantly decrease the time needed to create a
successful design and thus improve the competitive ability of U.S. industry. The
informal use of set-based design methods has already demonstrated a shortening
of the design cycle.
