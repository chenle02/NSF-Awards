This research explores emerging concepts of minimalist robotics, by analyzing
compliant motion planning for manipulators with reduced sensing and actuation
complexity such as the parallel-jaw gripper, as alternatives to more complex
multifingered, multijointed robot hands which can be more difficult to program.
The work investigates means to program grasp, recognition, orientation, and
positioning of an industrially-important class of parts whose cross-sections can
be represented by a combination of curved arcs and straight polygonal edges. The
research combines computational analysis of part geometry with methods from
stochastic estimation theory. A programmable parts kitting system will be
developed as an experimental testbed. This system will automatically generate
programs for CAD models of parts, for robot recognition and manipulation of
those parts.
