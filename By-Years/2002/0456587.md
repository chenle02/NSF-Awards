A fundamental question in neuroscience is how natural sensory stimuli are
encoded for information handling by the brain. Invertebrate animals often offer
systems that are in some ways simpler than those of mammals, and including such
features as identifiable single cells in networks of relatively few numbers.
This collaborative project exploits a sensory system called the cercal system of
the cricket, in which small appendages on the rear of the body contain fine
hairs that are used to detect, identify and localize behaviorally relevant air
current movements, such as those produced by a predator. The input from roughly
2000 receptor cells converges on 30 local interneurons and only 20 output
interneurons that lead to behavior such as escape. Three collaborators at two
institutions use computational and mathematical analyses of a database of
anatomical and physiological measurements on the 'dynamic map' that does the
central processing in the brain of the peripheral signals. The goals are to
characterize the representation of dynamic sensory stimulus parameters at two
processing stages within the mapped sensory system, and to examine the
mechanisms that transform the representation at the interface between these two
processing stages.&lt;br/&gt; Results will be important for our understanding of
information representation in nervous systems, particularly in dynamic
processing. The project also will enhance the independent career of a woman
faculty member in mathematics, and students will receive multi-disciplinary,
highly quantitative training related to biology, in two states that do not
currently have high profiles in federally funded research.&lt;br/&gt;
