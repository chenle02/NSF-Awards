The total solar energy absorbed by the surface of the earth in one hour is
nearly equivalent to annual global energy consumption. However, solar power
currently contributes very little to these energy requirements due to limited
production capacity and the high manufacturing costs of solar cells. The organic
nanomaterials developed in this work have the potential to serve as components
of organic solar cells, which are expected to be less expensive to manufacture
and more broadly useful for a wide range of applications. This NSF-supported
research provides insight into the mechanisms of energy transport within
nanoscale materials and contributes to the development of new energy conversion
technologies to generate, store and distribute energy. Beyond developing
strategies for the construction of nanoscale materials, this project introduces
a diverse group of students to interdisciplinary science in an effort to expose
them to the plethora of opportunities in emerging new
technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Macromolecular, Supramolecular and
Nanochemistry (MSN) Program supports the work of Professors Jon R. Parquette at
the Ohio State University and David A. Modarelli at the University of Akron. The
long-term goal of this work is to establish a reliable strategy to assemble
small, optoelectronic chromophores into high-aspect-ratio nanostructures with
controllable inter-chromophore interactions. Specifically, the researchers are
investigating the design and construction of self-assembled, nanostructures
containing bicontinuous donor/acceptor heterojunctions with multichromophore
gradients in the electron transport channel. These nanomaterials are further
studied using ensemble and single-molecule femtosecond spectroscopic techniques
to correlate the nature and type of intermolecular interactions within the
nanostructures with the corresponding electronic properties. These studies
should help to integrate the design and structure of nanoscale organic
architectures with their corresponding charge/energy transport properties.
