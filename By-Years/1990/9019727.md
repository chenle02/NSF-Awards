The Department of Astronomy of the University of Wisconsin- Madison (UW) has an
active staff engaged in a wide range of research activities. The primary
computer is a VAX 11/780 purchased over a decade ago for use in conjunction with
an image- display and PDS plate-scanning device. This award partially matched by
the UW, will upgrade the computing facility to a modern one. The system will
consist of SUN workstations with a central server to handle image-processing and
heavy numerical tasks, a smaller DEC device (using VMS) to which existing disks,
peripherals, and workstations will be connected, and a separate PC class machine
to control an upgraded PDS.
