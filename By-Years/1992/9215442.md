The principal objective of the project is the calculation of relativistic and
quantum electrodynamic corrections to the energy levels of He-like ions using
sophisticated variational and numerical techniques. Rates of convergence will be
investigated as well as novel methods for relativistic corrections. The common
thread running through the work is the application of mathematical and
analytical ideas to effect great improvements in computational techniques.
