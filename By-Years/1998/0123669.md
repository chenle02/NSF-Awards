The PIs propose to educate women geoscientists on the barriers to their progress
in academia&lt;br/&gt;and on strategies to overcome those barriers. Their goal
is to increase the proportion of women in&lt;br/&gt;geoscience tenure track and
tenured positions in academia in the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project
objectives are to:&lt;br/&gt;1) determine the current status of women in
academia through a survey of geoscience&lt;br/&gt;departments in the United
States,&lt;br/&gt;2) conduct focus groups and surveys of students, tenured and
untenured faculty and non-tenure&lt;br/&gt;track faculty at national geoscience
meetings to determine what is the perception of barriers&lt;br/&gt;to women's
progress in the field,&lt;br/&gt;3) hold a 1-day workshop to investigate the
causes of the low representation of women in&lt;br/&gt;academic geoscience
positions in the United States, and&lt;br/&gt;4) Disseminate the information to
geoscience students, junior faculty and to academic&lt;br/&gt;administrators to
educate women students and faculty on strategies to overcome
barriers,&lt;br/&gt;encourage women to pursue academic geoscience careers and
teach administrators how to&lt;br/&gt;recruit and retain qualified women in
geoscience.&lt;br/&gt;This approach to increasing women's representation in the
geosciences takes a 'supply-side' or mentoring approach, with a focus on
teaching women what they need to&lt;br/&gt;know to become (i) educated in the
field without discrimination, (ii) to negotiate salaries
and&lt;br/&gt;contracts, and (iii) to find out what is required to achieve
tenure at their institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported by
the NSF ADVANCE Program. The overall mission of the ADVANCE Program is to
increase the participation of women in the scientific and engineering workforce
through the increased representation and advancement of women in academic
science and engineering careers. &lt;br/&gt;
