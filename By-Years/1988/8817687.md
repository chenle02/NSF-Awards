The orientation and magnitude of the in-situ stress field and its spatial
variation in the Oberpfalz deep boreholes are investigated by a set of
complementary methods based on borehole geometry and borehole seismic methods.
Orientation and shape of stress-induced wellbore breakouts are controlled by the
ambient stress state and rock strength. The orientation of the crustal stresses
throughout the deep boreholes will be determined by interactive digital analysis
of the naturally-occurring breakouts and applying a recently developed stress
measurement method that utilizes information on the size and shape of wellbore
breakouts, rock strength and the magnitude of the least principal compressive
stress (as determined from hydraulic fracturing measurements) to determine the
magnitude of the maximum horizontal principal stress.
