This project will build new foundational technology for Internet video
streaming, by spanning the research areas of video-coding and computer-
networking systems. The goal is to get rid of video glitches and stalls, and to
build the abstractions to enable a "World Wide Web of video," where anybody can
use hyperlinks to reference, quote, excerpt, and edit educational and other
videos online. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will develop an open-source
video-streaming application, to be called Alfalfa. Alfalfa will be similar to
traditional systems (e.g. Netflix, YouTube) in that it will fetch and play
encoded video from a Web server via HTTP. But unlike these "adaptive-bitrate
streaming" systems, Alfalfa will not have a concept of a coded video "bitrate"
or "stream" at all. Instead, each frame will be a possible switching point
between quality levels, and the player's job will be to plan, at runtime, the
best frame-by-frame path through the video that maximizes a quality-of-
experience metric. The intention is to make the video encoder as "dumb" as
possible and to make most rate-control decisions at playback time.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Robust video streaming and the "World
Wide Web of video" will serve as a direct multiplier for students taking and
creating online video courses, especially in regions of the world with poor
Internet connectivity. The project plans to collaborate with providers of online
courses to test the Alfalfa technology and use it to allow student-driven online
video editing in appropriate classes. In addition, the project will include a
demonstration component that will stream U.S. broadcast television stations to
members of the public, educating the public about video-streaming technology and
enlisting participants in an effort to better understand the factors that
influence the "quality of experience" of online video.
