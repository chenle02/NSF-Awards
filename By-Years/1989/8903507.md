In recent years rule-based and frame-based systems became popular tools for
developing a wide range of knowledge intensive applications. Although these
tools provide significant help to the application developer, building expert
systems remains a largely ad hoc and a very labor-intensive activity. Recent
achievements in knowledge representation and deductive database research made
time ripe for attempting a systematic logic-based approach to expert systems.
The proposed contention is that expert system programming can be made more
declarative by releaving the developer from the burden of specifying most
details of control strategy. This burden should be taken over by the system
which will use various optimization techniques to achieve desirable response
time. In this research, a language which integrates rules and frames under one
roof, and is suitable for reasoning with uncertainty will be designed and
implemented. Being purely declarative, this language will allow shortening of
the development phase of knowledge-intensive applications and make them more
reliable and extensible. Industrial expert system developers as well as
knowledge engineering researchers will benefit from theresults of this research.
