The overall goal of this work is to determine the mechanisms of evolution of
physiological regulatory systems. We have identified an excellent model system
for such studies: the gastrointestinal hormones cholecystokinin (CCK) and
gastrin in the alligator. We will test the hypothesis that gastrin and gastrin
receptors evolved from CCK and CCK receptors in the primitive reptilia. The
specific aims of the proposed studies are to determine the structures of CCK and
gastrin in the alligator and to determine the properties of the alligator CCK
and gastrin receptors. Alligators are important in evolutionary studies because
they are closely related to the ancient reptiles that gave rise to all modern
birds and mammals. including man. One of the hallmarks of evolution is the
generation of new systems for regulation physiological processes, such as
digestion. This increased sophistication of digestion played a major role in the
evolution of endothermy, or warm-bloodedness, characteristic of birds and
mammals. Endothermy, in turn, allowed birds and mammals to become much more
successful than reptiles. Thus, studies of hormones and their responses in
alligators will lead to important new insights into the mechanisms of evolution
of physiological systems crucial to the success of life.
