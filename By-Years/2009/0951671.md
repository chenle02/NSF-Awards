Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has been a long standing model system in the
biological sciences for studies of photosynthesis, flagellar development and
other aspects of cell biology. Recently, as a fast-growing, photosynthetic
eukaryote, Chlamydomonas has attracted a great deal of interest as a source of
biomass and renewable energy. University of Minnesota-Twin Cities houses the
Chlamydomonas Resource Center (CRC) and its utility is enhanced by the
availability of the sequence of the nuclear, chloroplast and mitochondrial
genomes. CRC has a large collection of mutants and a complete genetic map linked
to the molecular map. The PI serves as the new Director of CRC and, in its 30th
year of operation, this stock collection center will continue to act as the
central repository to receive, catalogue, preserve and distribute wild type and
mutant cultures of C. reinhardtii. The Center will continue to maintain and
distribute molecular tools for Chlamydomonas research, including genomic and
cDNA clones of Chlamydomonas nuclear, chloroplast and mitochondrial genes, and
cDNA libraries. The Center will continue to distribute teaching kits, with
reagents, strains and instructions for high school and beginning college biology
class experiments. A web site [http://www.chlamy.org] will provide descriptions
of all cultures in the collection, historical information and reference material
on genetic loci and mutant alleles, genetic and molecular maps, and an extensive
bibliography.
