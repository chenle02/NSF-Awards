The Computer Equity Expert Project, which builds on a completed NSF-funded
pilot project, is designed to train 200 computer, science, and mathematics
education specialists throughout the U.S. to become trainers of teachers. The
focus of the training is on techniques to overcome gender biases in the teaching
and use of computers in science and mathematics at the middle school/junior high
school level and to attract more girls into fields which utilize computers.
Teacher Trainer participants will attend a five-and-a- half-day seminar on
either the East Coast or the West Coast followed by field experience training
teachers in their home states. The trainers will also attend a two-day follow up
session which will be held between four and six months after the initial
seminar. Networking activities will be planned at the seminars and will be a
major ingredient of the follow up sessions. The network which is formed will be
utilized to continue the training of teachers after NSF funding expires. Cost
sharing for this project in the amount of $90,000 is 9.8% of the NSF
contribution.
