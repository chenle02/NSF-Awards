Dr. Robert Hammer and other members of the Departments of Chemistry and
Biochemistry of Louisiana State University are being supported to establish a
Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in chemistry. For the period
1995-97, ten non-LSU undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer
actively engaged in a variety of research projects drawn from the traditional
areas of chemistry and biochemistry. The program also includes activities which
will improve students' proficiency in finding chemical information, in written
and oral communication skills, and in knowledge of research and career
opportunities in the chemical sciences. Recruitment will target regional
colleges and universities including predominantly minority institutions
