9321638 Bramble This is a comparative morphological study that addresses the
functional relationships between thoracic design and locomotor behavior among
highly cursorial, moderately cursorial, and non- cursorial members of the order
Lagomorpha (hares, cottontails, and pikas). A novel approach will be take to
understand the functional morphology of the thoracic complex: the mechanical
role of the lungs and the interaction of lungs, heart, and ribs, during
locomotion will be examined. A previously unexplored function of the lungs
within the thorax will be modeled: pneumatic stabilization. This study will test
the hypothesis that lungs, in addition to their role as gas exchangers, may act
as pneumatic stabilizers of the chest walls and heart and that this mechanism
will be positively correlated with running ability. A model will be developed
which describes the integrated function of the mammalian thoracic complex during
exercise based on the morphology, material properties, and mechanical
interactions of its constituent elements. High speed cineradiographic analysis
will be used in dynamic tests of both cadavers and live rabbits in order to
describe the interactions of elements of the thoracic complex and to test
essential predictions of the pneumatic stabilization model. ***
