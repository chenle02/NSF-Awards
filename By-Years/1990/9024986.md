This project will deal with specific free boundary problems arising in
industry. Our objectives are to establish existences, uniqueness, and regularity
of the free boundary problems. Some of the techniques to be used include the
minimization of functionals, fixed point theorem and penalization method. These
methods usually require some a priori estimates. It is often difficult to obtain
these estimates when the problem becomes very nonlinear, which is often the case
for problems related to industry. It is our task to overcome the difficulties
and reach our objectives. These problems are of interest to industries such as
those developing photocopying machines.
