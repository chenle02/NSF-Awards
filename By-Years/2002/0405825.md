Davis and Januszkiewicz plan to continue their research on
geometric&lt;br/&gt;group theory, nonpositively curved spaces and
L^2-cohomology. The &lt;br/&gt;major portion of their work will focus on the new
theory of the &lt;br/&gt;''weighted L^2-cohomology'' of the complex associated
to a Coxeter &lt;br/&gt;group. The "weighting" depends on word length in the
Coxeter group &lt;br/&gt;and a positive real parameter q. When q is integral,
the theory is &lt;br/&gt;intimately tied to the ordinary L^2-cohomology of
buildings. As q &lt;br/&gt;varies from 0 to infinity the theory interpolates
between ordinary &lt;br/&gt;cohomology and cohomology with compact supports.
Davis and &lt;br/&gt;Januszkiewicz are trying to calculate these weighted
cohomology &lt;br/&gt;spaces when q lies in a certain intermediate range. They
are also &lt;br/&gt;trying to extend this theory to other classes of groups
besides &lt;br/&gt;Coxeter groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theory of groups
generated by reflections plays an important role &lt;br/&gt;in many different
areas of mathematics, for example, in Lie theory &lt;br/&gt;and in the theory of
algebraic groups. Around 1960 J. Tits &lt;br/&gt;introduced the notion of a
"Coxeter group." Synonymous terminology &lt;br/&gt;might be an "abstract
reflection group." Coxeter groups form a much &lt;br/&gt;wider class of groups
than do the classical examples of geometric &lt;br/&gt;reflection groups.
Recently, they have become important in geometric &lt;br/&gt;group theory both
as a source of new examples and as a paradigm for &lt;br/&gt;predicting new
results. The new research on weighted L^2-cohomology &lt;br/&gt;has revealed
some unexpected connections between several different &lt;br/&gt;topics in the
theory of Coxeter groups. Much more remains to be
&lt;br/&gt;discovered.&lt;br/&gt;
