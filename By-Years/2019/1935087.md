Adaptation is a fundamental and defining feature of biology. In principle,
living systems can adapt via two mechanisms: evolution and learning. Learning is
a potentially rapid and powerful mode of adaptation. Even the simplest cells can
evolve, but can they demonstrate learning in the absence of evolution? If so,
what modes of learning can they engage in, and how simple can learning cells or
cell-like systems be? In setting out to address these fundamental questions
about the Rules of Life, this project will help to define the essential
biological nature of learning systems. This project will make important progress
towards the bottom-up construction of 'smart' synthetic cell systems, with
potential future applications across a wide range of academic, industry,
clinical and environmental settings. A multi-disciplinary cohort of graduate
students will be recruited and trained in interdisciplinary research, and a set
of 'science &amp; society' modules for bioengineering-related courses will be
developed. Furthermore, the project will engage a broader public audience by
developing hands-on activities related to the goals of the
project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to create synthetic cell systems
capable of associative learning. Specifically, the project will develop a
synthetic cell that learns to respond to a light pulse signal by associating it
with the addition of molecules detected by olfactory receptors. Success will
provide a proof-of-principle that genetically encoded information-processing
systems can carry out learning tasks, and will generate a reusable library of
learning circuit motifs. Modeling and design of associative learning circuits
will inform the development of corresponding genetic regulatory circuit
architectures. Multi-input chemical signals will be sensed using a library of
olfactory receptor proteins, and the effects of membrane encapsulation on system
behavior will be studied. Finally, an integrated Human Practices component will
explore the relationship between learning synthetic cells and artificial neural
networks/machine learning, from historical, conceptual and ethical
perspectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
