Sporoplasts prepared from mature ungerminated pollen of Lilium longiflorum
Thunb. will be used to prepare a suspension of subcellular pollen particles
which can be fractionated by gradient density centrifugation to yield "storage
bodies", organelles bearing phytin-rich inclusions. These organelles will be
studied for their phytase content, notably pH 5 and pH 8 phytases, which have
already been isolated and partially purified from whole pollen. Each phytase
activity will be purified to homogeniety and studied with regard to substrate
requirements, products formed, localization, and possible functions. The
question of phytate formation from 1L-myo-inositol-1-P will be examined to
determine whether 1L-myo-inositol-1-P synthase or myo- inositol kinase is
responsible from the first step of phosphorylation. This will be done by
measuring hydrogen isotope exchange at C5 of D-glucose-6-P during its conversion
to 1L-myo-inositol-1-P, a procedure used successfully in previous studies of the
path of carbon from D-glucose-6-P to UDP-D-glucoronate and cell wall products of
glucoronate metabolism. The significance of this research is explaining the role
of phosphate in regulating plant metabolism. Phytate is a phosphorus storage
compound of crucial importance yet practically nothing is known of how it is
made by the plant. Phosphates play important regulatory roles in carbohydrate
metabolism which in turn determines plant productivity.***//
