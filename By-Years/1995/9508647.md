9508647 DANFORTH This award will support DNA sequencing of part of two genes and
the combination of these molecular data with the PI's recent morphological
analysis of species and species group level phylogeny for the genus Lasioglossum
(Insecta: Hymenoptera: Halictidae). Many of the bees in this genus are solitary
but other species show varying degrees of social behavior. It is believed that
eusociality has arisen and possibly reversed several times within the genus but
the number of times is in dispute. The phylogeny obtained by this study will be
utilized to address questions of sex ratios and reproductive behaviors involved
in the origins of eusociality as well as the distribution of social and
presocial behaviors among the various lineages in the genus Lasioglossum. %%%
This research will contribute to our knowledge of the biological diversity of a
large genus of bees in the family Halictidae. These insects are important
pollinators, in general, including being the primary pollinators for certain
crops like alfalfa. The information on relationships among species and species
groups in the genus Lasioglossum will be used to test basic research hypotheses
about conditions related to origins of social behavior in insects. ***
