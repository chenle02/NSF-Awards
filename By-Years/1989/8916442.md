The areas of the Olutorsky Peninsula and the Kuul suture zone of northeastern
USSR are important terranes that border the northern Pacific basin, analogous in
some ways to southern Alaska. Presently, no reliable paleomagnetic data is
available from the region, however, terranes present may record motion across
the Pacific basin. This project will analyze paleomag- netically samples
collected during a cooperative field project with personnel from the Laboratory
of Regional Geodynamics, based in Moscow. Results are expected to provide
insights into the plate tectonic history of the Pacific basin and contribute to
the accretionary history of the Koryak region.
