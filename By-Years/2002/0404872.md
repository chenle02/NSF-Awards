This project is creating a versatile system for reliable assessments of student
learning outcomes for capstone design courses across engineering disciplines and
institutions. It builds on a decade of engineering design education and
assessment achievements of the Transferable Integrated Design Engineering
Education (TIDEE) consortium in the Pacific Northwest. Prior to this project,
the investigators engaged regional and national collaborators to: (a) develop a
consensus profile of a top quality engineer; (b) define engineering design
learning outcomes at mid-point and end-of-program; (c) develop and test reliable
assessment instruments for engineering design; and (d) facilitate dozens of
workshops to help faculty define and assess engineering design learning
outcomes. In this project, a multi-institution faculty team is developing
assessment tools with input from a diverse set of expert consultants and
stakeholders. Assessment instruments are being built around frequently used
classroom assignments to measure achievement of high-level integrated
performances in capstone design courses. Performance expectations are being
derived from a profile of a top quality engineer for applicability to a full
range of capstone engineering design courses. The developed assessment
instruments are being tested for quality in diverse institutions and student
populations to demonstrate their transferability.
