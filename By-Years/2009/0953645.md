0953645&lt;br/&gt;Xu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the proposed integrated
research and educational activities are to advance a novel approach for super-
resolution imaging and sensing using dielectric-filled nanowaveguides and to
make opportunities in science and engineering education more accessible to all
students, especially historically underrepresented minorities in science and
engineering through undergraduate mentoring, curriculum development and outreach
activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will focus on the study of
optical properties of dielectric-filled nanowaveguides and the application of
these nanowaveguide devices to super-resolution imaging and single molecule
spectroscopy. The objectives of this research are to: (1) fabricate silicon-
filled nanowaveguides and explore the possibility of other filling materials,
(2) characterize in detail the far-field transmission properties and near-field
intensity profiles of the nanowaveguides, (3) engineer nanowaveguide devices and
test them on a near-field optical scanning microscope, and (4) apply these
devices to biomedical and biotechnological research to solve challenging
problems in these fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the educational
activities is to make opportunities in science and engineering education more
accessible to all students, especially historically underrepresented minorities
in science and engineering. To accomplish this, the following approaches will be
taken: (1) undergraduate research mentoring via one-on-one interaction between
students and the PI, (2) new course development and curriculum innovation that
incorporates research into teaching, and (3) outreach activities through mentor
participation in programs like the Harlem Children Society and the New York
State Education Department's Science &amp; Technology Entry Program (STEP).
