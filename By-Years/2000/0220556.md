The American Association of University Women (AAUW) Educational Foundation is
producing a summary of what has been learned from projects funded by NSF and the
AAUW Educational Foundation from 1993 through 2001.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both
organizations have funded research and demonstration projects in education,
particularly science, mathematics, engineering, and technology education, that
increase the participation of girls and women, and provide equal access to
learning. The research team will summarize what is found in a number of areas,
including gender differences in math and science skills and performance,
differences among girls due to ethnicity and race, successful approaches that
engage female students, factors that influence girls and women to pursue study
in these fields, critical junctures for female SMET majors in higher education,
and determinants to persistence at the graduate level. The study will use
findings, evaluation results and accounts of innovative efforts reported in 175
projects funded by NSF and 200 projects funded by AAUW Educational
Foundation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The published synthesis of findings and results
will be disseminated widely to education policy makers, teachers and
administrators via AAUW's publishing and marketing programs.&lt;br/&gt;
