This award funds investigation of an approach to detecting and recognizing
deformable articulated shapes, such as people and animals, from real images. The
approach involves specifying a "language" for representing such objects, based
on previous work on deformable template models. These models represent objects
probabilistically, where the probabilities are required to specify likely
geometric deformations of the object and of the imaging function. To handle
effects such as lighting changes or partial occlusion of the object. These
models, however, are complex, and so detecting them in images poses formidable
combinatorial optimization challenges. This research explores a strategy which
makes use of a small number of image "primitives" which can be thought of as key
features. These may include both local image structures such as image corners
and larger structures such as symmetric shapes. These should be simple enough
that well-established optimization techniques can detect them optimally. The
primitives are desaribed probabilistically, like the object models, enabling the
use of information theory to quantify how much information a particular
primitive provides about the preseance or absence, or configuration of the
object in an image. It also enables optimal choices of primitives to be made,
with the goal of finding primitives that are easy to compute and convey maximal
information about the objects in the image.
