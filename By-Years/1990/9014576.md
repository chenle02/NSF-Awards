Once a program has been written, it can be checked against its specification
either statically (i.e. program verification) or dynamically (i.e. testing). The
project merges these techniques by assuming that assertions are always checked
dynamically but optimizing away as many checks as possible. Thus, program
verification becomes a special case of code optimization. Code optimization and
program verification will be linked by using the specification for program
components to optimize the programs that use them. Program components with
specifications are likely to be faster than those without, thus encouraging
programmers to specify them. The project will also study how to provide
performance information so that the programmer can see how to add assertions to
improve performance and can see when components are used incorrectly. The
project will use the TS compiler for Typed Smalltalk and the mu-ral interactive
theorem prover.
