The proposed research will use Neotropical singing mice (genus Scotinomys) to
explore how behavioral and neural mechanisms moderate competitive interactions
between species and, in turn, limit species distributions. The objectives of the
study are to 1) investigate how Alston's singing mouse (S. teguina) perceives
and responds to the songs of a closely related and dominant species, the
Chiriqui singing mouse (S. xerampelinus); and 2) to identify the neural
substrates that contribute to between-species dominance interactions. The
research involves both laboratory and field playback experiments in Costa Rican
montane cloud forests where S. teguina is found alone (allopatric) or with S.
xerampelinus (sympatric). The integrative nature of the study enables us to link
changes in song perception at the neural level to changes in distribution at the
geographic level. Examining the mechanisms and function of mammalian
vocalization also presents exciting opportunities to identify convergent and
divergent pathways of perception in birds and other vertebrate taxa. The
research involves substantial outreach to elementary and middle schools in Costa
Rica and Gainesville, FL. Lastly, the work will help forge international
collaborations throughout Latin America.
