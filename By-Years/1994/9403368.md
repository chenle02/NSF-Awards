9403368 Silver This award is under the International Junior Investigator and
Postdoctoral Fellows Program, which enables U.S. scientists and engineers to
conduct three to twelve months of research abroad at research centers of proven
excellence. The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and
the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental
conditions abroad. This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research
visit by Dr. Gail C. Silver to work with Dr. Claude Helene of the Museum
National d'Historie Naturelle in Paris, France. This research concerns the
stabilization of triple-helical nucleic acids for control of oncogene
expression. This is based on the recently investigated possibility of
interfering directly with gene expression by targeting deoxyribonucleic acid
(DNA) with oligonucleotides. The "anti-gene" oligonucleotides bind in a
sequence-specific manner in the major groove of the double-stranded target to
form a triple helix, also known as a triplex. Cancers are often the result of
over expression of certain genes or the expression of mutated genes. These
strategies have the potential to be used to inactivate the expression of genes
that contribute to cancer development. If the sequence of the oncogene is known,
a complementary sequence can be made to bind to that particular gene and thus
overcome cell proliferation. Though the potential of triplex technology is hard
to assess, there is promise and these experiments will help further
understanding by providing a means of stabilizing the triple helix structure.
