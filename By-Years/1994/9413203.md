9413203 Walker Luther Northwestern Theological Seminary requests support from
NSF for connection of its campus network to NSFNET. They will contract with
MRNet for delivery of Internet services including a connection to NSFNET. The
College needs greater functionality and network speed to be able to access
supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers along with being able to
implement a more reliable mail system. Students and faculty research will
benefit from the link. This is also a unique opportunity for the school to
explore innovative educational resources.
