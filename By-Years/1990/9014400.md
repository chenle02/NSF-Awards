The requested equipment consists of a specially-designed, double-action,
hydraulically-actuated machine that is suitable for a variety of mechanical
tests related to material forming operations. The precise position sensors and
special computer control technology can produce a variety of operating
schedules, thereby allowing the Hydraulic Forming Simulator to emulate many
kinds of standard testing machines, industrial presses, and other mechanical
devices while precisely controlling and recording loads, rates, and positions.
The Hydraulic Forming Simulator will be used by researchers involved in sheet
forming, forging, polymer and composite forming, and material testing. Its
flexible design insures that it can serve for many years as a state-of-the-art
mechanical testing platform for forming research.
