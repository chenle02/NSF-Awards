Dr. Bryant proposes to continue his analysis of the lethal(1)discs large-1
(l(1)d.lg-1) locus, and oncogene of Drosophila melanogaster. Mutations in this
locus cause neoplastic transformation of the imaginal tissue leading to an
extended larval life and a block in pupariation. Other alleles allow normal
imaginal growth but interfere with differentiation during metamorphosis. His
initial genetic and molecular characterization of the locus has revealed the
presence of at least three complementation groups and a complex pattern of
expression of the l(1)d.lg-1 transcripts. Sequencing of partial cDNAs indicates
that the locus encodes at least two different peptides, one of which appears to
be transmembrane. Database homology searches have shown that the predicted
l(1)d.lg-1 proteins contain the src homology region 3 or A-box. This amino acid
motif has been found in several of the vertebrate oncogenes and can regulate the
transforming ability of these proteins. Dr. Bryant plans to isolate full length
cDNAs for the l(1)d.lg-1 transcripts to determine the sequence of the entire
protein. He will also use these cDNAs to make minigene transformation constructs
to correlate the genetic and molecular results. He will make antibodies to each
of the predicted peptides to use for localization and biochemical
characterization. Finally he will attempt to analyze the function of the A-box
by sequencing this region from the pre-existing alleles of l(1)d.lg-1 and by
creating specific alterations in this domain using in vitro mutagenesis. The
results from these experiments should reveal how mutations in the l(1)d.lg-1
oncogene can cause neoplastic transformation and should help clarify the
relationship of this gene to the vertebrate oncogenes. %%% This study will yield
information about the regulation of a gene involved in growth control during
development in Drosophila. This gene has homologies to mammalian genes involved
in the transformation to malignant growth.
