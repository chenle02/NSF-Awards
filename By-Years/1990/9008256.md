This is a renewal grant for a theoretical program studying the structure and
excitations of low dimensional systems. The systems studied in this program are
quasi-one-and-two dimensional systems including the conducting polymers, two
dimensional strongly correlated lattice fermion systems relevant to the
superconducting oxides, the organic charge transfer salts, and the alkalides
which represent a new class of synthetic Mott insulators. We will explore the
low energy physics in these systems which leads to structures with broken
translational symmetry, and particularly phenomena which can lead to modulated
or incommensurate structures in the ground state. The structure of these novel
states of matter and their low lying excitations will be studied.//
