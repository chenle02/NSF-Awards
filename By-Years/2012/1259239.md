Colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals or quantum dots (NCs) are small, highly
fluorescent inorganic particles that potentially combine the positive qualities
of crystalline semiconductors and small organic molecules. Recently, researchers
have discovered a fundamental chemical reaction mechanism underlying low
temperature preparations of II-VI and IV-VI chalcogenide NCs, such as CdSe or
PbSe NCs. The overall goal of the project will involve scaling up the NC
synthesis reaction 1000-fold, while maintaining high quality nanoparticles as
measured by standard metrics. The general approach is to use NC chemical
precursor molecules with tunable reactivity to control rates of NC growth.
Researchers will have the ability to nucleate huge amounts of smaller NCs and
then use these nanoparticles to seed the growth of larger sized NCs on a much
bigger scale than traditionally used. There will be particular focus on near-
infrared NCs, which are not available commercially, and which fluoresce at bio-
medically relevant wavelengths where organic dyes emit poorly.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NCs can potentially drive novel technology in areas that
are traditionally the exclusive domain of either molecules (such as biomedical
imaging) or bulk inorganic semiconductors (such as solar cells, displays, light
emitting devices, and novel lasers). For example, NCs have many advantages over
organic dyes traditionally used for biological imaging including much brighter
fluorescence, significantly more photostability, and the ability to image at
several wavelengths simultaneously. By the end of this project researchers plan
to have developed the methodology to synthesize on the large scale core-shell
NCs, for visible and infrared photonic applications, providing a very large set
of potential opportunities for a startup company based on this technology.
