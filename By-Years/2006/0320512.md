This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
wafer-scale process for the reliable fabrication of Carbon NanoTube (CNT) based
probe tips for Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). This project will make use of a
novel technique for controlling the placement, number and dimensions of vertical
carbon nanotubes, growing them directly onto silicon cantilevers for use as AFM
probe tips. The process is based on catalyst deposition and lift-off, followed
by use of electric field enhanced chemical vapor deposition growth chamber.
Challenges to be overcome in this project include integration of the deposition
and growth processes with the harsh environment necessary for cantilever micro-
fabrication, and achieving uniformity of CNT dimensions and characteristics at
wafer scale. Successful development of this process would enable the batch
fabrication of carbon nanotube probe tips (up to 192/wafer) with controlled
length, diameter, vertical orientation and crystalline morphology. CNTs make
nearly ideal tips for many AFM applications, given their durability, high aspect
ratio, and resolution achieved. The initial commercial application developed
will be a CNT-based AFM probe for tapping mode microscopes. This process can
also be extended to specific demanding applications such as high-aspect
ratio/deep trench metrology, and thermal, conductive and magnetic imaging.
