The broader impacts of this collaborative project include furthering
understanding of different types of El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events
and their predictability, and the training of two graduate students, This
project will further our understanding of the dynamics and predictability of
Central Pacific and East Pacific ENSO events. The research team has extensive
experience in using observational constrained approaches as well as in
undertaking simulations using a suite of physical models.

The following scientific questions will be addressed: What dynamical processes
are responsible for the evolution of initial structures into a particular type
of ENSO event? Are there physical mechanisms that can explain the stochastic
forcing of these initial structures? How do initial structures and stochastic
forcing throughout the evolution of a particular event affect the predictability
of a particular type of ENSO event? How important - and how predictable - are
changes in mean state conditions versus changes in stochastic forcing in
influencing long-term variations in the statistics of different types of ENSO
events?
