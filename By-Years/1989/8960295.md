The objective of this proposal is to test the concept of using paratope analogs
of proteins as ligands in liquid chromatography. Preliminary experiments have
shown that short peptides may serve as analogs of paratopes (binding sites of
antibodies) and can bind proteins at a level high enough above background to be
reliably detected. The specificity of these interactions is, however, not known.
The proposed research will determine whether these analogs can be used in liquid
chromatographic separations. If successful, these ligands will facilitate the
separation and isolation of proteins in biochemical and medical research, in
pharmaceutical manufacturing operations and in quality control of therapeutic
proteins. The benefits could be immense.
