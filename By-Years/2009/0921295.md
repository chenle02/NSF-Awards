Many important Earth science questions can be addressed by determining the time
at which specific rock samples became exposed at the Earth's surface. For
example, a terminal moraine consists of boulders deposited at the front of a
glacier as it melts; hence the surface exposure age of the boulders constrains
the timing of glacial retreat. Over the last fifteen years great progress has
been made in the development of techniques to measure such ages via the
accumulation of rare isotopes produced by interactions in the uppermost ~ 1
meter of Earth's surface between high energy cosmic rays and the atoms in rocks.
Accurate "cosmogenic dating" requires that the rate and systematics of isotope
production be accurately known. This project will investigate a particularly
poorly understood part of these systematics - the processes occurring at the
air-rock interface, where cosmic rays transition from one medium (atmosphere) in
to a very different one (rock). Nuclear processes at this interface will be
investigated through high spatial resolution analyses in the uppermost few cm of
rock of several different isotopes produced by cosmic rays, including helium-3
and neon-21. In addition, synthetic mineral targets will be exposed to cosmic
ray irradiation at high elevation in the Andes, where the cosmic ray flux is
very high. These targets will be retrieved and analyzed at high spatial
resolution for the same set of isotopes. The synthetic targets complement the
work on natural rocks because they permit a far more controlled environment in
terms of chemical composition and exposure history. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
ultimate goal of this research is to increase the accuracy and reliability of
using cosmogenic isotopes as tools for determining the age of the Earth's
surface. This research has widespread application to investigations of many
relevant processes such as rates of erosion, timing of fault movements, and in
documenting Quaternary climate change.
