At the Colorado School of Mines (CSM) we are about to enter the fourth year of
a comprehensive curriculum improvement process undertaken in response to
concerns about systemic problems in engineering education. To date we have
developed a mission statement and a set of attributes which we wish all
graduates of the School to achieve including technical depth and breadth,
communication skills, international awareness, flexibility, and ethics. We have
also studied our current curriculum and the curricula at other leading
engineering schools and have developed a tentative framework for a new
curriculum in which we emphasize programs, pedagogy, and process. In the next
few years we plan to build on existing excellent programs at CSM to develop a
design-across-the curriculum program, a sequence of Systems courses, and an
enhanced and thoroughly integrated humanities and social sciences component. In
addition, we will build on our long teaching history and our Office of Teaching
Effectiveness to explore the best pedagogies for these new programs and to
prepare faculty for teaching in them. Finally, we will incorporate a refined
assessment/continuous improvement program into our new curriculum. This program
will grow out of our already mature and well-recognized state-mandated portfolio
assessment program. As we develop, pilot, and fully implement a unique
undergraduate engineering curriculum, our tangible products will include new
texts, laboratory experiments, and hard copy and multimedia course materials.
More importantly, we will produce students who are better prepared for science
and engineering careers and faculty who are better prepared to teach them. Over
the long-term, this project will help continue our transformation from an
institution focused on teaching to one focused on learning. Our project can
serve as benchmark for both the products and the process of curricular revision
elsewhere.
