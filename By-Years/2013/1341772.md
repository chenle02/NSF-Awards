The problem of visual recognition is fundamental towards the goal of automatic
image understanding. While a large number of efforts have been made in the
computer vision community, machine performance at these tasks remains
significantly inferior to human ability. &lt;br/&gt;The overarching goal of this
project is to leverage the best known visual recognition system - the human
visual recognition system. This project employs a "Human Debugging" paradigm to
replace various components of a machine vision pipeline with human subjects, and
examines the resultant effect on recognition performance. Meaningful comparisons
provide valuable insights and pinpoint aspects of the machine vision pipeline
that are performance bottlenecks and require future research efforts.
Specifically, the project considers the problems of image classification and
object detection, and explores the roles of local and global information, as
well part-detection, spatial modeling and contextual reasoning (including non-
maximal suppression) for these problems respectively. &lt;br/&gt;This project
touches on a wide range of problems in visual recognition including object
recognition, scene recognition and object detection. This novel paradigm of
identifying weak links in computational models via humans in the loop is also
applicable to other vision problems, as well as other sub-fields in AI. By
sharing all collected data and results, and through organized conferences and
workshops, this project will initiate and fuel a dialogue with the research
community about leveraging humans to advance computer vision. More broadly, this
work encourages the involvement of young women and undergraduate students in
computer science research.
