9452580 Elenbogen The project will construct a parallel and distributed computer
laboratory, running the Linda parallel language on a SUN workstation network.
The Linda programming language construct support various models parallelism and
are supported by a variety of base languages. In particular Joyce and C will be
supported. The laboratory would be devoted to a course in parallel and
distributed algorithm development. This course is based on the ACM-IEEE course
AL9 as part of its 1991 computing curricula. During class time, students would
individually view demonstrations of parallel algorithms using a windowed
environment to simulate several different architectures. Students would be able
to individually view the algorithms at their own pace. Outside of class,
students would write their own parallel and distributed algorithms, using Linda.
Projects and demonstrations would make use of Linda's graphical debugging tool
to view simultaneously the entire state of all processes as well as the data
movement. Labs would be developed and made available which could be used at
other institutions to teach their own parallel and distributed programming
courses.
