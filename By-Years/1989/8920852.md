It is well-recognized that women are underrepresented in science and engineering
studies. Their low representation is cause for concern because of its
implications for the quality of the scientific and engineering labor force in
the United States. It is well-known that gender differences in performance and
interest in science and mathematics begin as early as junior high school.
Understanding the factors that contribute to the differences are crucial in
bringing about change. This research on antecedents of academic achievement will
contribute to understanding this crucial period. The research focuses on home
and school circumstances, including parental encouragement and peer pressures,
that contribute to change in academic achievement over a two to four year period
after 7th and 9th grades. The sample includes 2,236 students who attended 14
South Carolina public schools in 1986. The results will show how differential
development in academic achievement of girls and boys during adolescence is
related to a variety of conditions in early adolescence, reflecting the
student's abilities and orientations, and his/her relationships with the major
agencies of socialization--the family, the school, the peer group, and mass
media.
