9422106 Leahy This award is to purchase equipment dedicated to research in
computer and information science and engineering. Specifically, the equipment
will be used for research in multi-dimensional signal and image processing,
including in particular: 1) fusion of multimodal neuroimaging data; 2) adaptive
quantization of image and video; 3) automatic target recognition via deformable
template matching; 4) design of high resolution diffractive optics for photonic
interconnections and computing; and 5) advanced adaptive multidimensional and
array signal processing. Common to all of these projects is a need for access to
fast numerical computation and high resolution visualization and display
capabilities. The goal of this project is to set up a state of the art facility
for processing, visualization and display of multidimensional data. Towards this
end, a computer for high performance numerical computation, and a RAM-based
workstation for display of high resolution video image sequences with a high
performance graphics capability will be purchased. ***
