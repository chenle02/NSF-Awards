Abstract Radulescu Radulescu will investigate in this project a range of
problems in the structure theory of von Neumann algebras. He will concentrate on
the harmonic analysis of the von Neumann algebras arising in connection with
discrete groups, free probability and in deformation quantization theory. The
goal is to determine the structure of the von Neumann algebras that reflect the
properties of non commutative probability, and to relate this structure to the
representation theory of Lie groups and their discrete subgroups. Radulescu
intends to investigate the problem of characterizing the factors of discrete
groups by computing their invariants, using ideas of Murray and von Neumann,
related to the fundamental groups of such an algebra, the set of all index
values for subfactors or the structure of convex sets of non-commutative
moments. He will investigate also Connes embedding conjecture via tensor
products on operator algebras.

The aim of this research is to discover non-commutative aspects of the real word
hidden in "quantum" structures. Non-commutativity is a true aspect of the
nature: for example two matrices do not necessary commute when multiplied. The
famous Heisenberg's Uncertaneity principle reveals the same non-commutative
aspect of nature. Von Neumann has developed a class of "continuous" matrices,
that, while keeping some of the properties of usual matrices, are subtle enough
to encode many of the aspects of quantum mechanics. Recent developments by Jones
have proven that aspects of such von Neumann algebras are intimately related to
aspects of topology, knot theory and ultimately biology. Likewise recent work by
Voiculescu has proven that the there is a non-commutative probability theory
encoded by the same type of objects. The aim of this research project is to
contribute to the understanding and classification of some of the structural
aspects of von Neumann algebras. _________________________________________
