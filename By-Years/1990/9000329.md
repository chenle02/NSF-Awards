Lasers emit a narrow beam of coherent, powerful and nearly monochromatic
electromagntic radiation. This intense beam of coherent visible and infrared
light excites the atoms of the optical resonator to a higher energy level and
the resonator forces the excited atoms to radiate in phase. Lasers are useful in
optics, communication, and engineering. This award from the Chemistry Shared
Instrumentation Program will help the Department of Chemistry at Princeton
University purchase laser equipment. This equipment will be used in the
following research activities: a) High Power Pulse Shaping for Laser Selective
Chemistry b) Photodissociation and Molecular Relaxation in Molecular Beams of
Clusters c) Time-dependent Study of Intramolecular Energy Flows d) Structural
and Dynamics in Proteins and Metalloporphyrins e) Structure and Dynamics of
Biomimetic Multiheme Assemblies f) Fast Reactions at Electrodes g) Motional
Dynamics in DNA
