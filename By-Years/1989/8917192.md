This award provides funds for 45% of the cost of acquiring a modern
multicollector thermal ionization source mass spectrometer that will be
installed and operated in the Department of Earth and Space Sciences at the
University of California, Los Angeles. The University is committed to providing
the remaining 55%. UCLA is establishing a major center for isotope geochemistry,
and this equipment is a vital part of that effort. The spectrometer will be used
in a wide spectrum of research applications, ranging from the evolution of the
crust-mantle system through studies of volcanic and crustal rocks and to
analysis of elemental and isotopic partitioning between mineral phases.
