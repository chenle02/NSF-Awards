Title: SASSY: Self-Architecting Software Systems

PI: Daniel Menasce Co-PIs: Hassan Gomaa, Joao Sousa, Sam Malek

This research proposes a framework for Self-Architecting Software Systems
(SASSY), a significant paradigm shift in architecting large-scale real-world
software systems. Focusing on service-oriented architectures, SASSY includes: 1)
Self-architecting: given the service and Quality of Service (QoS) requirements,
an optimal architecture is automatically generated with the aid of design
patterns. The merit of architectural alternatives is evaluated with the aid of
multivariate utility functions. 2) Activity-based specification: behavioral
requirements are expressed as activity schemas annotated with QoS requirements
and domain ontology. 3) Unification of evolution and adaptation: both the
evolution of requirements and changes on monitored run-time conditions and QoS
trigger the revaluation of architectural alternatives, and, to the extent
possible, the automatic reconfiguration of systems. The intellectual merit lies
in the development of a novel framework that advances the representation of
software architecture and mixed-initiative activities, while integrating
optimization theory and analytic models of QoS. The broader impact includes 1)
improved productivity in the software industry, due to significant automation;
2) the open-source availability of the tools developed to support and validate
this research; and 3) improved software engineering education by incorporating
results of this research into graduate and undergraduate courses at George Mason
University and publication at educational forums.
