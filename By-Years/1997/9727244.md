9727224 Martindale The Structure, Evolution, and Deployment of the Hox Cluster
in a Basal Cnidarian Modern day animals exhibit a bewildering array of forms, or
"body Plans." Classical biological approaches, such as paleontology and
comparative embryology, have so far proved unable to elucidate the evolutionary
transitions responsible for new body plans. Fortunately, molecular biology has
revealed underlying evidence of continuity. For example, animals as divergent as
mice and fruitflies have been found to use a common set of genes to establish
their anterior-posterior axis during development. These genes, known as Hox
genes, are important because they represent a conserved feature of development
that is shared by animals whose body plans have diverged during evolution. Only
by recognizing such conserved features can we hope to identify the evolution of
novel mechanisms responsible for new body plans. We have recovered Hox genes
from a sea anemone, a simple marine animal whose body plan is radically
different from both mice and flies. Evidently, the Hox genes are very ancient
and must have evolved prior to the evolutionary split between these highly
divergent organisms, over 500 million years ago. Interestingly, sea anemones do
not possess an anterior-posterior axis. This inconsistency raises two important
questions: (1) What is the present-day role of Hox genes in animals such as sea
anemones that lack an anterior-posterior axis? And (2) What does this reveal
about the ancestral role of the Hox genes? Our research seeks to establish the
role of Hox genes in the sea anemone by examining the chromosomal organization
of these genes, and by determining where and when these genes are "turned-on" in
the developing organism. In doing so, we expect to gain insight into the role of
these genes during evolution and their significance for the evolution of animal
body plans.
