The overall objective of the proposed research is to identify and isolate the
regulatory components of the Bacillus subtilis SOS DNA repair system and start
to characterize the molecular details of its regulation. Evidence available to
date suggests that the well-characterized Escherichia coli SOS system may be
highly conserved in B. subtilis. In E. coli, induction of the SOS DNA repair
genes is due to the RecA protein-mediated cleavage of the SOS gene repressor,
LexA protein. It appears that an analogous mechanism, involving the B. subtilis
RecA protein analogue, occurs in B. subtilis. The specific aims of this project
are to (1) characterize the regulatory DNA sequences of four distinct B.
subtilis DNA damage-inducible genes; (2) purify the protein (presumably a LexA
analogue) that binds to these sequences and clone the corresponding gene; and
(3) characterize the interactions of this protein with the regulatory DNA
sequences and with the B. subtilis RecA protein analogue. The methods will
include using the regulatory DNA sequences to (1) identify the protein and track
its purification in DNase footprinting assays; (2) construct an affinity column
to facilitate the protein purification; and (3) probe a lambda gt11 library for
the gene that codes for the protein. At present, the regulation of inducible DNA
repair is only understood for E. coli. This research will be a decisive step
toward understanding the regulation of the SOS DNA repair system in B. subtilis,
an organism that is not closely related to E. coli.
