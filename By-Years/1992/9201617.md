This project is an effort for coordinated study of the coupled upper
atmospheric regions, particularly during rapidly varying geomagnetic storm
conditions. It will be carried out in collaboration with other workshops
organized to focus on specific storm intervals. The program addresses carrying
out multi-station studies of the coupled upper atmospheric regions at different
heights and on a global scale.
