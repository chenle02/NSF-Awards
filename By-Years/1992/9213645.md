The objective of this faculty internship is to investigate research issues
related to productivity and quality improvement through ergonomics initiatives.
Research activities include the integration of ergonomics into engineering
design, development of an information system for accurate reporting and
documentation of ergonomics hazards, and testing of the utility of symptoms
surveys and perceived comfort ratings in identifying ergonomics hazards. The
research will be conducted with two industrial co- investigators with the
ultimate goal of integrating the quality program and ergonomics program within
the sponsoring industrial site. Analysis of human interface points in advanced
manufacturing departments are expected to provide generic guidelines applicable
to other industrial settings.
