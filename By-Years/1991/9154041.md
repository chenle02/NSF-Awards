Inter American University of Puerto Rico will carry out a project to improve
the science knowledge and pedagogical skills of preservice elementary teachers.
The project provides eight weeks of summer workshops each year, four in the
biological/health sciences and four in the physical and earth sciences. The
workshops are limited to recent graduates of the IAU teacher preparation program
who have secured teaching positions for the fall, and will take place during the
summer between graduation and the first year of teaching. Up to sixty teachers
per year over a period of three years will participate in these workshops, for a
total of approximately 180 teachers served. Class visitations and follow-up
support will take place during the teachers' first year in the classroom. The
workshops address a critical, often-neglected area of teacher preparation, that
of induction of the new teacher into the teaching profession. Since these
workshops are strategically scheduled to be taken during the summer before the
teacher enters the classroom, these experiences will be freshest in the minds of
the teachers as they begin teaching. The project will have a strong influence in
shaping these new teachers' attitudes, habits, and practice in elementary
science teaching which should continue throughout their careers. The University
has pledged to institutionalize successful project activities and will use the
workshops as a basis for upgrading the science preparation of all elementary
teachers. The University's cost-sharing is 16% of the amount contributed by NSF.
