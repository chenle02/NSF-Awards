This SBIR Phase I research project would demonstrate proof of principle for the
production of ultra capacitors with energy densities competitive with lithium
ion batteries, but that can be charged in seconds to minutes as opposed to hours
or days. These ultra capacitors are based on the development of new, super-high
permittivity (30-100,000 epsilon) nanostructured titanate particles that allow
for high charge storage along with high dielectric breakdown strength that are
arranged in percolative networks in a very low cost polymeric film. More
specifically, the project goal will be to demonstrate multilayer capacitor
prototypes having dielectric breakdown strength above 5000 V/mil and effective
permittivity above 20,000 (goal is 30,000) at room temperature, and demonstrate
the feasibility of fabricating these formulations into capacitor devices using
an innovative low cost metallized film production technology.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The successful development of high energy ultra capacitors
having energy storage densities above 150 J/cc has the potential to
revolutionize energy storage and power conversion technologies for backup power
supplies, as well as plug-in and hybrid vehicles by greatly reducing the size
and cost of energy storage systems. Competing products are flywheel storage,
advanced battery chemistries, and electrolytic capacitors, which are all
substantially more expensive and have lower performance. The primary current
market for film-foil super-capacitors is high peak power electrical applications
and includes pulse power supplies (lasers and flash lamps), defibrillators, and
high rep rate applications. &lt;br/&gt;
