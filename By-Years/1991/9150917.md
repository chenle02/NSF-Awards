Although computer science has its foundations in mathematical theory, the two
disciplines have drifted apart over the last decade. Computer science programs
place too little stress on theoretical foundations and mathematics programs
emphasize pure mathematics and service courses with little attention to the
computational sciences. This project brings the disciplines closer together with
a sequence of four introductory courses that integrate mathematical foundations
and algorithmic computation. The foundations courses introduce abstract
mathematical concepts that become the basis for algorithm development in the
algorithmic computation courses. The latter courses use the functional and
logical programming paradigms so that students can directly implement and test
mathematical concepts in the laboratory. By stressing visualization, concrete
examples, and practical applications in the laboratory, these courses make
abstract concepts more accessible to under-prepared students than current
approaches. This effort is the first year of a three year development; the first
pair of two pairs of courses are being prepared and taught. Products include
text materials and software for the laboratory activities.
