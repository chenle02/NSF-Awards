This research, funded by the NSF Theoretical and Computational Chemistry
Program, treats two topics in the theory of state-to-state reaction dynamics.
First, hydrogen atom exchange in heavy-light-heavy-atom systems is treated by
quantum or semi-classical (phase space) dynamics. Second, scattering resonances
will be computed by Fourier analysis of high energy quantum wavepackets evolving
in the transition state region. A complex gas phase reaction consists of many
elementary steps such as O+HCl = OH+Cl occurring sequentially or in parallel.
The first research topic is the development of mathematical methods for
predicting the rate of such an elementary reaction, in particular, one involving
the transfer of a hydrogen atom from one heavy atom to another. The theory
treats the dependence of the reaction rate upon the initial relative
translational energy of the reactants and the vibrational and rotational quantum
states of the reactants and products. In the course of a chemical reaction the
molecular system usually passes through a high energy configuration known as the
transition state. The second research topic attempts to follow the behavior of a
molecular system which starts out in the transition state region. One way to
prepare molecules in this initial condition in the laboratory is to first
generate a stable negative complex ion having (approximately) the appropriate
geometry, and then suddenly remove one electron by laser excitation
(photodetachment). One goal of this research project is to develop the theory of
these photodetachment experiments.
