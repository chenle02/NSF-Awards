An eight.week Research Experiences for Undergraduates program will be supported
by this grant. Ten students will work individually or in small groups on
projects in several areas ofmathematics. The advisory staff includes two
principal investigators, three faculty associates and a graduate assistant.
Participants will choose or design their own projects, prepare written reports
on their activities and participate in mini.courses, which will be videotaped
for distribution. Ample computing facilities ranging from a MacIntosh laboratory
to a Sequent parallel machine will be available. Research topics will be chosen
from a variety of areas of faculty expertise. They include ergodic theory, graph
theory and combinatorics, probability, number theory and commutative algebra.
The department is also nationally recognized for its research concentration on
the mathematics of tomography. This award represents the principal
investigator's fifth REU site award. Many of the 40 former participants are now
pursuing graduate work in science.
