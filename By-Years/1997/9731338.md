97-31338 Linda Shore This project will conduct a "proof of concept" around
establishing a two-year program for novice teachers recruited from the San
Francisco and San Mateo school districts. Attrition rates for new teachers are
extremely high, and this project will identify and implement strategies for
keeping them in their classrooms. The program will include: instruction in
standards-based content and inquiry-based teaching; links with experienced
mentors; both electronic and in-person approaches to link novice teachers with
each other; and strategies for connecting novice teachers to he Exploratorium.
The program will be evaluated both internally and externally.
