This grant partially supports the acquisition of an 800 MHz NMR cryoprobe to be
sited at Rutgers University, Busch science campus. The cryoprobe technology will
initially serve a minimum of four New Jersey institutions including Rutgers-New
Brunswick (NB), Rutgers-Newark, Princeton University and Montclair State
University (MSU). Eleven faculty members, three from Rutgers-NB/RWJ, two from
Rutgers-Newark, four from Princeton and two from MSU are participating in the
New Jersey Wide 800 MHz NMR Facility. Hands-on NMR experiments will be performed
by approximately 60 graduate students and postdocs, as well as undergraduates
involved in NMR research. The NMR facility will also have significant impact on
research and teaching of additional faculty members in New Jersey through the
research collaborations with the faculty and students in the facility.
&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The research activities of the users of the facility are
in molecular biophysics with emphasis in the following areas: Protein structure
determination; Conformational studies and dynamics of folded and unfolded
proteins to understand the basis of protein folding and misfolding and their
associated medical disorders; Studies of nucleic acid structure and
interactions; NMR investigations of protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid
interactions; Design and informational analysis of small bio-medically important
peptides; and NMR methods development for next generation
application.&lt;br/&gt;
