This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial Biology for
FY2003. The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of
protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are
not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides
opportunities for recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in
microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of
established scientists, and to broaden their scientific horizons beyond the
research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These
fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their
research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves
of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign
locations.

The research and training plan is entitled "Testing mechanisms of diversity
maintenance in pea aphid symbiont communities". Microorganisms that are
transmitted from parent to offspring are found in many insects and can have
effects on the host ranging from strongly positive to extremely detrimental. Pea
aphid possesses a diverse symbiont community with one obligate and at least five
facultative bacterial symbionts. This research uses multidisciplinary approaches
to test hypotheses that could explain the high levels of symbiont diversity
harbored in pea aphid populations.
