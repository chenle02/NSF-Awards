ABSTRACT This project will produce a comparative grammar of the Sahaptian
languages. It will cover sound changes, comparative phonology, morphology,
syntax, and discourse. A Sahaptian morpheme dictionary will be included, listing
all proposed Nez Perce and Sahaptin derivatives (with every suggestion from the
literature duly noted). This contribution, in addition to previous descriptive
work on Nez Perce and Sahaptin, will make Sahaptian one of the best understood
American Indian language families. It will provide data for further comparison
within Penutian, as well as make a contribution with theoretical appeal in the
area of general historical and comparative linguistics.
