Objective: This proposal offers an algebraic approach -- network modulation
(NeMo) -- to improve reliability, rate, security and robustness of multi-hop
networks. The objective of this proposal is to (i) design NeMo protocols to
enhance packet delivery rate and robustness to node failures; (ii) optimize NeMo
to incorporate network constraints on energy, delay, and data characteristics;
(iii) investigate NeMo techniques to cope with impairments of wireless links
such as fading; and (iv) develop random NeMo methods to improve network security
against sniffing and malicious attacks.

Intellectual Merit: This proposal tackles the challenging issues in multi-hop
networks from the novel perspective of symbol-level modulation. Relying on
signal space techniques and algebraic number theory, NeMo enables more efficient
networking in terms of data persistence, reliability, and security, and at the
same time remains flexible and scalable. Aside from applications such as
information exchange/collection in sensor networks that could directly benefit
from the NeMo technique, our novel insights also shed light on other networking
applications (e.g., media streaming and P2P content distribution).

Broader Impact: The proposed work is of both theoretical and practical
significance to the networking community. At a broader scale, it will impact the
design of future networks through technological advances. This project will
engage both graduate and undergraduate students by offering them research and
learning experiences. This project will also strengthen the ongoing
collaboration between the PI and the researchers at industry, thus facilitating
transition of scientific discoveries to the application domains.
