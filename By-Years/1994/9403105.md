9403105 Miller Dr. Scott J. Miller has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral Research
Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. Miller's doctoral degree was from Harvard
University under the supervision of Professor David Evans. Dr. Miller will
continue research at the California Institute of Technology under the
supervision of Professor Robert Grubbs. Dr. Miller's postdoctoral fellowship
will enhance his synthetic organic skills by providing him with experience in
organometallic catalysis as applied to olefin metathesis. Longer term, he will
apply his organometallic training to the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of
alpha-amino acids based on the use of chiral rhodium carbonyl complexes. The
Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as an important
infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge and experience of new
Ph.D.s and attract them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical
research and teaching. ***
