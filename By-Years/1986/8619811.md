A new Department of Computer Science has been formed at Princeton University;
unusually outstanding new faculty members have been and are continuing to be
recruited at all levels to join a nucleus of individuals from the former
Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. With the support
provided by the University, this Institutional Infrastructure award will aid in
the establishment and operation of a research computing environment that can
serve as the basis for experimental computer science research activities at
Princeton into the next decade. Research at Princeton includes work in
Programming Languages, Graphical Representations of Mathematical Objects, VLSI
Layout Algorithms and Tools, Design and Analysis of Data Structures, and
Algorithm Animation. The facility to be provided, which includes high-
performance workstations and advanced personal computers will, with the primary
VAX equipment provided by the University, serve the needs of all of these
diverse projects, allow the current group to move forward in experimental
research and provide for additional planned growth of both faculty and students.
