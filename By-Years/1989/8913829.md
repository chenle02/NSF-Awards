The Meteoritical Society is an international, non-profit organization which
promotes the study of extraterrestrial materials, cosmochemistry, meteor
phenomena, impact features, and planetary geology. The annual meetings of the
Meteoritical Society are usually held in North America and in Europe in
alternate years. However, the 1990 meeting will be held in Australia, to
recognize the growing membership in the western Pacific region. Travel costs for
this meeting will be very high, and this project will help to defray travel
expenses for selected U.S. graduate students. The Society normally supports
graduate student participation at its meetings through travel grants funded by
host organizations and the Society itself. The high cost of travel for this
meeting, however, requires additional support if American graduate students are
to participate.
