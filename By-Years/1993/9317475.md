9317475 Pancella An experimental program, using particle beams produced in the
electron-cooled storage ring and synchroton (Cooler) now operating at the
Indiana University Cyclotron Facility (IUCF) will be carried out. These
scattering experiments will be performed in collaboration with scientists at
IUCF and elsewhere. Experiments include pion production near threshold in few-
nucleon systems, and studies of spin dependence using polarized beams and
targets. The pion is known to mediate the strong force between nucleons, and
this force shows an interesting dependence on spin degrees of freedom. The data
provided by these experiments, in conjunction with theoretical models for
interpretation, will contribute to the fundamental understanding of the strong
interaction which forms nuclei. ***
