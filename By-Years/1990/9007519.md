Simultaneous, instantaneous images of the fuel, air, and reaction intermediates
will be made with an intensified charge-coupled digital camera in a turbulent
diffusion flame by Raman scattering and fluorescence induced with an
ultraviolet(UV) excimer laser. The imaging technique is based on recent advances
in Raman scattering and laser-induced predissociative fluorescence (LIPF) using
UV excimer lasers. The images can assess finite rate chemistry effects - the
effect of gradients of fuel and air on the chemistry of the turbulent flame.
These finite-rate chemistry effects determine combustion efficiency and
pollution formation in flames. From the images, the finite-rate chemistry in
turbulent diffusion flames can be quantified so that computer models of
turbulence-chemistry interactions can be improved. This proposal is to acquire
the imaging equipment necessary to measure the gradients of temperature, mixture
fraction, and minor species (OH) in a turbulent diffusion flame by imaging Raman
and fluorescence signals from a narrowband excimer laser. The photomultiplier
tubes used in the point measurements would be replaced by a gated intensified
(ICCD) camera.
