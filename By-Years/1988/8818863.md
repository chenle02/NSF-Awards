The goals of this research are: (1) to investigate the transport kinetics of
anions and cations in single erythroblastic cells at various stages of
maturation by means of cryosectioning and x-ray microanalysis, and (2) to
demonstrate the applicability of these techniques in studying transport of
materials labeled with identifiable elements such as bromine or iodine in a
multicompartment system. Investigation of membrane transport of erythroid cells
is complicated by the heterogeneity of the cell population. Without physical
separation of the cells into distinct homogeneous populations conventional
methods for measuring transport cannot be applied. The techniques of
cryomicrotomy and x-ray microanalysis provide a solution to this problem. They
will be used to study rubidium and bromide uptake as well as changes in
potassium and sodium concentrations in dog, sheep, and rabbit erythroid cells at
various stages of maturation. The different species of animals selected are
distinct in their red cell membrane transport properties. The stage of
maturation of the cells will be identified either morphologically or from the
amount of iron (i.e. hemoglobin) present. Pump/leak as well as co-transport and
counter-transport systems will be examined by multielemental analysis and with
the aid of inhibitors such as ouabain, furosemide, bumetanide, DIDS, and SITS.
Changes in surface to volume ratios of the cells will be determined by
stereological techniques and the contribution of these changes to uptake will be
examined. In addition, x-ray microanalysis will be applied to examine the
intracellular distribution of model iodine or bromine labeled compounds in order
to test the feasibility of using this technique for studying transport,
distribution and targeting of other materials in general. The techniques of
rapidly freezing cells, cutting frozen thin sections, and studying their
elemental content using x-ray microanalysis provides a unique approach to the
study of the transport and compartmentation of inorganic ions and small
molecules in cells. This procedure permits simultaneous quantitative analysis of
their elemental content and study of their morphology so that the transport
properties of individual cell types in a mixed population can be deduced from
very small samples. This research has already provided new insights into the
development of transport processes in maturing red blood cells. Extension of
this technique to study of the distribution in cells of model compounds labeled
with identifiable tracer elements will have many potential applications in basic
and applied research.
