This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Wechsler and her team will explore
how hydrogen gas is re-ionized by the ultraviolet radiation from the earliest
stars and active galactic nuclei, and how that affects star formation in small
galaxies. The standard Cold Dark Matter cosmologies predict many more low-mass
dark halos, clumped around much larger dark halos, than we observe as satellites
of larger galaxies. But ultraviolet radiation from the larger galaxy may prevent
gas in the smallest satellite dark halos from collapsing to form stars, so that
no galaxy is born there. Dr. Wechsler's work will improve on current studies,
which assume that the entire cosmos reionizes at a single time. She and her team
would first run large cosmological N-body simulations including only the dark
matter. They will then examine how changing the level of ultraviolet radiation
alters the number of infalling subhalos that could host faint satellite
galaxies. The team will then use the large-scale simulations, together with
models for reionization, to estimate the range of possible ultraviolet radiation
levels around a galaxy like our Milky Way. The calculations will predict how
patchy reionization affects the expected satellite population of Milky-Way-sized
galaxies, and examine what relations exist between a galaxy's reionization
history and its satellite population, formation process, and
environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Hispanic postdoc and a graduate student will
be trained as they participate in the research. Students from under-represented
groups in a program at Dr. Wechsler's institution will also be involved. She
will continue to participate in public outreach lectures and in developing
curriculum material for high schools.
