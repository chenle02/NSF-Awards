With this award, the Chemical Synthesis Program of the NSF Division of Chemistry
is supporting the research of Professor Paul J. Fischer in the Department of
Chemistry at Macalester College to develop new iron compounds that bind nitrogen
gas. Comprising nearly 80% of air, nitrogen gas is inert toward most chemical
reactions. Because of this inertness, nitrogen resists incorporation by
reductive chemistry into useful nitrogen-rich components of fertilizers and
pharmaceuticals. The goal of this project is to discover new approaches to
enhance the reactivity of nitrogen. The specific concept involves converting
nitrogen gas into compounds containing iron. Indeed, Fischerâ€™s research program
has identified a family of organic compounds that bind iron, allowing it to
activate gaseous nitrogen. The research is being conducted by Professor Fischer
and undergraduate students in an environment that fosters diversity by including
women and members of groups underrepresented in chemistry. Through this
research, the project is providing hands-on training to participants in advanced
organic and inorganic chemistry. Student coworkers are prepared for pursuing
STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) careers in academia,
industry, or federal laboratories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project contributes
to the "grand challenge" of the development of catalytic/stoichiometric
reactions for the manipulation of iron-dinitrogen complexes in a quest to
uncover new pathways for N2 functionalization. A family of terminal high-spin
iron(I) dinitrogen complexes are targeted. These new complexes allow systematic
study of variables affecting the iron-bound dinitrogen ligands in trigonally
coordinated and modulated weak ligand fields. A variety of supporting ligands
will be examined, with particular emphasis on the pyrazolate motif. Particular
attention is paid to the reduction potentials of the new complexes. This project
will also explore the reactivity of terminal iron(I) dinitrogen complexes with
respect to dinitrogen substitution with diamagnetic and paramagnetic ligands.
Additions of organic radicals to terminal dinitrogen ligands will be
investigated as one pathway to organic nitrogen products. The functionalization
of an iron-coordinated terminal dinitrogen ligand by radical addition would
represent an exciting new pathway for iron-mediated dinitrogen reactivity. The
research program draws participants from a diverse campus community, providing
them with practical, hands-on training in laboratory
operations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
