w:\awards\awards96\*.doc 9623270 Yeh This research aims at developing a novel
system that can be used to detect the motion of individual flux lines in high
temperature superconducting (HTS) materials in magnetic fields. The instrument
will be equipped with HTS thin film transformers with a micrometer-size pickup
coil to couple the flux motion signal to a dc SQUID. This probe will be scanned
with micrometer control. With this instrument the dynamics of flux line motion
will be investigated, especially the depinning process. An objective is to
determine information about individual pinning sites in the HTS material. This
research may reveal the main pinning mechanism and thus may lead to an
improvement in the critical current density in the HTS materials. %%% The
discovery of high temperature superconducting materials provides great potential
for applications in many types of products. The key problem for many practical
applications is the enhancement of the critical current density in magnetic
fields that is governed by control of magnetic flux line motion. This grant
supports the development of a microscopic probe to detect the motion of flux
lines and determine the material properties such as defects or impurities that
impede or pin the flux lines. Thus this research may lead to new techniques for
the preparation of high-current carrying superconductors. ***
