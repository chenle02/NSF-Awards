*** 9603134 Knaff This two-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research in
plant biochemistry involves the research grouping of David Knaff at Texas Tech
University and Jean-Pierre Jacquot at the Institute for Biotechnology of Plants,
University of Paris, South, Paris, France. The objective of the research is to
investigate the ferredoxin/thioredoxin light activation system in chloroplast of
higher plants and of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. They will also
study their target enzymes. The U.S. investigators bring to this collaboration
their expertise in biochemistry. This is complemented by the French
investigators expertise in molecular biology. It takes advantage of cDNAs
produced by the French group and will be used in the studies. The proposal
advances fundamental understanding of the proteins that are subject to
light/dark modulation. ***
