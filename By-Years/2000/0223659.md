Systemic Research, Inc. will collaborate with the awardee institutions of NSF's
Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) in the development and
implementation of a Self Assessment and Evaluation System. Within the context of
TCUP goals and relevant Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA)
requirements, the TCUP Self Evaluation System will assist TCUP awardee
institutions with progress indicator data collection for formative self-
assessment and evaluation. Electronic evaluation instruments will be designed
and developed in close coordination with TCUP awardee institutions to collect
relevant quantitative and qualitative indicator data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
activity will enhance TCUP awardee institutions' capacity to monitor and assess
institutional efforts to broaden participation in science, technology,
engineering and mathematics disciplines. Proposed collaborative efforts will
enhance institutional database management, evaluation and research capacity at
TCUP awardee institutions.&lt;br/&gt;
