Organic Light Emitting Diodes (OLEDs) have been considered as alternate for the
next generation of displays and illumination devices, which has received great
attentions from academia and industries. The proposed project converges at the
interface of synthetic organic chemistry, materials science and engineering,
semiconductor physics and device engineering to further develop OLEDs. In order
to achieve the maximum device efficiency (i.e. converting all of injected
electron to photons), it will require emissive materials to harvest all of
electron-generated exactions. The knowledge research gain from this project will
help to understand the fundamental mechanisms governing the radiative decay
process of organic excitons including the emission efficiency and the shape of
the emission spectrum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new classes of metal-assisted
delay fluorescence materials in this project will significantly contribute to
continuing efforts towards developing a cost-effective displays and solid state
lighting. The existing phosphorescent emitters require the utilization of heavy
metal ions like Iridium, which could be potentially expensive due to their low
natural abundance on the earth. On the other hand, metal-assisted delay
fluorescence materials could potentially utilize all of electro-generated
excitons and rely on more naturally abundant metal elements. Such technology
will provide more cost-effective alternative emissive materials for organic
displays and solid state lighting.
