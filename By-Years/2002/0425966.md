An assessment of plasma science in the United States will be conducted as part
of the decadal assessment and outlook, Physics 2010. Since publication of the
previous decadal study of this area in 1995, the field has undergone rapid
advances and significant changes, ranging from a refocused mission of the DOE
fusion science program to new plasma processing technologies arriving in the
commercial marketplace to significant advances in understanding how to confine
plasmas. A new field called high-energy-density physics has been defined that
foretells new connections between astrophysical phenomena and laboratory
experiments. It is timely and important to identify the compelling science
opportunities in plasma science and to frame a strategy for realizing them.
