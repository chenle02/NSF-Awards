9307055 Jackson The central objective of this project is to improve
understanding of the vegetation-sensing properties of sedimentary pollen
assemblages, which are the primary source of information on past vegetation in
most of the world. The research is specifically concerned with determining the
effective pollen source areas for important tree taxa, and understanding the
factors that govern them. These factors include basin size, canopy cover,
physical properties of pollen dispersal, and the patterning of vegetation on the
landscape. A related objective is to determine how these factors influence
pollen representation in percentage data, and to refine and test calibrations
aimed at correcting for those effects. Modern pollen assemblages from forest
floor moss polsters at 130 sites in northern New York and southern New England,
and 25 sites in northern Arizona, will be compared with vegetation composition
and patterns across a range of spatial scales. Scatter plots and regression
analysis will be used to identify pollen source areas and to estimate and test
calibration parameters for relating pollen percentages to forest composition.
%%% An understanding of these factors is crucial to the design and
interpretation of paleoecological studies, because pollen source areas determine
the spatial scales at which pollen assemblages record information about
vegetation. Analyses of historical vegetation patterns are essential for
understanding large- scale vegetation response to climate change. ***
