This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is to complete the
R&amp;D to commercialize a novel catalytic technology for pollution control at
ambient temperature. The novel technology will destroy VOCs using low
temperature oxidation with a highly active class of novel Heteropoly Oxometalate
(HPOM) catalysts. This new class of catalysts is dramatically more active than
traditional platinum oxidation catalysts. The Phase II catalyst will provide new
avenues for scientific research and education, by studying catalysis at mild
conditions needed for advanced instrumentation at diverse geographic locations,
and by expanding the applications to other societal needs in fuel cells,
Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, etc. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commercial applications
will provide efficient, low cost industrial emissions control and enhanced
indoor air quality. The firm's research facilities and prior SBIR licensing
success will facilitate rapid deployment. The program should protect the
nation's environment and improve economic competitiveness. &lt;br/&gt;
