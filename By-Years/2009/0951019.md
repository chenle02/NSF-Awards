Axons are long cellular cables that conduct information through the nervous
system. Despite a century of investigation, how axons elongate is poorly
understood. This question is important because axonal elongation wires the brain
during development and is ultimately responsible for how individuals think and
perceive the world. The PI's approach to studying this problem is to monitor the
process of axonal elongation in vivo using advanced microscopy in living intact
Drosophila (fruitfly) embryos, and in vitro on individual neurons grown on glass
coverslips. These classic cell biological approaches will be combined with
biophysical analysis and powerful genetic tools developed in Drosophila to
answer the following questions: 1) What are the cellular mechanics of elongation
in vitro and in vivo? (2) How do forces control axonal assembly? (3) How do
guidance cues cause axons to turn? Answering these questions will illuminate the
understanding of the genetic and cellular mechanisms of axonal elongation. This
project will support the training of graduate and undergraduate students, and
has an outreach component that exposes K-12 students, undergraduates, graduate
students, and secondary physical science teachers to cell biology, genetics,
microscopy, and contemporary questions in neuroscience.
