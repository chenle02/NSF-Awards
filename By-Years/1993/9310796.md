9310796 Mandelbaum NYSERNet, Inc. requests resources for continued development
of NYSERNet's New York State high speed data communications network through
1995. With these resources NYSERNet will; 1. Establish and support new high
bandwidth applications and technical and end-user users groups; 2. Expand
technical support and user services support for its members and affiliates; 3.
Provide significant advice and direction to New York State's K-12 National
Research and Education Network (NREN) access efforts. The challenge facing
NYSERNet include: 1) delivering new capabilities, such as: Image Transfer,
Multi-Media Database Access and Multi-Media Mail; interactive-network based
distance learning; and the other applications described above; 2) continually
improving network services in support of research and education to a widely
varied and increasing user community of researchers, scholars, and educators in
the natural sciences, social sciences, mathematics, engineering, humanities, and
health sciences; 3) insuring that, after the next several years of planned
changes to the NSFNET, NYSERNET's affiliates continue to enjoy the
interconnectedness they now have, both nationally and internationally; and 4)
increasing the utility of the Network to both sophisticated and new users. There
are four dimensions of growth and development of this community: 1) there will
be more users at more NYSERNet member and affiliate sites; 2) each user will
make more use of the network; 3) each use will be more complex; and 4) there
will be more new applications, especially in the areas of interactive computing,
visualization, and collaboration. ***
