This award, under the auspices of the Small Grants for Exploratory Research
(SGER) program, will establish a unique proxy isotopic record for the lower free
troposphere of the western Pacific convection system. This system plays a
dominant role in the climate of the tropical Pacific. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
study site on Lake Guam is situated adjacent to the Pacific warm pool and at an
elevation of 3600 meters on the high plateau of the Huon Peninsula, Papua New
Guinea (6 degrees S and 147 degrees E). The researcher will generate and
calibrate isotopic records of Oxygen-18 and Carbon-13 from carbonate sediments
in Lake Guam to instrumental records of temperature, humidity, and winds from
historical atmospheric soundings in the western tropical Pacific.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rationale for considering this award is the high-risk
challenge of validating the first high altitude isotopic record of the lower
troposphere in the western tropical Pacific and developing the first proxy
vertical soundings of this convection system.
