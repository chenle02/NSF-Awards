9451915 Johnston This project enhances experimental psychology by providing
creative, hands on laboratory courses based on compelling visual, auditory, and
cognitive effects that provide a good entry to the benefits of the scientific
method. Specific courses affected by include visual perception, learning and
memory, and neuroscience. Microcomputers with specialized audio and video
hardware offer an intuitive user interface and excellent graphical capabilities.
A suite of drawing, painting, rendering, and animation software packages provide
the capability to generate most perceptual phenomena of current research
interest. Also, students will be able to create their own stimuli, run
experiments, and analyze their data without the need for computer programming
skills.
