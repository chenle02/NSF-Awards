This is a new proposal for studying, Physics with ultra-cold Molecules". the
work calls for developing a general method for cooling and trapping any
paramagnetic molecule or atom. This would create a new area of molecular physics
whose impact can be expected to be comparable to, or possibly greater than, the
study of ultra-cold atoms in atomic physics. The technique is applicable to
paramagnetic atoms and molecules with a magnetic moment of one Bohr magneton or
larger and does not rely on any particular energy level pattern.
