Many important systems in science and engineering, including wireless
communications, complex networks such as the Internet, and neural science, have
natural formulations in terms of graphs. To analyze such systems, it is
important to understand the structure of the associated classes of graphs and to
decompose those graphs into structured pieces. Such structural information and
decomposition can then be used to provide good solutions to problems formulated
in these models. This research project investigates problems concerning
structure and decomposition of certain fundamental classes of graphs. Research
materials arising from the project will be used to train undergraduate,
graduate, and early-career researchers in this field of research.

Using structural and extremal techniques, the investigator and collaborators
have recently resolved a longstanding conjecture on graphs containing no
topological K5 and several conjectures on partitions of graphs and hypergraphs.
This project extends this research to study related problems, including
conjectures concerning non-separating paths and several problems concerning
judicious partitions of graphs and hypergraphs.
