Internet over a T1 (1.544 million bits per second) line. Faculty and students at
the school benefit from access to the resources of the Internet, including
libraries and supercomputers. In addition, they are able to communicate and
collaborate with colleagues at other institutions in pursuit of research and
educational projects. The award provides partial support of the project for two
years.
