This award funds a three-year Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site
at the Colorado State University (CSU) that will provide students with a
research experience in the area of vibration and sound. Activities will involve
fundamental research in three focus areas - modeling, measurements, and
visualization. The REU site is designed as a year-round program with 5-7
students participating during the academic year and 8-10 students participating
during the summer. During the school year, many of the students will be students
from the home institution, Colorado State University, with a focus on using
recruitment resources within CSU such as the Women and Minorities in Engineering
Program and the Colorado Alliance for Minority Participation. For the summer
research experience, students will be recruited from across the U.S. with
special attention given to recruit students attending schools where summer
research opportunities do not exist. Regionally, special efforts will be made to
attract students from Fort Lewis College, the University of Southern Colorado in
Pueblo, and several community colleges. Students will interact with researchers
and scientists at the Dynamic Measurements Laboratory at NIST-Boulder; the
Acoustic Testing Laboratory at Johns -Manville in Littleton, Colorado; and
Engineering Data Management of Fort Collins, Colorado. This REU Site is
supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU Program.
