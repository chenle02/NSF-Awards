0806939&lt;br/&gt;Silveira&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This international planning
grant will support travel to Brazil by Dr. Silveira, Dr. Vendramini Schaffer,
and two US graduate students from the University of Florida, and Dr. Jim Muir,
from Texas A&amp;M University to work with Brazilian collaborator Dr Jose Carlos
Dubeux at Universidade Federal Rural de Pernambuco (URFPE). The goal of this
planning visit is to support the development of research projects to develop
technology that enables greater persistence of existing planted grasslands in
Brazil. This collaboration will also be used to establish graduate student and
faculty exchanges to increase awareness of the international dimensions of
grassland agriculture and develop a web site for promoting debates and
presenting information related to grassland degradation
