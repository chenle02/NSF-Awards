In this project the principal investigators will study the geometric properties
of harmonic measure; in particular, they will focus on the relations between
harmonic measure on domains in the plane and one-dimensional Hausdorff measure.
The principal investigators will also look into problems involving harmonic
measure and analytic capacity, the relationship between rectifiable sets and
harmonic measure, and the estimation of eigenvalues of the Laplace operator on
subdomains of the sphere in higher dimensions. The principal investigators are
interested in studying the relationship between an analytical quantity known as
the harmonic measure of a set and the geometry of this set. Harmonic measure is
an important and useful concept that arises in probability theory and complex
function theory. In this project the principal investigators will seek to
characterize properties of the harmonic measure of a set in terms of geometric
properties of the set such as its Hausdorff dimension.
