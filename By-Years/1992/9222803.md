The nervous system is composed of numerous cell types. The mechanisms that
control development of the different cell types are poorly understood. It is
clear that a complex array of signals sent between the developing cells are
essential. One type of signal is communicated through direct contact between the
surface protein that influences the final stages of maturation of one cell type,
the neuroglial cells. The current project will examine in more detail the role
and mode of action of this protein in cultured retinal cells. Artificial genes
will be constructed and introduced into the retinal cells. These artificial gene
constructs will block normal expression of the protein in the retinal cells,
thus allowing the investigators to directly observe the role of this molecule in
specific developmental events. The protein being studied is one member of a
large family of proteins, and one or more members of this family are present on
most if not all cells of the developing nervous system. Insights gained as to
the function of one member of this protein family will supply a better
understanding of mechanisms active in development of all nervous system
cells.***//
