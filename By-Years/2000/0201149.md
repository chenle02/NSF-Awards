This project, submitted under the Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER)
program, will examine public attitudes toward immigration and civil liberties
following the attack on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. In particular,
this project will examine public attitudes regarding the freedoms of Muslims in
the United States, as well as public attitudes about the arrival of new
immigrants from Muslim countries. Using a panel survey of 1,000 adult
respondents, the principal investigator will probe attitudes toward security and
freedom. A split sample design will be employed to determine differences in
attitudes toward restrictions on freedom broadly in contrast to those applied to
Muslims. The principal investigator will also test hypotheses about attitudes on
immigration. In addition to economic and social explanations of these attitudes,
the survey will allow the study of feelings of personal safety.
