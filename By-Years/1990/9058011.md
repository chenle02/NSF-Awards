Almost all tissues are subject to physical and environmental forces. These
tissues, in response, adapt and remodel to accommodate these forces. Two prime
examples are blood vessels and bone. The former respond to the fluid shear and
pressure of blood flow by adapting vessel diameter and undergoing wall
remodelling. The latter responds to the stress, pressure and interstitial fluid
flow due to mechanical loading by adapting and remodelling bone tissues. Using
cell culture techniques, the Principal Investigator's (PI) research efforts have
focussed on understanding the nature and the specific mechanisms of tissue
response to physical forces. Having laid down the foundation in terms of
techniques and understanding of the force-cell interactions, the PI proposes to
engineer force bearing tissues such as bone and cartilage. The overall objective
is to develop several types of scaffolding materials (collagen, bioerodable
polymers, and hydrogels) as the structural framework for bone and cartilage
induction to be used as implants and grafts.
