This research will investigate the seismic velocity and reflectivity structure
of the Proterozoic lithosphere of the Baltic Shield for comparison with well-
studied parts of Phanerozoic continental lithosphere. Data are from the near-
vertical and wide- angle three-component seismic-reflection BABEL project
collected in 1989 by an international consortium. This work will study a subset
of BABEL data that is not being studied in detail by other BABEL investigators.
One objective is to determine whether mid- Proterozoic continental growth,
composition and tectonics resemble Phanerozoic on the Baltic Shield.
