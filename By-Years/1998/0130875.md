To facilitate the development of theories for biological information processing,
it would be useful to have a system that permits a priori specification of the
connection in a neural network. By defining the connectivity in a neural
network, the system will allow rapid prototyping of arbitrary neuronal
architectures. Ideally, such a system would be able to not only recapitulate in
vivo structure, but also be able to create novel neural structures in a user-
defined manner. Such user-defined networks will then allow more rigorous testing
of theories for biological information processing in the nervous system and will
potential result in the identification of novel information processing paradigms
in general. In this project, the following issues will be
addressed:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;a) Identify the determinants of successful
neurite elicitation under applied force.&lt;br/&gt;b) Compare engineered network
behavior to model network behavior to assess whether neuronal information
processing is linear or nonlinear.&lt;br/&gt;c) Develop approaches to scale-up
that allow multiple connections to be formed.&lt;br/&gt;
