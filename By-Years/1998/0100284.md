This award provides partial support for purchase of a cryo-cooling device to be
installed in a shared facility used for x-ray protein crystallography.
Crystallographic studies now play a central role in biology as the sequencing of
large stretches of DNA reveals more and more genes whose role in the cell are
poorly understood. Cryo-cooling minimizes radiation damage to protein crystals
during data collection, and is an essential feature of modern x-ray
crystallography workstations. At least 90% of the current crystallography
projects on campus require cryo-cooling, including structural studies of a
thermostable glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, other NAD binding
enzymes, human bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein, EF-hand calcium
binding proteins, anti-DNA antibodies, and enzymes in the alginate biosynthetic
pathway. Although one such device is already available to the PIs, usage of the
X-ray facility is expected to increase significantly as a result of the recent
establishment of a Structural Biology Core facility for which they are
responsible.
