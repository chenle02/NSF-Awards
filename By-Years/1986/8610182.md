Contamination of microelectronic components by submicron particles has become a
growing concern as the industry strives to reduce the size of components and to
increase their capacities. Furthermore, several processes in pharmaceutical
manufacturing require total isolation from even the clean-room enviornment and
requires the use of isolation chambers. Fine particles are also important in a
number of industrial processes such as photography and electgro-photography and
magnetic, biochemical, and agricultural processings. The International Symposium
will provide a very effective forum to deal with fine particles in all of the
stated processes. Furthermore, a workshop will also be conducted to determine
research needs and priorities in these areas. Workshop proceedings will be
widely distributed. Eight symposia/workshops are planned to be held at the
annual meeting of the Fine Particle Society, San Francisco, July 28-August 1,
1986.
