Vision is a dominant human sense, but so complex that traditional research has
concentrated on either the optical system of the eye, or the neurobiology of the
retina and brain, or the psychology of visual perception. Recently there has
been more interest in trying to synthesize new principles using a variety of
approaches. This symposium addresses vision in a multidisciplinary way, with
perspectives from the worlds of optics, of physiology, and of perceptual
psychology. The two central questions addressed are: 1) How is visual processing
limited by properties of optics and photoreceptors of the eye? 2) How do
behavioral measures of eye movements or perception relate to activity of cells
in the visual cortex of the brain? While covering relatively few topics, with
speakers of high caliber, this symposium will touch a relatively large and
diverse audience both at the site and by the subsequent publication. The effort
made to communicate the success of these diverse, powerful approaches is likely
to have considerable impact on many young visual scientists, in addition to
generating healthy controversy among those more established.
