The proposal describes a cross-disciplinary research project that will
investigate the learning of symbol processing. The research team brings
cognitive neuroscientists with strengths in studying brain mechanisms and the
behaviors underlying the development of fundamental symbol processing activities
together with educational psychologists and educational technology researchers
who are skilled in designing and studying the impact of interactive software
within school settings. The project focuses on changes in skill and brain
activity associated with learning the linkage between visual symbols and their
associated perceptually-based referents. The researchers will compare the
neurological and behavioral changes that are predicted to result from different
instructional techniques (by means of web-based software) and then see to what
extent those differences are in accord with different theories of instruction
and the development of symbol processing.
