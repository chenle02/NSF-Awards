Flexible AC Transmission Systems (FACT) are being studied by the electric
utility industry for increasing the transmission capability of the existing
infrastructure while maintaining or increasing security and quality levels. Most
studies are concerned with the use of thyristor switched circuits. Currently
these systems have to be custom designed, basically due to the thyristor's
inherent need for natural turn-off, manifesting itself as harmonic interactions
between the switching system and the power system. These interactions are not
well understood. In order to eliminate such problems, the use of power
converters with gate turn-off switches has been proposed. However, the power
levels reachable with these are limited by the power semiconductor and power
converter technology. This current study investigates a hybrid approach which
aims to achieve the best features of each, i.e. high power level and an
interface free of harmonic interaction.
