Ellington This proposal requests funds in partial support of a symposium to be
held on the campus of Indiana University, Bloomington from October 12 15, l995.
The symposium is entitled The Exploration of Sequence Space: Selecting
Functional Molecules from Combinatorial Libraries. This conference represents an
acknowledgment of the fact that the interface between chemistry and biology has
become increasingly integrated, and that scientists from both areas have begun
to contribute to a new interdisciplinary field, combinatorial chemistry.
Although combinatorial techniques are still in their infancy, they are
nonetheless becoming increasingly important in exploring biological complexity
and diversity, in understanding how chemical and biochemical self organization
can occur, and in the design and discovery of new drugs. The meeting is the
ninth in an annual series presented under the auspices of the Indiana Institute
for Molecular and Cellular Biology at Indiana University. The objectives of the
organizing committee are to bring together an international group o
