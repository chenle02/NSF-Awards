One component of this project will explore the possibility of explaining the
nature of delay and inertia in economic behavior by importing into standard
dynamic economic theory from communications engineering the notion of the
Shannon capacity of an information channel. This has already been shown to imply
realistic modifications of the predictions of the permanent income theory, and
appears ripe for further extension.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another component will
improve and apply computer code for finding Taylor series expansions of
solutions to dynamic stochastic equilibrium models. Such models are seeing
increasing use in central bank policy analysis, so that wider availability of
these methods will find quick application to important
problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a dispute, relevant to the evaluation of
reform proposals for our monetary institutions, over how much and in what way
monetary policy has changed in the US over the course of the twentieth century.
A component of this research project will apply Bayesian model comparison
methods to look further into the sources of conflicting conclusions in the
literature on these issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;Recent
developments in econometric methodology and in its connection to decision theory
have made it practical to take new approaches to quantitative modeling for
monetary policy analysis. The local expansion programming and the Bayesian time-
varying parameters and model choice methods in other components of this proposal
are likely to find application in the central bank revisions of their methods.
One component of this project is to continue existing contacts of the
investigator with central bank research departments, both to disseminate the
results of this project's research and to learn more about the analytic
bottlenecks in the policy process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
