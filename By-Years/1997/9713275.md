Abstract - Gundersen CTS - 9713275 This is a study of the physics and
engineering of non-equilibrium plasmas generated by extremely short high-voltage
pulses with an emphasis on pollution-abatement applications. The project
combines modulator design, advanced diagnostics, and sophisticated modelling to
provide basic insight into the plasma reactors, their underlying physics, and
their applications. Laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) using a tunable laser
system will be utilized in reactors driven by advanced power sources to obtain
data about specific species including nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic
compounds (VOCs). The results will be modelled with a time-dependent two-
dimensional hybrid Monte Carlo/fluid model. This model will then be used to
simulate the effects of parameters such as reactor geometry, amplitude of the
applied voltage, chemical additives, and bulk flow parameters, and the results
used in design of reactors for specific applications.
