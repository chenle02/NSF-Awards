This project will support a five-day CBMS conference on "Higher representation
theory of Kac-Moody algebras" at North Carolina State University in June 2014
with Raphael Rouquier as the principal speaker. The theory of Kac-Moody Lie
algebras and their quantum analogs is a timely topic with various applications
to other branches of mathematics and theoretical physics. Major developments
have been focused on the categorification program which realizes key algebraic
structures, such as canonical bases, in terms of category of modules based on
combinatorial, algebraic or geometric structures. Categorification can provide
deeper understanding of the original algebraic structures and obtain new
structures. In categorification of quantum enveloping algebras, Khovanov-Lauda
and Rouquier independently introduced the KLR algebra.

As one of the inventors and a leading practitioner in this field, Professor
Rouquier will give ten lectures on the subject which aim to introduce workshop
participants, including graduate students, to current research and chart
possible future directions. Prof. Rouquier will also write up a monograph of the
CBMS lectures after the conference. The conference expects to gather about 40
participants. An additional five speakers are invited to assist Professor
Rouquier's lectures and to talk about categorification and higher representation
theory. The conference will encourage participation from women, minorities, and
persons with disabilities.
