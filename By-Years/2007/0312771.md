Research:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this Information Technology (IT)
Research - Small project is to develop a framework for distributed modeling,
simulation and agent based optimization. Such a system will permit the
integration of classical process systems engineering tools, like process
modeling, numerical integration, optimization and predictive evaluation with the
distributed data base capabilities of ERP systems. The focus will be on solution
strategies that take advantage of distributed computing and information exchange
across a network of connected computational units. The approach achieves speed,
quality flexibility, and robustness that scales favorably with problem size. Two
specific problems will be addressed:&lt;br/&gt;1. How to develop methods for
dynamic simulation of distributed process networks, and&lt;br/&gt;2. How to use
agent based methods for solving large scale, stochastic control problems that
have dynamics distributed in time and space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A key issue in
the research will be how to interface the modeling and agent-based optimization
frameworks in such a way that the performance of the process network is
optimized. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enterprise
Resource Planning (ERP) systems and other IT tools allow companies to access,
analyze and disseminate vast amounts of distributed information almost
instantaneously over the web. This project could help interface business IT with
classical tools for process modeling and optimization which in turn could be of
great commercial benefit to US industry.&lt;br/&gt;
