The authors are proposing to organize a workshop in April or May of 1992 on
modeling and identification of uncertainty for the purpose of robust control
design. It is anticipated that such a workshop will foster collaborations and
accelerate the development of this research area. The workshop will also
consider more broadly the question of the connections between analysis,
simulation, and experiments in control design, as well as the problem of
developing meaningful benchmark applications to aid researchers in evaluating
and comparing different methodologies.
