Relative to the large effort that has been devoted to design problems of new
processes, there has been relatively little work on developing methodologies for
the optimal redesign of existing processes that can be performed with limited
resources. The primary objective of the research is to perform a systematic
study on the optimal redesign of existing processes through the use of synthesis
simulation and optimization techniques. The investigation will develop
methodologies for the optimal redesign problem of existing processes that will
be applicable to other engineering disciplines. In particular, the design of (a)
heat and power systems, (b) complex reactor networks, (c) reactor-separator
systems, (d) separation systems and (e) systems that involve stochastic
uncertainties will be addressed. Theoretical models coupled with insights are
expected to result in redesign conceptual frameworks that will enhance the
designer's ability to innovate.
