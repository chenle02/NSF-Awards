The physics emphasis of this proposal is on the modifica- tion of the nucleon-
nucleon interaction in the presense of the nuclear medium, and on the spin-
response of the nucleus. This experimental work is being done mainly at the
TRIUMF facility. New directions are being pursued at the Indiana University
Cyclotron Facility to extend the TRIUMF work to 200 MeV, and at Brookhaven
National Laboratory using kaon beams in the hypernuclear physics program. The
main focus of this proposal is to continue existing research into the spin-
response of the nucleus, with the goal of understanding how the spin-dependence
of the NN (nucleon-nucleon) force in the nuclear medium is different from the NN
force in free space.
