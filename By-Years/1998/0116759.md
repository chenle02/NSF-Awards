MRI: Acquisition of SMP Clusters for Supporting Shared-Memory Metacomputing

This is a proposal for equipment acquisition under the Major Research
Instrumentation (MRI) program to support research and student training in the
development of high-performance distributed computing systems. The goal is to
develop efficient system software for supporting a seamless programming
environment on symmetric multiprocessor (SMP) clusters.
