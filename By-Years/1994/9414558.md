9414558 Casey A major practical limitation to the application of high resolution
two-dimensional ultrasonic imaging is the size and flexibility of the cable
linking the transmitter/receive transducer element with the powering and
processing electronics. The PI's have successfully fabricated a prototype based
on a combination of a fiber optics and integrated optoelectronics, which would
replace the cumbersome coaxial cable currently used to excite the transmit
pulses for relatively small linear transducer arrays. They propose the use of
the Electronics and Power Sources Directorate (EPSD) facility for assistance in
the design and fabrication of the photoconductive semiconductor switch (PCSS)
which is the critical element of our approach. Support of the proposed research
would be in direct support of advanced biomedical ultrasound techniques already
being partially supported by the National Science Foundation as well as Army
interests in the application of high resolution ultrasonic non-destructive
evaluation (NDE) to materials and structures of military significance. ***
