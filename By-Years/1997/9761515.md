*** 9761515 Sengupta This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project will explore a process that uses continuous heat treatment for
manufacturing BSCCO-2212 wire with micron-sized filaments. Although steady
progress has been achieved in high temperature superconductor (HTS) wires and
tapes, they are not fully commercialized. This innovation is expected to produce
long multifilamentary BSCCO-2212 wire competitive in cost and performance with
niobium tin compound (Nb3Sn) wire. Phase I will demonstrate the cost-effective
fabrication of high-performance multifilamentary BSCCO-2212 silver (Ag) alloy
sheathed wire with filament diameters of 2-4 microns by using continuous heat
treatment. Phase I will focus on the optimum particle size and distribution of
powders suitable for fabrication of wires with 2-4 micron filaments. Drawing
parameters to produce mechanically uniform wires without will be determined. The
temperature gradient and the pass rate will be optimized to achieve desired
properties. Phase II would pursue optimizing process parameters and fabrication
of long-length (200-500 meter) multifilamentary wires. Commercial application of
high-performance multifilamentary BSCCO-2212 wire is expected in production of a
new generation of high-field magnets or magnet inserts which may operate at
fields in excess of 20 Tesla. These ultra-high field magnets would significantly
impact further development of high energy physics, advanced magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) and neutron magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis, and energy storage
devices, e.g., superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) and micro SMES.
