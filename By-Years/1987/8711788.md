Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
available to the chemist for the elucidation of the structure of molecules.
Chemists can now study substances in the solid-state and thereby gain
information in addition to that accessable from traditional solution studies.
State-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out
frontier research. The Department of Chemistry at Louisiana State University
will use an award from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program and the
Instrumentation for Materials Research Program to help purchase a 200 MHz solid-
state NMR spectrometer. The areas of chemistry that will be enhanced by the
acquisition of the instrument include: 1) Solid-state deuterium NMR and ADLF
spectroscopy: Applications to organometallic chemistry and polymers 2) Solid-
state NMR of biomolecules 3) Applications of pulsed field gradient NMR to
polymer dynamics 4) Characterization of chitin-protein complexes 5)
Characterization of cement/hazardous waste systems 6) High pressure NMR to
investigate capillary condensation from supercritical fluids
