This award enables Bucknell University to attach to NSFNET through the
Pennsylvania mid-level network PREPnet. Connection to the Internet will greatly
improve access to supercomputers and other resources needed by the students and
faculty. In particular, reliability and speed of file transfers and electronic
mail will be greatly enhanced. The physical link to PREPnet will be a Proteon IP
router connected between the campus Ethernet backbone and a 56Kbps leased line.
The router, to be provided and maintained by the local telephone company, is
managed by Bell of Pennsylvania.
