This proposal supports a highly visible dissemination outlet for grant holders
in the Course, Curriculum, and Laboratory Improvement (CCLI) and Advanced
Technological Education (ATE) Programs. The PI is organizing a poster session at
the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) Annual Conference in June
of each of the next three years (2003-2005). He is inviting grant award
recipients from one or two years earlier to submit an abstract for inclusion in
the poster session.
