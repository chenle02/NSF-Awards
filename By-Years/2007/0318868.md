The Institute for Learning Innovation (ILI) requests support to conduct the
second conference on museum learning, "In Principle, In Practice," following
their successful NSF-funded conference of a decade ago entitled "Public
Institutions for Personal Learning: Establishing a Long-term Research Agenda."
The goals of the conference and two related publications are to advance shared
knowledge within the field about current research concerning learning in and
from museums, to promote effective practice, to identify and disseminate
research-based best practices for developing evaluation frameworks and to
enhance the infrastructure for research and education. The four components of
the project include: 1) a special supplement of the journal "Science Education,"
2) a two-day national conference, 3) a post-conference white paper on informal
science learning, and 4) a post-conference book on research-based understandings
of learning from museums.&lt;br/&gt;
