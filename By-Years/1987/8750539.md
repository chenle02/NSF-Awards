This project will equip an advanced electronic laboratory with six experiment
stations. Each station will contain an IBM PC/XT, a Keithley Data Acquisition
System and a Digital Multimeter with analog outputs. The stations will allow
very rapid data collection, leading to an increase in the number of experiments
that the students will be able to perform. Rapid data collection will also allow
the students to examine the circuit characteristics as the parameters are
changed resulting in a fuller understanding of the design of circuits.
