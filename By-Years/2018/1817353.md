NSF has made an award in support of participant travel costs with the initial
"Research Summit on 'Thought to Speech' for People with Cerebral Palsy" being
held in San Francisco, CA, on May 3-4, 2018. This meeting will bring together
experts in Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI), cerebral palsy, neuroscience,
language development, and related fields to identify the challenges and path
forward to developing a BCI system that will allow individuals who have not
previously developed spoken language to communicate with the broader society.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will be organized as an intensive 2-day
meeting organized around three stages: 1) review of current knowledge relevant
for real time speech generation; 2) identification of theoretical and practical
barriers to new systems; 3) identification of solutions to overcoming barriers;
and 4) developing a specific research roadmap to advance the start of the
science and engineering in this field. Results of the Summit will be
disseminated through a developed white paper, to be made publically available by
the Cerebral Palsy Alliance Research Foundation, and the publication of a
reviewed journal article on the conclusions reached. Invited participants will
be selected based on their expertise, paying attention to including individuals
from underrepresented groups, including those with disabilities, and inviting
several early career researchers to prime a pipeline within the
field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
