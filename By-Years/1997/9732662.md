Abstract 9505823 Rosenberg The University of Maryland will continue their
studies of the high magnetic latitude ionosphere and magnetosphere using
galactic radio noise absorption techniques (riometry). Several years ago, they
developed a new imaging riometer (IRIS) which allows the study of auroral
morphology during daylight and through clouds. These imaging riometers are now
being operated at Iqaluit, Canada; Sondestromfjord, Greenland; South Pole,
McMurdo and in all six of the Automatic Geophysical Observatories (AGO) operated
by NSF in Antarctica. Additionally, they are operating broad beam riometers at
Iqaluit, McMurdo and South Pole as well as auroral photometers at McMurdo and
South Pole. They have also provided imaging riometers for the British Halley Bay
and the Australian Davis stations, both in Antarctica, thus considerably
extending coverage. In the next few years they will also build imaging riometers
systems for some of the British AGOs. The instruments work synergistically with
a number of other instruments which are operated at all of these sites by other
investigators. ***
