The Somerset County Business/Education Partnership, formed in 1988 by senior
business executives and school superintendents to define goals and create an
ongoing relationship, has requested support to (a) develop consumer-relevant
instructional packages for K-12 grades and (b) provide teacher training for the
implementation and dissemination of the packages. In this 36 month project,
industry scientists and interested teachers, working in paired teams, will
develop lessons drawing upon the scientists' expertise for identifying potential
topics and the teachers' for creating appropriate instructional packages. While
only 15 plans are envisioned for each of the project's years, each package will
be adapted for a different age group, thereby leading to the production of
approximately 90 different units over the life of the project. A one-week
training workshop will be held in June each year for 30 teachers and
participating teachers will be expected to participate in two post-training
sessions to evaluate their experiences using the newly developed materials.
While the initial request for support of the Foundation did not include
provision for significant evaluation of student performance, that was added to
the project in the course of negotiations. The Foundation's support represents
approximately 48% of the total project costs.
