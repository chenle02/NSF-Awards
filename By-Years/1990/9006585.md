At the present time, many sheet metal products such as beverage cans are made
from blanks cut out of sheet metal. Several processing steps are required to
produce this sheet metal from the metal. Previous research conducted at the
Colorado State University using a die and punch set has shown that it is
feasible to cast thin blanks directly from the melt. This method could
potentially eliminate the costs related to sheet metal manufacturing. However,
further research is required to increase the speed of blank casting to the level
needed to be cost effective. The requested research equipment will enable blank
casting at higher speeds. In addition, mechanical and microstructural properties
of blanks cast at high speeds would be investigated for further improvement in
processing.
