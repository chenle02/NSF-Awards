Ohio State University requests support from NSF for the connection of the
following schools: Baldwin Wallace College, Capitol University, Cedarville
College, University of Findlay, College of Mount St. Joseph, and Xavier
University to the Ohio Academic Resources Network (OARnet) which is the NSF mid-
level network that serves the State of Ohio. A primary goal of OARnet is to
facilitate collaborative projects and sharing of resources between instutuion,
including those outside the state. OARnet will provide operations management and
information services and it will give the six universities a 56 thousand bit per
second connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second)
National Backbone network. The universities need greater functionality and
network speed to be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file
transfers along with being able to implement a more reliable mail system.
Students and faculty research will benefit from the link. This is also a unique
opportunity for the schools to explore innovative educational resources.***
