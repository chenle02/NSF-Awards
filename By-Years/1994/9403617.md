Using oxygen isotope analysis, the hypothesis that the variation of freshwater
flux in the Labarador Sea is responsible for much of the variations in water
properties along the northeast U.S. continental margin will be tested. In
particular the effects of variations of this flux on the shelf-slope water
exchange and the freshwater volume along the Middle Atllantic Bight and the
circulation and mixing in the Gulf of maine will be investigated.
