The Pacific-Antarctic ridge is the key link in the plate circuit describing the
relative motion of the plates of the Pacific basin and the surrounding
continental terranes. This project involves a shipboard survey of critical
flowline, at high latitude, crossing the Pacific-Antarctic ridge. The objectives
of the program are to: (1) construct a high resolution plate kinematic model of
the South Pacific for the past 50 Ma; (2) analyze the temporal evolution of both
ridge parallel and fracture zone crustal morphology; (3) model the deep
structure of fracture zone FZ XII using combine Geosat, Hydrosweep, and gravity
data; and (4) evaluate the contributions of chemical remnant magnetization and
thermo-viscous magnetization to the source of marine magnetic anomalies.
