ABSTRACT The national need for civil and environmental engineers to address the
engineering aspects of the deterioration of infrastructure facilities and the
remediation of environmentally damaged sites is becoming more eminent as
awareness levels rise and priorities change. To meet this need the faculty in
the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of
Michigan is dedicated to recruiting and training high-quality engineering
professionals to serve as educators, researchers, and practitioners. Two
conditions limit our capacity to be successful: our ability to fund quality
students, and our ability to attract a diverse group of American students. It is
well recognized that the traditional pool of candidates for graduate school is
dwindling, and that the talents of persons historically underrepresented in
engineering must be tapped. This includes both minorities and women. This
proposal outlines our intention to aggressively pursue qualified students to
encourage them to join our educational program, and to prepare them for a
professional career in one or more of the multi- faceted phases of
Infrastructure Facilities.
