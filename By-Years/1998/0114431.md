The Project will (1) focus on results of large-scale K-5 science education
reform on student achievement to further understand what practices and
curriculum facilitate learning and benefit all students. (2) the Project will
use Tennessee's unique statewide, longitudinal database to develop a comparable
longitudinal database that includes several culturally diverse California school
districts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(3) Student achievement findings in Tennessee's
standardized assessment will be linked to two NSF-LSC projects' teacher training
databases. (4) An additional database will be developed using one or more
appropriate assessment measures that may be better aligned with new science
curriculum. (6) The TerraNova test will be used to allow value-added analysis in
Tennessee and California and linked to the Stanford Achievement Test 9th
Edition, used in California.&lt;br/&gt;
