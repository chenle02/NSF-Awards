Abstract 9421266 Baker This project uses high-frequency coherent back-scatter
radars to study ionospheric structures of auroral origin and to determine the
magnetospheric activity responsible for the radar echoes. The existing radars
are at Goose Bay, Labrador Canada and the British Antarctic Survey station at
Halley Bay, Antarctica. This pair is called the Polar Anglo-American Conjugate
Experiment, and they are so located that their fields of view are magnetically
conjugate. A new radar, called the Southern Hemisphere Auroral Experiment will
be installed at the new South African Sanae Station in Antarctica when it is
built. Though not officially part of this consortium, the new radar at the
Japanese Antarctic Station, Syowa, will contribute complementary data. The
project is a joint venture of Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics
Laboratory, British Antarctic Survey and the South African National Antarctic
Expedition. The Japanese National Institute of Polar Research is cooperating
closely with the PACE/SHARE collaboration. JHU/APL developed the use of HF
coherent radars for auroral research, based on their extensive experience with
Over-The-Horizon radars, which are used for defense purposes. ***
