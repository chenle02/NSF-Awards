9306733 Schoen This grant supports the research of Professor C. Schoen to work
on Chow groups defined by cycles of higher dimensions. He will also study maps
of an algebraic curve to a genus zero curve defined over the reals. This project
falls into the general area of arithmetic geometry -a subject that blends two of
the oldest areas of mathematics: number theory and geometry. This combination
has proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems that
withstood generations. Among its many consequences are new error correcting
codes. Such codes are essential for both modern computers (hard disks) and
compact disks. ***
