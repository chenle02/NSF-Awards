This is an award under the Research Planning Grant program for women scientists
and engineers. It is a project to study the changing shape of voluntary
association activism in America in recent decades. The researcher will examine
Internal Revenue Service data on voluntary associations in order to select a
representative sample of such associations and identify their founders. Also
supported would be work to develop an interview schedule and pilot interviews
with selected founders of voluntary associations in order to learn their what
their strategies were in launching their organizations and how they saw the
environment for activism at that time. This award will initiate research which
should provide important new perspectives on the social climate and political
dynamics of post-World War II America. In addition to the scientific gains to be
achieved by the research, this award will materially assist a promising young
researcher to prepare for a larger project, thereby contributing to the
stengthening of the national base of women scientists and engineers.
