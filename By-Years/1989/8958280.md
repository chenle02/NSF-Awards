In order to understand the role of nucleic acid conformation in genetic
regulation, Dr. Feigon plans to: 1) continue studies of DNA oligomers containing
potential B-Z junctions and triple stranded DNAs; 2) investigate echinomycin-DNA
complexes; 3) examine how ECORI restriction enzyme and methylase bind
specifically to the DNA sequence GAATTC; and 4) the study the interaction of the
typtophan repressor with operator DNA. This project is concerned with the range
of conformations that nucleic acids adopt, both free in solution and in complex
with proteins and drugs, and in the specific factors that determine sequence
specific binding of proteins and other ligands to nucleic acids. The primary
research tool for this project is high field nuclear magnetic resonance
spectroscopy, particulary two-dimensional, to elucidate structure and dynamics.
