This award provides support for the 2020 Talbot Workshop "Ambidexterity in
Chromatic Homotopy Theory" to be held June 21-27 in Nacogdoches, TX, as well as
for subsequent workshops in 2021 and 2022. The structure of these workshops
reflects the fact that mathematics is an intensely collaborative endeavor,
requiring mentorship across generations and formation of trusting relationships
within a given cohort. Since the initial meeting, in 2004, the Talbot Workshops
have employed a uniquely human-centered approach in introducing scores of young
researchers to topics of contemporary interest in a broad range of mathematics
centering on algebraic topology. Each workshop gathers about 35 young
participants and one or two senior mathematicians for a week-long retreat. The
participants, who are mostly graduate students, learn about the workshop?s
research topic by exchanging lectures and discussing the topic under the
guidance of the mentors. As many of the participants are first- or second-year
graduate students looking to get a start in a promising research area, the
lectures begin with basic introductory material and lead up to a presentation of
open problems. The workshop has been extremely successful, inspiring the future
research of many students and establishing numerous collaborations among the
participants. There will continue to be a serious effort to insure a broad and
diverse participant list. The workshop?s unique format, in which participants
live and cook together in a rental house, helps to create and sustain a relaxed
and collaborative atmosphere. Organizing the workshop provides an important
opportunity for professional development by the leadership committee, which is
entirely made up of graduate students with backup oversight by a senior faculty
member.

Past Talbot Workshops have focused on a wide variety of topics in homotopy
theory and surrounding areas, from elliptic cohomology (2004) and Fukaya
categories (2009) to non-abelian Hodge theory (2011) and solution of the
Kervaire invariant problem (2016), and most recently, recent progress on Moduli
Spaces of Manifolds (2019). The topic for the 2020 workshop is "Ambidexterity in
Chromatic Homotopy Theory." It will be mentored by Jacob Lurie (Institute for
Advanced Study, Princeton) and Tomer Schlank (Hebrew University, Jerusalem). The

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
