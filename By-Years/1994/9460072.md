This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is directed at
determining the feasibility of a new enzymatic process for synthesizing insect
pheromones. Pheromones are nontoxic, naturally occurring chemicals that show
great promise in controlling insect pests in agriculture. However, there
currently is no cost advantage to using pheromones, primarily because pheromones
are expensive chemicals. In the Phase I program, unsaturated fatty acids with
specific location of a single double bond (which are key, high-value
intermediates in numerous pheromones) will be synthesized from inexpensive
saturated fatty acids. The proposed new enzymatic-synthesis process is based on
enzymes that insects themselves use to produce pheromones. If successful, this
process should result in production of pheromones at a cost two to four times
less than is the case with traditional chemical synthesis. Researchers believe
that this could substantially increase the use of pheromones in agriculture and
also result in significant environmental benefits from both synthesis and use of
pheromones compared with insecticides. Success in the Phase I program will lead
to process development and scale-up in Phase II and commercialization in Phase
III.
