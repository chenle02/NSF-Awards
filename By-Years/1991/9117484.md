Our understanding of the dynamics of the magnetosphere will be advanced by this
proposed research in three ways: (1) to carry to a new and significantly greater
level of completeness the assembly of the basic engine that drives
magnetospheric circulation, (2) specify the global geometry of magnetospheric
circulation for times when it appears to operate in reverse (up to 50% of the
time), and (3) graphically demonstrate and quantitatively evaluate over an
entire magnetospheric cross section the coupling by which the solar wind powers
the engine that drives magnetospheric circulation. The first project will
combine for the first time separate and distinct models for three major
components of the engine (voltage generator, current generator, and ring current
energy storage element) into a single, physically explicit, self-consistent,
quantitative model that predicts the distribution of currents and voltages over
the ionospheric surfaces on which magnetospheric circulation is expressed. The
second project will produce quantitatively explicit, global magnetic field maps
showing for the first time how hemispherical asymmetry plays a critical role in
establishing reverse circulation. The third project will produce empirically
derived magnetic field maps (from IMP 8 magnetic field data) showing how the
solar wind magnetic field - the coupling field - drapes over and attaches to the
magnetosphere to deliver the power to the engine that drives magnetospheric
circulation.
