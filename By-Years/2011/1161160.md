1161160/ Banta&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goal of this innovative and high
risk NSF EAGER award, funded by the Biotechnology, Biochemical and Biomass
Engineering Program and by the Biosensing Program, is to use directed evolution
to modify novel calcium-regulated beta roll peptides so that they can bind to
protein targets with built-in allosteric recognition. The beta roll peptide has
a cork-screw structure that reversibly forms in the presence of calcium. This
domain has not evolved to bind to other proteins, but structurally it resembles
the leucine rich repeat and ankyrin repeat proteins, which have both evolved,
and been engineered, for biomolecular recognition. The researchers have begun to
use directed evolution to create new beta roll peptides that bind to a model
protein target, and the built-in allosteric regulation of the scaffold will
enable the binding interface to be formed depending on the calcium
concentration. This will be the first example of the directed evolution of an
intrinsically disordered peptide for biomolecular recognition. These peptides
can then be used in sensing or other molecular engineering applications.
