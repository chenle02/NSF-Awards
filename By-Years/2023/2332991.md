This grant supports a workshop on Software Engineering for Robotics
(SE4Robotics), which will take place in Detroit in early October, co-located
with the International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2023).
The workshop's purpose is to bring together two communities – Robotics and
Software Engineering – to discuss how Software Engineering R&D can be taken into
account for Robotics. Software Engineering advances the ability to develop, test
and debug software, prove properties of software to verify correctness, automate
code understanding, architect systems so that they are modular and maintainable,
produce product lines, etc. New programming languages and tool chains may be
needed to implement these advances.

The field of Robotics is rapidly increasing as an economic sector, making the
software engineering issues a paramount concern as robot software becomes
increasingly ubiquitous. It is important to take advantage of years of software
engineering algorithm development, techniques and tools, platforms, open source
ecosystems, and studies of theoretical and practical limitations, rather than
have the field of Robotics treat the software engineering issues afresh.
Conversely, Robotics software will push the limits of current software
engineering capabilities due to the special nature of the field, due to
requirements such as uncertainly, new notions of system state, integration of
cyber and physical components, real-time needs, and so on. The result of the
workshop will be a report outlining an R&D roadmap.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
