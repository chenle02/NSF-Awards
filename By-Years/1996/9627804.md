be used for the following research projects: (i) Sequential Experimental Design
in Non-Linear Models (I. Guttman & A. Mallik). (ii) Bayesian Interim Analysis of
Clinical Trials (G. D. Papandonatos). (iii) Model Selection Problems (J.
Dmochowski). (iv) Planning of Experiments and Rank Tests (M.M. Desu).
