Proposal # 1143535&lt;br/&gt;Title: Academic Leadership for Women in Engineering
&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Peter Finn&lt;br/&gt;The Society of Women in
Engineering&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Proposal Summary: &lt;br/&gt;The Society of
Women Engineers (SWE) is committed to the achievement and success of all women
in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM). An important segment of
SWE?s membership consists of women in academia. Since retention and promotion of
women in academia, especially within engineering disciplines continues to be a
significant challenge, this workshop will assist faculty to acquire essential
leadership and management skills. Senior women mentors will share their
experiences with the participants during this workshop. The proposed workshop
will offer executive leadership opportunities and key skills that will support
career advancement for women academics in engineering. Participants will be
encouraged to pursue the full diversity of roles within their organizations that
offer opportunities for leadership. The workshop will be hosted in October
13-15, 2011 at SWE?s annual conference, WE11, in Chicago, IL. &lt;br/&gt;In
addition, participants will learn sound practices in advancement in academia and
develop opportunities and mechanisms for networking across institutions.
Specific objectives of the workshop are: &lt;br/&gt;? Increase the number of
women in academic leadership positions &lt;br/&gt;? Provide key practices and
information that will accelerate and enhance the success of women in academic
leadership positions &lt;br/&gt;? Cultivate a network of practice for women
engineering faculty leaders &lt;br/&gt;? Develop mentor relationships that
benefit women engineering faculty who are seeking leadership roles.
