This project concentrates on propositional proof systems, Boolean complexity,
and parallel/sequential computable functionals of higher types. The project
specifically concerns: (1) upper and lower bounds for the number of symbols in
proofs of various combinatorial statements for an extension of resolution called
cutting planes, originating in operations research, as well as for related
prepositional logics (logics of approximate reasoning or threshold logics,
logics with the bi-conditional, with modular counting gates, etc.); (2) the
relation between the parallel complexity of a language L and the algebraic
structure of so-called invariance groups and extended invariance groups
corresponding to L (structure of invariance groups of regular and context free
languages, structure of extended invariance groups of fast parallel computable
languages, invariance groups of monotonic versus non-monotonic boolean
functions, relation to Krohn-Rhodes semi-group theory); and (3) the study of
variants of the scheme of bounded primitive recursion applied to higher type
functionals (functions whose arguments may be functions), and the study of
parallel computable real valued functions. This research applies techniques from
complexity theory, proof theory (mathematical logic), combinatorics and finite
group theory. Initial experimental studies of extended invariance groups will be
done using a parallel computer. The goal of this research is to increase our
understanding of low level parallel complexity and associated logics with long
term possible applications in logic programming, database update methods, VLSI
design, and programming language design.
