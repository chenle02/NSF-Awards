While it is known that ovarian and adrenal steroid hormones are involved in the
regulation of reproductive behaviors, the question remains as to the specific
role that androgen and estrogen play. While once considered a straightforward
question, it is now complicated by the finding that testosterone, the major
androgen, is metabolized into estrogen in peripheral and neural tissues. Since
strong evidence is accumulating to suggest a function for androgen in expression
of female behavior in both humans and primates, it becomes imperative to know
the identity of the hormone mediating each function. Dr. Rissman has developed a
model system to examine this important question. She uses members of a small
primitive mammalian species of the order of Insectivora which have a number of
striking features similar to humans. Dr. Rissman has designed a series of
experiments to determine whether androgen is acting directly or by its neural
metabolism to estrogen. Once she has this information, Dr. Rissman will define
the location in the brain where the hormone is acting. These studies will
provide important information towards understanding the underlying neural
mechanisms. Moreover, this work could be very beneficial in prescribing hormonal
therapy for postmenopausal women and women who have had their ovaries and/or
adrenals removed for medical purposes.
