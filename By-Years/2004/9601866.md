9601866 Selassie Pomona College This award from the Academic Research
Infrastructure (ARI) Program will assist the Department of Chemistry at Pomona
College acquire computer workstations and attendant software packages. This
equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including the following:
(1) dynamical theory of reactive processes in pillared smectite clays and
zeolites (2) intramolecular hydrogen bonding in DMSO solution (3) 3D-QSAR
studies of receptor-ligand interactions (4) enzymatic reactions in non-aqueous
solutions, and (5) re-analysis of quantitative structure-activity relationships
using comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA). A network of fast, modern
computer workstations is a new way to satisfy the computing needs of chemistry
departments. Such a "computer network" also serves as a development environment
for new theoretical codes and algorithms, provides state-of-art graphics and
visualization facilities, and supports research in state-of-the-art applications
of parallel processing.
