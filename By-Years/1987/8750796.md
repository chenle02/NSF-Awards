Appalachian State University will upgrade optics laboratories for undergraduate
instruction. A modern optics laboratory will be instrumented for a senior-level
course, Optics and Optoelectronics. The laboratory component of this course will
include traditional experiments in geometrical and physical optics but will
emphasize contemporary topics in optical science such as lasers, fiber optic
communication, and holographic techniques. An important part of the laboratory
work will be the use, in selected experiments, of microcomputers for data
acquisition and instrument control as well as for data analysis. The computer
hardware and some of the necessary optics equipment has already been acquired.
All of the experiments have been designed and developed and, to the extent
possible, tested with the limited equipment on hand. A number of classical
optics experiments currently performed in existing upper-level physics
laboratory courses will also be upgraded by supplementing or replacing some
older one-of-a-kind apparatus with present generation equipment. Introductory
courses for science and pre- engineering majors and others will also be improved
by the project.
