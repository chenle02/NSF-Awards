Two methods, discriminant analysis of Fourier transform mid-range and near
infrared spectra, have been developed as high throughput approaches to
identifying mutations in plant cell wall polysaccharide components and wall
architecture.

These methods will be employed to identify in insertion tagged populations of
maize and Arabidopsis a broad range of mutants involved in the biogenesis and
dynamic alteration of plant cell wall architecture during growth and
development. A systematic protocol using biochemical, spectroscopic, and imaging
methods has been devised to categorize defects in wall structure and
architecture related to development into one of six stages of wall biogenesis or
disassembly. Maize lines carrying Mu-insertions and Arabidopsis lines carrying
T-DNA tags will be used as primary material for both forward and reverse
screens. A major practical goal of the project is to generate plants with
genetically defined variation in wall composition and architecture that will
permit assessment of modifications on wall properties and plant development.
Since cell walls are an enormously important source of industrial raw material,
we anticipate that several of the genes we identify and characterize, as well as
several of the plants with genetically defined alterations, will be of economic
importance. As the heritability of the mutations is confirmed and information on
the possible function of the genes identified is obtained, the plant biology
community will be informed of them through a web site that has been created as a
repository for all cell-wall related genomics. Maize and Arabidopsis stock
centers will be provided with all materials to dispense to the community at
large.
