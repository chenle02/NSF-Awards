This proposal seeks support to develop and implement a two- semester course of
instruction designed to provide an integrated introduction to science for pre-
service elementary education (first through eighth grade) majors. Concurrent
with an inquiry-centered laboratory-based content course is the development of a
practicum in which the pre-service students will work with master
teacher/mentors teachers to translate science content into actual learning
situations with children. This practicum will involve teachers and students from
the Moscow, Idaho Public Schools and the Couer d'Alene Reservation Schools.
Additional school districts will be brought into participation as the project
matures. At the end of three years, all elementary education majors will
participate in this program. The curriculum will be developed by six research
faculty from the departments of chemistry, biology, physics, geology, and
biochemistry, in collaboration with science education specialists as well as
teachers and administrators from regional schools. The courses will present
science as a seamless whole through a blending of discovery-based activities and
cooperative learning in a technology-rich environment. While this is a content
curriculum, it will present science in ways that model the best teaching
practices.
