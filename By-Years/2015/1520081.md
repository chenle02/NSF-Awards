With this study we plan to combine seismic data from oil-company surveys with
the earthquake seismic data from the Southern California Seismic Network to
determine the velocity in the top 1-3 km of the surface in the Los Angeles
Basin. This information is important because it directly bears on the level of
shaking that can be expected from earthquakes due to the variations soils and
subsurface structures. It will be used along with actual measurements of ground
shaking to determine maps of seismic hazard for the central part of the Los
Angeles Basin. In addition, we will use the dense coverage provided by the oil-
company surveys to determine the micro-earthquake activity in the basin. This is
important for understanding the physical process that generates the earthquakes
in Los Angeles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The subsurface velocity structure will be
determined by surface waves and refracted body waves. These waves will be
extracted from the ambient noise field by cross-correlation of the oil-company
and earthquake-monitoring data. The source that generates these waves is ocean
microseisms, and hence is always present. The correlations will be done over
many days and will use small-aperture sub-arrays to minimize the background
noise. The result will be a map of the near-surface shear and compressional wave
velocities for the central basin, where the ray coverage is the densest. The
near-surface velocities will then be added to the reference model of the Los
Angeles region (SCEC velocity model) to make a complete velocity model that can
be used to simulated earthquake-generated wave in the basin.
