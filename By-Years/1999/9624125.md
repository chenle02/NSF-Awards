Future high speed networks will carry traffic from a variety of applications,
including distributed computing/database applications. The primary motivation to
use high speed networks for this application class is to achieve very low
latencies, and more importantly, to obtain guarantees on the delay bounds at the
application level. This project will investigate application level performance
in high speed networks for this application class. The objectives of this
research are to (1) characterize traffic from this application class using
actual traces, (2) determine application-level QoS requirements for this
application class, (3) translate the end-to-end application-level QoS
requirements to network level per node QoS (for instance, cell-level QoS for
switching nodes in ATM networks), and (4) assess the effectiveness of existing
techniques (both at the network as well as the application level) to guarantee
QoS requirements for this application class. Analytical and simulation
techniques assisted by measurements will be used in this research. The
significance of this research will be its contributions to the fundamental
understanding of the interaction between distributed computing/database
applications and high speed networking architectures and protocols.
