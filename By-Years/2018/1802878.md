With the increased availability, prominence, and applicability of data in all of
our lives, the emerging field of Translational Data Science is critical to
harnessing societal benefit from advances in data-related scientific
disciplines. The unprecedented growth in the creation and use of data offers new
opportunities for fostering more effective bridges between researchers, industry
and government colleagues, and a diverse community to enable new scientific
progress and tangible advances for societal benefit. This workshop will focus on
academic research and industry expertise to further cooperation and
partnerships.

Translational data science is an emerging field that applies data science
principles, techniques, and technologies to scientific challenges that hold the
promise of having an important societal impact. It focuses on the interface and
interactions between foundational aspects of data science and their use in
advancing scientific frontiers. By convening a diverse community of stakeholders
who can contribute to the strategic development of a Translational Data Science
roadmap, this workshop will build and strengthen connections across sectors. The
perspectives and insights shared from industry, government, nonprofits, and
academia, coupled with discussions focused on actionable challenges and
measurable outcomes, will serve to advance the field of data science as well as
related fields and application areas. The workshop provides a mechanism for
identifying high-priority topics and high-impact opportunities for future
research, training, and collaboration.
