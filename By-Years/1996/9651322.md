Capillary electrophoresis is becoming increasingly important as an analytical
tool in many areas of chemistry and related fields. Several colleges and
universities have begun to introduce capillary electrophoretic methods into
their undergraduate programs, but there remains only one published report of the
use of capillary electrophoresis for undergraduate education. The project begins
the process of modernizing the instrumental facilities with the purchase of a
capillary electrophoresis system with photo diode array detector and workstation
for data acquisition and analysis. Through the use of this instrument, students
can be exposed to several areas of chemistry and instrumental analysis
previously lacking in the department. Laboratory exercises are being developed
for an instrumental methods laboratory and a biochemistry laboratory. The
capillary electrophoresis system is also made accessible to undergraduates
conducting research in chemistry and related disciplines.
