This award provides funding for a three year standard award to support a
Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering Site program at the
University of Texas at Arlington entitled, "UT Arlington RET Site on Hazard
Mitigation," under the direction of Dr. Nur Yazdani.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
three year UT Arlington RET site will bring together a total of 42 high school
STEM teachers from the Arlington, Texas and five other school districts from
surrounding areas for a six week summer research experience focused around the
common theme of hazard mitigation. This site will involve a multi-disciplinary
group of faculty members from civil engineering, computer science, electrical
engineering, industrial engineering and education. The RET site will train
teachers regarding the application of mathematic and scientific principles to
solve problems related to hazard mitigation such as emergency evacuations,
dispersion of airborne toxics, and enhanced hacker detection. The teams will
work on "real-world" scenarios which can help to mitigate crises that may
potentially occur as they relate to homeland security, natural disasters and
information security.
