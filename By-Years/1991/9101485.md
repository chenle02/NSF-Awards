This project will study existence and regularity of solutions for nonlinear
dispersive equations. The main topics to be considered are the development of
singularities, the life span of solutions, and blow up of solutions to
thermoelasticity equations. The techniques to be employed come mainly from
harmonic analysis and apriori estimates for commutators. The questions to be
analyzed are state of the art mathematical problems in equations modeling
phenomena in physics and engineering.
