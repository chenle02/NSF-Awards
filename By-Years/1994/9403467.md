9403467 Robinson In this project, the PIs will continue process studies of: I.
Intermediate and Deep water formation, dispersion, and mixing, and, II. Dynamics
of the Mediterranean general circulation. Several different modeling approaches
will be used, both with idealized conditions to identify internal parameters
important in the mixing processes, and with realistic fluxes to simulate actual
conditions in the Eastern Mediterranean for comparison with field studies to be
carried out by neighboring countries. Previous work, carried out under POEM
(Physical Oceanography of the Eastern Mediterranean) has been very successful
and has involved scientists from several countries bordering the region of
interest. *** 9403471 Rizzoli In this project, the PIs will continue process
