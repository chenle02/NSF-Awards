0331608&lt;br/&gt;Dixon&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research by Dr. James Dixon at
the University of Colorado, Boulder is to complete the analysis and publication
of results from the archaeological research at "On You Knees Cave" (OYKC) on
Prince of Wales Island, Southeast Alaska. The proposed project includes field
verification of remaining questions, completion of data analysis, description,
illustration, interpretation and presentation/publication of the research
findings. This particular project has been a model for developing partnerships
between the scientific and local Alaska Native community. This relationship has
been particularly important to the extraction and examination of the oldest
human remains discovered to date in Alaska or Canada. The proposed completion of
the final analysis and publication of the research findings will give greater
insight into early cultural development and paleoecology along the Northwest
Coast of North America.
