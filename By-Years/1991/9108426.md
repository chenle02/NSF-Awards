A genetic approach will be taken to investigate cell specification in the
embryonic pituitary. A transgenic mouse will be made in which expression of the
thymidine kinase gene will be directed to melanotropes and corticotropes using
the promoter of the pro-opiomelanocortin gene. Cells that express the transgene
will be ablated and the consequences of this ablation on the differentiation of
other pituitary cell types, repopulation of the pituitary with pro-
opiomelanocortin cells and re-differentiation of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis
will be determined. These studies offer an innovative, non-invasive approach
toward understanding the role of cell-cell interactions in neural development
and specification.
