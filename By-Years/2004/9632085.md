9632085 The long term goal of this project is to determine the total DNA
sequence of the Arabidopsis thaliana genome. For the next three years, the
specific goal of this project is to produce at least 8.5 Mb of finished
sequences of DNA using a two-pronged, BAC-based strategy for generating megabase
quantity of high quality genome sequence data. One focus of the strategy will be
to perform single-pass sequencing from the ends of BAC clones from a well-
constructed genomic library of Arabidopsis. The second focus will be on the
complete sequencing of BAC clones using a random shotgun approach. When each BAC
has been completely sequenced and assembled, the BAC contig sequence will be
compared to the database of BAC end sequences. A BAC or BACs which have minimal
sequence overlap with the completed BAC will then be selected for the next round
of shotgun library construction and sequencing. By repeating this
sequence/search process after the completion of each BAC, a sequence-based map
of the minimal tiling path of Arabidopsis BACs will be generated for the genome
without requiring a separate BAC mapping effort. The finished sequence data will
be released on TIGR's web site and in GenBank three months from the time when
work begins on the sequencing of each selected BAC. Clones will be freely
available through the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center at Ohio State. This
award is one of the three awarded by the triagency (Department of Energy,
National Science Foundation, and US Department of Agriculture) Arabidopsis
thaliana genome research program. The activity of this project will be
coordinated with the other groups engaged in large scale sequencing of the
Arabidopsis genome. The results will contribute to determining the overall
strategy for the completion of the sequence of the entire Arabidopsis genome.
More importantly, the information and data produced will be useful to the
general research community and will contribute to rapid advances in pl ant
biology.
