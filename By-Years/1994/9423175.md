9423175 Howes The Center for Grinding Research and Development (CGRD), an NSF
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center, seeks funding to support its
director on a tour of precision manufacturing research centers and companies in
Asia. The CGRD and its industrial sponsors recognize that grinding technology
development is taking place world wide and that standards of precision in
grinding are set on a global rather than a national scale. The tour of precision
manufacturing laboratories and companies proposed for the CGRD director will
achieve several goals. First, and most significantly, it will allow him to
better determine the research paths that would be strategically advantageous for
the CGRD and its industrial sponsors to pursue. Additionally, the tour is
expected to open opportunities for research collaboration between Asian centers
and the CGRD and its industrial sponsors. Through this tour, the director will
be able to access a fund of international expertise in grinding and precision
manufacturing hitherto unavailable in the U.S. Finally, the director will
explore the possibility of future collaborative projects between the CGRD and
these sites. The report that results from this tour will be mf strategic
importance to the NSF as well as the Grinding Center. The CGRD director has
already visited precision manufacturing research facilities in Germany and
Japan, and this tour will allow him to produce an analysis that takes into
account the major areas of precision manufacturing technology throughout the
world. Such a document could assist the NSF in making policy decision relevant
to its manufacturing initiatives.
