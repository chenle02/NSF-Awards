This research will study the complexity of computation using the framework of
Boolean circuit complexity. Special emphasis is placed on the following topics:
Strong separations of circuit classes: If known separations of small circuit
complexity classes could be strengthened, it would imply separations on larger
time- and space-complexity classes. This connection will be investigated, using
the notion of "immunity" as a tool. Width-bounded reducibility: This notion will
be used as a tool to investigate the relationships among "similar" complexity
classes. This project also investigates threshold circuits, an structure of the
complexity class P/poly.
