The Cincinnati Art Museum, which holds important collections of prehistoric
North American artifacts, will deaccession these materials in 1989. The
Cincinnati Museum of Natural History (CMNH) has agreed to accept responsibility
for them, and support from the National Science Foundation will assist in this
process. Appropriate storage cases to house the collection and computer hardware
to aid in its recataloguing will be purchased. Because of the magnitude of the
project, addition staff will be hired. These actions will insure that the
collection is properly stored and made available to the research community. The
collection is important because it is essentially regional in nature and
consists of archaeological objects from southwestern Ohio and the middle Ohio
Valley, as well as complete ceramic vessels from Arkansas. Rare engraved shell
objects from eastern Tennessee are also included. The collection spans the gamut
of prehistory in eastern North America and contains a significant group of
proto-historic objects. Thus, it documents the rise of complex Native American
societies and shows the effect of contact between these groups and European
cultures. It is useful to archaeologists interested in North American prehistory
and the effects of culture contact and change. Archaeological collections such
as this one serve to document America's past and stand as important
archaeological data. To realize their potential, however, they must be preserved
and made available to researchers. This project is essential because it will
make such materials available for scientific study.
