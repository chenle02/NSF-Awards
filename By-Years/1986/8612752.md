This is a research program on the development of laser-assisted chemical vapor
deposition (LA-CVD) for the epitaxial growth of II-VI compound semiconductors.
Focus will be on ZnSe, which has several important optoelectronic device
applications. LA-CVD should allow lower growth temperatures and better
Stoichiometric control than conventional techniques, through selective
excitation and photodissociation of source materials. Lower temperatures may be
particularly important for the development of techniques for the growth of
device-quality II-VI semiconductor crystals. The first year of the research
program will be devoted to demonstrating that LA-CVD is a viable method for
growing ZnSe of useful quality by determining the important parameters and
techniques for successful epitaxial deposition. In the second and third years,
quantitative kinetic and mass transport models of the growth process will be
developed. Detailed characterization of the structual and electrical properties
of the films will be made in order to correlate growth conditions with
electrical characteristics. The ultimate goal of this program is to develop a
technique for the growth of device quality ZnSe and to fabricate working p-n
junction from this material.
