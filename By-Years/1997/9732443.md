This study focuses on the behavior of simple quantal systems whose classical
counterparts are chaotic. Further experiments on the sharp, strong-field
resonances between adjacent Stark substates of excited hydrogen atoms driven by
a superimposed linearly polarized microwave field and a static electric field
will be pursued. Basic knowledge from spectroscopy measurements on these states
will be used to develop an n-tomograph for measuring the n-distribution of atoms
having an unknown mixture of n-levels. Finally, comparison will be made between
two-dimensional electromagnetic cavities and of quantal billiards having the
same shape.
