Professor John L. Hogg and other members of the Chemistry Department of Texas
A&M University are being supported to continue a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry. For the period 1991-93, nine
undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in a
variety of research projects. Projects include chromatography of chiral
molecules, reactions of tellurium compounds, and the folding mechanism of
proteins. The program will feature a lecture series and tours of local chemical
industries. Students will give both oral and written reports of their summer
research progress. Participants will be predominantly two-year college students
and minorities.
