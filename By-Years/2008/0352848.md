This award supports the development of microelectrode array technologies that
can be used to directly monitor, on a second-by-second basis, neurotransmitter
signaling in the brains of laboratory animals. The devices are formed on ceramic
wafers analogous to microelectrode chips. The resulting microelectrode arrays
can be mass fabricated for general scientific use and can be configured to
directly measure second-by-second changes in the neurotransmitters glutamate,
acetylcholine and GABA and other molecules. The present technology can be
carried out in anesthetized animal preparations, brain slices and cellular
systems. In addition, the technology can be adapted for studies in awake
behaving animals so that neurotransmitter changes in the brain can be directly
related to behavior and function. When perfected, this technology will be widely
used by basic scientists in the fields of neuroscience and neurobiology, and may
contribute to other applications with scientists developing biosensor devices.
The development of the ceramic-based microelectrode array technology could allow
for linking behavior with brain function and a further understanding of learning
and memory, epilepsy, movement processes, drug abuse, brain systems and a
variety of neuronal systems that all use glutamate, acetylcholine and GABA as
their primary neurotransmitters. A variety of improvements to microelectrode
design include 1) enhanced selectivity for the neurotransmitters glutamate,
acetylcholine and GABA; 2) development of methodology to implement the recording
technology inexpensively so that other laboratories can afford this state-of-
the-art technology; 3) development of the technology for awake animals so that
investigators can study the direct links between brain systems and behavior; and
4) development of nanotechnology approaches to enhance the recording properties
of the microelectrodes.&lt;br/&gt;
