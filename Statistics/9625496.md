DMS 96-25496 Eubank Problems of inference for parametric and nonparametric
regression are investigated. Tests of goodness-of-fit for parametric regression
models are proposed that derive from the comparison of parametric and
nonparametric estimators. This is accomplished for rather general models that
include generalized linear and time series models. New methods are developed for
analytic, asymptotic comparison of these nonparametric type tests through the
use of intermediate asymptotic efficiency. These testing ideas are extended to
more general goodness-of-fit problems, such as testing for additivity, where the
null model is even nonparametric. Other inference problems are also studied,
including several proposals for the construction of asymptotically valid
confidence intervals for nonparametric regression that have good finite sample
properties. It is often reasonable to believe in many areas of science, such as
biology, engineering, psychology, etc., that the data being collected is
produced by two components: a nonrandom component, representing a characteristic
of nature common to all individuals or subjects, and a random component that
accounts for individual variation. The nonrandom component represents the
reproducible or predictable aspect of the phenomenon being studied and is
therefore of considerable interest. In many cases, from theoretical
considerations or past experience, one can postulate a mathematical framework or
model that is believed to describe the nonrandom component. When such models are
correct they can provide useful summary and predictive tools. However, an
incorrect model can lead to misleading conclusions and inaccurate predictions of
future events. Thus, it is important to have methodology for assessing the
accuracy of postulated models for data. This research focuses on the development
of new tools for this purpose that rely on the comparison of two types of
estimators for the nonrandom component: namely, an estimator that is computed
under the assumpt ion that the postulated model is correct and a very flexible
estimator that does not employ this assumption. The theoretical statistical
issues that are addressed in this work include the development of objective
criteria for comparing the two estimators and the determination of values for
these criteria which indicate that the data does not support a postulated model.
Other problems that are considered include the use of the data to construct
intervals that have a known, specified, chance of containing the unknown,
nonrandom component of the data.
