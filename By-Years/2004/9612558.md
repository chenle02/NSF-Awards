9612558 Dahleh We propose to carry out basic research in the areas of
identification robust control, and nonlinear robust control. In the
identification area, we intend to examine new paradigms in which model
uncertainty is part of the model structure parametrization, such that the
resulting identified models are readily usable for robust control purposes.
Fundamental issues relating to identifiability of model sets, input design,
algorithms, and sample complexity will be addressed. In the robust control area
we propose to develop robust analysis and synthesis tools for more general
classes of performance, which are more relevant to practical design objectives
than the worst- case paradigms employed at present. Moreover, we will further
investigate the optimal l1 problem in state space to derive a separation
structure for the optimal output feedback controller. In the nonlinear area, our
purpose is to provide computational analysis and design tools for classes of
nonlinear systems that capture a wide range of applications. One such class is
the set of linear parameter-varying systems. The goal is to provide a catalog of
special problem structures and corresponding tools for analysis and controller
design. In addition, we will search for structures that have low dimensional
nonlinear components in such a way that the computational complexity of the
analysis problem is directly a function of these nonlinear components. Other
related topics will be considered. ***
