9520536 Wilson The research combines high-resolution laser ablation with laser-
induced electrical conductivity to address the problem of copper deposition on
polyimide. There are significant advantages of a copper/polyimide inner-connect
system arising from the polyimide low dielectric constant and the high
electrical conductivity of copper; however, there are fundamental problems, such
as the resolution and adhesion of copper to polyimide. If these problems can be
addressed and solved, then improved performances and decreased cost will result
in chip metalization, Multi-Chip Module (MCM) interconnects and printed circuit
wiring boards (PCBs). The research addresses these issues and, in particular,
offers a solution to the chip-interconnect problem. An innovative approach to
the fabrication of MOS Transistors with the use of the above techniques to form
a conductive gate electrode over a multi-insulator, polyimide gate dielectric
layer. ***
