Recent technical advances in computer hardware and sensitive electron array
detectors have made it possible to examine the structure of extremely small
volumes of material. Unequivocal structural information on such volumes cannot
be obtained by conventional means. This research will develop techniques for the
determination of the structure of nanometer size regions using advanced
equipment. In addition modifications to the theory of electron diffraction from
such regions will be developed as necessary. The research will be conducted
cooperatively between Arizona State University and Exxon Chemical Company.
