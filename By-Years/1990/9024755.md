The proposed work is the lead project in an integrated research program into the
oceanographic structure of the western Weddell Sea. It is to be carried out from
an ice camp jointly occupied by U.S. and USSR scientists from February to June
1992. This project concerns the large-scale oceanographic circulation and the
variability of the Weddell Sea boundary current, and how these affect and are
affected by the regional water mass formation and modification processes. The
Weddell Sea may be divided into three regions on the basis of the energy
exchange mode. The warm regime occurs in the east where the intrusion of warm
circumpolar deep water keeps the water temperature nea +1 deg C. The cold regime
occurs in the center, where deep water is overlain by a thick near freezing
mixed layer. In both regions however enough heat is seasonally carried to the
sea ice to melt it completely. In the western region, the sea ice cover does not
melt, and it is expected that the thermodynamics processes will be different.
Hydrographic data, coupled with the current meter observations, chemical tracer
experiments, turbulent flux measurements, and sea ice dynamics that are part of
this project, will provide a unique picture of the Weddell Sea continental slope
processes.
