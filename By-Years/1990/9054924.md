This project will develop a series of mathematics software programs for middle
school students. These programs are to develop skills in mathematics problem
solving. It has a specific target: at-risk students in the middle school. The
goal is to develop a discovery based approach to enable students to explore the
types of information necessary to discover key procedures. Two types of software
will be developed. the first type is a toolkit which enable students to
construct experiments on the relationships among different ways of expressing
numbers. the second type is word problem processors, which allow students to
generate varieties of word problems and speculate about similarities of the
conditions under which the computer used a particular approach to solving a
given problem. In addition, lesson plans will be developed and published. These
lessons are to guide the teachers in the use of the software. The lessons will
be geared to existing software as well as the software being developed on the
project. The result will be a complete course of lessons.
