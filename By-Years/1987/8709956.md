This project is a workshop in differential geometry to be held at the Aspen
Center for Physics in August of 1987. The purpose of this workshop is to
encourage and extend collaboration and research among differential geometers and
mathematical physicists. Of particular interest to the workshop will be areas of
modern geometry that have close interaction with recent research developments in
theoretical physics in Gauge Theory, String Theory, and Relativity.
