This is a study of uranium geochemistry in the anoxic sediments of the Black
Sea. The investigator is studying the mechanism by which uranium is precipitated
from seawater. Experiments are designed to determine the relative role of
organic complexation and the reduction of u+6 to U+4 in the precipitation
process. The Black Sea serves as a ready made laboratory where the uranium in
seawater has already been reduced to the +4 state before it diffuses into the
sediments. The samples were collected during the Black Sea expedition (April-
July, 1988) and in this project they will be analyzed and interpreted. The
ultimate goal of the research is to understand the sources and the sinks of
uranium in seawater.
