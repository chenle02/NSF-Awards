Abstract ATM-9409368 Linsley, Braddock K. Dunbar, Robert B. William Marsh Rice
University Title: Collection of Multi-Century Coral Records of Ocean- Atmosphere
Variability from Clipperton Atoll This SGER award supports the retrieval of
coral records from the remote island of Clipperton (10o 18'N, 109o 13'W) in the
eastern Pacific. The goal is to collect drill cores from massive corals for
climatic reconstruction. Clipperton Island is uniquely situated on the northern
edge of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), in an area that has &gt;5m of
rainfall per year and is also directly influenced by El Nino events. Clipperton
is the eastern most atoll in the Pacific and is perhaps the largest biogenic
carbonate build-up in the eastern Pacific. Coral cores have never been collected
from Clipperton Island. The collection of coral cores from Clipperton Atoll will
enable comparison of the timing of interannual climatic variability with records
from Panama and the Galapagos. The research will be an important step in the
reconstruction of the ITCZ and ENSO in the eastern Pacific.
