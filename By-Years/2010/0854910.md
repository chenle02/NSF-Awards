The materials from which organisms are built (i.e. biomaterials) intrigue
engineers as well as biologists, but often for different reasons. Whereas
biologists are interested in how these structures vary, evolve and ultimately
influence performance and ecology, engineers typically seek to comprehend and
exploit the impressive properties of these materials. Indeed, biomaterials have
unmatched strength, toughness, resilience, and capacity for self-repair that, if
harnessed, might inform the development of new high performance man-made
materials. Despite having similar research interests, there is often a lack of
communication between biologists and engineers. This symposium, "Biomaterials:
properties, variation and evolution", will be held at the Annual Meeting of the
Society of Integrative and Comparative Biology with the goal of facilitating the
exchange of ideas among researchers who study a broad range of biomaterials
using a variety of perspectives and techniques. The symposium participants
constitute a diverse group of speakers in terms of gender, geographic origin, as
well as career stages, and include members of underrepresented groups in science
and engineering. The symposium will culminate in a collected volume of the
presented work in the journal, Integrative and Comparative Biology.
