The primary research objective of this grant is to advance the fundamental
understanding of the different physical and mechanical properties of cells as
they advance through different stages of neoplastic transformation from normal
to the metastatic state. Since recent reports indicate there is significant
ambiguity about how these properties change for different cancer cells, the
investigators plan to measure these properties for a single line of cells, and
to determine whether the changes vary for different cellular components: i.e.
whether the change in physical properties is due to a change in the
cytoskeleton, the cell membrane, the cytoplasm, or a combination of these
elements. Measurements using a wide array of techniques from physics and
cellular biology will be applied to the different cellular structures. In
addition, the investigators will create a biophysical computer model that brings
together all measurements to account for the observed variations in physical
properties at each state of neoplastic transformation.

This work will help to establish and disseminate new protocols and techniques
for determining the differences in physical properties between cancerous and
noncancerous cells. A team of physicists and biologists will train graduate and
undergraduate students to work in this highly interdisciplinary field.
Particular emphasis will be given to the education of minorities, through the
connections to the MARC U* STAR programs of NC A&T University and Winston-Salem
State University.
