0207407&lt;br/&gt;Keller&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The International Continental
Scientific Drilling Program (ICDP) is funding the drilling of a 2km hole in the
Chicxulub impact crater on the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. NSF is funding US
investigators to analyze core samples from the Chicxulub Scientific Drilling
Project (CSDP). The Chicxulub crater is one of the world's largest impact
craters and has been linked to the mass extnction event at the Cretaceous -
Tertiary (K/T) boundary ~65 million years ago. As part of the CSDP Science Team,
the Principal Investigators will carry out a collaborative and multidisciplinary
effort that addresses three main topics: 1) the age of the Chicxulub impact, 2)
evidence of multiple impacts, and 3) environmental and biotic consequences of
the impact(s). The research falls into two categories. The first is an
investigation of CSDP core samples by the PI to determine the age,
biostratigraphy, faunal turnover, and paleoenvironment of deposition based on
planktic and benthic foraminifera, and the correlation of this data with
sections throughout Central America. The second is a collaborative research
effort with other team members involving analyses of CSDP core samples for
impact glass, sedimentology, geochemistry, and mineralogy.
