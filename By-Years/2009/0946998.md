With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities:
Departmental Multi-User Instrumentation program (CRIF:MU), Professor Walter E.
Rudzinski and colleagues Michael Blanda, Chad J. Booth, Debra Feakes and
Jennifer Irvin from the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Texas State
University - San Marcos will upgrade a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. The upgraded
console will allow pulsed field gradient experiments and much faster data
collection and increased student accessibility. The spectrometer will also have
an auto-sampler. The instrument will be used to support research activities
such: 1) self-assembly of inherently chiral calix[6]arenes into helical
nanotubes; 2) development of high performance polymeric materials; 3)
investigation of polyhedral borane anions; and, 4) study of electroactive
polymers with improved n-doping stability and the effects of dopant ions on
electroactivity&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the
elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown
substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and
to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solids and in
solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists
who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will
have a positive impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry and materials
chemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as
research.
