The Psychology Department is using funds to enhance laboratory offerings in
experimental psychology, especially in the core content areas of perception and
cognition. The funds are being used to acquire computing and video equipment and
related software that will facilitate interactive learning and cutting-edge
research experiences for undergraduates, both on campus and at remote research
sites. Multimedia technology plays a prominent role in providing students on
campus with access to ongoing infant perception and child cognition research
programs conducted at the remote sites. Although the project's main focus is on
the content areas of perception and cognition, equipment acquired supports
hands-on, interactive laboratory activities in other areas as well, including
statistics and research design, neuropsychology, learning, social psychology,
and introductory psychology.
