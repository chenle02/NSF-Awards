9300867 Christie In this project the P.I.s will dive at Seamount 6 (near EPR at
12N) to make field measurements and sample hyaloclastite deposits. Their
objective is to evaluate dynamics of hyaloclastite eruptions. They argue that by
studying them they will obtain constraints on magma ascent velocity, plume
dynamics etc, for the high eruption-rate end-member of magmatic activity at
ridges. Once these field observations and other measurements are made, they will
employ modelling studies with the help of laboratory experiments. ***
