This research will focus on function theoretic properties of L-convex
manifolds. These L-convex manifolds are complex manifolds which are convex with
respect to sections of a bundle L. L-convex manifolds have recently proven
useful in attacking some classical problems in homomorphic convexity, such as
the Levi problem and Shafarevich's Conjecture on the universal covering space of
a projective variety. The project involves five areas of research: exhaustion
functions, approximation of sections, embedding, cohomology with values in a
coherent analytic sheaf, and characterization by local boundary conditions. This
research is in the general area of the geometric analysis of surfaces or
manifolds. These manifolds or surfaces exist in two, three, or many dimensions
and involve both analytic and geometric techniques to understand and describe
their structure. Often the surface is given coordinates and a metric which
provides a measurement of distance or angle. In this project the manifolds have
coordinates over the complex field and support a hermitian metric.
