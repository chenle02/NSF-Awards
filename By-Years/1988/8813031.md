Funding is provided for partial travel expenses of U.S. scientists to
participate in the Eighth International Phage Workshop, entitled "Gene
Organization and Expression in Bacteriophages". The workshop will be held in
Salamanca, Spain, from July 4-8, 1988 under the auspices of the European
Molecular Biology Organization (EMB). The American side of the meeting is being
organized on behalf of the Bacteriophage Division of the American Society for
Microbiology. The meeting will deal with fundamental problems in the molecular
biology of bacteriophage and their hosts. Progress in understanding these
processes at the molecular level has contributed greatly to advances in research
and biotechnology, and support of basic research in this area is therefore well
justified.
