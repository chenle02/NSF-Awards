The measurement and assessment of technological innovation has attracted the
interest of many actors. As reflected in national science and technology
statistical publications, the demand for reliable innovation indicators has
steadily increased over recent decades, both for macro and micro-economic
analysis, and for policy use. The goal of the proposed research is to leverage
advances in data/text analysis and visualization techniques to support knowledge
discovery and to identify knowledge transfer based on (NSF) project funding and
(USPTO) patent databases. As indicators of inventive output are mostly based on
patents, efficient and innovative methodologies and frameworks for the analysis
of the information related to technological innovation stored in patent
databases are needed. Information about trends in NSF funding can be derived
from the analysis of the NSF award abstracts and other relevant data. The
research challenges are: uncertainty about the validity of using the award and
patent data to approximate science and technology development, difficulty in
intuitive presentation of analysis result, and precise identification of
emerging topics and concepts in the NSF award and patent databases. This
exploratory project aims to examine both technical issues and the fundamental
hypotheses involved. Major information and computer science techniques adopted
include: text-based linguistic analysis, 2D/3D knowledge map visualization,
citation network analysis, and graphical display and analysis of temporal
patterns. The current testbed is related to analysis of nano science and
technology research in USA and other research described at
