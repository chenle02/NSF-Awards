ABSTRACT

The investigators study Fourier bases of Hilbert spaces associated with affine
iterated function systems (IFSs) on the real line and in higher dimensions.
While much work in the last two decades has focused on the case in which the
attractor of the IFS is a fractal with non-integral Hausdorff dimension, the
investigators study IFSs with overlap. In the one-dimensional setting, the
measures associated with these attractors are Erdos's self-similar convolution
measures; in general the measures are invariant Hutchinson measures. Almost
nothing is known about orthonormal bases associated with Hutchinson measures in
the case of non-finite overlap, and in fact previous work of the investigators
and P. Jorgensen has shown that the measures in the overlap cases have different
properties from the non-overlap measures. The proposed work on IFSs is an
exciting branch of harmonic analysis which connects to fractals, wavelets, and
random walks; it also has applications to number theory, dynamics, and
combinatorial geometry. The investigators draw on methods from all these fields
in their work. The work in this proposal will involve further collaborations
with P. Jorgensen at the University of Iowa.

Iterated function systems (IFSs) embody the common themes of recursion and self-
similarity. The investigators will study properties of IFSs and their associated
geometry. In fact, a central theme in this work is the interplay between
geometry and spectral analysis on fractals. There is a natural tension between
studying fractals from a geometric point of view and from a spectral point of
view; traditional time-frequency methods used in spectral analysis are linear,
and the systems the investigators study are non-linear. The need to understand
non-linear phenomena is motivated by a host of real-life applications. IFSs
occur repeatedly in signal processing and communications. For example, wavelets,
the key behind the JPEG 2000 compression standard, are a particular example of
an IFS. Applications of iterated function systems extend far beyond
communications---IFSs are used in data compression, quantum computing, pattern
recognition, DNA computations, and a vast array of other fields. Furthermore,
due to its wide applicability, work in this proposal will draw undergraduate
students into mathematical research. The investigators will conduct research
with undergraduates at Grinnell College, and published work by P. Jorgensen and
the investigators has already been incorporated into research projects for
undergraduates at the University of Iowa, as part of the Alliances for Graduate
Education and the Professoriate (AGEP Alliance) and the Heartland Mathematics
Partnership.
