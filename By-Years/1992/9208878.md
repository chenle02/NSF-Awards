Only 60 of the 3,000 species of the extant lizards attain an adult body mass
greater than 1 kg. Yet, these large lizards represent over 60% of the lizard
species considered threatened or endangered. We have previously examined
incubation requirements, otogeny of behavior, and adult reproductive biology of
several large lizard species in diverse genera (Varanus, Iguana, Ctenosaura).
Although only distantly related, their large size and requirement for vast
tracts of undisturbed habitat link these species with respect to
management/conservation strategies. We now propose to study Cyclura nubila, a
species we consider to be a model that will provide substantial baseline data
for comparative purposes within the genus. The study population of C. nubila can
be manipulated in ways that will yield data required for future management
decisions. The management techniques employed should be applicable to other
genera of large lizards.
