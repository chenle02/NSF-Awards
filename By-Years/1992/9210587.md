This research effort is directed at developing improved global illumination
algorithms for image synthesis. Monte Carlo techniques avoid artifacts due to
the discretization of the environment required for radiosity methods and are
favored when the geometry of the rendered objects are freeform surfaces rather
than polygonal objects. The major problems with the Monte Carlo methods are the
noisy characteristic of the solution and the high sample rate required to bring
the noise down to an acceptable level. Importance sampling and stratified
sampling are two methods that can significantly reduce the noise level and
sample rate required for a high quality solution. Radiosity methods can be used
to provide guidance for importance sampling. Model preprocessing can be used to
locate known discontinuity curves on the model surfaces and to partition the
surfaces into pieces that are expected to have smooth illumination for
stratification. Trimmed spline representations can be used to represent the
illumination functions over each surface.
