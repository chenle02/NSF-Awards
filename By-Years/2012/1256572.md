Reproduction is an energetically expensive process and therefore can lead to
impairments in health and survival. In mammals the costs and tradeoffs,
including reduced growth, impaired immune function, and lower life expectancy,
have been mainly studies and associated with females and maternal care. In some
mammals, including humans, males/fathers also provide extensive care for their
offspring; however, the consequences for fathers of providing paternal care has
not been well studied. Therefore, this research will investigate the effects of
fatherhood on blood hormone levels, body composition (fat and lean mass), energy
utilization, exercise performance, and immune function in the California mouse,
a monogamous rodent in which both parents engage in extensive parental behavior.
Behavioral, morphological, and physiological measures will be compared between
males housed with a breeding female and males housed with a female that has been
surgically neutered. Because the consequences of fatherhood might be exacerbated
by stress, half of the animals will be housed under standard laboratory
conditions and the other half under cold conditions. The results will identify
the effects of parenthood on behavior, morphology and physiology in fathers, and
will further indicate whether such effects differ with the animals' age,
reproductive experience, or stress. These results will provide novel insights
into the biology of paternal care and may have important implications for
understanding parenting in humans. In addition, this research will contribute to
the training of numerous graduate and undergraduate students, a substantial
number of whom will be underrepresented minorities and/or socioeconomically
disadvantaged.
