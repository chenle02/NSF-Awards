The next generation of cellular technology (NextG) is about to revolutionize
communication as we know it. These new technologies will offer cellular
communication faster, more reliable, with lower latency, more energy- and
spectral- efficient, higher mobility, and denser connectivity than 5G. It will
enable applications such as real-time remote healthcare, intelligent industrial
automation, high-performance precision agriculture, autonomous vehicles, smart
infrastructures, holographic communication, and space communication, and
continue to impact each of the sixteen critical infrastructures. The goal of the
proposed work is to create a roadmap that prioritizes research pertaining to
NextG technologies. It emphasizes issues of correctness, security, and privacy
as relating to NextG technologies, viewing correctness as a precondition for
security, and security as a precondition for privacy. The project will identify
what research is needed to ensure that these networks are trustworthy and offer
a high degree of security and privacy for users. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most of
the ongoing research studying NextG technologies is done by the networking
community and has been primarily focused on performance. Solving the trust,
security, and privacy research challenges posed by the NextG ecosystem requires
expertise from several research communities such as networking, security,
privacy, machine learning, programming languages, software engineering, and a
strategic approach to engage them in working towards a common vision. The
project will analyze the existing literature and studies on the topic, keeping
in mind the Governmentâ€™s priorities on NextG research, and engage in discussions
with relevant academic, government, and industry experts. If need be, some
relevant workshops will be held. The envisioned roadmap will be the conclusions
obtained from these studies and discussions and will craft the research agenda
for NSF programs, as well as other government research programs and researchers,
that will seamlessly incorporate NextG into everyday
life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
