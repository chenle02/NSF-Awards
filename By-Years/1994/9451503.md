The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a gas chromatography/mass spectrometry
system as an integral part of restructuring the laboratory program. This
equipment is affecting laboratory courses from the introductory chemistry
sequence through the senior level and is enhancing an expending undergraduate
research program. Students are individually gaining experience with complex
micro- analysis problems analogous to those encountered in industrial and
research laboratory environments.
