The investigators will study new computational techniques with applications to
inverse problems and image analysis. They will seek new methods that combine
variational arguments with ideas from computational harmonic analysis and
partial differential equations in order to overcome limitations of existing
methods. The research will have three objectives: propose new models for cartoon
and texture separation in images by working with spaces of distributions;
propose completely new techniques for multiscale hierarchical decomposition of
images; propose efficient algorithms for solving inverse problems.

From the proposed research and educational program, computational mathematics,
image processing, as well as more general areas of science and engineering will
benefit. Applications include image analysis, medical imaging, satellite
imaging, material science, and terrain data analysis, surveillance and inverse
problems.
