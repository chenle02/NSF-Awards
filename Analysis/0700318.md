Under this award the PI will study differential operators on manifolds with
singular metric structures. One project is to study the wave equation on
singular spaces. Melrose, Vasy, and the PI will investigate the diffraction of
solutions of the wave equation by complex singular geometries, perhaps
eventually a large class of stratified spaces. This builds on previous work with
Melrose, which showed that a singularity of a solution of the wave equation
interacts with a cone point to produce a "diffracted" spherical wavefront
emanating from the cone point. The singularity of the diffracted front may be
weaker than that of the incident front if the latter is not too precisely
focused on the cone point. Another direction of research involves the
Schroedinger equation on manifolds, where the infinite speed of propagation has
some intriguing consequences. The PI will investigate aspects of the dispersive
smoothing effect for Schroedinger evolution in trapping geometries, focusing
initially on the propagation of regularity associated to Lagrangian
submanifolds.

A central question in the mathematical theory of quantum mechanics is: what is
the relationship between the classical dynamics of a particle and its
corresponding quantum states? Insights into this problem have come not only from
the direct study of the quantum mechanical energy operator or "Hamiltonian"
itself, but also from other fundamental equations involving it, such as the heat
equation, the wave equation, and, naturally, the time-dependent Schroedinger
equation. The focus of this research consequently includes the geometric
analysis of several kinds of partial differential equations. One project
investigates what happens to waves when they interact with (a certain
generalization of) sharp corners---the geometry of how wavefronts move can be
quite subtle in these cases owing to the effects of diffraction. Possible
physical applications include "inverse problems" in which one attempts to deduce
the structure of an object (e.g. the interior of the earth) from observation of
waves that have passed through it. Another project is to study the behavior of
solutions of the Schroedinger equation on curved spaces; such solutions describe
the time-evolution of a quantum particle. Progress in this subject may also have
consequences for the nonlinear Schroedinger equation, which arises in nonlinear
optics and the theory of Bose-Einstein condensates, among other physical
applications.
