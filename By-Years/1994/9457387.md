This research is applying the principal investigator's previous work in the area
of nonlinear circuit theory to make major enhancements to the way designers
simulate analog circuits. In particular, improvements to the continuation
methods of solving dc operating points of circuits are being made guaranteeing
that all of a circuit's operating points will be found during a single analysis.
Moreover, continuation methods are being applied to sensitivity analysis of
circuits; for example, by making observations of a continuation curve, a
designer could determine whether a circuit is prone to a latch up condition.
Erroneous models are thought to be a major source of convergence problems and
erroneous results in circuit simulation. Another enhancement to circuit
simulation includes checking the accuracy of transistor models by verifying that
all models satisfy passivity and the no- gain condition.
