The investigators, along wit their students and collaborators, will develop
novel mathematical formulations and computational techniques for applications in
data science, remote sensing, atmospheric sciences, and medical imaging. This
multidisciplinary research includes advancement of discovery and understanding
of many natural phenomena and the development of new imaging sciences methods
for the medical field. Super-resolution of hurricane imagery will be of value to
science, where many aspects of hurricane formation and strength prediction are
still unknown, and to society, which could benefit from more accurate
information being used in forecasts of storm strength and development. Improving
the quality of images distorted by atmospheric turbulence will have applications
in defense, while improving image registration algorithms will tremendously help
research, diagnosis, and treatment decisions in the medical field. This project
will provide support for one graduate student per year.

The project's activities will provide links between efficient mathematical
formulations, imaging approaches and applications in remote sensing, atmospheric
sciences, and medical imaging, where similar approaches have not yet been
attempted. Novel variational approaches, iterative and numerical analysis
techniques will be developed for solving these and related inverse problems. In
particular, this investigation will study novel robust variational approaches
and their numerical approximations, including: a new combined deconvolution and
geometric correction variational model for restoration of atmospherically-
distorted images; local and nonlocal total variation regularized super-
resolution method and an efficient computational algorithm for space-time
deconvolution of low-resolution sequences; novel applications of multiscale
hierarchical decompositions to blind deconvolution and image registration. The
investigators will promote multidisciplinary teaching, training and learning.
Mathematics students will be exposed to a broad range of topics and techniques:
(i) in applied and computational mathematics, image processing and analysis, and
(ii) topics outside mathematics, including remote sensing, atmospheric sciences,
and medical imaging.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
