Profs. Eric Oldfield and Andrzej Wieckowski will develop in-situ high-field
nuclear magnetic resonance-electrochemistry (NMRE) techniques to investigate
interfacial structure and dynamics in electrocatalysts, with the purpose of
clarifying the role of modification of electrode material in the poisoning of Pt
electrocatalysts for methanol fuel cells. Both metal surface and adsorbate
structures in an electrochemical cell under potentiostatic control will be
characterized. Knight shifts, spin-lattice and spin-spin relaxation times
determination, aided with density-functional calculations, will be correlated
with shifts of the Fermi-level LDOS of metal and adsorbates. In particular, the
research will involve 195Pt NMR of fuel cell catalysts to obtain LDOS
(bimetallic particles will be composed of Pt with Ru, Sn, Rh, or Cu); and 13C
and 17O NMR of adsorbed CO to obtain diffusion kinetics. Determination will be
made of catalyst-support and catalyst-adsorbate interactions; and of the effects
of electrode potential and electrolyte environment on surface structure and
dynamics. The wider relevance of the research is in the design of CO-poisoning
resistant, high current-density electrodes for methanol oxidation, which have
potential use in mobile power sources.
