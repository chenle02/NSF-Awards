Dr. Faber is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship
to carry out a program of research and education at the University of Illinois
at Urbana- Champaign. Dr. Faber's research in relativistic hydrodynamics will
draw together gravitational wave astrophysics with the main body of
observational astrophysics. By studying coalescing black hole-neutron star
binaries and the collapse of massive stellar cores, Dr. Faber plans to link
observations of gamma-ray bursts and supernovae with gravitational wave
detections. Through this work, he hopes to set tight constraints on the nuclear
equation of state and to better understand the collapsar supernova mechanism.

In addition, Dr. Faber's work will be used as the foundation for an educational
program serving both the general public and research astrophysicists. He will
develop planetarium shows and hands-on audiovisual exhibits with the aim of
introducing large numbers of interested people to gravitational wave physics and
to the central philosophical ideas which underpin modern science. In addition,
he will develop online resources, including animations, notes, and other course
materials, intended as an introduction for undergraduate students on the topics
of relativistic phenomena and gravitational radiation.
