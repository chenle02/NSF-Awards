Various numerical techniques have been proposed for the solution of elliptic
boundary value problems, the most recent of these being finite difference
methods and finite element methods. In recent years, boundary integral equation
methods have gained in popularity, and, while of less general applicability than
the more established methods, they have proved to be exceedingly effective for
the solution of various types of problems arising in such areas as
electrostatics, heat and fluid flow, elasticity, and fracture mechanics. This
conference will center on a series of ten lectures by Wolfgang Wendland, an
international authority on the analysis of the boundary element method.
