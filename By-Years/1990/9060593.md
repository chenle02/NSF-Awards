Magnetic stimulation of nerves is attractive because the stimulus can be
delivered noninvasively. Current magnetic stimulation systems are limited by the
lack of precise localization of the stimulus. The goal of this proposal is to
design new coil configurations, including different shapes, orientations and
multiple coils, to more precisely control the site of stimulation. If
successful, the improved stimulation system would find numerous neurological
applications.
