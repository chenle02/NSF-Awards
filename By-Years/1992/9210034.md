This project is to organize and convene a U.S./P.R.C. Workshop on Experimental
Methods in Earthquake Engineering to be held at Tongji University in Shanghai,
China, in May 1992. The project will provide support for the organization of the
workshop, printing of workshop proceedings, and for travel expenses of nine U.S.
participants. Local expenses in China will be covered by the P.R.C. sponsors
(Tongji Univeristy and China Academy of Building Sciences). The purpose of the
workshop is to bring together leading experts from the two countries to (a)
assess the state-of-the-knowledge in experimental methods, (b) discuss
innovative methods that improve the realism, reliability and usefulness of
experimental research on structures, and (c) identify future developments needed
to improve experimental methods in earthquake engineering. The workshop will
consist of plenary presentation sessions and working group sessions in which
smaller groups will focus on specific topics of experimental research. This is a
project supported under the U.S./P.R.C. S&amp;T Protocol on Earthquake Studies,
Annex III.
