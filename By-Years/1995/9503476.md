Tools for Argumentative Discourse Good reasoning and argument is necessary for
writing, thinking, and arguments. In the hypertext and visual language domains,
presentation tools are developed for arguments and design rationales. This
project focuses on research on tools for the presentation of arguments and for
the support of argumentative communications among humans. In the thirty years
after Toulmin, there have been advances in the philosophical and logical
communities on the understanding of non-demonstrative and defeasible arguments.
With applications to the legal domain, the computer study of these argumentative
communications becomes useful.
