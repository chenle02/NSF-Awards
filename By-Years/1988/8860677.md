This work will evaluate the use of x-ray computerized tomography as a viable
technique to quantitatively measure fiber concentration, alignment and
distribution. Three dimensional profiling of fibers will be developed. Secondly,
indications of quantitatively measuring impact damage has been attained. This
project will, in conjunction with ongoing efforts in destructive mapping of
impact damage, develop procedures and algorithms to map impact damage and
quantitatively profile that damage.
