9355625 Cassady The Children's Museum of Indianapolis is developing a new
permanent 12,000 square-foot gallery, "The Wet, Wild, Wonderful World of
Science: A Science Gallery That Connects Kids to Their World." Water is the
catalyst for the exploration and discovery of science concepts throughout the
gallery. Within the gallery are three hub context areas (Pipes and Pumps,
Streams and Ponds,Tubes and Flasks) that are closely linked, both conceptually
and physically. The message is that the concepts introduced in one hub also
apply to the others, thus erasing artificial distinctions between natural and
physical sciences. The goals of the project are: To create a gallery that will
make science accessible to the museum's current and underserved visitors. To
create hands-on opportunities for young people to practice scientific thinking
so they may better understand the physical and natural world. To create a
science education experience that promotes linkages for visitors between the
learning of science in the gallery and formal and informal learning outside of
the museum. To research the application of constructivist theory in the design
of hands-on exhibits. ***
