As social scientists the laboratory is the world and the best approximation and
understanding of the ways in which nations operate is through representative
experiments such as simulations. Simulation as a technique for teaching and
learning is an integral part of the Political Science curriculum. However, the
simulations were based on human interaction and simple forms of communication.
The project is enabling the college through the addition of computers, printers,
modems, and support equipment to become a full participant in the International
Negotiation Project, which is a simulation of foreign policy decision making
that relies on computer technology for communication between member
institutions. The simulation is unique and of special interest because
institutions around the world routinely participate and communicate in their
native tongue. This helps stress problems of decision making while also
addressing issues of cross- cultural communication and problems of translation.
