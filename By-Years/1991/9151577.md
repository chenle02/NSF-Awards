The Chemistry department is purchasing an automated polarimeter for use in
several upper division courses. Students are using the instrument to study the
kinetics of disaccharide hydrolysis and of the racemization of optically active
transition metal complexes. Stereoselectivity of various synthetic reageants are
being investigated in the advanced organic chemistry laboratory. It is also
being used by undergraduate students conducting independent research.
