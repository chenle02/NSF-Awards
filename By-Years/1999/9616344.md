. 9616344 Chow, Louis C. ABSTRACT This proposal deals with spray cooling for
high heat flux applications. The principal investigators propose to
experimentally determine the relative importance of forced convection, nucleate
boiling from surface cavities, and secondary nucleate boiling due to air/vapor
nuclei entrapped by the impinging droplets. A high-speed camera will be used in
conjunction with a semi-transparent synthetic-diamond film to visualize the
boiling process. Relevant parameters such as the bubble density, growth rate,
etc. will be determined for calculating the contribution of nucleate boiling in
spray cooling. The contribution of secondary nucleate boiling will be
established by comparing the nucleation characteristics with that conducted with
a submerged jet where secondary nucleation is absent.
