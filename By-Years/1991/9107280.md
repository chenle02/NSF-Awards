An international symposium, entitled "The Future of the Research Enterprise
within the Industrialized Nations," sponsored by the Government-University-
Industry Research Roundtable, is being held February 26, 1991 at the U.S.
National Academy of Sciences Building in Washington, D.C. The purposes of the
symposium are (a) to assess current challenges to the research systems of the
major industrialized nations, (b) to compare national strategies for meeting
these challenges, and (c) to explore options for the research systems of the
21st century. Symposium speakers are senior government science policy officials
and leading scientists from the United States, Japan, Germany, France, the
United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union. The symposium is a component of the
comprehensive Roundtable program of activities focused on the current status of
and future options for the academic research enterprise. The proceedings of this
symposium are being published by the Research Roundtable in June, 1991.
