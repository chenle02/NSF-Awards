The Climate Research Institute seeks to inform public policy officials and
opinion leaders of the gravity of the climate change challenge. Scientists have
predicted a global warming of as much as 9 degrees F. by the middle of the 21st
Century. Increased vulnerability of coastal areas to storm damage, and
significant changes in agriculture production, forestry, and fisheries have been
predicted. The conference on "The Arctic and Global Change" to be held October
25- 27, 1989 in Ottawa, Canada, will bring together top scientists studying
climate change and its likely impacts; and U.S. and Canadian government policy
makers, environmental leaders, and corporate decision makers. NSF is one of
several government and non-government sponsors of this conference. Because
significant climate change may be observed first in the Polar regions, this
proposal is important to the Division of Polar Programs. Research on climate
change in the Polar regions is also a major concern to the U.S. Arctic Research
Plan.
