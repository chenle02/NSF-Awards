This is a five year project in which thirty secondary science teachers from
Howard County, Baltimore County and Baltimore City will participate in a
research program at two campuses of the University of Maryland, UMAB and UMBC.
The summer components will consist of a seven week, full time research practicum
in the biological/biomedical sciences and a seven session research colloquium.
The colloquium has three distinct foci: principles of research methodology,
recent advances in specific research area and translation of research
methodology into the classroom. The classroom application will be the focus of
monthly colloquia during the school year. Scientists from the University of
Marlyand will act as mentors for the research and science educators from each
LEA will direct the pedagogical aspects of the program. Six teachers will be
phased in each year of the project with each teacher participating for three
years. School districts are cost- sharing a good portion of the total cost to
insure that this strategy for teaching science and the introduction of research
methodology into the classroom is implemented. The project will lead to an
increased understanding of content and appreciation of biological knowledge,
preparation for curriculum redesign and improvement, establishment of a cadre of
"master teacher" with research experience, and increased interactions among
participating teachers and faculty of the University of Maryland.
