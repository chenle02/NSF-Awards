The IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM) is a
preeminent venue for world-leading scientists, researchers, and practitioners to
present the latest research results and to exchange research ideas over a broad
range of topics in computer communications and networking. Attending this
conference is of paramount importance for the career development of students in
the field. It provides students with opportunities to present their work, to
learn the cutting-edge research, and to interact with leading experts and fellow
students from worldwide institutions. This award will support approximately 25
students in the United States to attend the 2016 IEEE INFOCOM conference which
will be held in San Francisco, CA, USA from April 10 to April 15, 2016. The
travel grants will target graduate students, in particular female and
underrepresented minority students. Priority will be given to the students who
will substantially benefit from attending this conference but have limited
travel funds.
