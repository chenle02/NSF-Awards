bandgap semiconductor which is of interest for use in blue light emitting diodes
and lasers, which are important for applications in compact disk readonly
memones (CD ROM's), high definition video displays, and secured underwater
commumcations. In recent months, pulsed operation of zinc selenide based
semiconductor blue lasers has been demonstrated at temperatures up to 250 K.
Higher performance, namely continuous laser operation at room temperature, is
desirable but has not been achieved due to the difficulties in obtaining stable,
low resistivity p type ZnSe and low resistance ohmic contacts to n and p type
ZnSe. Due to these difficulties, the blue lasers which have been fabricated by
molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) to date have large forward voltage drops (15 30V)
and also excessive power dissipation. We plan to develop ZnSe blue lasers using
organometallic vapor phase epitaxy (OMVPE), with an emphasis on the development
of low resistivity p type ZnSe and lowresistance ohmic contacts. P doped ZnSe
will be produced by nitrogen doping from the novel alkyl sources,
trimethylamine, triethylamine, and triisopropanolamine. Low resistance ohmic
contacts will be fabricated using a unique approach based on gradedbandgap
alloys of HgZnSe. ZnSe based laser structures will be fabricated using ZnSe/Znl_
xCdxSe/ZnSe single quantum wells and the techniques described above. ***
