The proposal requests funds to support students at the 3rd International
Workshop on Software Analytics (SWAN 2017), to take place in September 2017 in
Paderborn, Germany. The funds are to encourage US-based students to attend, with
priority given to underrepresented groups, US citizens/residents, and those
otherwise unable to attend without financial support. The area of software
analytics as the basis for empirical research in software engineering leads to a
scientific understanding of phenomena surrounding software and its development.
The area is emerging and will be boosted by increasing participation in this
start-up workshop series. The workshop is a forum for presentation of work in
this field, and as such, it will help expand research and strengthen US
participation in the field.
