This is a transfer of funds to the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Wallops
Flight Facility (NASA WFF) for commissioning services in support of the first
NSF-sponsored satellite mission to be launched by the Department of Defense
(DOD) in December 2009. The NSF sponsored nano-satellite will be a "triple (3U)
cubesat" and will utilize the Poly-Picosat Orbital Deployer (P-POD) system. The
purpose of the NSF nano-satellite mission will be space weather research. The
selection of the mission will be done following a solicitation for proposals and
scientific and technical review of the proposals. This will be the first project
under a new NSF initiative titled: "CubeSat-based Science Missions for Space
Weather and Atmospheric Research." NASA WFF will provide technical assistance to
NSF for the preparation, integration, and test of the cubesat and the integrated
P-POD carrier/ejector system. WFF will also work with the launch sponsor, and
launch provider to provide necessary assurances that the Cubesat spacecraft will
not adversely interfere with the primary spacecraft, either technically or via
schedule delays.
