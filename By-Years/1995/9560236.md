This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I research project will analyze
and design a wideband wireless network for the transmission of transaction
traffic, file traffic and digital voice traffic. Multiple access protocols are
used to permit independent transmitters to share a single communication channel.
When the number of transmitters is large or when the duty cycle of individual
transmitters is small a random access multiple access protocol is usually
required. Spread ALOHA is a new random access protocol which can operate at a
data rate 50 or more times that of conventional protocols. Spread ALOHA uses a
single spreading code to transmit signals from an unlimited number of remote
transmitters. In this research project it is planned to analyze and design an
improved form of Spread ALOHA which uses two codes rather than one for all
transmitters. By means of the second code it is possible to greatly increase the
throughput in wideband wireless networks with significant amounts of file and
voice traffic. This research can be used to build less expensive, more efficient
personal communication services (PCS) networks integrating transaction traffic,
file traffic and digital voice traffic.
