Often a decision maker's first exposure to an innovative technology is a story
-- from either a critic or a proponent -- of how the technology will develop. A
critic's narrative focuses on what might go wrong if it fails; a proponent's
envisions the benefits it will bring. While stories may be a weak form of
evidence, they can be useful in the decision-making process, and some of their
most disciplined use is found in scenario planning. But the schism between
decision analysts and scenarists is a long-standing and historic one, and today
there is no credible methodology that can incorporate the subjective,
qualitative input provided by the narrative structures of scenarios into a
traditional analytic framework -- even though there is a clear need for decision
makers to be able to anticipate potential consequences, both scientific and
social, in the types of highly fluid and ambiguous circumstances that nascent
sciences such as genomics present.

The goal of this project is to integrate scenarios and analytical approaches in
order to more effectively assess the risks and benefits of genetic interventions
and genomic technologies. We begin by screening for problems whose uncertainties
seem to require scenario-like thinking -- where there is no historical record
that can confidently be projected forward, and no formal analysis that has
resolved concerns satisfactorily. (One project member defines these as "things
we don't know we don't know, or about which we don't understand what we don't
understand.") In these domains, we seek scenarios that have been advanced by
some respected agency, organization, process or individual as a plausible
representation of a technology's risks and benefits. We then will create a
formal analytic model of each domain, based on scenario content and analysis by
our domain experts. If successful, the products of this study will be the
rudiments of a computable model for problems that previously were impenetrable
by such traditional analytic means, as well as a framework for integrating
analytic and scenario-based thinking about the risks and benefits produced by
complex systems. We believe this new methodology, which will be capable of
reflecting the needs and resources of diverse stakeholders, will also be
applicable to other complex problems that involve uncertainties as fundamental
as those in genomics, such as those posed by nanotechnology.
