This planning proposal is designed to provide the necessary data and
administrative processes for the preparation of a state-wide science and
technology proposal on the order of $600,000 per year for up to 2 to 5 years,
which will enable the State to become more effective competing for Federal and
industrial funds and in attracting appropriate industry. The plan includes the
evaluation of research barriers, State commitment to the program, a plan for
focusing State and Federal resources on the appropriate area(s), and the
establishment of a State-wide leadership committee.
