0122577 Sengupta The objective of this research is to develop a physico-chemical
process that has the potential of meeting the twin objectives of nitrogen and
phosphorus removal from wastewater and generation of a high-quality fertilizer.
In this process, a potential gradient is applied perpendicular to the flow of a
continuous reactor and three different ion-exchangers are placed at appropriate
electrodes. These different ion-exchangers are selective for ammonium, nitrate,
and phosphate ions. The specific objectives of this research include: (1)
correlation of the potential gradient, electrode distance, and the pH profile
for efficient operation, (2) a study of the effects of background constituents
(competing ions) and electrode material on process efficiency, (3) a study of
ion-exchanger fouling and regeneration, and (4) quantification of process
performance by mathematical modeling of the system with process parameters and
solution chemistry as input variables. ***
