The Center for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Education (CEMSE) at
California State University Fullerton is establishing the partnership for a
future Noyce Teaching Fellowship project; conducting a needs assessment to
determine specific areas of teacher shortages and interest among STEM
professionals in the Fullerton/Orange County area; identifying sources for
matching funds; and designing programs that would be offered to CEMSE Teaching
Fellows. The project is addressing alignment of the credential and graduate
teacher education programs and alignment of four master's degree programs with
the National Board Certification process. In addition, the project team is
determining how programs might be revised to meet needs of science and math
teachers and to address science and mathematics concepts that are least well-
understood, and determining appropriate inclusion of information, communication,
and educational technologies in the teacher education programs.
