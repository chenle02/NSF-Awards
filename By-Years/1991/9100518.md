This award is made in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry
Program to Clemson University to support the research of Dr. Gregory Robinson.
Dr. Robinson's research deals with the design, synthesis, structure and
reactivity of organoaluminum:amine complexes and provides needed structural data
on coordination of main group elements. The interactions of organoaluminum
moieties with macrocyclic amines, multidentate open-chain amines and nitrogen
heterocycles will be investigated. Preliminary results indicate that these
systems contain aluminum centers in unusual trigonal bipyramidal, square
pyramidal and octahedral coordination environments. The coordination of the
aluminum atom(s) will be determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction and
aluminum-27 NMR. The thermal behavior of these unusual compounds and their
feasibility to function as single-source molecular precursors for ceramic
materials will be investigated. %%% Organoaluminum chemistry is an important but
rather neglected area of organometallic chemistry. In addition to filling in
serious gaps in our knowledge of aluminum chemistry, the project will result in
the synthesis of new organoaluminum compounds which will be of potential value
as precursors for the preparation of ceramic materials such as aluminum nitride.
