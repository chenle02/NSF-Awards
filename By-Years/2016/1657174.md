This project will advance efforts of the Innovative Technology Experiences for
Students and Teachers (ITEST) program to better understand and promote practices
that increase students' motivations and capacities to pursue careers in fields
of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) by engaging in hands-
on field experience, laboratory/project-based entrepreneurship tasks and
mentorship experiences. This Hinds Community College project will involve junior
and senior high school girls from four high schools from three Mississippi rural
counties--Copiah, Claiborne, and Hinds--to participate in a summer
apprenticeship program and other activities to increase their awareness about
STEM and academic preparedness for a pathway to STEM related careers. The
program will last three years and will engage up to 120 rising high school
junior and senior female students intensively and introduce up to 300 female
students to STEM education and careers. During the three year grant period, the
project will implement the following activities: a four-week summer
apprenticeship with a near-peer mentoring program; host an annual STEM Girls
Rock Convocation; offer Spring Break STEM Tours for apprentices, their
parents/caregivers and mentors, and Hinds Community College STEM instructors;
offer after-school and Saturday science fair project assistance; and collaborate
with the Shodor Foundation, a nonprofit research and education organization and
a national resource for computational science education, to offer workshops for
high school teachers, counselors and administrators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
primary focus of the proposed project is to grow the pipeline of female students
who are aware of STEM and computer science educational pathways and career
opportunities. The goals of the project are to: 1) Provide evidence of engaging
minority females in hands-on experiences in STEM-related technologies and
practices; 2) Document evidence of advancing knowledge on how best to prepare
minority females for STEM-related occupations; and 3) Build and expand the
research foundation on STEM learning and learning environments, workforce
development, and broadening participation in STEM. The project includes an
infrastructure mechanism for teachers and administrators within the high school
to support students by providing them opportunities to build their academic
skills while participating in the project. A concurrent mixed methods research
design will be used that combines quantitative and qualitative approaches to
assess the latent variables.
