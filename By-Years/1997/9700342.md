9700342 Frenkel A two-wavelength transmitter concept will be implemented in a
current pulse frequency division multiplexing fiber-optic communication system
currently in place at New Mexico Highlands University. This implementation will
increase the capacity of the system, and promises an increase in capacity of
local fiber-optic communications networks to that of 100's of GBIT/s. ***
