The new instructional equipment procured through this project is raising the
quality of nearly every course taught in the Biology and Chemistry Departments.
This wide-spread impact results from the way it is enhancing the laboratory
experience so that the experimental skills and techniques developed by these
students are better matched to the high level of theoretical training they
traditionally have received here. The degree of change varies among the courses,
with the greatest initial improvements being seen in the upper-level courses and
in the Junior- Senior Research Seminar experience. The new equipment has been
selected for maximal student utilization, as well as for its relevance to modern
technology. Student interest in the sciences is finding strong reinforcment
through their greatly increased opportunities to actually engage in scientific
laboratory work, rather than merely hearing about it in the lecture hall.
