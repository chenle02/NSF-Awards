9319412 Canny The research addresses continuing exploration of sensing and
manipulation strategies for simple robot hardware, in the RISC (Reduced
Intricacy in Sensing and Control) paradigm. RISC robotics, advocated by the
author and Prof. Ken Goldberg of USC, is an attempt to fuse automation and
robotic technologies. It uses traditional automation hardware such as parallel-
jaw grippers and optical beam sensors, together with geometric planning and
sensing algorithms, to accomplish more cost-effective and reliable operations
that are also easy to set up and reconfigure, and flexible enough to support
small batch sizes and rapid changes in part design needed in future
flexible/agile manufacturing systems. The research will address model-building
algorithms for optical beam and other sensors, accurate model acquisition, high-
rate recognition, grasping and fixturing with minimal numbers of elements, and
automatic design of RISC workcell elements. The effectiveness of the RISC
approach will be tested with some challenging case studies, starting with an
assembly program for a model-aircraft engine.
