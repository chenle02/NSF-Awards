The PI proposes to investigate the effects of three types of coffee cultivation
on the native insect fauna associated with the area. Preliminary planning
activities include: literature review, site location, necessary permissions and
collaborating institutions, experimentation with methodologies, preliminary data
gathering, data analysis and interpretation, experiment redesign and writing of
final proposal. Activities during the first year will involve the comparison of
3 management systems: 1) Traditional agroforestry system with a variety of shade
trees interplanted with coffee; 2) the agroforestry system with just one shade
tree species intensively managed through periodic pruning; and 3) monocultural
coffee with no shade tree. Representative farms will be selected. Base-line data
related to ant assemblages, insect pest and disease densities and distributions
will be gathered using standard sampling methods. Photon flux density and CO2
uptake will be calculated directly using the Solarcal computer program.
Satellite photographs will be used to determine the area of the country planted
in the monocultural system. The effect of nitrogen fertilization and the effect
of pesticide insecticide applications on the ant assemblage and on pests will be
studied in subsequent years.
