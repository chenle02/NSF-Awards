The investigator develops a methodology for the explanation of variability in
data attributable to known and unknown external factors. This has applications
in all data-intensive fields, including public health, economics, and
environmental studies. It provides a natural tool for personalized medicine, as
it can both filter from data the influence of each patient's characteristics,
such as age and sex, and particularize the predictions to account for the
specifics of each patient. It also permits the analysis of meteorological data
taken at different locations and times and with different instruments, and of
unstructured time series depending on known and unknown external factors.
Graduate and postdoctoral students participate in the work of the project.

The problems of amalgamating datasets and removing external factors of
variability find a very natural formulation in an extension of the mathematical
theory of optimal transport: both problems concern normalizing (i.e.
transporting) the original data so that no signal is left that points to the
dataset of provenance or the values of the confounding variables. On the other
hand, the transport needs to be optimized, minimizing the removal of variability
associated to other sources. This project extends the theory of optimal
transport to handle these problems. The extensions include problems such as
finding the barycenter of a continuum of probability densities of which only a
finite amount of samples are known. Graduate and postdoctoral students
participate in the work of the project.
