SES- 0956796&lt;br/&gt;Shane R. Thye&lt;br/&gt;University of South

Lawler&lt;br/&gt;Cornell University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
investigates why collaboration may not occur among group members even when the
conditions for collaboration are present such as common interests and shared
identities. The investigators contend that affective ties of people to the group
are critical, and these develop from jointly solving tasks that give people a
sense of shared responsibility. They hypothesize that in a cooperative group
setting, people with common interests and common identities develop affective
group ties only if they are involved in joint tasks that give them a sense of
shared responsibility. When this occurs, people are more willing to act in the
collective interests. The hypothesis is tested in two lab experiments that
combine interactions around a task (low or high in jointness) with (a) common
interests (experiment 1) or (b) common identities (experiment 2). In the
experiment, groups of four people engage in individual and joint tasks that
involve well-known survival scenarios, such as "lost on the moon," where
participants rank the importance of several items to their survival.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS: The project addresses an important and
pervasive problem, that is, how to create and sustain social order (cooperation,
collaboration, etc.). The issue takes on new relevance in the contemporary world
given globalization and associated economic and political changes. People
interact with more people at greater distance, all of which make group ties even
more important as a source of collaboration and cooperation. This research
develops a way to produce and sustain such ties and, thereby, promote individual
sacrifices for the group or collective benefit. It has broad implications for
how social divides can be crossed or bridged to create new group affiliations.
