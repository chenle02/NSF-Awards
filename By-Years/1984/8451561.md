The goal of this research is to develop a better way, or ways, to forecast
construction project performance. It is intended to accomplish this by three
separate, but coordinated research studies--two investigating cost forecasting
and the other schedule forecasting. One of the cost studies and the schedule
study will explore ways of applying knowledge-based expert system concepts from
computer science to these forecasting problems. Quantitative, as opposed to
heuristic, methods of forecasting cost performance will be investigated. In
future years, other aspects of construction project performance such as quality,
safety, and organizational issues will be investigated, but cost and time are
the crucial two issues for this initial investigation.
