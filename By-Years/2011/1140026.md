The award extends liquid Noble Gas (LNG) detector technology from the low rate,
low radiation background environments as has been developed for astrophysical
dark matter searches, to the high rate, high radiation environment found near
spent fuel assemblies. LNG gamma ray detection technology will alleviate many of
the count rate and radiation damage problems which crystal detectors encounter
in high radiation environments.

The development of LNG gamma ray detectors fits DNDO's strategic planning which
intends an integrated, mutually enhancing infrastructure for detection,
coordination, and response, as safe guards measures used for Special Nuclear
Materials (SNM) accounting is a block to one of the pathways to Nuclear
Terrorism. The award will provide an excellent training of graduate students in
both physics and nuclear engineering.
