Two novel non-invasive techniques will be investigated for measuring both solid
and liquid velocities in dense slurry flows. In such flows, the flows can be
impeded by the formation of plugs and clusters. Ultrasonic Velocimetry and
Electrical Impedance Tomography will be utilized to obtain simultaneous velocity
and concentration profiles. Conditions leading to aggregate formations will be
investigated and explored.
