The Grambling State University computer Literacy Center is being developed to
establish an environment to foster the acquisition of computer skills required
in our technological society. The center consists of twenty-five personal
computers without a hard disk connected over a local area network to a file
server. Having all software including the operating systems, spread sheets, word
processors, and BASIC interpreter centrally located simplifies software
maintenance and enhances system integrity. The center also contains eight
personal computers with additional memory and a hard disk for more advanced
applications. The establishment of the literacy laboratory allows the
introduction of computing concepts with hands-on experience to all undergraduate
students except those majoring in mathematics and computer science.
