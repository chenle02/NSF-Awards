This project involves a field program in the Mediterranean Sea to take
sedimentary cores that will be used for a paleoclimatic study. That study will
use the geochemical composition (Cadmium and Barium especially) of foraminifera
shells to determine the circulation of the Mediterranean during the last 20,000
years. That information will be used to examine which of two competing
hypotheses on the glacial/interglacial circulation patterns may be correct. The
results of this project may also contribute to an understanding of the
mechanisms which control the organic content of sediments.
