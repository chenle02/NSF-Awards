This a project to combine results from dynamo theory with analysis of high
quality paleomagnetic time series of secular variation derived from lake
sediments, for the purpose of interpreting magnetic field variations through the
Holocene in terms of the dynamics of the outer core. The research consists of
two parts: (1) an analysis of published paleomagnetic secular variation data
from North and South America, Australia and Eurasia using dynamically consistent
models of propagating and standing wave fields, and (2) numberical simulations
of kinematic dynamos with permanent dipolar fields and coexisting secular
variation. The object is to identify the source of the low frequency
paleomagnetic secular variation and to determine the dynamical structure of the
outer core from which it originates.
