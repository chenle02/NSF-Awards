The National Science Foundation uses the Early-concept Grants for Exploratory
Research (EAGER) funding mechanism to support exploratory work in its early
stages on untested, but potentially transformative, research ideas or
approaches. This EAGER project was awarded as a result of the invitation in the
Dear Colleague Letter NSF 16-080 to proposers from Historically Black Colleges
and Universities to submit proposals that would strengthen research capacity of
faculty at the institution. The project at Hampton University aims to study the
merits of using monofiliment carbon wires in drift chambers, and to develop a
low recoil proton detector. If this project succeeds, the resulting knowledge
can be used to develop future carbon nanotube wire chambers, which would be a
possibly transformative development in experimental nuclear and particle
physics. The project involves training of the next generation of physicists at
Hampton University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As part of the project, the
investigation into the usage of carbon mono lament wires for construction of the
cathode layer and/or an additional inner wire chamber for the BONuS12 detector
will be carried out in parallel with development work on the currently planned,
but lower risk, design. The current project is one of the first to investigate
usage of such wires in an cylindrical detector. More generally, the usage of
carbon mono laments could be a boon for experiments requiring detection and
tracking of low momentum protons and nuclei due to the potentially significant
reduction in energy lost over traditional metal wires. The technology for
producing carbon nanotube wires offering conductivity surpassing that of copper
wires has just now become available, with mass production likely available over
the next few years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This EAGER is co-funded by the
Directorates for Education &amp; Human Resources and Mathematical &amp; Physical
Sciences.
