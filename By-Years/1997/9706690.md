9706690 Kellogg Using a combination of Global Positioning System (GPS)
measurements, historical data, and viscoelastic modeling, The PI will determine
the deformation on the White Wolf Fault, southern California. This fault was
responsible for the 1952 Kern County Earthquake (magnitude 7.8). The research
plan includes: (1) reoccupation of the previously studied geodetic network to
establish the long-term deformation rates and examine the effects of the
Northridge earthquake; (2) occupation of geodetic sites near the northern end of
the fault to determine the strain associated with seismic activity in this
region; (3) analysis of available geodetic data from 1952 and 1953 to determine
the deformation associated with the Kern county earthquake, and (4) simulation
of the deformation using a numerical model of a faulted, viscoelastic medium to
determine the crustal rheology. ***
