Lockwood 9311414 This project is a three island comparative study of the impact
of market integration and capitalist incorporation on rural Tahitian women. The
islands, Tubai, Rurutu, and Raivavae differ in their degree of development and
exhibit a range from minimal to advanced market integration. Women on these
islands play different socioeconomic roles and have different kinds of control
over resources and income; subtle differences in gender ideology can also be
identified. The researcher predicts that these differences reflect the
differential impact of capitalism. By comparing women's roles and patterns of
domestic relations (autonomy, decision-making, authority) and gender
stratification (differential control of income/resources) on the three islands,
the research will identify the key factors (both structural and ideological)
linked to the course of change in rural Tahitian women' lives. This research
will contribute to our understanding of variability in the impact of capitalism
on Third World women. The research will be conducted by three anthropologist,
each responsible for the major portion of research on each island. Data
collection includes a household socioeconomic census on each island and
extensive structured interviews with male and female household heads.
Statistical analysis of the data will be conducted and specific hypotheses which
relate various gender-based structural and ideological factors will be tested.
