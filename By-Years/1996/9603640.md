PI: Heidemann IBN: 9603640 Nerve cells, or neurons, are cells for which shape is
critical for connections to distant targets. We understand very little about how
the long structures, called neurites, are formed and become distinct for
receiving information (a dendrite) or sending information (an axon). Recent
studies have suggested that physical tension produced during development may
have a role in determining the axonal or dendritic polarity as a cell elongates.
This project, a collaboration between a biologist and a physicist, utilizes a
novel technique of microscopically applying calibrated tension using fine glass
needles on brain cells in culture, to characterize the cellular response to
tension, the possible production of tension by parts of the neurite, and the
crucial issue of whether tension can determine morphological polarity of the
developing cell at a critical stage. Results from this innovative, multi-
disciplinary collaboration could provide a potential breakthrough in
understanding a key aspect of neuronal development, and be important beyond
neuroscience to developmental biology and to cell biology.
