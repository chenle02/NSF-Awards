This award will support collaborative research at the Daresbury Laboratory in
the United Kingdom between Dr. David B. Fossan, Nuclear Structure Laboratory,
Physics Department, State University of New York at Stony Brook and Professor
P.J. Twin, Department of Physics, University of Liverpool. Both the Stony Brook
and Liverpool research groups have been involved in closely related spectroscopy
research programs and have carried out complimentary work on the extraction of
nuclear structure properties. The Daresbury Laboratory has two unique
experimental facilities that have been effectively used in conjunction with
their 22 MV tandem accelerator. The large array of Compton suppressed Ge
detectors and the recoil mass spectrometer at Daresbury have led to the
discovery of superdeformed bands in 132Ce and in several Nd isotopes, and
important structure properties in very neutron deficient nuclei. This
cooperative project will focus on nuclear structure studies in the A=130 region,
with experiments taking place at the LINAC laboratory at SUNY Stony Brook and
the tandem laboratory at Daresbury.
