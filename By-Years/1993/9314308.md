9314308 Cox This project seeks to investigate the role of very short capillary
waves in transmitting momentum from the atmosphere to the ocean. The research
consists of two phases: a laboratory experiment in the SIO wave channel, and a
sea-going experiment with instruments deployed from "FLIP" in which measurements
of wind profile, capillary and larger waves will be made. The study aims to take
advantage of a successful new optical technique developed by Zhang and Cox
(1992) for measuring both components of the surface slopes simultaneously. These
measurements are combined with measurements of vorticity and velocity in the
water to map the distribution of momentum transfer at the ocean surface.
