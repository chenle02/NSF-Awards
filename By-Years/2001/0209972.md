This project involves laboratory and field studies to help elucidate the
chemical mechanisms underlying ozone production and hydroxyl radical reactivity
in the atmosphere. This research includes intercomparison and development of
instrumentation for measuring atmospheric free radicals, and studying the mixing
ratios, loss rates and kinetics in urban, rural, and remote sites of the
hydroxyl and the hydroperoxyl radicals. The project will investigate the source
of observed and evening and nighttime signals of these radicals, as well as
develop and deploy detection capabilities for atmospheric free radicals.
