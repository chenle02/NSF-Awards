PI: Sergiu Klainerman, Princeton University&lt;br/&gt;DMS-
0245368&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goal of the
proposal is to investigate the regularity properties of the Einstein field
equations of General Relativity as well as those of other important physical
systems. Most emphasis be given to the `` Bounded square integrable curvature
conjecture'' according to which the initial value problem for the Einstein-
vacuum equations is well posed with only square integrable bounds on the
curvature of its initial data set. The PI believes that this is an essential
foundational step towards a general&lt;br/&gt;regularity theory of the Einstein
equations. By concentrating on the issue of minimal regularity assumptions for
which the equations can be uniquely continued it is hoped that we can find, at
least, some of the tools needed in understanding the onset of singular
behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the fundamental tasks of mathematical
physics is to provide a full, qualitative, description of black holes and
singularities of solutions to the Einstein equations in General Relativity. The
principal investigator has established a program&lt;br/&gt;which he hopes that
will provide the rigorous mathematical foundations of such a theory. The main
goal of this present proposal is to establish the minimal regularity
assumptions&lt;br/&gt; that needs to be verified by the initial conditions such
that one can still make sense of a physical solution to the Einstein field
equations. The proposal also envisages research in connection to other important
equations of mathematical physics such as those governing the behavior of
collisionless particles in an electromagnetic field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
