9619885 Hoffmann This is an award to provide support for research on use of
titanium dioxide as a catalyst in a photocatalytic process for treatment of
aqueous and gaseous waste streams to reduce their pollutional impact on the
receiving environment. The goal of this project is to determine whether the rate
of the photochemical reaction can be significantly increased in aqueous
heterogeneous media to levels comparable to those obtained in application of the
photocatalytic process to gas-phase waste streams. The research is designed to
address the fundamental basis for this apparent discrepancy by studying the
reaction mechanism using a pulsed source of ultraviolet radiation. Two
hypotheses are planned to be examined. One is that the difference in
reactivities between the process application to liquids and gases relates to
differences in the mode of substrate adsorption on the surface of the aatalyst.
The other is that water may inhibit oxygen reduction and/or substrate
competition for available adsorption sites on the target compound. Results of
this project are expected to contribute to a better understanding than now
exists of photochemical reactions as they may be applied to decontamination of
soil and water. This in turn is likely to result in improvement of the
engineering design of processes that can be used reduce the pollutional effect
of liquid and gaseous waste discharges on the quality of surface and groundwater
and to decontaminate soil.***
