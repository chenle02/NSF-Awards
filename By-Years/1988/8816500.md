This award will support planning activities related to the possible
establishment of a National Center for Undergraduate International Programs for
Science and Engineering. This includes the convening of a conference to bring
together representatives from academic/engineering institutions and industry for
the purpose of planning such a center. Dr. Howard L. Wakeland, Associate Dean of
the College of Engineering will serve as principal investigator. The proposed
center would be a joint academic-industry- scientific/engineering-associations
venture designed to provide undergraduate students with
language/cultural/scientific/ engineering exposure at foreign centers of
excellence, especially in the Pacific Rim area. The goals are to improve
American students language capability at an early stage, as well as to foster an
increased awareness of scientific and engineering developments abroad.
