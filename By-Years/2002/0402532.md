This award funds the development of multi-century and sub-annual coral-based
time series of climate variability from Easter Island, Chile. Easter Island is
sited beneath the descending limb of the Pacific Cell; an area that shows
pronounced decadal climate variability. It is also located with a section of the
South Pacific Gyre that acts as a source for shallow subsurface meridional flow
at the southeastern most section of the South Pacific Convergence Zone. These
factors, when combined, are thought to support the production of time series of
sea surface temperature over the past 300 years from the southeastern
Pacific.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research aims to fill a gap for data from an
important region of the world that can be used to develop a better understanding
of climate, ecosystems, and sea surface interactions and feedbacks. The
researchers and their graduate students will work closely with colleagues at the
Universidad de Chile and the Universidad de Concepcion to interpret the
developing Easter Island data set and to enable Chilean students to participate
in exchange visits at Stanford University.
