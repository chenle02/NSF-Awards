This SGER proposal intends to explore new ways to leverage Internet2 facilities
and capabilities in supporting network research. The initial exploration is
targeted at the existing portfolio of NSF-funded network research projects, and
mapping their work and needs for network infrastructure and services to current
and near-term capabilities in Abilene and Internet2. The Abilene Observatory and
HOPI testbed are two such facilities that can be used in support of network
research. The work promises to enhance network research through this exploration
and eventual application. Impact of the work results from new advances in
computer and network systems, and a near-term significant improvement in
supporting experimental deployment of new networking
technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
