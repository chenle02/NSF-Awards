9400329 Jaron The research proposed in this application is concerned with
modeling the steady state and time-varying properties of O2- CO2 coupled
transport in the microcirculation. The model developed is a compartmental model
representation from the distributed model. Simulations are carried out
systematically by applying space-averaging methods to the corresponding
distributed models. These simulation results will be compared with experimental
results appearing in the literature. The long term goal of this research program
is to incorporate the results of this study with previously developed mechanical
and hemodynamic models of circulation in order to relate the metabolic and
mechanical performance of the system and study their interaction. It is expected
that the integration of gas transport and metabolism with the hemodynamic
behavior of the system will be an important step toward improving understanding
of the control characteristics of the biological system. This research may be
important in understanding the normal physiological system, as well as for
pathological phenomena involving hypoxia, heteroxia, and gas toxicity. ***
