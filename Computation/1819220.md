The recent discovery of a whole family of atomically thin layers has led to much
interest in the fields of materials science and nanotechnology. In principle,
many desired electronic, optical, and thermal material properties can be
obtained by stacking vertically a number of such layers to form so-called two-
dimensional weakly-bonded integrated multilayers. Such structures are generally
non-periodic. This leads to interesting geometrical properties such as moire
patterns, but also results in the breakdown of the traditional (periodic)
description of materials that is essential to the computer simulation of
materials from first principles. The broad goal of this project is to exploit
the mathematical structure that arises in quantum models of two-dimensional
multilayer materials to enable the efficient and reliable predictions by
computer simulations that are required to explore the vast range of design
possibilities and to guide or validate experimental studies.

This project aims to develop and analyze novel discretization techniques and
algorithms based on the C*-algebra formulation of the quantum electronic
transport phenomena. This novel class of numerical techniques will implement
directly the noncommutative framework for aperiodic multilayer geometries and
enable fast and robust ab-initio computations of electronic properties in two-
dimensional multilayer materials. Numerical analysis and theory-based numerical
experiments will be developed to optimize and certify the resulting
computations. Beyond the case of two-dimensional weakly-bonded integrated
multilayers, this new prediction and design tool will also allow the
investigation of mechanical or photonic meta-materials by engineering artificial
incommensurate geometries.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
