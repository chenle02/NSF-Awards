HEDGES 9401903 Processes affecting the preservation of organic matter and its
major biochemical components in marine sediments will be studied with a
continuing program which will: a) Develop a molecular-level technique for
analysis of tannins and apply it in a study of the geochemistry of these
polyphenols. b) Continue our recent studies on the physical forms or organic
matter in marine sediments, emphasizing the effects of protective matrices on
major biochemical distributions in organic-rich and deltaic deposits. c)
Investigate the possible effects of slow oxic degradation on the preservation of
organic matter and pollen in a marine turbidite and in continental margin
sediments. The proposed tannin initiative is an extension of our efforts to
develop and test analytical methods for major biochemicals that are promising
geochemical tracers. The sediment fabric and oxic degradation studies represent
a shift in emphasis away from case studies of biodegradation in specific plant
tissues, toward field investigations of processes that may strongly affect the
preservation of sedimentary organic materials on a global scale.
