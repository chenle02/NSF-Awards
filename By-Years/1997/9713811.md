This is a proposal for a CMBS sponsored research conference on division
algebras. The week long conference will be held at Colorado State University in
Fort Collins Colorado in the summer of 1998. The principal speaker, David
Saltman, is an authority on the subject. He is both one of the main contributors
to recent advances in the subject and a popularizer of the area through his
students, collaborators and lectures. The subject itself is concrete and can be
approached in an elementary way. Division algebras are currently an exciting
area of research, with both knowledge of these objects and the application of
this knowledge expanding rapidly. This makes the proposed subject an ideal one
for a research conference appealing to a broad audience. For more information
