This grant supports the research of Professor H. Montgomery as principal
investigator, Professor David Masser as a research associate and Dr. Jeffrey
Thunder as a post-doctoral associate. Professor Montgomery will work on problems
in analytic and additive number theory. In particular, he will concentrate on
sieve methods and the geometric properties of the zeta function. Professor
Masser will work on Diophantine approximation particularly as it relates to
arithmetic geometry. He will also study large period matrices and endomorphism
rings of Abelian varieties. Dr. Thunder will try to give explicit asymptotic
estimates for the number of points of bounded height on certain varieties. He
also intends to study the Thue equation. This is research in the field of number
theory. Number theory starts with the whole numbers and questions such as the
divisibility of one whole number by another. It is among the oldest fields of
mathematics and it was originally pursued for purely aesthetic reasons. However,
within the last half century, it has become an essential tool in developing new
algorithms for computer science and new error correcting codes for electronics.
