This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Iowa purchase laser equipment. This
equipment will be used in the following research activities: A) All-Optical
Triple Resonance Spectroscopy B) State-Selected Photodissociation C)
Spectroscopic and Dynamical Studies of Molecular Clusters in Ground and Excited
States D) Velocity Modulation Spectroscopy of Molecular Ions Lasers emit a
narrow beam of coherent, powerful and nearly monochromatic electromagnetic
radiation. This radiation is used in chemistry to study a broad range of
subjects, from the dynamics of proteins and nucleic acids to photoelectron
transfer processes, and from interfacial chemistry to picosecond pulse shaping.
Lasers are also in optics, communications, and engineering.
