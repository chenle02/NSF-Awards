A workshop aimed at Identifying the Grand Challenges to Reducing the Impact of
Materials Flows in the United States will be held in 2004 to exploit new
information on national Materials Flows to discover existing or needed cross-
sectoral technologies to address these challenges. Materials flows accounting
data will serve to identify high volume or high hazard materials flows. Four
areas of improvement will serve to focus the effort as well: 1) synergy in
byproduct materials exchange with benefits accruing to at least two sectors; 2)
joint development of technologies common to at least two sectors; 3) technology
transfer; and 4) best practices. This workshop is motivated by the recent work
on Materials Flows and Energy Accounting by the National Academies and the WRI.
The workshop focuses on one way in which these data could enable new lines of
research. Experts from industry, the national labs, and academia will be invited
to join an organizing committee. This committee will arrange a preliminary
videoconferencing or net-meeting. The full workshop will follow and a larger
group of attendees will be defined based on the prior Materials Flows analysis
and meeting of the organizing committee.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts from
identifying cross-sectoral synergies and the efficiencies that could ensue are
potent societal benefits that could follow from this workshop. The cross-
disciplinary team and the partnership between and NGO and academia offer a rich
source for cross-fertilization of ideas. A final report of workshop results will
be disseminated to leaders in the resource industries, university faculty,
government managers, and students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
