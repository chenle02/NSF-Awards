9628051 Vidale This research involves the use of earthquake recordings at dense
short-period seismic networks that are analyzed as an array to delineate details
of mantle structure, especially at and near the core-mantle boundary and at
discontinuities in the upper mantle. Core reflections and refractions recorded
at over 1000 seismic stations in the western U.S. from more than 50 large
earthquakes in Central and South America will be used to image the heterogeneity
near the core-mantle boundary. Approximately 100 Nevada Test Site nuclear tests
recorded at west coast stations will be used to analyze reflections from the top
of upper mantle discontinuities. P'P' reflections from the bottom of the same
discontinuities will also be used as sensitive indicators of sharp changes in
upper mantle properties. Study of these mantle heterogeneities and
discontinuities will help us learn about the Earth's convection which is the
driving force for plate tectonics and earthquakes. This research is a component
of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program. ***
