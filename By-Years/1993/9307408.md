9307408 Jones The PI will conduct a comprehensive theoretical research program
to study the dynamics of optical fiber devices and characterize the stable and
unstable pulse propagation conditions. By allowing the gain material to retain
its full set of variables, i.e. polarization and population difference, new
degrees of freedom will be introduced into the system which will play in the
generation of complex waveforms. The PI will focus studies into the threshold
conditions of the system, the dynamics of the gain material, and its effect in
constructing or reshaping pulses. Currently, the PI is exploring the
possibilities of experimental demonstrations of these effects with a group
located within their own laser center. ***
