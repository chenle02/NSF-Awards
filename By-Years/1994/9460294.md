This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will investigate the
feasibility of using sonic energy to synthesize alumina ceramic powders from
aluminum nitrate-water solution at room temperature. Intensity of sonic energy,
water surface tension, solution temperature, the dissolved gas, and solution
concentration will be defined to achieve the sonochemical effects to produce
nanosize alumina powders. The synthesized powders will be characterized by X-ray
diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, and electron microscopy.
