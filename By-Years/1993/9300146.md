9300146 Dyer This award will support collaborative research between Charles R.
Dyer, University of Wisconsin, and Marco Ferretti, University of Pavia, Italy.
The research will attempt to exploit parallel programming models to overcome
existing problems in shape and motion analysis. It will include research on
designing and implementing parallel computer vision algorithms for high-
performance parallel computers. Data-parallel methods will be developed for the
intermediate-level vision tasks of two- dimensional and three-dimensional shape
analysis, and motion analysis. Each researcher brings complementary strengths to
this cooperative effort. Dyer has developed a number of new techniques in the
areas of three- dimensional object representation, object recognition, motion
analysis, and methods for active visual three-dimensional shape recovery and
exploration using continuous, directed observer motion. Ferretti has studied
extensively the implementation of parallel algorithms on a wide range of custom
and general-purpose parallel computers. The researchers will collaborate on
defined problems of mutual interest that will enhance both groups' abilities to
develop new techniques and implement parallel programs to test these methods.
