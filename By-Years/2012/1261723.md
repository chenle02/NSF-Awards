This project supports student travel to IEEE International Symposium on Workload
Characterization (IISWC) to be held in San Diego, CA on Nov 4-6, 2012. IISWC is
dedicated to the understanding and characterization of workloads that run on all
types of computing systems. New applications and programming paradigms continue
to emerge as the diversity and performance of computers increase. On the one
hand, computing workloads evolve and change with advances in microarchitecture,
compilers, programming languages, and networking/communication technologies.
This symposium, sponsored by IEEE Computer Society and the Technical Committee
on Computer Architecture, will focus on characterizing and understanding modern
computer applications commercial and scientific computing.
