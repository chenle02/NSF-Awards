Interdisciplinary(99) This project is developing a new innovative program to
develop future faculty in engineering with practical training to be more
effective educators. The core of the proposed program is based on efforts in a
newly developed and popular program called the Minor in Engineering Studies
(MES). The project creates teams of effective faculty to train, mentor, and
evaluate a select group of graduate students to teach classes in the MES
program. The combination of intensive mentoring by well trained faculty and
instruction in current effective teaching techniques ensures that graduate
students are poised to become top educators in engineering.&lt;br/&gt;The MES
program is designed and implemented to provide technological literacy to non-
engineering students. The main objective of the MES program is providing the
concepts and ideas of engineering and technology to students with non-technical
backgrounds. The MES uses a contextual approach (e.g., learning electrical
engineering by investigating how a cell phone works)that makes engineering
relevant to the daily lives of non-engineering students. The classes are non-
mathematical and are focused on applications, conceptual understanding, and big-
picture items. The classes have no prerequisite and build on high school
algebra. Effective and successful faculty participate in the program as
representatives of the best resources in providing guidance, mentorship, and
special lectures to help strengthen graduate educators' teaching skills and help
them become more effective educators. The project models the effective use of
expertise and training to ensure that future generations of well trained
engineers and non-engineers have an understanding of engineering technology.
