Advanced computer vision equipment will be used to improve the sensitivity in
measuring in-plane displacements on the surface of structural components.
Smaller displacement measurements will detect smaller flaws in a structure and
will provide more accurate assessment of the parameters which control brittle
fracture of structures. The equipment will also be used to measure the
micromechanical deformation of grain boundaries in metals leading to a better
understanding of the material parameters which control the strength of metals.
