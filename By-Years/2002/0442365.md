Mathematical Sciences (21). This project is developing a "kit" of plastic
manipulatives to make three-dimensional reference frames that support
construction, study, and experimentation with three-dimensional mathematical
objects. Components would include plastic rods to represent vectors, marbles to
represent points, and pipe cleaners to represent curves. The investigators see
these physical tools as enhancing students' ability to visualize concepts
relating to points, surfaces, planes, curves, contours, and vectors in three
dimensions. For example, when introducing students multivariable functions,
manipulation of these physical objects can prove more effective than a
projection of three dimensions onto a two dimensional screen. The project is
also building on the use of prototypes of these manipulatives in a precalculus
course for engineers that introduced functions of two variables in precalculus.
An Advisory Board of faculty from a diverse set of institutions including a
state-supported research institution, a private four-year college, a community
college, and a secondary school is helping the PI and colleagues to perfect the
design of these tools and to produce drafts for accompanying manuals to help
instructors of multivariable calculus and algebra use the kit.
