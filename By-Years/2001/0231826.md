Perceptual learning is defined as experience-induced changes in the way
information is extracted by these researchers who intend to investigate how
perceptual learning occurs and whether it has implications for mathematics and
science learning. It is the process by which learners differentiate relevant
structure from irrelevant variation. The methods of research involve
experimental investigations of conditions affecting perceptual learning, effects
of structure discovery, and structure mapping variants of learning procedures on
transfer. Experiments will employ objective measures of learning such as speed,
accuracy, and transfer to novel problems. They will test and apply new learning
technology such as automated sequencing algorithms that use a learner's speed
and accuracy to assess learning and to sequence events for optimal efficiency.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The panel reviewers noted that an investigation that might
clarify perceptual learning might help supplement or even challenge prevailing
constructivist theories of learning. This way of thinking about learning could
be an important discovery for mathematics and science learning. &lt;br/&gt;
