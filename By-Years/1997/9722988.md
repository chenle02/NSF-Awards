9722988 Phillips Soil bacteria have evolved sophisticated mechanisms for
coexisting with plant roots. The focus is on the interaction of Rhizobium
meliloti and alfalfa. The work is based on the previous detection of a bacterial
factor that stimulated root respiration, although the factor is structurally not
identical to the known lipo-chitin oligosaccharide signals involved in
nodulation. In addition, the factor does not induce roothair curling and its
synthesis is not dependent on the presence of roots. The work will characterize
this factor and determine its structure. Bacterial mutants which do not
synthesize the factor will also be characterized to unravel the biosynthetic
pathway. Finally, the purified compound and the bacterial mutant strains will be
used to study alterations in root colonization, signaling between the symbiotic
partners and plant responses.
