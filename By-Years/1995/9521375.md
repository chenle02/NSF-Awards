9521375 Hartline PROPOSAL ABSTRACT The roles of mechanoreception in predator
detection by epipelagic and mesopelagic calanoid copepods (Acartia, Labidocera,
Undinula, Euchaeta, Pleuromamma, and Gaussia spp.) will be evaluated from
morphological, neurophysiological and behavioral perspectives. The hypothesis to
be tested is that escape behavior is triggered by mechanical stimulation of two
specific neurons (GAMs) in each antenna. A second focus will be a comparison of
conditions eliciting bioluminescent discharge with conditions leading to the
stereotypic rapid escape (="jumps"). ***
