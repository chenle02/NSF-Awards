The International Linear Collider (ILC) is a high priority project in the world
high-energy physics program. As part of an ongoing effort to educate and train
young scientists for this project, the ILC Global Design Effort (GDE), the ILC
Steering Committee (ILCSC) and the International Committee for Future
Accelerators (ICFA) Beam Dynamics Panel will jointly organize the Fourth
International Accelerator School for Linear Colliders in 2009 in China. This
award provides funds for partial support to U.S. students to attend the school.
