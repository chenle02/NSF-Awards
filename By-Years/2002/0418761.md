The award from the Chemistry Division supports an Undergraduate Research Centers
(URC) planning grant. The PI is H. David Husic assisted by co-PI Diane W. Husic
of Moravian College. This planning grant will support activities of the
Consortium for Research Opportunities in the Plant Sciences (CROPS) to develop
an URC. The consortium members are chemists, biochemists and a molecular
biologist at Lafayette College, Moravian College, Colgate University, Haveford
College, Juniata College, Marist College and Lehigh University. The award will
support work towards the following goals: 1) development of consortial
relationships; 2) fostering interdisciplinary collaborative faculty/student
research; 3) provide research opportunities in the area of plant sciences; 4)
develop programmatic elements that will illustrate the ties between chemistry
and the plant sciences that can impact both research and classroom teaching.
Programmatic elements to be considered and designed include a seminar series,
curricular materials, workshops, laboratory resource guides, an electronic
newsletter, a website focusing on chemical and molecular aspects of plant
sciences. The consortium will foster research opportunities for students at
institutions that currently have limited infrastructure to support research,
including a regional community college, Northampton Community College.
