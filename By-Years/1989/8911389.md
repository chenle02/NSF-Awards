There is a great potential for the use of trace elements in the study of
oceanic processes. However, this potential has not been realized to the extent
that it could be due to the time, cost, and technique involved in most types of
trace element analysis. Thus, it would be desirable to have available analytical
techniques which: a) reduce analysis times, b) can be used on shipboard and
possibly in-situ, c) are inexpensive, and hence d) are accessible to a wide
variety of analysts. This is a proposal to develop new trace element analysis
systems which will meet these criteria. Such systems are possible using kinetic-
catalytic colorimetric reactions adapted for continuous flow analysis. The best
available kinetic-catalytic reaction schemes will be adapted for determining the
elements manganese, copper, and iron. Shipboard tests will be performed using
the new systems and results compared with analyses performed by other accepted
techniques. The suitability of the new analysis systems will also be evaluated
for making in-situ measurements and preliminary attempts will be made to develop
an in-situ analysis system.
