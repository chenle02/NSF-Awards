Whittier College is establishing a connection to NSFNET via a 56,000 bits per
second line through the CERFNET mid-level network. The connection enables the
school's faculty and students to communicate and collaborate with the national
scientific and educational community, and to access network resources. Areas of
science and education to be addressed by Whittier over the Internet include
geology, image processing, physics, mathematics, political science, economics
and history. The library also will benefit from the connection. This award funds
part of the costs for two years.***//
