9405654 Jones The University of the District of Columbia requests support from
NSF for connection of their campus networks to SURAnet. SURAnet is the midlevel
network located in the southeastern United States. It will provide operations
management and information services and it will give the University of the
District of Columbia a 56 thousand bits per second connection to the NSFNET, a
high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National Backbone network.
Students and faculty research will benefit from the link. By linking to the mid-
level and national networks the University's faculty and academics will maintain
a position of leadership in research and educational innovation by profiting
from remote access to super computer centers, data bases and information
services, high speed communications, file transfer and remote login, and access
to library resources. This is also a unique opportunity for the school to
explore innovative educational resources.
