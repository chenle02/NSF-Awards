Through this project new experiments in optical spectroscopy and magnetic
resonance are introduced into the undergraduate physics curriculum as part of an
innovative upper-division laboratory course for physics majors. The course
(Spectroscopy and Magnetic Resonance) investigates electronic transitions in
molecules and solids, vibrational and rotational transitions in molecules, and
magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Students are exposed to the most important
experimental techniques in visible, infrared, and magnetic-resonance
spectroscopy. The first component of the course introduces absorption
spectroscopy, laser-induced fluorescence, and photoluminescence. In the second
section, students investigate Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and Raman
spectroscopy. The third component introduces pulsed (i.e., Fourier transform)
nuclear magnetic resonance. This course has a significant interdisciplinary
component. The experiments and techniques explored in this course are central to
physics, physical chemistry, and biophysics, and the experiments developed in
this course are available to students in chemistry and biology.
