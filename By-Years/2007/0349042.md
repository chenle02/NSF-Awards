How brain mechanisms regulate and are regulated by complex social behaviors
across animal species is one of the greatest challenges for neuroscience. This
Science and Technology Center for Behavioral Neuroscience brings together a
diverse group of behavioral biologists, psychologists, neuroscientists,
molecular biologists and engineers from a mix of research-intensive and
teaching-oriented institutions in the Atlanta area, including five Historically
Black Colleges and Universities. A novel intensive collaboratory approach
introduces modern molecular biology into behavioral research with an explicitly
comparative aspect. A novel perspective is taken on how brain function, even at
the molecular level, may be influenced by particular kinds of social behavior
among individuals. Comparing different species offers insights about the
conservation of genes and circuits during evolution, and it may transform the
way we think about how hormones influence behavior, how genes are regulated, and
how brain mechanisms have been adapted for different environmental demands. Six
core facilities are formed for technical developments to allow answering
scientific questions that previously could not be asked. The research of this
center will produce new discoveries, and the integration of research and
education for a broad diversity of students will promote a new generation of
interdisciplinary neuroscientists.&lt;br/&gt; The impact of this Center extends
beyond the scientific advances. The infrastructure of this Center creates a new
network of research and educational institutions in the Atlanta area to provide
a strong local focus, where excellent facilities and researchers from diverse
backgrounds also offer outstanding opportunities for underrepresented groups at
all educational levels. Taken together, these features make this Center an
exceptional investment by NSF for research and education with a high quality and
a high impact.&lt;br/&gt;
