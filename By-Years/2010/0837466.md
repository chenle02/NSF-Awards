Computer Science (31)

The objectives of this project are to generate a new teaching tool SWEET (Secure
WEb dEvelopment Teaching) in secure web development for undergraduate students
in computing field; to create a portable teaching laboratory; to evaluate the
effectiveness of the teaching tool in improving students' learning experiences;
and to foster collaboration between academia and industry partners. SWEET
provides structured lectures, laboratory exercises, and project modules for
building problem solving skills.

This project is conducted collaboratively by Pace University (Pace), the lead
institution, and City University of New York - City College of Technology (CUNY
City Tech). Pace develops the SWEET platform and both, Pace and CUNY City Tech,
develop teaching modules and build their own portable teaching laboratories to
incorporate SWEET in several undergraduate courses. The project supports the
training of a new generation of computing professionals who understand and are
able to solve security problems occurring in web development.

This project broadens students' exposure to a modern, practical software
development through realistic web security scenarios from industry. SWEET is
disseminated to broad audience including industry partners, academic partners,
web sites and conferences. It bridges the gap between the current computing
curricula and industry expectations from graduates in the computing disciplines.
It has a potential to attract undergraduate students by providing a new,
interesting and innovative teaching tool in secure web development.
