People who occupy positions of power are held in higher esteem that they
otherwise would be. This elevation in status can be reduced if the social
advantages responsible for a given individual's power are known. This doctoral
dissertation project is an experimental study that will integrate theoretical
concepts from three theories in sociology--exchange, expectation states, and
status value--in an effort to explain why power confers status and why it
confers more status in some situations than in others. One hundred and fifty
participants will take part in an experiment designed to examine the effect of
differences in power which produce a difference in rewards in the presence or,
alternatively, in the absence of information about the social structural power
that produces that difference in rewards. This project will contribute to the
fields of sociology and social psychology by increasing our understanding of the
connection of power to status. In addition, it will increase our understanding
of the motive for restricting information in organizations that in turn could
lead to techniques for increasing the flow of information. This project also
will provide an excellent opportunity for a promising young scholar to continue
to develop independent research skills.
