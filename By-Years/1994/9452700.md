9452700 Abraham The University of Tulsa seeks to initiate a four-week,
residential, Young Scholars program in engineering for 36 students entering
grades 9 and 10. The primary components of this program are the on- campus
sessions at the university where the scholars interact with engineering faculty,
undergraduate engineering students, and representatives from industry. Specific
activities include hands-on engineering laboratory experiments, an engineering
design project, industrial site visits, workshops in engineering ethics, and
computer training sessions. One of the goals of the program is to make
engineering as a career come alive for the young scholars, especially Native
Americans, while at the same time help them to understand the educational
foundation they must acquire in high school in order to confidently and
competently pursue an engineering career.
