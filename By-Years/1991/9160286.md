Quality x-ray optics will be a key factor in the success of x-ray imaging
applications such as lithography, x-ray lasers, x-ray microscopes, and x-ray
spectroscopy. Multi- layer lamellar gratings and phase patterned x-ray optics
would offer advantages in spectral resolution, spatial resolution, and power
efficiency over current x-ray optics used in these applications. The production
of reflective phase structures will require innovative schemes for fabrication.
This research will develop a fabrication process suitable for phase structures
based on processes used in the semiconductor industry. The method utilized will
be suitable for the fabrication of phase gratings with periods of less than .2>m
or the limits of lithographic resolution. The feasibility of this method will be
shown by making large scale (5 square cm.) multilayer phase gratings of .3>m to
.8>m periodicity, which will be characterized on the Brookhaven synchrotron. The
experiments will determine the feasibility of making gratings of less than .2>m
periodicity. The processes developed under this proposal will be directly
applicable to fabricating other phase structures such as zone plate x-ray
lenses.
