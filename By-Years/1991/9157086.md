This is an award to support research the objective of which is to obtain a
better understanding than now exists of the fate and transport of ionic solutes
(primarily metals) in the subsurface environment, in adsorption processes for
treatment of water and wastewater and in processes for treatment of contaminated
soils. Work includes determining the mechanisms of solute precipitation on
particles and the influence of humic material coatings on surface and sorptive
properties of minerals. Competitive sorption of solutes will be studied
especially between trace metals and major electrolyte ions. This award provides
initial base-level support for this Presidential Young Investigator and funds to
match $37,500 provided by the Chambers Development Corporation of Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania. Results are expected to advance the understanding we now have of
adsorption mechanisms for aqueous ionic solutes, to enhance the usefulness of
existing adsorption models that are used in design of processes for treatment of
water and wastewater, in predicting the movement of pollutants in aquifers, and
in engineering design of systems to decontaminate soil.
