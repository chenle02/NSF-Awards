The objective of this proposal is to combine the advantages of holographic image
processing in photorefractive semiconductors, with the resonant enhancement of
electro- optic properties using quantum- confined excitons. This objective will
result in the first systematic study of semi-insulating multiple quantum wells
and their application to image processing. Significant resonant enhancement of
photorefractive diffraction is possible. Semiconductor already have the
advantage of fast device speed. The quantum wells must be semi-insulting to
allow spatial modulation of electric fields. In the proposed research, multiple
quantum well structures will be grown by molecular beam epitaxy and will be made
semi-insulating by ion implantation. The differential transmission of
wavelengths that are near the fundamental absorption of the quantum wells will
be measured as an alternating electric field is applied across the quantum
wells. Holographic gratings will be imposed on the wells using the interference
of two coherent, low-power, cw laser beams that can be turned continuously
through the fundamental absorption. The research has significance because it
will yield image processing devices that are limited in resolution only by
diffraction, are optically addressed and controlled, and require very small
operation energies.
