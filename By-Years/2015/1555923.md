The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project allows for a more effective glaucoma treatment
by adjusting eye pressure based on disease progression for each patient. In
2015, the US glaucoma market is estimated to be over $2 billion and our
addressable market, glaucoma surgical therapies, is estimated to be $534M. The
incidence for glaucoma increases with age, and as the baby boomer population
gets older, there will be a growing need for glaucoma treatments. To treat
glaucoma, patients undergo lifelong drug regimens, multiple laser procedures,
and invasive surgical procedures. However, even with all these treatment options
glaucoma patients still go blind from glaucoma. The proposed novel design and
approach to glaucoma will personalize the treatment for patients and remove the
need for numerous and costly procedures. Most importantly, the personalization
of glaucoma therapy will optimize visual protection for every
patient.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will validate the safety and
efficacy of a glaucoma drainage device to adjust and set pressure in the eye.
Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness and is only treatable by
reducing eye pressure. Surgical treatments are unpredictable with suboptimal
success rates based primarily on the choice of drainage site. The proposed novel
device drains to a new area of the eye to avoid the complications and
unpredictability associated with the current glaucoma surgeries. The device also
can provide the first-ever personalized treatment for millions of glaucoma
sufferers by fine-tuning pressure based on the needs of the patient throughout
his or her lifetime. Phase I/IB studies have shown feasibility of the device
with an adjustable component. However, its efficacy and safety have yet to be
fully investigated. Therefore, in this Phase II research grant, we will optimize
the device for safety and efficacy and perform the necessary preclinical testing
according to FDA standards to further develop the product.
