This award enables the research team to continue their work on the ICECAP (ICE
age Chemistry and Proxies) modeling project whose aim is to explore the utility
of delta O-17 isotopes in ice core sulfate as a proxy for past oxidant levels.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Generally, the research will investigate the evolution of
the atmosphere's oxidation capacity during the Last Glacial Maximum and pre-
industrial Holocene through to the present-day. Specifically, the researchers
aim to evaluate the relative roles of emissions and atmospheric dynamics in the
variability of oxidants on glacial-interglacial timescales as well as any
regional variation in sulfate and nitrate isotopes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
award will support two graduate students and a high school science teacher.
Successful completion of the work would improve the understanding of feedbacks
between climate and the sources and sinks of methane, which would help improve
our understanding of climate.
