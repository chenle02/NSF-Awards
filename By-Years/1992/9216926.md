This award supports a conference entitled: "Lie Group Representations and
Combinatorics". The conference will be held from 27 to 31 December 1992, on the
campus of New Mexico State University, in Las Cruces. The conference will
acquaint researchers and graduate students with Lie theory and combinatorics. It
will disseminate information presently unfolding about both areas and their
application throughout mathematics. The major objectives of the conference are:
1. Bring an eminent researcher to the geographically isolated area of the
university; 2. Foster research collaborations between local faculty and outside
participants; 3. Stimulate ongoing and future research programs.
