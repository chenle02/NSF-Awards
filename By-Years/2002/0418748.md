This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
multiplexable diagnostic assay for DNA detection. The approach uses NanoBarCode
(NBC) technology to localize fluorescent DNA probes that are coupled to the NBC
particles through thiol-linkages.

The commercial application of this project will be in the area of DNA detection.
The proposed DNA hybridization assay, if successfully developed, could be used
to detect genetic disorders and biological warfare agents.
