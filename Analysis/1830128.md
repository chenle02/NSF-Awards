This project concerns a study of the some of the mathematics behind the
following basic physical question: To what extent can the geometry of a body be
determined from information about a force field associated to the body (for
instance, its gravitational field)? Such inverse problems in potential theory
have a rich history, but the mathematical tools needed to properly answer this
question, especially in the case when the operator relating the force field to
the mass distribution of the body is sensitive to long-range interactions, are
currently underdeveloped. In this project, the principal investigator will
develop tools to further understand this problem, concentrating especially on
what can be said if one knows only that the field has bounded magnitude.

More specifically, the project primarily concerns the relationship between the
geometry of a measure and the regularity of an associated differential or
singular integral operator. This is is a question that has attracted
mathematicians ever since the Cauchy and Riesz transforms were introduced as
tools to study the behavior of analytic and harmonic functions, respectively. An
integrated approach to such problems is proposed that goes through the study of
reflectionless measures. This approach has recently yielded several new results
and could potentially address a number of open problems, especially those
concerning the smoothness of the support of a measure that has a bounded Riesz
transform. Here new tools in quantitative geometry and higher order partial
differential equations need to be developed in order to make progress.
Furthermore, the principal investigator seeks to build upon recent innovations
in the theory of quasilinear differential equations to consider analogous
problems for a wide range of nonlinear differential operators, where no integral
representation is available.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
