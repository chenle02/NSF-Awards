This award funds a study of the linear polarization of the centimeter
wavelength radiation from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) on the smallest scales.
This is to be accomplished with the technique of polarization sensitive Very
Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI), whereby the linear polarization structure
of compact radio sources may be determined on angular scales of milliarcseconds
at multiple wavelengths. Dr. Roberts is one of the pioneers and leading
investigators in VLBI polarization studies. At the distances of AGN, these small
angular scales correspond to physical scales of light years. The linear
polarization tells us about the magnetic field structure, radiation mechanisms,
particle content, kinematics, and geometry of the radio jets produced by AGN,
which will help us understand their structure and evolution. The ultimate goal
of this work is to understand the mechanism which lies at the heart of AGN,
currently thought to be accretion onto massive black holes.
