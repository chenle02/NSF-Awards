9452320 Bukatko The goal of this project is to restructure the teaching and
format of the introductory statistics course, a required course of all majors in
psychology. The project uses an interactive learning approach rather than the
traditional lecture/discussion model. A principal goal is helping students
appreciate more the concepts and assumptions that underlie various statistical
tests. Active-learning modules on central statistical concepts incorporate
computer graphing and statistical analyses, computer graphing enable students to
visualize the theme of each module. The graphing component is especially helpful
to those students who have difficulty understanding mathematical formulae. Also,
the computer-based statistical exercises permit students to immediately observe
the effects of various transformations and relations among various sets of data.
