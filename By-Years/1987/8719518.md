This is a conference to be held during the annual meeting of the Association
for Chemoreception Sciences. The topic of the conference is insect pheromone
research, an area that is important from the standpoint of insect control as
well as having considerable impact on our understanding of chemical
communication. The interaction of researchers working with insect pheromones and
those in other areas of taste and smell has not been as extensive as might be
hoped, and among the benefits of this conference is that it will bring a group
of pheromone researchers to the meeting of the chemical senses scientists and
will do so in a forum that will not be in a time slot competing with any other
activity of the meeting.
