This research project will incorporate haptics and devices into "virtual humans"
to investigate interpersonal interactions with medical students and these
simulated patients. Prior virtual human work has identified that the lowered
engagement level of students and the lack of haptics hampered the fidelity and
applicability of virtual human experiences. To enhance human-virtual-human
experiences, this project will develop and evaluate mixed reality humans. Mixed
reality humans (MRH) in this project will integrate haptics, physical objects,
and physiological monitoring to form simulated conversational partners. MRHs
will be evaluated in a series of studies with students in the health profession.
As part of coursework, students will experience a series of Human-MRH
interactions. The impact of MRHs on interpersonal patient scenarios will be
evaluated with behavioral, physiological, and self-report
measures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The developed MRHs will be integrated into course
work of medical, nursing, and physician assistant students. These students will
be provided new opportunities to practice interpersonal scenarios associated
with intimate exams. Intimate exams tend to be high-anxiety interactions, and
include exams of the breast, pelvic, and prostate. Improving student
communication skills in intimate exams has the potential to directly impact
patient care quality and patient outcomes. It is difficult to provide
technology-based experience with these exams with existing technologies; thus
there is good potential for impact through development and research of MRHs.
This technology will also be integrated into a health exhibit at the Museum of
Science and Industry in Tampa, FL. The exhibit will have thousands of visitors
interacting with virtual human doctors and patients to receive important health
information while interacting with and experiencing the affective capabilities
of virtual humans.
