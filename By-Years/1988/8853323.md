The primary objective of this laboratory improvement program is to teach
undergraduates intelligent process control and to integrate a coherent chemical
engineering curriculum. A series of two chemical reactors are used to simulate
the heart of a typical chemical industry. The control system implemented around
the reactors provides the students hands on experience. Laboratory projects are
integrated with several experts systems, which include (1) IDSCA: Intelligent
Direction Selector of Controller's Action for multiloop control systems; (2)
IDSOC: Intelligent Decisionmaker for problem-solving Strategy of Optimal
Control; (3) ESID: Expert for System Identification experiment Design; and (4)
the integrated intelligent system for real-time process control. The intelligent
educational system, which is based on production systems with a backward
chaining inference engine, can help students gain a clear insight into the above
subjects. Microcomputers make such a low cost and effective teaching facility a
real possibility.
