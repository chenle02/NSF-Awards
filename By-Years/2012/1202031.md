The Rochester Group will be conducting research on BES-III in Beijing with the
goals to study in open-charm production and to measure, with high precision
through Dalitz analysis, phase information on the decays of neutral D mesons
into Kshort pi pi final states with different tags for CP even and CP odd. This
information can then be used by B factories and LHCb to determine the value of
the CKM mixing angle gamma (or Phi3). Additional aspects of the program include
the study of radiative decays of D mesons and searches for rare/forbidden
decays, which are highly suppressed in the Standard Model, and if observed would
be indicative of new physics. The Broader Impacts of the program included
assisting with the Rochester PREP program, a summer program for high-school age
women to promote further science interest in those who have yet to take high
school physics.
