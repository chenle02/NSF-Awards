Production planning and scheduling is an area of research that has received much
attention over the last two decades. It includes long-, medium-, and short-range
planning. Productivity is low if these activities are not performed well. Three
problems in this area will be investigated. One involves medium-range planning:
enhancing algorithms that determine lot sizes and the scheduling of production
operations and raw material acquisition. Better estimates of lead times are
expected from this work. A second problem also involves medium-range planning:
it takes account of uncertainty in multi-stage manufacturing systems. Better
estimates of safety stock and safety time are expected. The third problem
involves short-range planning: development of an algorithm for detailed
scheduling of production operations, fast enough to deal efficiently and
effectively with the stream of disruptions that make many detailed schedules
obsolete almost as soon as they are created.
