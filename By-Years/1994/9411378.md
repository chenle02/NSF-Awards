9411378 Narin The proposed research will examine the relationship between
patented US technology and US science through an analysis of references cited on
US patent grants in 1987/88 and in 1992/93. Hypothesis testing will be used to
determine if the preference for citing US references on US-inventor patents is
increasing, whether a significant amount of the citation pertains to very
fundamental research, the source of the research funding, for example from NSF
and NIH, whether citations are concentrated in specific science dependent
technologies, how rapidly science linked technologies are growing, and whether
there is a geographic dependent preference in the citations. ***
