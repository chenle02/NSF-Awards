A Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR) is being acquired for use in
two areas of undergraduate instruction - structured laboratories and independent
undergraduate research projects. Students at the sophomore level are using the
FTIR in microscale organic labs to perform quantitative analyses of products and
to demonstrate organic reaction kinetics/mechanisms. Students in the junior
analytical laboratory sequence are assembling a network of interfaced
instruments by combining the FTIR and its associated computer with a compatible
spectrofluorometer. The students are using the FTIR to explore its ability to
quantitatively analyze samples in a variety of physical states - aqueous
solutions, dilute solutions, opaque solids, polymer coatings, etc. Students are
using the networked spectrofluorometer to characterize a polynuclear aromatic
hydrocarbon mixture with 3- dimensional fluoroscopy. Students in the extensive
undergraduate research program are able to select from eight, FTIR-oriented
research projects that have been designed by five faculty members (3 inorganic,
3 analytical/ environmental, 1 organic, 1 polymer). The grantee is matching the
award from non-Federal sources.
