This research is motivated by a strong need to provide engineers with
computational assistance in the design and evaluation of complex engineering
systems. The research investigates ways of harnessing distributed computing and
faster CPU processors to significantly increase the range of practical design
problems that may be handled in an optimization-based format. Significant
improvements in man-machine interaction are expected. The research application
to base isolated structures will improve the understanding of the complex cause
and effect relationships existing between the characteristics of earthquake
ground motions and the response of isolated structures. An important goal of
this work is formulating guidelines for proportioning flexible superstructures
when limited inelastic deformations are permitted/prohibited under severe
lateral loads.
