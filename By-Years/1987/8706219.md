The proposed research will focus on the determination of the microscopic
structure and lattice dynamics of physisorbed, incommensurate monolayers. An
important part of this study will be the calculation of the detailed shape of
the static and dynamic structure factors. Calculations will be done for both
quantum and classical solids, and will examine both finite temperature effects
and quasi-two-dimensional behavior. The importance of various energy terms will
be explored, and the sensitivity of the results to reasonable variations in the
interatomic potential funtions will be investigated. The theoretical approach to
be used in this study is a variation of and an extension to a nonlinear coupled-
harmonics theory which has been successfully applied to the zero temperature
classical solid. This theory can be used both far from and near to the
commensurate-incommensurate transition. The modifications to the original theory
include the use of a self-consistent phonon to treat the dynamics of the solid
monolayer. Some computer simulations of solid phases and phase transitions will
also be done.
