Dr. Lenore Blum and associates at Mills College plan to explore the use of an
interactive videodisc environment for elementary education in mathematics using
existing materials from SQUARE ONE TV. The project will use a prototype
interactive computer learning system that uses icons embedded within an
exploratory environment to allow learners to select their own activities. The
system allows videodisc materials to be easily combined within an interactive
computer environment and includes browsing, lesson selection, open exploration,
practice problems, and extended activities keyed to the SQUARE ONE TV material.
They will produce a videodisc with source materials provided by Children's
Television Workshop, design the interactive environment, and evaluate its
effectiveness with trial groups of teachers, students, and others in formal and
informal settings. This modest proposal will extend the range of utilization of
SQUARE ONE TV and provide valuable information on its potential use in non-
broadcast settings.
