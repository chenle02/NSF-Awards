This award supports the participation of two scientists from Uganda and
Tanzania in an international cooperative research project on paleoclimate
studies on Lake Victoria, which is part of the core project `IDEAL,` the
International Decade of the East African Lakes. The grant provides funds for the
two scientists to come to the University of Miami to participate in data
processing and interpretation of the seismic reflection data collected earlier
in this geophsical experiment. The U.S. principal investigator is Professor
Christopher Scholz, Division of Marine Geology and Geophysics at the Rosenstiel
School of Marine and Atmospheric Science,University of Miami. The two African
scientists are Mr. Honey Malinga, a geophysicist with the Uganda Petroleum
Exploration Department, and Mr. Sebastian Shana, a geologist with the Tanzanian
Petroleum Development Corporation. Both scientists participated in field work
for the project in Africa and are among the core of junior scientists in their
countries responsible for major operations in their companies.
