This proposal is an extension of the PI's previous theoretical work on the
response of bone to mechanical stresses. The intent is to extend the
mathematical theory to describe the changes that occur at the bone-implant
interface. A computational procedure known as boundary element method will be
used to analyze the microstructural remodeling of bone and to determine the
variation in mechanical stability as a function of time. If the theory is proven
correct, the work will lead to the improved design of bone protheses.
