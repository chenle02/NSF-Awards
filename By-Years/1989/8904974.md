The mating system or social-organizational structure of an animal species or
population is a fundamental aspect of its biology in the field. It affects the
ways in which animals exploit resources in a region and how individuals compete
for resources and for reproductive success. Such systems differ in different
species. The overall system in a society is the product of the individual
behavioral responses of the animals in the society. The goal of this project is
to determine the behavioral tendencies of animals living in different systems,
in an attempt to understand what individual behavioral patterns are important in
producing the system. Voles of the genus Microtus are ideal research subjects,
as they live in different mating systems and adapt well to the laboratory. Dr.
Dewsbury will continue studying four species of voles: prairie voles and pine
voles, which are often monogamous, and montane voles and meadow voles, which are
often polygamous. Among the traits to be contrasted are development, play, mate
choice, and sperm competition. The results will contribute to a general
understanding of different mating systems and the factors that underlie them.
