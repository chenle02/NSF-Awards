At Paul Smith's College, a two year college of arts and sciences there are both
pre-baccalaureate programs and technically oriented programs in Environmental
Science and Forestry which help students develop skills and attitudes necessary
to solve problems, in the areas of pollution control and resource conservation.
Environmental Science and Forestry graduates are regularly admitted to four year
programs with full junior status, while those who elect to enter directly into
employment benefit from the technical skills they have developed through the use
of analytical equipment. There currently include gas chromatography, HPLC, and
atomic absorption spectroscopy. Ion chromatography is an important technique for
this kind of program since the Dionex Ion Chromatograph has been specified by
the Environmental Protection Agency as the method of choice for anions and acid
rain studies. With this system our students are instructed in the newest
techniques of analysis. The institution is matching the NSF grant with an equal
amount of funds.
