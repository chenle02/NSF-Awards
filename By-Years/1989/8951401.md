The modern Fourier transform nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer has become
one of the most versatile pieces of instrumentation available to the practicing
chemist. The availability of such instrumentation for hands-on use os critical
to education and training of the undergraduate student. The acquisition of FT-
NMR provides our student with the desired exposure to current technology. The
instrument is actively incorporated in the sophomore organic course, which has
been recently converted to the microscale program. At this level, routine proton
and carbon-13 data are emphasized. A more detailed discussion of theory and
application of NMR occurs at the junior level during the year long courses in
physical chemistry and in our spectroscopy-instrumental analysis course. During
these courses and our courses in biochemistry, advanced organic chemistry, and
advanced inorganic chemistry the multinuclear, variable temperature, and two
dimensional capabilities are explored. The students have first hand opportunity
to a variety of chemical problems through the use of the NMR spectrometer. The
institution is providing an amount equal to about 125% of the NSF grant toward
the purchase of the equipment.
