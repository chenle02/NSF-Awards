The Department of Geology is acquiring an x-ray diffractometer (XRD) to improve
the laboratory part of the undergraduate geology curriculum. The XRD is being
used, along with the currently-owned electron microprobe and atomic absorption
spectrometer, as the basis for a new senior-level course "Analytical Laboratory
Techniques" to give undergraduates hands-on experience with these modern tools
for analyzing geological materials. In addition, the instrument is enriching
both the current sophomore and senior level mineralogy and petrology courses.
