9709245 Verosub This grant provides three years of partial salary support for a
technician to oversee operation and maintenance, service user requests and
develop new analytical methods for the recently acquired 2-G Model 755-R long-
core cryogenic magnetometer at the University of California-Davis. This is a
Phase I Technician Support grant under the IF/EAR program. Support of a
technician for this u-channel cryogenic magnetometer facility is intended to
allow easy access to this "first-of-its-kind" instrument in the U.S. for both
members of the U.S. paleomagnetic community and other geoscientists interested
in environmental paleomagnetism and the secular variation of the geomagnetic
field. Support of this position will also aid in the development of software to
adequately treat the large volumes of high-resolution paleomagnetic data that
can be easily generated with the Model 755-R. ***
