This Department is purchasing equipment to enhance the development of data
acquisition and analysis skills in undergraduate students -- both majors and
non-majors. Computer simulations and interactive videos are creating an
environment in which non-major students can collect and evaluate data without
being dependent on manual skills. This enables even scientifically naive
students to become involved quickly in scientific pursuits and to begin to
experience ways in which scientists solve problems. In upper level courses
(including research projects) majors have opportunities to work with computer-
interfaced instruments to speed data collection and to accomplish calculations
that enable the student to interpret and draw conclusions from related groups of
facts. The thrust of the project is to spend more time thinking about the
implications of data sets than is spent in acquiring the factual information.
The grantee institution is matching the NSF award with an equal sum obtained
from non-Federal sources.
