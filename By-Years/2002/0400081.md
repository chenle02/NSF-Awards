The objective of this grant is to develop methodologies and computationally
practical approaches of reliability analysis and reliability-based design for
complex engineering systems. The complexities include multiple interacting
disciplines, large number of design variables, the mixture of multilevel details
of uncertainty information, and the extensive use of computer simulations. The
complexities have hampered the wide applications of reliability-based design in
real-life engineering sytems design problems. This research will deal with the
complexities at two complementary levels. At reliability analysis level,
efficient and accurate reliability analysis methods, including Saddlepoint
Approximations, will be developed. At reliability-based design level, strategies
and mathematical formulations of reliability-based design models that can be
solved efficiently with capabilities of dealing with the abovementioned
complexities will be established. The proposed approaches will be demonstrated,
verified, and validated through a reliability-based vehicle safety design
problem by collaboration with industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is anticipated
that the research results will provide industry efficient and practical tools
for the implementation of reliability analysis and reliability-based design in
complex engineering systems design with reduced product development times at
reduced cost and risk. The research will also contribute computational methods
to general engineering design under uncertainty, such as robust design and
decision-based design under risk and uncertainty. In addition, the research
results will contribute to education in the areas of engineering design theory
and methodology, quality engineering, and systems engineering. &lt;br/&gt;
