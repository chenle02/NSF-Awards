In this project, the principal investigator will continue his work on several
basic problems in multivariate complex analysis that are closely related to
research in differential geometry, nonlinear analysis, and classical dynamics.
More specifically, the principal investigator would like to continue his
research on the equivalence problem in several complex variables and carry
further his work on the complex structure of the holomorphic hull of a real
submanifold in a complex space through the use of the attached holomorphic
disks. He will continue his investigation of various rigidity problems in
several complex variables, as well as their applications and interactions with
super-rigidity problems in the theory of complex singularities and complex
geometry. He intends to investigate the simultaneous embedding and filling
problem for a Cauchy-Riemann (CR) family of embeddable, compact, strongly
pseudo-convex, three-dimensional CR-manifolds. Finally, he will continue his
work to understand whether an algebraic, strongly pseudo-convex hypersurface can
be locally holomorphically embedded into the Heisenberg hypersurface in a
complex space of higher dimension.

Complex numbers and functions of complex variables have become, since the
nineteenth century, indispensable tools in many areas of mathematics and its
application to other areas of science and engineering. The solutions of many
problems in the applied sciences could ultimately depend on improvements in
these complex analytic tools and a deeper understanding of their basic
properties. For example, in materials science the standard method for treating
multidirectional stresses in a uniform way is to represent them as complex
numbers or, in more complicated situations, as complex functions. It then turns
out that, among other things, the direction of the propagation of cracks in
materials is related to the properties of certain equations associated with
these complex numbers or functions. Results of the research to be carried out in
this project may lead to the discovery of new properties of solutions of these
equations. This project has significant educational and training aspects:
several graduate students and junior mathematicians will be actively involved in
this project. Finally, the principal investigator will continue to organize
international conferences on several complex variables and complex geometry,
bringing together mathematicians to discuss their research and teaching.
