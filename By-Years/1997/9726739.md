This award supports Dr. Peter Kotelenez of Case Western Reserve, Douglas Blount
of Arizona State University, and Richard Sowers of the University of Illinois-
Urbana Champagne in a collaboration with Michael R`ckner of the Mathematics
Department of the University of Bielefeld, Germany. The collaboration will
develop a rigorous mathematical framework for a large class of physical and
biological models, with a focus on Dirichlet forms, particle systems, and
abstract classical methods. Both sides of the collaboration bring unique
expertise to an area of research that is important to the study of probability.
Results will have implication to applications and models in physics and biology.
