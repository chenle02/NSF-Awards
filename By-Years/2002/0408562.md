The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) is convening the state
supervisors of mathematics, a group of mathematicians, and a group of
mathematics education professionals to examine the mathematics standards from
all states and territories that have such standards in order to study the common
elements and the critical differences. The work will be done in Park City, Utah
in conjunction with the Park City Mathematics Institute in the summer of 2004.
Proceedings will be published in 2005 and are intended to inform the work of
curriculum developers and publishers and to provide insight into the K-12
curriculum by two- and four-year colleges and universities.
