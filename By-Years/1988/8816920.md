Project is a world wide study of the rupture characteristics of large
continental normal faulting earthquakes and their aftershocks. Develops
procedures for analyzing whole seismic waveforms. Examines the depth of
rupturing, variation of fault dip as a function of depth, evidence of detachment
surfaces at the base of the aftershock zones (and if there is coseismic slip on
these surfaces during an event), and variations in the rupture modes as a
function of region. Current area of concentration is the Aegean region.
