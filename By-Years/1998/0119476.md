This grant supports a continuation of the analysis of lightning flash and stroke
characteristics across the United States using data from the National Lightning
Detection Network (NLDN). These data extend back to 1983. To the American data
will be added data from the Canadian Lightning Detection Network (CLDN), which
was established in 1997. The two networks combined comprise 187 sensors and
provide data extending from 25 degrees to 60 degrees N latitude and from 50
degrees to 135 degrees W longitude. The number of recorded flashes on these
networks exceeds 300 million. The data are used for characterizing different
properties of cloud-to-ground lightning, including flash polarity, the number of
flashes per unit area, the peak current, and stroke multiplicity. Studies are
under way on the variation of these quantities with season and geographical
location, and their dependence on local features such as mountains and cities.
There is already evidence of increased flash rates over urban areas, explained
perhaps by increased convection over heated cities or by microphysical effects
of pollution aerosols. Other findings to now are that the highest peak currents
are in the upper Midwest and the highest percentage of positive flashes to
ground are along the West Coast of the United States. Physical explanations for
these findings will be sought as part of the project.
