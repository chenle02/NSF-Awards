This award will provide one-half the funds required to purchase and install a
new ion source and emission regulator for an existing mass spectrometer system.
The system upgrade will enable measurements of hydrogen isotope abundances. The
upgraded system is to be used in isotope research at the Enrico Fermi Institute
of the University of Chicago. The University is to provide the matching funds
for the system upgrade.
