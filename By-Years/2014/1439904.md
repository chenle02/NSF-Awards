With funding from the National Science Foundation's Robert Noyce Teacher
Scholarship Program, this project addresses the Nation's growing need to recruit
and prepare secondary STEM teachers. The project will recruit STEM students from
Texas Tech University, as well as from three community colleges and will provide
them with effective mentoring, in addition to the pedagogical and discipline-
based knowledge they need to teach in the Lubbock area school systems. These
well-trained teachers will help close the documented achievement gap in these
schools. This project is a partnership among Texas Tech University (TTU), the
Lubbock Independent School District, South Plains College, Midland College, and
Odessa College. As a Phase II Scholarship and Stipend project, it will apply
what was learned during the Phase I Noyce project to enhance the recruitment and
mentored retention of talented STEM students into high needs secondary schools
in west Texas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The successful Phase I project supported 37
students. This Phase II project will prepare an additional 16 new teachers. The
evaluation of the Phase I project provided knowledge that informed the design
and development of the current project. Based on what was learned, the project
PI team will recruit students from among community college students, as well as
TTU students, and will involve current Noyce scholars in those recruiting
efforts. In addition, the project will support the pre-service teachers through
group mentoring, which they have found to be more effective.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Phase II project will encourage the scholars to
explore self-determination and will provide Autonomy Support Training from in-
service teachers during their internships and classroom placements. These
activities will result in a more intentional self-selection for the teaching
career and a higher probability of staying with the profession. Research on the
features of self-determination and autonomy exploration will generate knowledge
on the elements of motivation that may be effective in recruitment of pre-
service teachers. The project outcomes will be evaluated through surveys,
interviews, document analysis of research reports, and questionnaires. The
results of the research and evaluation will inform the recruitment and support
of pre-service teachers in programs across the country.
