9302883 Anderson The purpose of this project is the comprehensive experimental
and theoretical examination of tensile-strained quantum-well-heterostructure
lasers. Emphasis will be on the systematic identification of physical mechanisms
responsible for the significant performance improvements recently observed in
these types of lasers, and application of this information to high-performance
laser design. Sets of strained-layer laser samples designed to elucidate trends
in lasing properties with variations in specific quantum-well with the help of a
detailed model of strained-layer lasers to be developed as part of this work.
Investigations of the effects of externally applied compressive and tensile
uniaxial stresses will be included. It is important that these studies will
encompass wide ranges of well widths and compositions, thus spanning the range
of band structure configurations available in tensile-strained quantum wells,
and will emphasize careful isolation of various materials, strain, and quantum
confinement effects through a combination of theoretical and direct experimental
means. Finally, the information gained form these studies will be applied to the
design, fabrication, and testing of optimized low-threshold tensile-strained
lasers and new structures with unique tensile-strained active regions. Specific
focus will be on InxGa1-xAs-InP and GaAsy-1-AlxGa1-xAs lasers. ***
