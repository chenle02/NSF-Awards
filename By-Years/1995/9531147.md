The Mexico Political Reform of 1977 was initiated to revitalize the electoral
process and re-legitimize the government party and national political
institutions. During the previous decade, Mexican politics had become
increasingly violent as opposition increased and groups moved outside the
political arena to affect change on the system. The 1977 Reform was designed to
increase incentives for critics to work within the political system by changing
procedures for political party recognition, enlarging the national legislature,
and establishing a two-tiered electoral system with partial proportional
representation. By all reports the reforms enacted were successful in changing
the electoral process. But little is known about the impact of the reforms on
the operation of the national Chamber of Deputies which has absorbed the new
opposition political parties. This research examines how the reforms of 1977 has
influenced the path of Mexican democratic government. Based on a pre and post-
reform research design, legislative rules and well as legislative business (in
the form of bill introduction, amendment and passage) will be collected for the
period 1970-1993. The results of this research will demonstrate the utility of
the "new institutionalism" perspective for explaining legislatures outside the
United States and Europe. * * *
