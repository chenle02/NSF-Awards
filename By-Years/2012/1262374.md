This award provides renewed funding for a Research Experience for Undergraduates
(REU) program at the University of Maryland. The program will provide 15
students with a 12-week active learning experience each summer for five years,
for a total of 75 students over the duration of the program. The students will
be housed at one of the two Univ. of Maryland marine laboratories, Chesapeake
Bay Laboratory or Horn Point Laboratory, and will work closely with a scientist-
mentor to design, conduct and complete a summer research project. Following a
5.5-day orientation, REU students work with their scientist-mentor to write an
NSF-style proposal, give a mid-summer presentation, conduct field and laboratory
studies, analyze data, write a final research paper and present a talk at a
final symposium. The program introduces REU students to applying the scientific
method; learning field and lab methods; developing an understanding of estuarine
processes; achieving an in-depth understanding of a research problem; and
learning to interpret, organize and present in written and oral form the results
of a research project. Students may work individually with their mentors or as
part of a large, interdisciplinary research program. Recent student research
topics include nutrient biogeochemistry, estuarine modeling, sedimentology,
trace element chemistry, land use impacts, fisheries bioenergetics modeling,
predator/prey studies, microbial ecology, genetics, environmental contamination
and organism toxicity. In addition, student activities include learning about
science communication, research ethics, the graduate school application process,
networking and alternative careers in marine science.
