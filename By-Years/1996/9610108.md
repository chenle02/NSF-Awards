This project is cooperative between the University of Michigan (Papaefthymiou)
and the University of Rochester (Friedman). It is exploring electronic design
automation methods for optimizing high performance, high complexity VLSI/ULSI
circuits. The focus is on retiming and clock scheduling, two complementary
circuit optimization strategies that have attracted significant attention.
Retiming is an architectural-level transformation method that speeds up a
synchronous digital design. Clock scheduling is a circuit-level optimization
that increases the operating speed of a digital design. The approach is to merge
these two methods into a single powerful optimization process that will handle
comprehensive delay models. Problems being investigated are: (1) Finding
enhanced circuit models that consider physical and electrical issues related to
submicrometer technologies; (2)Developing a theoretical yet practical framework
for simultaneous retiming and clock scheduling based on these physical &amp;
electrical models; (3) Designing and evaluating polynomial-time approximation
algorithms for integrated retiming and clock scheduling. Software developed
during the project is being widely distributed.
