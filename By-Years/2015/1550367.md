The University of Pittsburgh's Center for Learning in Out-of-School
Environments, the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, and the Robotics Institute
at Carnegie Mellon University are building an open access cyberlearning
infrastructure that employs super high-resolution gigapixel images as a tool to
support public understanding, participation, and engagement with science.
Networked, gigapixel image technology is an information and communication
technology that creates zoomable images that viewers can explore, share, and
discuss. The technology presents visual information of scientifically important
content in such detail that it can be used to promote both scientific discovery
and education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of the project is to make
gigapixel technology accessible and usable for informal science educators and
scientists by developing a robotic imaging device and online services for the
creation, storage, and sharing of billion-pixel images of scientifically
important content that can be analyzed visually. Project personnel are
conducting design activities, user studies, and formative evaluation studies to
support the development of a gigapan technology platform for demonstration and
further prototyping. The project builds on and leverages existing technologies
to provide informal science education organizations use of gigapixel technology
for the purpose of facilitating three types of activities that promote
participatory learning by the public--Public Understanding of Science
activities; Public Participation in Scientific Research activities; and Public
Engagement in Science activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The long-terms goals of
the work are to (1) create an accessible database of gigapixel images that
informal science educators can use to facilitate public-scientist interactions
and promote participatory science learning, (2) characterize and demonstrate the
affordances of networked gigapixel technologies to support socially-mediated,
science-focused cyberlearning experiences, (3) generate knowledge about how
gigapixel technology can enable three types of learning interactions between
scientists and the public around visual data, and (4) disseminate findings that
describe the design, implementation, and evaluation of the gigapixel platform to
support participatory science learning. The project's long-term strategic
impacts include guiding the design of high-resolution images for promoting STEM
learning in both informal and formal settings, developing an open educational
resource and science communication platform, and informing informal science
educators about the use and effectiveness of gigapixel images in promoting
participatory science learning by the public.
