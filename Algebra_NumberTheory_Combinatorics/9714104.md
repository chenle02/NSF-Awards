9714104 Grossman This award supports a four-day workshop entitled "Mathematical
Techniques to Mine Massive Data Sets". The goal of the workshop is to introduce
a group of mathematical scientists to techniques used for the mining of massive
data sets. Data mining is the automatic extraction and discovery of patterns,
associations, changes, anomalies, and significant structures in large data sets.
Large data sets generated by scientific, engineering, medical and business
applications are becoming increasingly common. Developing algorithms which can
uncover patterns in large data sets is an important mathematical challenge. In
the past decade, extremely large sets of data have been generated at an alarming
from very diverse areas including scientific, medical, communications, and
manufacturing. These data bases are growing much faster than the speed of
computers and thus are outstripping our ability to extract information with
current techniques. The aim of this workshop is to acquaint mathematical
scientists with the issues involved in the mining of massive data sets and to
use their ability of abstraction to obtain new approaches to this critical
problem.
