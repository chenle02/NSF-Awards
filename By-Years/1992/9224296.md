Oregon State University (OSU) requests funding to purchase shipboard
instrumentation in support of NSF-funded research. The instruments will be used
aboard the research vessel WECOMA, a 177 foot vessel that is owned by NSF and
operated by OSU. All of the instruments are for shared-use by a wide variety of
scientists. The PI will upgrade the ship's computing, replace Niskin bottles,
and purchase a Milli-Q water purifier, a fluorometer, an AC bridge standard for
the temperature calibration facility, and a liquid scintillation counter.
