This proposal will support a week-long summer school on Cognitive Robotics to be
held in Boston, Ma in June 2017. The summer school will be a combination of
invited talks and tutorials, which are designed to introduce students to issues
in planning and execution from perspectives of both Robotics and Cognitive
Artificial Intelligence, and daily labs, which are designed to give students
hands-on experience with robotic hardware and state-of-the-art software tools
for developing robotic behaviors. The summer school will help expose graduate
students to cutting-edge ideas at the intersection of Robotics and Cognitive
Systems and will help to form a new community of researchers in this
interdisciplinary area.
