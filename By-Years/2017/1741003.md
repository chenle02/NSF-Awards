Tornadoes are a significant hazard in the United States and while tornado
warning times have lengthened over the past few decades, there is still room for
improvement. One of the recent technological advancements in tornado science is
the use of dual-polarimetric radar data. Dual-polarimetric radars transmit
signals horizontally and vertically. Through the combination of those signals,
we can infer properties of rain, snow and hail, such as their size and shape. It
has been observed that there are specific polarimetric signals that show up
prior to some tornado events. This research award will investigate those signals
to determine why they form and whether they are good candidates to be used as
indicators for developing tornadoes. The societal impact of the project is
related to improving tornado warning times and increasing public safety. The
research team is also working with an author to develop a non-fiction book about
tornado scientists, targeted at 8 to 11-year-olds, to enhance scientific
literacy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to develop conceptual
models of recurring differential reflectivity signatures in supercells with
potential prognostic value for tornadogenesis. The research team will analyze
existing rapid-scanning dual-polarized radar observations in supercells, collect
new observations using a novel rapid-scanning dual-polarized mobile radar
system, and utilize both sets of observations to develop and refine conceptual
models of these differential reflectivity (Zdr) signatures in relation to
tornadogenesis. The researchers will systematically focus on the Zdr column and
Zdr arc behavior immediately prior to tornadogenesis, comprehensively
documenting and analyzing a sample of 8-10 supercells. At least five additional
tornadic supercells will be sampled using the UMass-Amherst phase-tilt weather
radar (PTWR) during field studies during the award.
