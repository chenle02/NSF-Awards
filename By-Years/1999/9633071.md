This research will be conducted under the auspices of the Coastal Ocean
Processes (CoOP) program and is a continuation of a previously funded research
project. Funding is provided for an integrated, interdisciplinary analysis and
synthesis of extensive physical and biological samples and data collected off
Duck, North Carolina in 1994 during the CoOP project, entitled "Suspension,
cross-shelf transport, and deposition of planktonic larvae of inner-shelf
benthic invertebrates." The field program provided simultaneous and
comprehensive sampling of physical and biological patterns that comprise a
unique resource from which investigators will derive a greater understanding of
processes (both physical and behavioral) influencing the distribution and
transport of invertebrate larvae over the inner continental shelf, as well as
detailed knowledge of physical processes on the inner shelf. Sample analysis and
data integration will continue on this unique data set in order to achieve the
basic scientific objectives of the originally proposed research: (1) Do larval
distributions show water mass or interface (i.e., fronts or clines) affinity?
(2) Are there large changes in larval distributions during wind-driven, cross-
shelf circulation (i.e., upwelling and downwelling)? (3) Does the freshwater
plume from the Chesapeake Bay influence larval distributions on the inner shelf,
both in terms of species composition (i.e., as a source of estuarine larvae) and
of inner-shelf circulation? (4) Is there a semi-diurnal (i.e., tidal) variation
in near-bottom larval concentrations? (5) Is there a correlation between near-
bottom larval distributions and turbidity profiles? Do near-bottom larval
distributions change during resuspension events and how might these changes
affect larval transport? The work will be accomplished by six different teams of
investigators at five separate institutions as a collaborative interdisciplinary
effort.
