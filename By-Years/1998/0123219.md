The Scholarship Assistance for Technology Students program at Northwest-Shoals
Community College has the primary goal of inspiring motivation in academically
talented program participants to complete a college core curriculum and graduate
with AS degrees in computer science, engineering, or mathematics. The Alabama
Appalachian area the College serves contains significant numbers of needy
students from underrepresented groups who are currently enrolled in math,
engineering, and/or computer science degree and non-degree programs. Students
are given financial assistance and opportunity to study in these fields,
graduate with either a two-year terminal degree in these fields or transfer to
four-year colleges to complete their degrees. A solid foundation of networking
between the College and local employers is used as a base for mentoring scholars
and for placing the trained students into a career related to their education.
