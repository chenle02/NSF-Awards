Development of a Project Based Laboratory Sequence in Molecular Biology and
Biochemistry A project based laboratory curriculum in Molecular Biology and
Biochemistry is being implemented. The new curriculum offers students a
coherent, project oriented laboratory experience that allows them to participate
in the selection and design of experiments. The laboratory curriculum is
engaging students in the scientific process and thereby is facilitating the
development of the reflective judgment and problem solving skills relied upon by
scientists. The students are being acquainted with the techniques of molecular
biology and biochemistry most commonly used to address research questions. In
the Molecular Biology course, both molecular cloning and polymerase chain
reaction techniques are being introduced, and students then are applying these
techniques, using the DNA thermocycler, and exploring a question of interest. In
the Biochemistry course, protein purification is being approached by using
recombinant DNA technology rather than by relying upon classical tools. The
Biochemistry course also is using high performance liquid chromatography to
effect difficult separations of biomolecules.
