This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in the general
area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the subfield of heterogeneous
catalysis. The thrust of this activity focusses on fundamental investigations of
metal sulfide cluster-oxide support systems for hydrodesulfurization (HDS).
Hydrodesulfurization remains a poorly understood reaction despite very extensive
study. The use of cluster-derived catalysts for HDS represents a novel approach
to identifying the active site for HDS and understanding its physicochemical
nature. This type of catalyst could also have improved activity and selectivity
relative to conventionally prepared HDS catalysts. In the execution of the
research plan of this project, Dr. Thompson will investigate the behavior of the
homonuclear sulfide clusters Cp2Mo2(uS)2(uSH)2, Fe2(uS)2(CO)6,and
Co6(u3S)2(CO)12. Because these clusters contain bridging sulfide ligands, their
metal frameworks are expected to be very robust and stable under HDS reaction
conditions. These clusters will be synthesized and supported on partially
dehydroxylated gamma-Al2O3 and MgO. The pure and supported catalysts will be
characterized by a variety of analytical techniques including infrared
spectroscopy, surface area analysis, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy. Mechanistic insights into the HDS reaction garnered from these
studies will be used as the basis for a model of this important catalytic
process.
