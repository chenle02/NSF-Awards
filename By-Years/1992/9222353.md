Dr. Page will examine the gene structure, distribution of gene expression, and
ligand specificity of two biogenic amine receptors whose genes have been cloned.
Biogenic amines modulate behavior similarly in both invertebrates and
vertebrates. They are particularly interesting due to their implication in human
neurological disorders including schizophrenia, manic depression, and drug
addiction. Some insects provide an ideal model system for studying the role of
biogenic amines in behavioral control due to the caste structure of their
societies which results in the division of stereotypic behavioral repertoires
between individuals according to sex, caste, and age. Dr. Page's work will
provide a complete molecular genetic characterization of two insect receptor
genes. This will include the localization of gene expression in the central
nervous system in insects of each sex and caste. Antibodies will be produced for
each of the receptor proteins for use in protein regulation studies. Finally,
the receptors will be expressed in Baculovirus transfected insect cells and a
ligand binding profile of each receptor will be determined. This work will
provide the basis for future studies describing the genetic basis of behavioral
control and social integration.
