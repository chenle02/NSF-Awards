The determination of the structure of the dyneins is of fundamental importance
to the understanding of microtubule- mediated motility. This project will
identify the structural relationships among the dyneins which are expressed in
the gametes and early embryo of a single animal species, the sea urchin, a
uniquely well-suited model system. By focussing on a single animal which
expresses multiple dyneins in different developmental contexts, information
related directly to function and to development will be obtained. Specific aims
are to: determine the polypeptide composition of the ca. 21S ciliary dynein
which is obtained by the high salt extraction of embryonic cilia; raise new
antibodies to ciliary dynein polypeptides; and to determine the structure of the
ciliary 12S and 21S dyneins by electron microscopy. The results of these studies
will add to our understanding of dynein structual heterogeneity and how it might
affect dynein function.
