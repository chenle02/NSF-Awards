This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks to demonstrate the
high-density feasibility of a novel memory, which has both volatile and non-
volatile functionality. Such memory combines the non-volatile memory's ability
to retain information in the absence of power (such as Flash memory) and the
fast access speed and reliability of a volatile memory (such as Static Random
Access Memory (SRAM) or Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM)). This memory is
fabricated using silicon-based fabrication process, eliminating the need of new
materials or new process technology developments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of
the many applications of the proposed memory is to enable power-efficient
computing applications and mobile devices. A power-efficient memory such as the
one proposed in this proposal can reduce the overall data center power
consumption by up to 75%.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).
