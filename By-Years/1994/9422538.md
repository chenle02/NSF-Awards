9422538 Jalali Instabilities in current flow in semiconductors has been of
interest of some time. A well known example is the technologically important
Gunn effect which has been observed in direct bandgap semiconductors such as InP
and GaAs in which the electric field profile of a biased n+-n-n+ diode collapses
into a high field domain. This domain is swept out of the n-region in a
characteristic time, t and results in current pulses of frequency f=1/t. Since
the first observation of the transferred electron effect by Gunn in 1963 the
devices have been successfully implemented as low noise source of microwave and
millimeter-wave radiation. The similarity between the collector region of a
III-V heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT) and the drift region of a Gunn
diode has motivated us to explore the Gunn-Hilsum phenomenon in bipolar
transistors. Using numerical simulations, we have shown that current
instabilities resulting from the transferred electron effect can be observed in
modified HBT structures in which the electric field profile in the collector has
been properly engineered. These results have established design criteria for a
new three terminal bipolar oscillator with the potential for incorporation into
existing HBT integrated circuit technology, which we shall study in the this
project. The proposed device will be used as a novel spectroscopic tool in which
it is possible to independently vary voltage and current flow in the region of
semiconductor where stability occurs. Using this property we can apply a wide
range of bias conditions to assess the applicability of the Landau-Ginzburg
theory of phase transitions to describe fluctuations near oscillation threshold.
