The principal investigator will study nonlinear phenomena in which chaotic and
solitonic behavior occur. Topics to be studied include Hamiltonian theory over
non-commutative rings, algebraic and analytical aspects of the D-bar method,
solutions of algebraic equations using algebraic geometric methods, Painleve
equations and their appearance in the matrix models of quantum gravity, and
generalizations of the hypergeometric functions. Integrable systems and inverse
scattering problems play a fundamental role in establishing links between
fundamental physics and the way in which mathematical models are used to
describe it.
