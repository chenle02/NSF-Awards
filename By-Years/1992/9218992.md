Faugeron, Universite Paris-Sud %%% The Seventeenth Fungal Genetics Conference,
will be held at the Asilomar Conference Center at Asilomar, California on March
23-28, 1993. Approximately 400-500 scientists and students from around the world
will attend. The conference is focussed on the molecular biology, genetics,
biochemistry and cell biology of filamentous fungi. The meeting consists of six
plenary sessions, three poster sessions, informal discussions, and a day devoted
to concurrent workshops in specialized areas. Topics covered are sexual and
asexual reproduction, genetic instability and variation, mechanisms of gene
expression, and agriculturally, medically and industrially important fungal
systems. Strong emphasis is placed on the participation of scientists and
students from under-represented groups.
