Abstract

This project will analyze Kaehler-Einstein metrics on a compact Kaehler manifold
in three different ways. The first one is to study the potential function of the
Bergman metric of a polarized compact Kaehler manifold. The first several
coefficients of the asymptotic expansion of Zelditch have been computed by the
author. The method I used is complex geometric. Comparing to the method using
the paramatrix of the Szego kernel of the unit circle bundle, our method is more
straightforward. We wish to have some uniform estimates. Even in the case of
complex dimension one, this problem is interesting. In dimension two, the
problem is already complicated enough. Tian proved that there is a uniform lower
bound for the multi-anticanonical bundle over a Kaehler-Einstein surfaces. In
higher dimensions, the problem is very important, pointing towards the stability
of manifolds. The second one is the computation of the Futaki invariants. This
problem is related to the previous one in that the potential function is used in
the definition of the Futaki invariants. Futaki invariants can be used not only
as the obstruction towards the existence of the Kaehler-Einstein metric, but
also can be used to check the stability of manifolds. Since we are only
interested in the Futaki invariants for those varieties which are embedded into
some complex projective space, it is reasonable to think that we can compute the
invariants using some "extrinsic" information(Such as the polynomials in
defining the varieties). In fact, in the case that the variety is a complete
intersection, we found a formula to calculate the Futaki invariants. The last
one is on the geometry of moduli space of polarized Calabi-Yau manifold. A
Kaehler metric on the moduli space has been defined and was found that the Ricci
curvature of such a metric is negative away from zero by the author.
Furthermore, if one can prove that the scalar curvature of the metric is lower
bounded, one would be able to prove Viehweg's compactification theorem using
differential geometric methods.

Einstein's general theory of relativity interprets the concept of gravity as a
geometric property of space-time. The main mathematical tool to study the
geometry of these spaces is differential geometry. Since the discovery of
general relativity, differential geometry has been crucial to both
mathematicians and physicists. Our project is in one of the main fields in
differential geometry, and should add to our understanding of gravity and
ultimately the space we are living in.
