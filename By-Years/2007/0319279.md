This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)Phase I proposes to develop a new
method for antibiotic susceptibility testing having unparalleled speed and
simplicity. The technical approach is based on a novel implementation of
impedance sensing to monitor cellular growth with unprecedented sensitivity and
stability. This enables results to be obtained directly from bacterial
suspensions in less than one hour with a simple, inexpensive, and easy to use
device ideally suited for mass production. This method avoids the need for
growing cultures reducing the time from sample collection to complete diagnosis
by weeks compared to currently used methods. In this Phase I project, the
feasibility of the proposed diagnostic tool with antimicrobial drug resistant
strains of Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis will be demonstrated.

The commercial application of the proposed product will be as an in-office
medical diagnostic. A low-cost and easy-to-use rapid and specific monitor of
biological samples has broad application throughout the microbiological testing
industry. Specific large markets include rapid techniques for urinary tract
infections, testing of mycobacteria, and testing of biological threat agents.
