Johnson 9531775 The goal of the 1996 REU project at Gustavus Adolphus College
is to nurture the development of underrepresented individuals in the geological
sciences. Eight undergraduate women will conduct field and laboratory research
to determine the character, origin, and history of Pleistocene deposits in
south-central Minnesota. Four of the women will be selected from Gustavus
students, the other four will come from outside the institution. The individual
research projects are concerned with till stratigraphy of south-central
Minnesota, genesis of late-Wisconsin till (possibly a deforming-bed till),
character and sedimentology of River Warren (outlet of Lake Agassiz), and
Holocene colluvial fans of the Minnesota River valley. These projects will
require the participants to learn and apply various geologic research techniques
including outcrop description, laboratory analysis, and statistical analysis on
the computer. REU students will examine issues in scientific ethics and women in
science, with input from professional women in the Geosciences. At the close of
the session, they will present a professional talk, lead a field trip, and
interact with a group of visiting glacial geologists from other parts of
Minnesota. The last two weeks consist of a field excursion to active glaciers in
the Canadian Rockies to study glacial processes first hand.
