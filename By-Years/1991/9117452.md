This grant is for support of participants at a winter Gordon Conference on
Sensory Transduction in Microorganisms. The conference, which is anticipated to
have 110-135 attendees, will permit scientists from the United States and abroad
to discuss recent developments and ideas regarding molecular mechanisms of
sensory transduction in simple unicellular systems including bacteria, yeast,
flagellates, and Dictyostelium. Sessions will emphasize the emerging
generalizations regarding chemosensory and photosensory receptors,
intramolecular transduction, intracellular signal processing, and the response
processes, ranging from flagellar or pseudopod modulation in tactic cells to
gene expression in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. Homologies between
microbial and higher animal signal transduction components will be emphasized.
Sensory signal transduction is the key to the ability of an organism to perceive
and respond appropriately to its environment. The mechanisms by which microbes
perceive and respond to environmental stimuli are fascinating in their own
right, and crucial to the survival of microbial species. In addition, they
provide important clues to mechanims whereby higher organisms, both plant and
animal, likewise perceive and respond appropriately to environmental stimuli.
