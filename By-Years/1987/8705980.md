This research project focusses on modeling the interannual variability of the
tropical Pacific Ocean, using a 15-year record of atmospheric forcing from a
version of the NCAR Community Climate Model. The skill of the ocean model's
hindcast will be assessed. To the extent that the ocean model reproduces
extremes of sea surface temperature that were present in the original boundary
forcing, the dynamical causes of these events will be determined, including the
relative contributions of zonal advection, upwelling, and anomalous surface
heating. Several integrations with different sampling of surface forcing fields
will be carried out to determine the requirements for measurements of surface
wind stress and surface heat flux to reproduce the main results with the highest
quality of specified forcing. The results will pave the way for coupled GCM
studies of interannual variability and quantitative assessments of the potential
of long-range forecasting. It will also contribute to the design of observing
systems for the tropical Pacific Ocean. This project is important because it
attempts to develop and test a way to treat in a modeling perspective the global
processes by which oceans and atmosphere interact to produce and to alter
climate. This project is a primary part of the World Climate Research Program's
Tropical Oceans Global Atmosphere research program.
