Microstructure and material properties define the functionality of all
engineered composites, from advanced fiberglass-epoxy automotive body panels to
composite biomaterials such as wood, bone, or myelinated axons. For full
exploitation of these advanced materials, variability of microstructure, loading
conditions and manufacturing processes must be addressed simultaneously. This
career plan is focused on development of a set of novel, unified predictive
tools for improved selection and repair of fibrous materials, validated in each
focus area with tightly coupled experiments. A new set of mechanics techniques,
referred to collectively as the Fiber Network Theory, is used to allow
applications of the research to three distinct fields of engineering endeavor:
power storage; structural design; and human biology. The investigator will
develop both undergraduate and graduate curricula and integrate them into
research activities. In addition, this CAREER plan will explore the teaching
techniques and encourage women and minority students to participate in
engineering and research.
