9526955 Fisher Subduction of oceanic plates under continental margin commonly
involves uplift of forearc regions, and recently it has been shown that
subduction of large features such as seismic ridges causes differential uplift
in the margin above the down-going buoyant material. This project will test the
idea that along sediment starved convergent margins forearc deformation is
characterized by differential uplift in the upper plate controlled by the
roughness of the incoming seafloor bathymetry. This work involves integration of
structural, bathymetric seismic and geodetic information in the middle America
trench off Costa Rica to determine the linkage between down-going topography and
the resulting differential uplift topography of the upper plate, and the
operative kinematics, stress orientation and seismicity associated with the
phenomena. Results will be useful in understanding uplift in active forearc
regions and is subduction zone dynamic generally.
