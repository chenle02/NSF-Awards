9413693 Rumble This award provides one-half the funding for the acquisition of
the components needed to build an ultra- violet laser microprobe for the
analysis of oxygen isotope ratios in silicate and oxide minerals. The laser
microprobe will be designed, built, installed, and operated in the Geophysical
Laboratory of the Carnegie Institution of Washington. The Carnegie Institution
of Washington is committed to providing the remaining funds necessary to
complete the project. The development of the laser microprobe system for in situ
microanalysis of oxygen isotope concentrations is expected to make a large
impact in the interpretation of stable isotope variations in geological systems
by allowing the measurement of isotopic variations to be made with a spatial
resolution of several micrometers, comparable to the scale on which mineral
samples preserve the isotopic zoning inherited during growth. ***
