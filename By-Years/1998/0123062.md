Twenty nine scholarships in the amount of $3125 are available annually to
academically talented, low-income students majoring in computer science or
mathematics. Several strategies are used to ease the transition from high school
to college helping to ensure student achievement and success. These strategies
include small class sizes, an emphasis on collaborative learning, a student
mentorship program, internship&lt;br/&gt;opportunities with local business and
industry, and active student organizations focused on professional development
in computer science and mathematics. The program is resulting in increased
numbers of students electing to major in the targeted disciplines.
