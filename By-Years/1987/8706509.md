The Flathead Lake Biological Station (FLBS) was established in 1896 for
research and education in the field sciences. Located on the largest freshwater
lake in the western United States (outside of Alaska), FLBS has a year-round
research program emphasizing limnology and stream ecology. A state-of- the-art
freshwater research laboratory provides the instrumental basis for a varied
aquatic research program in the largely pristine environments of northwestern
Montana. Research on Flathead Lake has led to a ten-year data base that is fully
computerized. Recent efforts in simulation modeling have helped identify
priority research topics at FLBS for the next five years, including
investigations of suspended sediment/microbial relationships in phosphorus
cycling, ecosystem-level effects of accelerated nutrient loading, effects of
stream- and lake-level regulation on primary productivity, and changes in lake
trophic relationships caused by the recent introduction of an exotic arthropod
into the lake. These studies require acquisition of a reasonably large and fully
instrumented research vessel. The largest vessel currently available at the
station is a 16-foot research boat which, due to safety considerations, can only
be used during calm weather. This project will provide funds for the purchase of
a 26 ft, diesel-powered research vessel and for shipboard equipment. These funds
will be matched by $45,000 in new equipment by the University of Montana.
