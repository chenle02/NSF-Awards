0318458&lt;br/&gt;Kenig&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports acquisition of
a new stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer (SIRMS) in the Environmental
Geochemistry Isotope Laboratory, Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences,
University of Illinois at Chicago that would be coupled with an existing gas
chromatograph and high temperature pyrolysis system for compound specific stable
isotopic analysis (CSIA) of carbon, hydrogen and chlorine in organic matter (OM)
as tracers of microbial geochemical pathways and identification of specific
sources of complex mixtures of organic matter. CSIA has great potential as a
highly sensitive proxy of paleoenvironment conditions at the time of OM
deposition and as a method of unraveling the geochemical history (i.e., redox
conditions) experienced by the OM since deposition. Areas of research that will
benefit from the new SIRMS include &lt;br/&gt;paleoceanographic proxy studies of
the water column chemistry of Mesozoic seas, paleoclimate/paleoecologic
investigations of perennially ice-covered lakes and the Dry Valleys of
Antarctica, and environmental studies of the fate and transport of PCBs in
groundwater.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
