Travel support is to be granted to a selected number of US participants invited
to give presentations at a Symposium on Nonlinear Hydrodynamic Stability and
Transition, to be held in France on September 3 - 8, 1990. Younger and less
known participants are targeted for support. The symposium is sponsored by the
International Union of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics, and the support from
NSF is shared by a variety of other sources.
