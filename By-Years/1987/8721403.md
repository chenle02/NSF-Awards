Detailed structural and petrologic studies are proposed in several transects
across the Nepalese Himalayas to further under- stand the Eocene collision
between India and Asia. Specifically, thermobarometry and Ar-Ar and U-Pb
geochronology will be used to constrain the P-T-time paths for these rocks.
Analyses of heat- producing elements will be carried out on selected samples to
evaluate the thermal evolution of these rocks and to evaluate partial melting of
the underthrust Indian plate (to determine origin of the associated granites).
Structural work will assess basement-involved thrusting. The goal is to improve
knowledge of the relative importance of various tectonic processes in the
thermal evolution of collisional orogenic belts. Collaborative arrangements have
been made with Nepalese (Dr. Upreti), French (Dr. LeFort), and others (e.g. Drs.
Parrish, Harrison) from N. America.
