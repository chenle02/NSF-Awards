9803374 Davis About 50 years ago, Aleksandrov, Busemann and Wald introduced the
idea of defining upper and lower bounds for the ``curvature'' of more general
metric spaces than Riemannian manifolds. Aleksandrov was interested primarily in
the case of nonnegative curvature and its applications to convex polyhedral
surfaces in Euclidean 3-space. Interest in this subject was renewed about ten
years ago when Gromov pointed out that for topological and group theoretic
reasons the nonpositively curved case was much more interesting than the
positively curved case, the main reason being that the universal cover of a
nonpositively curved space is contractible. Gromov also pointed out that there
were many polyhedral examples of such spaces. In particular, Tits buildings are
such examples. For the past several years, Professors Charney and Davis have
collaborated in investigating nonpositively curved polyhedra and applications to
group theory. The groups in which they are primarily interested are Coxeter
groups and Artin groups. Both types of groups are associated to groups generated
by reflections. Both Charney and Davis have also accomplished separate research
in these areas. They will continue their research on these areas as well as on
closely related topics such as the properties of Tits buildings and their
automorphism groups. Groups generated by reflections occur in many places in
mathematics and in nature (for example, in crystallogrophy). The symmetry groups
of regular tilings of the Euclidean plane are such groups. Escher's drawings
show examples of regular tilings in non-Euclidean plane geometry. These are also
associated with reflection groups. Professors Charney and Davis are interested
in such examples in a more abstract setting. It turns out that abstract
reflection groups (Coxeter groups) can always be realized as the symmetry groups
of a space that is nonpositively curved, much as in the case of the Euclidean
and non-Euclidean planes. ***
