Epitaxial gallium phosphide (GaP) will be studied as a promising new material
for the manufacture of particle detectors. Due to a high indirect bandgap and
exceptional crystalline quality, epitaxial gallium phosphide detectors will
provide superior performance in high-temperature, high- radiation environments.
Extremely low reverse saturation current and good signal-to-noise ratios are
expected from gallium phosphide detectors. This Phase I program will apply a
systematic approach to demonstrate the capabilities of epitaxial GaP detectors.
A comprehensive study of intrinsic and compensated high resistivity epitaxial
gallium phosphide layers and PN detectors will be performed. A novel device
design intended to extend the high energy collection efficiency of an epitaxial
particle detector will be proven. The Phase II program will further develop and
optimize this device as well as develop a technology to economically produce
millimeter thick epitaxial layers of high resistivity detector grade gallium
phosphide.
