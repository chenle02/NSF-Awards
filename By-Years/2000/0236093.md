The main objective of this research is to develop innovations in probe
microscopy of biomolecular materials. The research will integrate both the
imaging and the pulling aspects of probe microscopy to develop models of
biomolecular mechanics and structures. Specifically, the work will focus on
three significant classes of biomolecular materials, and it will examine two
types of biomaterials from each class: (1) Highly elastic biological proteins -
spider capture silk and HMW (high molecular weight) glutenin -are good model
systems for possible improvements in the elasticity of synthetic materials. (2)
Protein mimics to be investigated are polyamino acids and a non-peptide triblock
copolymer mimic of the abalone protein lustrin; lustrin is the main protein
component of abalone shell, which is 3000 times more fracture resistant than
concrete. (3) Novel DNA structures to be investigated are telomeric mimics, and
DNA-surfactant liquid-crystalline films, which have been used to study
photoconductivity of DNA. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will take a multi-
directional approach to make innovations in probe microscopy of biomolecular
materials. Probing many systems has been a good approach for maximizing the
probability of innovation in probe microscopy of biomolecular materials.
Undergraduate students will be involved in the research, and some will become
co-authors or first authors of peer-reviewed publications. &lt;br/&gt;
