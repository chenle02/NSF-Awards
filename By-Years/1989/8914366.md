In this project in the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor Christopher S. Foote
will study the "Chemistry of Singlet Oxygen and Related Topics" in the Chemistry
Department at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). He will explore
the biological aspects, chemistry, photochemistry, and spectroscopy of singlet
oxygen. The chemistry of singlet oxygen is of tremendous pathologic,
therapeutic, and industrial significance to a society vitally dependent on
atmospheric oxygen and sunlight for its existence. Photooxidation plays a major
role in the degradation of materials and in a number of pathological processes.
Photooxygenations involving singlet oxygen and electron transfer are being
studied, with the goal of elucidating the borderlines for various mechanisms.
Mechanistic tests are being developed for intermediates in these reactions such
as exiciplexes, zwitterions, and perepoxides. Isotope effects, trapping
experiments, and direct time-resolved spectroscopic probes for intermediates are
being used, and novel unstable products of some reactions are being
characterized at low temperatures.
