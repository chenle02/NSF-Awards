This conference sponsored by the New York Academy of Sciences will highlight
the remarkable progress achieved over the last few years concerning calcium
channels in excitable tissues. Advances were mainly possible because of the
development of new Ca++ channel ligands and of new methods for the detailed
functional investigation of single Ca++ channel molecules. Thus, several
distinct Ca++ channel types with different biophysical, physiological,
pharmacological and regulatory properties have been identified. New models for
the mechanisms of ion permeation and channel gating have been developed. New
high-affinity ligands have allowed the chemical purification and elucidation of
the subunit composition of at least one channel type, the localization of
channel distribution as well as the observation of Ca++ channel expression
during development and in various diseases. Additionally, antibodies against
Ca++ channels have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Lambert-Eaton
Myasthenic Syndrome, and a specific absence of Ca++ channels has been
demonstrated in muscular dysgenesis. Ca++ channel study has evolved into a truly
multi-disciplinary effort. The conference will bring together scientists from
neurobiology, biochemistry, molecular biology, physiology and pharmacology, each
contributing a vital part to the understanding of this relevant biological
signalling pathway.
