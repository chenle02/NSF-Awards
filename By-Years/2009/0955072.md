0955072&lt;br/&gt;Rylander&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this CAREER plan is
to create and utilize a novel sensing system called the "holey scaffold" to
nondestructively and minimally invasively measure dynamic nanoparticle transport
and photothermal and photochemical tumor response to nanoparticle-mediated laser
therapy. A holey scaffold is a new technology co-invented by the PI that is
composed of an embedded network of microchannels within a scaffold framework
upon which cells and tissues can be grown. Hollow core fibers integrated in the
holey scaffold permit simultaneous optical sensing/imaging of dynamic processes
and selective delivery of biological agents (e.g. nutrients, cells,
nanoparticles) for control of biochemical responses. The CAREER objective is to
use holey scaffolds to measure 1) spatiotemporal nanoparticle transport for
varying nanoparticle properties, targeting approaches, and delivery methods, 2)
dynamic photothermal response (temperature, heat shock protein expression, and
cell injury), and 3) real-time photochemical response (reactive oxygen species
production) associated with nanoparticle-mediated laser therapies. The
versatility of holey scaffolds will enable the first measurement of dynamic
tumor response in vitro within a bioreactor system and in vivo in a mouse tumor
model. Measured tumor response will be utilized to create a novel computational
model for predicting tumor response and optimizing implementation of
nanoparticles in laser therapy.
