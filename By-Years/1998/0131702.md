The mammalian anterior pituitary gland is a major organ for neuroendocrine
function because it secretes multiple, important hormones. During development,
proteins known as transcription factors regulate activation of the genes that
encode these hormones. Two transcription factors of the LIM homeodomain group,
Lhx3 and Lhx4, are involved in the specification of the hormone-secreting cells
in the anterior pituitary. Very little is known about the biochemical mechanisms
by which these factors exert their specific gene regulatory functions. Lhx3
exists in different isoforms, which have distinct DNA-binding and gene
regulatory properties. This project uses molecular and biochemical approaches to
test the hypothesis that Lhx3 is a phosphoprotein that is modified at multiple
locations, and that phosphorylation of Lhx3 modulates its gene regulatory
properties. Lhx3 will be expressed, purified and analyzed by mass spectrometry
techniques, and modified isoforms will be changed by site-directed mutatgenesis.
The DNA binding, gene regulatory properties, involvement of intracellular
signaling pathways, and localization of these modified Lhx3 molecules will be
tested using reporter genes, constitutively active signaling enzymes and
confocal microscopy. Experiments also will test to what extent Lhx4 has similar,
but distinct, transcriptional properties to Lhx3. An important issue from
genomics is to understand how a limited number of genes can mediate the
development of complex organisms, and this study shows an example of how
multiple proteins can be generated from individual genes, and how their
functions depend on post-transcriptional regulation.&lt;br/&gt; Results will
have an impact beyond neuroendocrinology, because LIM proteins are required for
development and function of many other systems in both animals and plants.
Training and mentoring of undergraduate and graduate students also are an
integral part of this project.&lt;br/&gt;
