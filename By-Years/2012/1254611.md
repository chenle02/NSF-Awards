In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry
Program of the Chemistry Division, Neal Devaraj of the University of California,
San Diego will study catalytic coupling reactions that can drive the self-
assembly and competitive growth of phospholipid assemblies. The main research
idea is that in-situ catalytic lipid synthesis within vesicles should provide a
route to assemblies capable of selective growth and division. The experimental
approach includes studying and developing chemistries capable of generating
phospholipid in-situ, synthesizing novel catalysts that associate themselves
with specific vesicles, and monitoring vesicle competition and growth
phenomenon. Understanding the chemistry required for driving vesicle growth
would enhance our knowledge of biomimetic assemblies and could reveal chemical
mechanisms that were essential to the origin of life. The broader impacts
involve developing an educational component integrating the proposed vesicle
research with an existing K-20 outreach effort at UC San Diego. In particular,
there will be a focus on reaching populations typically underrepresented in STEM
fields. These outreach efforts will be significant in their impact on K-12 STEM
education in the San Diego area, particularly with respect to exposing a broad
range of students and teachers to origin of life and supramolecular chemistry
topics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How sets of reactive small molecules led to the
origin of life is "Grand Challenge" a problem in chemistry, and the proposed
studies seek to improve our fundamental understanding of the chemical processes
underlying this phenomenon. Knowledge generated from these studies also could
guide efforts toward the synthesis of self-replicating materials which could
lead to new types of materials with advanced properties.
