Amherst College is known for excellence in both research and teaching by its
faculty, and for providing its undergraduate students with the research
experiences normally found only at the graduate level. Amherst prides itself on
hiring faculty who are among the top researchers in the country, and so are
engaged in cutting-edge research similar to the work being done at large
research universities. An increasing number of Amherst science faculty
collaborate with researchers at other institutions, and need the very high
bandwidth and quality of service of Internet2 to collaborate effectively and
efficiently.

The College has recognized that high bandwidth connectivity is fast becoming an
essential tool for many faculty, and has committed to making improvements in the
campus infrastructure. Nevertheless, Amherst location in a rural area has hurt
the College ability to acquire cost-effective telecommunications circuits to the
main Internet and Internet2 access points. Working with the other schools in
Five Colleges, Inc., Amherst College is eager to implement a cost-effective
fiber network connecting the five institutions to Springfield, Massachusetts,
the closest point on the main telecommunications corridors. This proposed grant
will be used primarily to establish such high-performance connectivity.
