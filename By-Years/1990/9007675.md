A Rheometric Fluid Spectrometer will be acquired to support basic research in
the mechanics of suspensions, viscoelastic fluids and surfactant solutions. The
equipment will be used by several faculty members of the Levich Institute for
physico-chemical hydrodynamics and of the CUNY Physics, Mechanical Engineering
and Chemical Engineering Departments. This award will support an
interdisciplinary research effort in the areas of rheology of suspension and
two-phase flow.
