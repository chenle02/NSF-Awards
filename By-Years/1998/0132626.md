&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The Idaho EPSCoR Research Infrastructure Improvement
project invests in three research focus areas and implements a number of
initiatives to strengthen statewide human resource development and train its
21st century workforce. Idaho's three research universities, the University of
Idaho, Idaho State University and Boise State University will collaborate in
these endeavors.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The Idaho research universities will
build nationally competitive teams in the following areas: 1) nanoscale
materrials for electronics and sensor applications; 2) life at interfaces and
the biocomplexity of extreme environments; and 3) neuro-fuzzy soft computing via
silicon structures. In the nanoscale materials area, research will focus on the
ultimate suitability of various materials for device and sensor applications in
electronics, optoelectronics and magnetics. The research in life at interfaces
and the biocomplexity of extreme environments will address biochemical and
geochemical aspects of life at rock-water interfaces in extreme environments
through an interdisciplinary combination of field, laboratory and modeling
components. Neuro-fuzzy soft computing via silicon structures will address
theoretical and practical issues for developing enabling technology necessary
for cost effective neuro-fuzzy computing systems.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The
human resource development programs will add value to the project's research
focus areas through the integration of research training and student education
and through professional development of faculty. A number of activities are also
proposed for new and continuing collaborations with national laboratories and
Idaho's private sector. In addition, specific programs will address several of
the issues challenging Idaho's workforce, including the recruitment and
retention of members of underrepresented groups in research and education-
related activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
