The principal investigator will initiate a study of multiple self-intersecting
closed geodesics on hyperbolic surfaces. This will include an investigation into
a systematic method for determining the existence of permanent triple points.
The method involves the application of trace identities between matrices in
SL(2,C) representing hyperbolic isometries. Trace polynomials will also be used.
Geodesics, which may lie along surfaces, are generalizations of the concept of a
straight line. The great circles are the geodesics on a sphere. These are called
closed geodesics because they eventually retrace themselves. For many years,
geometers have studied the problem of classifying and counting the numbers of
closed geodesics on other surfaces such as the torus. The principal
investigator's project is related to this continuing study.
