This project deals with the development of a sintered silicon nitride ceramic
system having a transverse rupture strength of at least 70,000 psi at 1000oC,
densified to 99% of the theoretical density, and formed to near net shape as an
indexable cutting tool. The eventual goal is to accomplish sintering to full
density with the desired microstructure at one atmosphere of nitrogen pressure.
Certain sintering limits restrict the compositional choices. However, optimal
properties may be obtained by compositions that can be densified within the
microstructure- sintering limits. It is also possible that certain compositions
require a two-stage sintering process to achieve 99% theoretical density.
Potential benefits from this research would be a fundamental understanding of
the sintering mechanism of the silicon nitride ceramic system, and the increased
productivity and cost-savings from the use of sintered silicon nitride cutting
tools in machining gray cast iron.
