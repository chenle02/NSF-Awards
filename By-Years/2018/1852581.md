This award supports the renewal of the Physics Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of California, Davis. Each year, the
REU program will provide twelve students from around the United States an
opportunity to participate in a ten-week summer research program. REU students
work closely with a faculty mentor on a ten-week research project chosen from a
variety of physics subfields. The projects span the subfields of astrophysics,
biophysics, complex systems, condensed matter, nuclear and particle physics.
Examples of projects include efforts to understand quantum gravity, develop
photovoltaics from nanoparticles, investigate dark energy and dark matter, model
the workings of Alzheimer's disease, produce medically important radioactive
isotopes, and many more. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to their specific
research project, the students learn from their interactions with faculty,
graduate students, and other REU students, and from field trips showing physics-
related work in diverse settings. Students will visit facilities such as the
McClellan Nuclear Research Center, Lick Observatory, and the Advanced Light
Source. At the end of the program, each participant gives a formal research
presentation and presents a written project report that can lead to a peer
reviewed publication. Taken as a whole, the REU activities teach skills useful
for further scientific endeavors, give students a broad perspective on possible
future paths, and help them build a network of professional contacts. This award
is supported by the Division of Physics and the Division of Materials Research
within the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate of the National
Science Foundation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
