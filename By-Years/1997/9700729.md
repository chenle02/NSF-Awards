This project involves a physical anthropologist and a physician who will create,
in a developing country, a laboratory that is capable of using contemporary
molecular tools to study human populations, and will optimize methods for DNA
collection and market typing in this setting. The project will take place in
south India, and will benefit all involved parties by increasing our
understanding of genetic evolution in this place. The project will also serve as
a test case for similar laboratories in similar developing countries.
Investigators in a wide range of countries will have first hand involvement in
helping achieve the goals of the Human Genome Diversity Project. Through this
project's experience as a model for other countries, the goals of the Human
Genome Diversity Project will be advanced as it attempts to sample worldwide
populations in order to further our understanding of human evolution.
