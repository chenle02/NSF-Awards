General Relativity is Einstein's theory of gravity that interprets gravity as a
consequence of the curvature of spacetime. The theory predicts the existence of
black holes via solutions to the Einstein equation. The first image of a black
hole, recently obtained by astronomers using Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), has
given remarkable evidence to the accuracy of this theory. The aim of this
proposal is to investigate the geometry of space regions in general relativity,
which in particular include regions surrounding a black hole. Results from this
project will shed new light on the gravitational energy confined in a finite
region, as well as the contribution of black holes to such quasi-local energy.

In geometric terms, the PI aims at studying manifolds with non-negative scalar
curvature, with boundary. The goal is to obtain new understanding of the
interaction among scalar curvature, boundary mean curvature, interior minimal
surfaces, volume of compact manifolds, and mass of asymptotically flat
manifolds. The PI willl also establish a Poincare-type inequality on the
boundary of compact manifolds with non-negative scalar curvature. The PI will
employ geometric and analytic methods from calculus of variation and partial
differential equations to achieve these goals.
