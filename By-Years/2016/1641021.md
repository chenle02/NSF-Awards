The goal of this project is to organize a high quality workshop involving
participants from United States and India to foster synergistic research
collaboration on Smart and Connected Communities (SC2), a topic of national
importance for both countries. The SC2 workshop will be held on June 9-11, 2016
at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Delhi. It aims to bring together 12
thought leaders and visionary researchers from each of US and India to explore
collaboration on developing scientific and engineering foundations, innovative
information and communication technology (ICT) solutions to enable livable,
workable, sustainable, and connected communities with a goal to improve quality
of life.

The workshop will focus on the applications of ICT to healthcare, energy, and
disaster response and recovery. These application domains pose unique challenges
so far as physical environments, demography, social and cultural differences are
concerned. By jointly investigating them, it is possible to leverage a broad set
of distinct yet complementary scenarios, testbeds, and datasets critical for
studying a wide variety of sustainable societies that integrate ICT solutions.
This will help establish stronger US-India strategic alliance in research,
education, technology innovation, entrepreneurship, and workforce development in
order to be globally competitive.
