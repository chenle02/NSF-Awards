The purpose of this research is to develop a novel, efficient technique of
noncontacting laser phased array generation of ultrasound, for the
nondestructive evaluation (NDE) of solids and processes. The new technique uses
an array of laser beams in place of a single beam. The research will include a
basic study to evaluate the performance of and develop an analytical model for
the phased array. Specific applications to noncontact NDE on-line control of the
depth of penetration and porosity during a gas metal arc welding (GMAW) process
will be pursued. An electromagnetic acoustic transducer will be used as a
noncontact receiver. The research has five phases as follows: (1) development of
an analytical model for predicting the generation of ultrasound by a laser
phased array; (2) experimental verification of the model for the phased array;
(3) application of phased array to noncontact NDE on-line control of the depth
of weld pool penetration and porosity; (4) development of an analytical model
for propagation of sound through the weld pool; and (5) development of the data
acquisition system and algorithms. The information on weld pool penetration and
porosity extracted from the ultrasonic signal will be used in the system
feedback for the welding power-supply, current, or speed control, to achieve the
desired penetration and porosity.
