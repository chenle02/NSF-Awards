The award provides funding to help defray the expenses of U.S. participants in
"A Conference on Hilbert Function Spaces" that will be held May 20-24, 2013, in
Gargnano, Italy, at a facility that belongs to the University of Milan.

This event is intended to furnish a venue in which the relevant international
mathematical community is able to assess the "state of the art" in an important
and active area of mathematics. The theory of Hilbert function spaces lies at
the crossroads of complex analysis and operator theory, with emerging ties to
other disciplinary areas (e.g., probability). The participants include most of
the recognized world leaders in the area. The conference program provides ample
opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to
present their work.
