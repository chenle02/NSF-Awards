Stereolithography: A Distributed Partnership Stereolithography has become a
powerful industrial tool in reducing the manufacturing lead time from design
conceptualization to product realization. It has begun appearing in engineering
and technology curricula only recently. One objective of the project is to
enable Rowan's engineering students to rapidly produce designs working with
their technology team partners at Camden County College. This activity is
centered around the creation of a stereolithography center. Freshmen engineering
students develop product designs in their engineering clinic course, but are
generally unable to fabricate them since conventional processes require high
degrees of skill and long cycle times. Stereolithography allows any 3-d model
developed on a computer to be produced by successively solidifying layers of
resin using a laser beam. Engineering students can now ascertain the design
complexity and assess the functional requirements. Technology students now have
access to a state-of-the-art manufacturing capability that complements their
training in computer integrated manufacturing and laser technology. The second
objective of the project was to bring technology and engineering students
together in project teams. This represents the real work environment that
students will face after graduation. By placing the stereolithography equipment
at Camden County College, Rowan's engineering students must interact with the
technology students by remote access to produce prototypes of their designs. The
remote access is provided by video teleconferencing combined with distributed
computing using a networked design package. This innovative approach will better
prepare both engineering and technology students to adapt to a rapidly changing
work place.
