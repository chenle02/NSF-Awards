This award provides funds for the acquisition of a gas chromatograph and
combustion line to be interfaced with a stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer
in the Department of Environmental Sciences at the University of Virginia. The
new instrumental system will enable the determination of nitrogen and carbon
isotopic compositions of the individual molecular components of mixtures of
complex organic compounds. Such analytical capabilities offers enhanced
interpretation of the source and history of organic material preserved in the
natural fossil record and will be used in geological, biological, and
anthropological research.
