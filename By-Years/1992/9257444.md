This NYI award will support the research of a promising and accomplished young
investigator. His research will include research and development of Gas
Microstrip Detectors for use in Elementary Particle Physics experiments at the
SSC and B factories, and analysis of data obtained with these detectors,
particularly decays of the b quark at the Cornell Electron Storage Ring.
