This award addresses several key research problems in an Integrated Multi-Robot
System (IMRS). The principal investigator will develop IMRS communications
architectures, particularly emphasizing the real-time performance and
interactions among industrial processes; develop rigorous, objective methods for
the assignment and scheduling of control tasks among the processors in the IMRS;
and investigate the fault-tolerance of the IMRS by pairing tasks. This includes
determining the information exchanged between paired tasks, the frequency of
these exchanges, determining the required health management tasks, and providing
graceful degradation of the system as processors and devices fail.
