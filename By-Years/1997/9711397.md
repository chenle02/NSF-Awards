This technology development project deals with acoustic travel- time current
meters (ACMs) that are widely used in oceanography and the atmospheric sciences
to measure boundary layer turbulence. These sensors infer velocity by measuring
the difference in time required for acoustic pulses to travel both ways between
opposing transducers separated by a distance L. The response of such a device to
turbulence having spatial scales equal to or smaller than L should be
attenuated, and a simple model of the ACM response function based on this idea
has been known for almost 30 years. However, recent field and laboratory
measurements of the spatial response of ultrasonic ACMs to turbulence in water
show that measured velocities are less attenuated than this simple model
predicts. Research will be conducted to test whether anomalous behavior of ACMs
is due either to flow distortion or to spatial variations in the amplitude and
phase of the acoustic field, and to distinguish between these alternatives. It
is expected that an improved understanding of the spatial response of ACMs will
considerably enhance their usefulness as turbulence sensors in the ocean, and
should lead to improved sensor design and performance.
