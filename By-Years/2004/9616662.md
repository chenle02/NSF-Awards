9616662 Heath White whales endure oxygen deficits, extreme cold and pressure,
and rapid changes in pressure when they perform repeated prolonged breathhold
dives to greater than 1800 feet. This study will examine how these factors
affect important body functions such as heartbeat, circulation and oxygen
delivery to tissues. Of particular interest are specific adaptations that allow
the whales to perform such dives repeatedly without incurring any harmful
physiological side-effects.
