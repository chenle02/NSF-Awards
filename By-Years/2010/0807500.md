The supported research will improve on previous variability studies of quasars
in the optical regime using the SDSS (Sloan Digital Sky Survey). It will
assemble a large database of two million measurements for 80,000 SDSS quasars,
to generate well-sampled light curves for 2,600 quasars over an eight year
baseline. This will be used to develop a detailed statistical description of
quasar variability. The research will unify several families of models for
variability into a single comprehensive model and compare the results to the
observations. This study will impact our understanding of the regions close to
supermassive black holes and of the mechanisms of quasar emission.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts include provision of a "science ready"
public database of quasar variability, training of students, and a public
outreach web site devoted to this research.
