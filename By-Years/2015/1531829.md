The proposed project will bring together researchers in a workshop to be held
April 22-24, 2015 at the Holiday Inn, Arlington, Virginia. The Workshop will
address research areas of a wide range of non-graphene 2D atomic layers such as
hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), transition metal di-chalcogenides, tertiary
compounds of carbo-nitrides and complex oxides, as well as their applications in
various devices. It will allow scientific exchanges among leading scientists
working on graphene and beyond graphene 2D materials and devices from Europe and
the United States to help promote future collaborations and address common
challenges. The Workshop is expected to play a key role in addressing in detail
currently faced bottlenecks in 2D material and device research and identifying
new directions for research. The research discussed at the Workshop is expected
to lead to technological breakthroughs and disruptive technologies that can have
great societal impact in the future in many areas such as sensing,
communications and health.
