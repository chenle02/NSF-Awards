Interest in solid state chemistry has undergone explosive growth in recent years
due to the broadly based recognition of the technological importance and
scientific challenges involved in the discovery and study of new materials, and
due to the influx of scientists from other disciplines who see the opportunities
for performing exciting research in this area. This Symposium on Solid State
Chemistry is a one-day symposium on Solid-State Chemistry to be held as part of
the Mid-Atlantic Regional Meeting of the American Chemical Society to be held in
Princeton NJ June 8-11, 2003. The goal of the conference is to facilitate
collaborations and information exchange across a broad spectrum of researchers
with interests in solid-state chemistry areas that include novel synthetic
methods, crystal chemistry, electronic and magnetic properties, dielectrics and
ferroelectrics, nanomaterials, solid state ionics, and new materials. The NSF
funds will be used to defray the expenses of students, post-docs, and junior
faculty attending the symposium.&lt;br/&gt;%%% &lt;br/&gt;The Solid State
Chemistry community continues to have direct impact on technological advances of
high significance to society by designing new materials for energy, electronics
and photonics, including the design and construction of novel 'biosolids' such
as biomolecules in sol-gels as sensor materials.&lt;br/&gt;*** &lt;br/&gt;
