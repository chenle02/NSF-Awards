0244305 Speer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A theoretical study of acoustic propagation
in the Southern Ocean and an in-situ test will be conducted to help determine
the experimental parameters needed to plan future field work. The results will
also be of some fundamental interest since so little is known about large-scale
acoustical propagation of signals relevant to float tracking in the Southern
Ocean. Future observational studies of the role of small-scale (subgrid scale)
processes in the Southern Ocean, the transports they produce, and their effect
on the larger scale circulation will involve a combination of measurement
techniques, including Lagrangian techniques, because these have played a key
role constraining lateral eddy fluxes. Floats have also been deployed to support
both lateral and diapycnal studies with deliberately released tracers, in a
variety of environments. Acoustically tracked floats have not, however,
previously been used in large-scale experiments in the Southern Ocean, outside
of the Agulhas-Benguela current system just north of the ACC (and still within
the subtropics). Questions of dispersion, for sampling requirements, and sound
propagation, for float tracking, need to be answered to be able to proceed
reasonably with experiment design. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
