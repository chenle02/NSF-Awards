The goal of this research is to develop a methodology for programming in Prolog,
the most developed programming language based on logic programming, in order to
build moderately sized software. The methodology will be based on recognizing
the key programming cliches and basic building blocks of writing Prolog, and,
more importantly, providing methods and tools for combining building blocks into
complicated programs.
