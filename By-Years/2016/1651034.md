The North American monsoon (NAM) brings much-needed rain to the U.S. Southwest
and northeastern Mexico, sustaining agriculture, urban areas, and the unique
biome of the Sonoran Desert. This project aims to clarify the response of the
NAM to climatic changes in the past, in hopes of improving predictions of future
climate change in the region. Specifically, this project will reconstruct past
changes in the intensity of the NAM through use of the hydrogen isotopic
composition of leaf waxes deposited in sediments from the Gulf of California and
the Mexican Margin. The research will focus on understanding the response of the
monsoon to globally cool periods such as glaciations, and regionally warm
periods such as those caused by seasonal changes in solar insolation. The
paleoclimate data will be synthesized with output from climate modeling
simulations to understand the mechanisms of climate change in the NAM
region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will employ a tiered mentoring system
to engage a postdoctoral associate, graduate students, undergraduates, and high
school students in elements of the research. This will be facilitated by a
partnership with the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum (ASDM), whose educational
mission complements the research goals of this project. High school students
participating in the ASDM Junior Docent program will be directly involved in the
proposed research through the Desert Museum Plant Wax Project, a modern study of
plant waxes that will provide context for our paleoclimate interpretations. The
research team will also work with ASDM staff and the Junior Docents to develop a
Sonoran Desert Climate Change Kit, which will be presented by the teen docents
to the general public visitors of the Museum. Additionally, the Principal
Investigator will continue to give public lectures at the Museum concerning
Sonoran climate and climate change.
