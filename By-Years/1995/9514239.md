Abstract 9514239 Klessig Salicylic acid (SA) has been found to play an
important role in the activation of defense responses against microbial attack
in plants. This laboratory has identified a SA binding protein, which is a
catalase, and its activity is blocked by SA. The hypothesis to be tested is that
increased levels of H2O2 and other reactive oxygen species induce plant
resistance (PR) genes (PR . In this proposal experiments will be done to study
the role of catalase and ascorbate peroxidase (another H202 degrading enzyme)
inhibition by SA, as well as he induction of PR gene resistant genes. The time
course of the levels of SA, H2O2 and PR mRNA will be determined at the sites of
infection. Plants made transgenic by the introduction of the nahG gene, which
codes for the enzyme that breaks down salicylic acid will be examined and
compared in a number of way to the wild type plants. Transgenic plants with
suppressed levels of catalase or ascorbate peroxidase, made by introducing
antisense to these enzymes will also be examined. These experiments will provide
information on how salicyclic acids acts in the plant defense response. ***
