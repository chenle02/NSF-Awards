9314736 Castro This Americas Program award will support attendance of a group of
Latin American shorebird biologists to a conference on shorebird research. The
purpose of the conference is to review recent findings and determine priorities
for shorebird research and management in the Western Hemisphere. Coordinators
for the conference, which will be held in Ottawa, Canada, October 1994, are Dr.
Gonzalo Castro and Dr. Julie Sibbing, of the Western Hemisphere Shorebird
Reserve Network. Other coordinators include representatives from Canada, Mexico,
Peru and Argentina. The conference will include presentations of papers by
researchers and managers, and working group sessions for developing conclusions
and recommendations. Most species of shorebirds depend upon wetlands as sources
of food throughout their annual cycle of extensive, interhemispheric migrations.
Wetlands in the Americas continue to be drained, or otherwise rendered
unsuitable for use by the birds at a rapid pace, resulting in a precarious
relationship between them and their habitats. This serious loss of shorebirds
habitats across the hemisphere has generated conservation research efforts aimed
at the protection of the species. However, successful conservation programs
demand information-sharing and cooperation among the nations that host the
species during their travels. This conference presents an opportunity for
interaction among researchers of the Western Hemisphere and provides a forum for
discussions of the latest findings in shorebird migration, ecology and
conservation. ***
