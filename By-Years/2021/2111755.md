The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of a system to improve
detection of infectious diseases, such as Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and
Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). The proposed project advances a low-cost, efficient
system for robust point-of-care blood tests. The end result is a device that can
process blood into a sample for improved blood-based diagnostic
testing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
Phase II project will enable a magnetic-bead based separation assay to achieve
low-complexity and rapid blood-plasma separation in a resource-independent form
factor for clinical settings. Blood testing is currently limited to centralized
testing labs due to the requirements of centrifugation, a key first step in most
diagnostic testing. However, centrifuges are not suitable for use at the point-
of-care and represent a bottleneck. This Phase II effort will explore the design
and development of a new kind of blood collection tube capable of performing
sample collection and sample processing in one form factor. The Phase II effort
will demonstrate the benefit of the underlying technology for companion use with
commercially existing point-of-care blood-based diagnostic tests for Human
Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). This will be validated
by comparison&lt;br/&gt;of enriched plasma obtained with the magnetic bead
separation assay with a conventional centrifugation
process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
