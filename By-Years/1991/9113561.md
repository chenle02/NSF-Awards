This is a Phase II proposal. In Phase I, PI established the feasibility of, and
wrote programs for data retrieval. The programs make public health data,
including teenage pregnancy data, collected by the State of California
accessible to resear- chers using standard SPSS and SAS analytic packages. Phase
II proposal is to continue developing the retrieval and archiving packages, to
make them operate more efficiently, to develop search and retrieval software,
and to create documentation and user manuals. They document a variety of follow-
on funding, contracts, and agreements.
