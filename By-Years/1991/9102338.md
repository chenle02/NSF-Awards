This grant partially supports the planning, organization, and conduct of the
Southwestern Regional Symposium on Applied Computing (SAC91). The symposium is
co- sponsored by ten regional universities, ACM, IEEE-CS, and private industry.
SAC'91 is unusual in several respects: it is a vehicle for technology outreach
between research institutions and teaching institutions in the area; it provides
nationally recognized speakers in a regional conference setting thus allowing
greater interaction with students; it draws many of its student participants
from institutions with significant Native American and minority populations
underrepresented in science and engineering. This is the fifth annual symposium
on applied computing; it has increased awareness of the technology potential of
the region and increased interaction between the supporting institutions in the
region.
