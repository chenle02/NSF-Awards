Abstract Senkan CTS-9508454 The PI proposes to explore a new flow reactor
process aimed at the synthesis of fullerenes and other related materials. This
process will exploit the highly exoergic reactions between halogenated carbons
such as CCl4, C6Cl6 (perchlorobenzene) and C10Cl8 (perchloro-naphthalene) and
the Group IA and IIA metals. The PI claims that the innovative aspect of the
proposed research lies in the use of completely halogenated starting materials,
thus avoiding hydrogen in the feedstocks and the supposedly deleterious effects
of hydrogen on the yields of fullerenes and fullerene derivatives. Because
simple salts such as MgCl2 and NaCl are produced as by-products, purification of
the resulting fullerenes should be relatively simple. Furthermore, since the
flow reactor process is envisioned as being continuous, scale-up should be
straight forward and easy. The PI has requested funding for 12 months to explore
the technical feasibility of the proposed process.
