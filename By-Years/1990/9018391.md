The Reunion hot spot has been active over at least the past 70 M.y. and has
left its mark on the Indian and African tectonic plates of the Indian Ocean. On
the African plate, the Mascarene ridge is coincident with a significant positive
geoid anomaly, similar to the Hawaiian swell, indicating that the apparent
compensation of the topographic load is deep in the lithosphere or
asthenosphere. Utilizing a French research vessel based in the Indian Ocean, the
PI will make appropriate heat flow measurements to determine the extent to which
the deep compensation may be explained by a static thermal anomaly, or whether
it is primarily dynamic support as a result of active mantle convection, as the
Hawaiian hot spot now appears. The heat flow and other geophysical fields will
be modeled with numerical methods.
