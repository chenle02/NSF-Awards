This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project will develop a
reliable prototype of a novel, compact and low cost solar air conditioning
system for hot and humid climates. The system will consist of an air-cooled
single effect absorption machine driven by an array of high performance flat
plate collectors and a thermal storage tank. A microncontroller based control
system will allow an optimal system operation. The capacity of the system is
projected to be in the range of 3-5 cooling tons.

The marketing, manufacturing, installation, and product development of the
proposed technology is envisioned as a partnership of three small businesses
dedicated to: installation of A/C systems, marketing and manufacturing of solar
collectors, and to research.
