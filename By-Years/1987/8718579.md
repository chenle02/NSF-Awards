The goal of this proposal is to understand in molecular mechanical terms how
ribosomes and the macromolecules that interact with them function to form
proteins. Specifically, the proposed research is to determine how tRNAs and mRNA
move in relation to each other and to ribosomal structural components during the
reaction steps by which peptides are elongated on ribosomes. The appraoch is to
bind fluorescently labeled tRNAs or mRNA to labeled or unlabeled ribosomes, then
to measure various physical changes before and after completion of a specific
reaction of the peptide elongation cycle. Probes are covalently attached at
specific known sites on tRNA, mRNA analogues, ribosomal proteins and ribosomal
RNA. The latter are reassembled into functionally competent ribosomes. All
proteins are formed on ribosomes with mRNA and tRNA by a mechanism that appears
to be similar for all organisms. Thus, knowledge of ribosome structure and
function is fundamental to an understanding of how proteins, which catalyze the
myriad reactions that occur in living systems, are formed at the molecular
level.
