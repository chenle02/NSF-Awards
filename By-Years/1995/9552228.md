The chemistry department is creating a computer-interfaced chemistry laboratory.
The objective for the project is to strengthen chemical principles recognition
by (1) simplifying data collection and (2) simplifying methods for representing
relationships from the data. The revisions provide an avenue for open-ended
experiments and experimental design which, in turn, foster critical thinking
skills. The college is purchasing 12 MacIntosh laptop computers linked to the
campus' instructional computing network for greater software availability, a TI
Graph link for each computer to allow the students to transfer data for
calculations at home, Labworks computer interface package to allow data
acquisition, and a printer for hard copies of data, graphs, and reports. The
lap-top computers allow other science labs, such as physics and physical
science, to have access the equipment. The project also takes the equipment into
area high schools to demonstrate a computer-interfaced lab.
