The research proposed here seeks the answer to one of the
fundamental&lt;br/&gt;questions about our understanding of matter; i.e. is there
any new physics&lt;br/&gt;beyond the Standard Model of electroweak physics. The
QWEAK experiment at&lt;br/&gt;Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility
addresses this question by&lt;br/&gt;measuring the proton's weak charge via
parity-violating electron scattering&lt;br/&gt;at very low momentum transfer.
The proton's weak charge, which is its&lt;br/&gt;coupling to the neutral Z
boson, has a well-defined prediction in the&lt;br/&gt;Standard Model; and a
precise measurement of this charge is sensitive&lt;br/&gt;to many popular
scenarios for extending the Standard Model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The
Virginia Tech group is responsible for an essential component of
the&lt;br/&gt;particle tracking system, two sets of drift chambers. This system
is&lt;br/&gt;required in order to precisely measure the kinematics of
elastically&lt;br/&gt;electrons, as well as for critical studies of experimental
backgrounds.&lt;br/&gt;Participation by one graduate student and two
undergraduate students&lt;br/&gt;under the supervision of a faculty participant
and funded by this grant&lt;br/&gt;will provide essential resources for timely
completion of this project,&lt;br/&gt;and will substantially enhance their
educational experience and training. &lt;br/&gt;
