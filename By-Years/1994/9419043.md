9419043 Rader This project supported under the technology Development activity
area of the Technology Reinvestment Project (TRP), is designed to develop
processes for the manufacturing of micro surgical knives. Bulk wet etching of
silicon has been well developed, and recent research interest has focused on
fabricating structural components using semiconductor processing technology. In
the intermediate size scale of the proposed surgical scalpels (larger than
integrated circuit features, smaller than traditionally machined components),
silicon is not a structural material. Previous research has shown the potential
for bulk forming structural shapes from harder ceramic materials such as
sapphire. The potential gains from the development of processing for both
commercial and defense related structures will be examined herein. %%% The
objective of the TRP is to stimulate the transition to a growing, integrated,
national industrial capability which provides the most advanced, affordable,
military systems and the most competitive commercial products. TRP programs are
structured to expand high quality employment opportunities in commercial and
dual-use technologies, manufacturing and technology assistance to small firms,
and education and training programs that enhance US manufacturing skills and
target displaced defense industry workers. This specific project is a joint
venture between the personnel at the Storz Ophthalmic Instruments Company and
the Microsurgery Advanced Design Laboratory, Johns Hopkins Hospital. ***
