Since 1983, the National Science Foundation (NSF), in cooperation with other
agencies, has funded the Japanese Technology Evaluation Center (JTEC). Its
purpose is to assess the status and trends of Japanese research and development
in selected technologies, thus contributing to enhanced scientific and
technological cooperation between the United States and Japan. JTEC assessments
are performed by panels of U.S. technical experts from industry, academia, and
government and are based on analysis of public literature and extensive tours of
Japanese laboratories. The focus of the assessments is on the status and long-
term direction of Japanese R&amp;D efforts relative to those in the United
States. Panel findings are disseminated by workshops where participants critique
the preliminary findings, professional journal articles, conferences, and
reports available from the National Technical Information Service (NTIS). This
proposal describes a plan for study of Japanese and European R&amp;D in six more
technologies. The detailed research will be done by six expert panels that will
analyze foreign literature, visit foreign laboratories, and present their
findings in workshops and in technical reports.
