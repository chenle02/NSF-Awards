The focus of this research is the synthesis of cell-surface glycoconjugates
using as building blocks aluminoxy-acetals and related asymmetric ketals. The
methodology allows for the preparation of complex carbohydrate sequences and
thus, the ultimate synthesis of inhibitors of the glycoprotein processing
enzymes found in the Golgi apparatus. %%% With this award, the Synthetic Organic
Program is supporting the research of Dr. Robin L. Polt of the Department of
Chemistry at the University of Arizona. Professor Polt will focus his work on
the chemical synthesis of novel cell-surface glycoconjugates, compounds that can
be used as biochemical tools for the study of membranes and Golgi apparatus
function.
