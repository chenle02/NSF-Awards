This project will conduct spatial, thermal, and compositional analyses of fluid
inclusions in plutonic samples from Ocean Drilling Project core 735B and a suite
of metaplutonic and diabase samples recovered from the Atlantis II fracture
zone. Microthermometric results of fracture-bound fluids in these ductily-
deformed and hydrothermally altered rocks will be used to develop a model for
fracture-fluid evolution in the high- temperature root zones of submarine
hydrothermal systems associated with slow spreading environments.
