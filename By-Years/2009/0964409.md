This project studies higher-level abstractions for constructing distributed
systems that integrate information and computation across administrative and
trust domains. Current practice does not offer general, principled techniques
for implementing these systems securely. To develop these techniques,
fundamental problems of security, consistency, performance, and system evolution
are being explored. Problems studied include automatic, adaptive, secure
partitioning of programs and data across the nodes of a distributed system; new
authorization logics for efficiently managing trust relationships in a
distributed system; new methods for increasing performance of distributed
systems while guaranteeing strong data consistency; and new ways to securely and
consistently evolve the structure of persistent information.

These topics are being studied in the context of Fabric, a new platform for
secure distributed computation. Fabric is intended to support secure integration
of information systems, a valuable capability for many application domains,
including in medicine, finance, education, government, and the military. For
example, good methods for integrating distributed information systems would
support secure sharing of medical records between institutions.
