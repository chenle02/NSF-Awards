9360683 Eraslan MELTER-ISV Simulator will be developed as the industry-standard
computational model for simulating in-situ vitrification (ISV) process that are
currently being considered as alternative remedation technologies for hazard-
waste sited. The advanced state-of-the-art computational model will be able to
simulate the transient, three-dimensional, chemically reacting, multi-
constituent-material, multi-phase solid, liquid, gas (vapor) convection-flow and
heat-transfer conditions in the melt and in the surrounding ground, during ISV
processes. Therefore, it will be able to predict, accurately, the detailed
geometry of the molten ground-material, that can be generated during a site-
specific ISV process, and consequently, whether or not, the planned site-
specific remedial action program can actually stabilize and immobilize, by
encapsulation, the contaminants at the hazardous-waste site. MELTER-ISV
Simulator will establish the urgently needed computational analysis capability
for the emerging ISV technology, which can be used by the regulatory agencies,
in industry, in the engineering-design and planning of site-specific ISV
systems, that can be implemented, costs effective, as remedial action programs
for hazardous waste sites in the USA and around the world. ***
