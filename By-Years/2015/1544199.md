This research addresses the science of Cyber-Physical Systems. In a multi-agent
system, each agent is faced with the task of making decisions taking account of
the objectives and actions of other agents, as well as the dynamics of the
environment. In such a distributed system each agent receives measurements of
its environment, and must infer both the state of the world as well as that of
the other agents. The intellectual merits of this research are that it develops
new efficient techniques for this information processing, which achieve run-time
performance using algorithms that have low computational requirements. The
project's broader significance and importance are that it will provide new
mathematical and computational tools for use in many engineering applications,
including the power grid, transportation networks, and other multi-agent
systems, and will be transitioned to practice through professional activities
such as workshops, development of educational material for graduates,
undergraduates and teenagers, and outreach to industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
underlying mathematical and computation tools for this research are based on new
methods for statistical filtering in a dynamic setting. One of the most
important techniques for the design of software control systems constructs state
estimates which are sufficient statistics for the associated decision problem.
However, conventional approaches to sufficient statistics and state estimation
do not apply to the multi-agent setting. Recent results have given new
sufficient statistics for this setting, and the research develops the theory and
algorithms to allow these statistics to be used for multi-agent control of
cyber-physical systems.
