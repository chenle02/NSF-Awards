This project involves the use of Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) to acquire and
analyze high-quality digital spectra and images obtained with existing
spectrographs and telescopes. Student project work using these upgraded
instruments are done in both the optics laboratory and the observatory. Two
scientific-grade CCD detector systems, the Star I/Series 300 system, from
Photometrics Ltd. of Tucson, Arizona are used. These systems have been added to
existing moderate-and high-resolution spectrographs and to a 56-cm telescope.
This upgrade in detector capability provides students with the experience of (1)
working with state-of-the-art instruments of the type now commonly found in many
optics laboratories and observatories, and (2) carrying out quantitative
analysis of the data obtained with these instruments using sophisticated image
processing software. The outcome of this program is a greatly enhanced lab
experience for students in physics and astronomy. The college is matching the
award in with an equal amount of funds.
