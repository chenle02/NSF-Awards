The objective of this grant is to purchase a Geometry Profiling System
(Roundness Tester) which will be dedicated to support research in engineering.
This piece of metrology equipment will be used in a research project seeking to
specify dimensional inspection techniques and guidelines for the measurement of
cylindrical features with Coordinate Measuring Machines (CMM's). CMM's have the
potential to provide a wealth of information on manufactured part geometry.
However, for the metrologist, this technology brings a host of problems related
to the methodology, quality and interpretation of measurements. The goal of this
research project is to develop a set of guidelines designed to assist CMM
operators in selecting appropriate measurement strategies for the verification
of cylindrical feature tolerances. Within this project, the Roundness Tester
will be used to generate polar chart of form errors characteristics of common
cylindrical feature machining processes. The data will then be processed to
extract dominant harmonic terms of these errors in order to build stochastic
error models for form errors. The stochastic models will then be used to
generate data for a simulation module designed to help make inferences on the
performance of various inspection strategies.
