This project will study how to engineer modern spectrum sharing systems.
Wireless spectrum is now recognized as a key national resource that has to be
managed appropriately to support innovation and economic growth. Traditional
wireless rules were written by a combination of lawyers and engineers in legal
English, and read/interpreted by lawyers and engineers. The emerging revolution
in wireless regulation is that the core rules will be embedded in automated
Spectrum Access Systems (SASs) that are implemented in a combination of
hardware, software, and interaction protocols. Moreover, the SASs will support
diverse wireless systems ranging from legacy federal users to traditional
cellular carriers to emerging new innovative wireless systems. The ideas
developed in this project will be disseminated to industry as well as brought
into the classroom, including our new Masters of Engineering courses aimed at
educating innovative technical leaders. The project will also broaden
participation in the technical workforce by mentoring students from
underrepresented groups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At its technical core, this
project will help create a modern theory of how to make scalable and robust SASs
by bringing together a combination of software engineering, mathematical
wireless theory, as well as an understanding of the policy tradeoffs that we
want to support. The key realization is that making scalable systems is about
robustly approximating what we want in a safe manner while supporting
flexibility. Ideas from virtualization, software-defined-networking, and cloud
computing will play an important role. In addition to getting a handle on what
the overall architecture should be of our SAS-enabled wireless future, the
project will also take insights and embody them into easy-to-use prototype tools
that can be adapted by federal regulators and spectrum managers to explore and
navigate the design tradeoffs.
