The investigators improve specification of the topside electron density and ion
composition, using the International Reference Ionosphere (IRI) model.
Investigating the global and temporal variations of previously determined
topside model parameters, they establish a functional description of these
variations in terms of universal time, local time, season, solar cycle, magnetic
activity and geographic and geomagnetic coordinates. Using incoherent scatter
data, they investigate the profile shape near the F peak, an activity necessary
in merging the new topside model with F peak models applied in IRI. In addition,
they study global and temporal variation patterns of characteristic topside ion
composition parameters; like the upper transition height, where ion gas consists
to equal parts of light ions and atomic oxygen ions, and the ratio of ionized
helium to ionized hydrogen. The ultimate goal of these systematic evaluations is
to establish parameters that are most influential in different altitude regimes
and the underlying physics.
