Research on Result Synthesis in a Distributed Artificial Intelligence
Environment The goal of this study is to propose a systematic approach to
synthesize solutions from a set of heterogeneous intelligent agents with
overlapping expertise. A dichotomous classification problem will be examined to
demonstrate how multiple inductive agents can work cooperatively to solve a
problem. First, a comparative analysis of various inductive methods, including
statistical and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques will be conducted. This
is followed by an in-depth investigation of how the differences in sample
characteristics (i.e., normality, linearity, etc.) affect the performance of
each inductive method to establish a foundation for result integration. The
concepts and procedures developed in meta-analysis statistics will be used to
combine results. The research will facilitate true cooperation in a DAI
environment by introducing computational models that promote negotiation through
cooperation rather than competition. The incorporation of the models is expected
to improve the overall performance and enhance the consistency and validity of a
DAI system.
