0922970&lt;br/&gt;Tanner&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law
111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds from this grant will support the acquisition
of a powder x-ray diffract meter (XRD) to support research and research training
at Le Moyne University. Studies requiring mineral phase identification will be
supported by the requested XRD including PI research on Mesozoic paleoclimate,
soil development and novel organo-metal complexes. Undergraduate student
training in XRD methods and research will better prepare them for careers in
industry that require knowledge of modern materials characterization techniques
or prepare them for future graduate education requiring analytical
skills.&lt;br/&gt;
