Title: 55° North, 55° South: Effects of global climate change on prehistoric
coastal populations and marine ecosystems of the eastern pacific

The archaeological records of the Northeast Pacific and Tierra del Fuego
coastlines are well known and provide data critical to understanding the effects
of climate change on humans and the marine ecosystems they relied upon. Using
thousands of fish, bird, sea mammal and shellfish samples from archaeological
sites spanning 5000 years in both regions, stable isotopes of carbon, nitrogen
and oxygen will be used to investigate the effects of climate change on marine
ecosystems in 100-500 year time scales. These data will be correlated with
extant data from archaeological, ice core, pollen, and lake core records to
investigate the effects of ecosystem disruptions on human adaptive strategies,
the long-term dynamics of marine ecosystems, and marine responses to global and
regional climatic events. The data will reveal important long-term relationships
between overall marine productivity, oceanic food webs, and climatic change
while human responses to these changes will be studied through changes in
settlement and demographic patterns, socio-political organization and adaptive
strategies. This project is the first comparison of ecosystem and paleoclimate
change and human responses to these changes between the sub-Arctic and sub-
Antarctic regions. The long-term records can be applied to better understanding
how to insure the future of fisheries and the fishing communities themselves in
both these areas.
