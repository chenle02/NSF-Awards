Lauraceae, the avocado family, are one of the most common tree families in wet
forests of Madagascar. Its species provide local people with timber and spices,
while its fruits are an important food source for the endemic lemurs. In spite
of this importance, the taxonomy of Lauraceae in Madagascar is very poorly
known. The proposed project will result in a floristic treatment of Malagasy
Lauraceae and will thus make the species of this family accessible to other
botanists, foresters, zoologists and other interested scientists. Results of
this project will also be incorporated in a study of generic boundaries and
relationships of Lauraceae on a worldwide basis.
