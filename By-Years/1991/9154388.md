The use of economic sanctions as instruments of foreign policy is a time
honored practice. However, as the continuing debate about the use of sanctions
by the United States against nations such as South Africa and Iraq demonstrates,
there is little agreement about the effectiveness of sanctions. In some places
at some times sanctions appear to have produced desirable results; in other
places and other times they have not. Previous research on the topic is
inconclusive, in part because none of the existing studies has undertaken
systematic and rigorous assessments of the use of sanctions in different
contexts and under varying conditions. This very promising Minority Research
Initiation planning grant will support preliminary research on the conditions
under which economic sanctions are likely to be more or less effective. The
planning grant will support an exhaustive review of the literature, a survey of
extant data sources, and development of a systematic research design for
conducting further research on this important topic. When completed this project
should provide the basic for launching a systematic and rigorous study of the
efficacy of economic sanctions as instruments of foreign policy. //
