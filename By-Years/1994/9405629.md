9405629 Lamb This research will investigate the behavior of fluids in the system
H2O-CO2-CH4-NaCl in the range 400-750 oC and 0.5- 2.0 kb. The ternary subsystems
will have priority for study before research on the quaternary system is
initiated. The experiments will utilize synthetically produced fluid inclusion
to trap samples of fluids at controlled temperatures and pressures. The ultimate
objective is to arrive at an empirical relationship from which the molar volume
of a fluid can be predicted for specified P-T-X conditions. The results will
ultimately find application in studies of the formation and evolution of many
base and precious metal ore deposits, the development of metamorphic mineral
assemblages and the transfer of heat during metamorphism, igneous processes such
as partial metling, and diagenesis.
