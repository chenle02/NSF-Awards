This project lies at the intersection of several fields of mathematics:
representation theory, classical and quantum integrable systems, mathematical
physics, combinatorics, and enumerative algebraic geometry. Representation
theory is the study of symmetries of a vector space such as a three-dimensional
Euclidean space (or more generally, an infinite dimensional space) endowed with
additional important structures. Such symmetries often arise in families encoded
by algebraic objects like groups, Lie algebras, or algebras. One important class
of algebras that arise in this way is the class of so-called affinized quantum
groups. These algebras have been inspiring active research and interactions
between mathematics and physics since the 1980s. The main goals of this project
are to resolve important questions intrinsic to the affine nature of affinized
quantum groups. The project will enhance our understanding of their internal
algebraic structures and establish novel connections to the above fields. In
addition, the project will have an educational impact through the training and
mentoring of students at various levels from high school to graduate school.

In more detail, the project will develop new methods in the study of quantum
loop groups with applications to geometric representation theory, integrable
systems, mathematical physics, and quantum cluster algebras. Building on recent
results, the PI will pursue research in five related areas, with specific goals
in each. These research areas are unified by the general notion of duality and
the use of the "shuffle algebra approach." The rough plan is as follows: 1.
Develop key structures of quantum affine and toroidal algebras; 2. Continue the
study of quantized Coulomb branches; 3. Continue work on integrable spin chains;
4. Develop a new approach to finite quantum groups and their integral forms that
allows for arbitrary roots of unity, as well as a modular theory, thus
generalizing and unifying the classical work of DeConcini-Kac-Procesi; and 5.
Provide a rigorous mathematical formulation and proof of the BPS/CFT
correspondence for A(n)-type quiver gauge theories in string theory,
generalizing the known results for the A(1)-quiver.
