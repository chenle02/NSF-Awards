Project Title: Development of Ship-Borne Atmosphere-Ocean Ozone Flux
Measurements by the Eddy Correlation Technique&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs
propose to build and deploy a sensitive, fast response ozone analyzer to
quantify air-sea ozone fluxes. This experiment will complement established
technologies for ECM from a ship platform. In addition to the testing of this
new technique, concurrent chemical, physical, and biological ocean water
measurements will offer an opportunity to investigate the variations and
biological dependencies of ocean ozone fluxes. This research will result in a
future program for the study of the magnitude and controls of ozone deposition
to oceans and freshwater lakes and will also provide new data for elucidating
the formation of secondary volatile organic compounds that are released as a
result of reactions between atmospheric oxidants, such as ozone, with the
organic microlayer covering the ocean surface. Ozone deposition data will be
incorporated in surface-atmosphere gas exchanges models and atmospheric
chemistry and transport models for better descriptions and forecasts of global
atmospheric composition and climate. This research addresses several research
needs identified in the surface ocean lower atmosphere study.&lt;br/&gt;
