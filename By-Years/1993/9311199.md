HONJO 9311199 The scientific team on this project, consisting of researchers
from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Oregon State University, Brown
University, will conduct a series of field studies during the Arabian Sea
Process Study (ASPS) to determine fluxes of particulate in the water column, at
the sediment-water interface, and within the topmost sediments of the seafloor.
To measure particle fluxes in the water column, the team will deploy several
sediment traps at various depths at five mooring stations located along a
transect from the highly productive western margin of the Arabian Sea to the
relatively oligotrophic central basin. Similarly, to measure depositional fluxes
at the seafloor and burial rates, a program of high-quality sediment coring and
carbon 14 dating will be conducted at the same five stations. This work will
provide fundamental data on fluxes within the Arabian Sea Study area as well as
samples of trap and coring particulate matter useful to other ASPS
investigators.
