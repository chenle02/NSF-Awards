9629276 O'Day The proposed research program of this Faculty Early Career
Development proposal involves: (1) Spectroscopic and microscopic
characterization of field samples from Pinal Creek, AZ. and (2) model studies of
Zn sorption and precipitation and the characterization of reaction products by
X-ray absorption spectroscopy. During the first phase, the PI would like to
directly verify the chemical state and distribution of Co, Ni, CU and Zn
associated with solid phases in the stream bed and alluvial sediments, and
determine the nature and amount of amorphous and crystalline phases. Part 2 will
focus on two aspects of the Zn (II) sorption system: (I) The influence of
mineral substrate on uptake and release of Zn and the identification of
coordination change with sorption with XAS, and (ii) the local molecular
structure and kinetics of Zn(OH)2 homogenous precipitation and surface
precipitation. Sample characterization will be done by SIMS and probe.
Analytical methods to be used include TEM, PEELS, and XAS.
