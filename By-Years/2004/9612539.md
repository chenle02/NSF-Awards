9612539 Nathan The objectives of this proposed project are to study the effect
of strain on the characteristics of electronic devices made from III-V
semiconductor heterostrutures, and to explore possible applications of these
effects. We wil study both band structure effects and piezoelectric effects in
heterostructure devices such as (interband) resonant tunneling diodes and n- and
p-channel field effect transistors. Our goal will be to reach a new level of
understanding that will lead to novel microsensor concepts. ***
