The purpose of this research is to analyze health and nutrition status in the
Western Hemisphere from pre-Columbian times to the early twentieth century using
skeletal data. The skeletal evidence from 10,000 to 15,000 individuals at 100 to
200 cites will be complied into a common format and summarized in an index of
biological standard of living, which incorporates an individual's length of life
and biological quality of life. Research will be conducted by 17
interdisciplinary teams that will use a common methodology and gain
interdisciplinary understanding at a conference to be held at Ohio State
University. A major purpose of the conference is to reach agreement on data
reporting protocols, which assure that all data are in a form suitable for
coding and comparative analysis, and it will include seminars on methods of
skeletal biology for economic historians and seminars on issues in economic
history for bioarcheologists. The teams will prepare reports on the health and
nutrition of particular regions, time periods, or ethnic groups. Tabulations of
the index and related measures will be made available to the teams as
ingredients in reports that will test alternative hypotheses concerning the
biological impact of socioeconomic change. The project is important because it
will develop new methods for analyzing and understanding changes in long-term
economic well being.
