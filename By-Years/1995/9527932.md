Experiences for Undergraduates: Undergraduate Internship Program in Biophysical
Computing and Computational Dynamics This Research Experiences for
Undergraduates project will support nine students per year in programs carried
out during the summers, for three years. The program's objective is to promote
and help support undergraduate involvement in ongoing and new research in
biophysical computing and computational dynamics and new software development
efforts for scientific computing and graphics support for such research, as well
as to carry out interesting and useful research. Undergraduates will work with
faculty on a wide variety of projects. The Supercomputer Institute, an
interdisciplinary research program spanning all colleges of the University,
provides a focal point for the project and arranges sessions at which the
students working on various subprojects share their work, visit each others'
labs, and learn about related work. ***
