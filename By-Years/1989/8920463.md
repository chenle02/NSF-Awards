This project will characterize sequence variation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
in ancient tissue specimens from the southwestern United States. The samples are
identified archaeologically as Basketmaker, Anasazi, or Hohokam, and are
approximately 1000 years old or older. Precise temporal provenience will be
obtained for key specimens by accelerated carbon fourteen dating. Molecular
genetic characterization of mtDNA variation in these ancient samples will permit
identification of the geographic and temporal distribution of lineages in the
ancient cultures of the Southwest. Such an assessment will allow testing of
several hypotheses relating to origins of native cultures in the region,
patterning of prehistoric migrations of the area, and more precise information
on ancestral/descendant relationships between ancient southwestern cultures and
modern populations.
