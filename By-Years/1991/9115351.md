With this Grant for Explaratory Research Armstrong and Nebesny will attempt to
create a completely new class of materials based on superlattices of
phthalocyanines deposited by molecular beam epitaxy. They will characterize the
initial surface chemistries of the materials, answering questions such as the
way in which the materials nucleate, and the method by which they stack. The
optical properties of the materials will be explored. Initial expectations would
suggest that the materials may be important in fast optical switching - a
situation that is not achievable completely with existing materials. %%% The
research, in the general area of Analytical and Surface Chemistry, focuses on
the investigation of new superlattice materials created by unconventional
molecular beam epitaxy. The work promises to lead to the preparation of novel
superlattice materials with important optical properties which could lead to new
optical switching devices. Because the work has high novelty and urgency it is
being funded through a Grant for Explaratory Research.
