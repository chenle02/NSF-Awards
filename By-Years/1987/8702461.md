The PI has developed an H(2)+ gaseous field ion source that produces a highly
columnated ion beam of high angular current density and low energy spread. The
PI proposes to extend the gaseous field ion source to several other ion species
using different gases. The characteristics will be used to determine the
required conditions of temperture, gas pressure, fields, etc. for gaseous
sources using helium, the rare gases, 0(2), N(2), and some gaseous hydride, e.g.
silane (SiH(4)), phosphine (PH(3)), Arsine (AsH(3)) and diborane (B(2)H(6)) will
be investigated.
