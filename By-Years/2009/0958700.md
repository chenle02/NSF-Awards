Engineering - Other (59)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is organizing a
workshop to create learning outcomes and evaluation strategies for undergraduate
multidisciplinary engineering, technology, and management (METM) programs. The
workshop effort is being guided by an organizing committee and involves
representatives from many of the leading programs along with evaluation experts
from academia, the federal government, and the broader research community. A
pre-workshop web-based survey is being used to capture the existing vision and
goals, learning outcomes, evaluation methods and data. The workshop agenda
includes efforts to identify and refine thematic groupings of learning outcomes
and explore evaluation strategies for each grouping and efforts to develop an
online forum to establish a continuing virtual community. Material from the
workshop is being posted on a website and presented ASEE conference and
publications.
