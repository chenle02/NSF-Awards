This award provides support for the conference "Arithmetic, Birational Geometry,
and Moduli Spaces" held at Brown University on June 12-16, 2023. The conference
will connect established experts, early career researchers, and graduate
students working in algebraic geometry. Its goals are to encourage collaboration
across sub-disciplines within the field and to foster an environment where
people at all career stages may interact productively. A poster session will
highlight achievements of graduate students and postdocs. Results of the meeting
will be disseminated through live-streaming and video archives of lectures. The

The technical focus of the meeting will be resolution of singularities and
semistable reduction. Resolution refers to the replacement of singular algebraic
varieties with smooth models by repeated blowings up. Semistable reduction is
the closely related process of finding mildly singular limits of degenerating
families of algebraic varieties. These are fundamental tools for constructing
birational models and boundary limits in moduli spaces. New tools like algebraic
stacks, non-archimedean geometry, logarithmic geometry, and tropical geometry
are driving progress on these questions. Novel, stronger forms of resolution and
semistable reduction are appearing, even as the proofs of existing results
become simpler. These developments offer a deeper understanding of long-standing
arithmetic problems.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
