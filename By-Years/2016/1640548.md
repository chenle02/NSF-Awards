Tor is used daily by millions of users, including journalists, militaries and
law enforcement, activists, companies, whistleblowers, and ordinary people, to
protect their web browsing against surveillance. However, the internal
architecture of Tor is very complicated. This complexity creates performance
problems, and it makes security analysis difficult. Furthermore, Tor's
encryption will be broken by future quantum computers. Spies are recording
larger and larger fractions of Internet traffic; once the spies build a large
enough quantum computer, they will be able to retroactively see who was saying
what to whom. This FASOR ("Faster and Stronger Onion Routing") project is
interdisciplinary, combining theory and practice, with research covering
protocol design, software engineering, post-quantum cryptography, and privacy
analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FASOR brings together three complementary
research directions. The first component is Tor itself, with a deployed user
base in the millions, broad deployment experience, and a history of analyzing
privacy protocols to discover vulnerabilities. The second component is
"MinimaLT", a clean-slate low-latency encrypted network protocol that reduces
complexity and increases security and privacy. The third component is post-
quantum cryptography, which introduces cryptographic algorithms that resist
quantum computers, but which also poses efficiency and network protocol
integration issues. The FASOR project unifies these three components, increasing
performance, providing high-security post-quantum cryptography, reducing
duplication among different system layers, making it easier to introduce new
functionality, and reducing surface area exposed to attackers. The FASOR project
will also analyze these protocols for new types of vulnerabilities and threats,
and expose and clarify new research problems for the world.
