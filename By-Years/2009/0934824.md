This engineering education research award to George Mason University will study
the development of engineering design thinking in undergraduate engineering
students using innovations in cognitive science and new methods of analysis. The
study will take place over three years at two engineering schools, George Mason
and Virginia Polytechnic and State University. The techniques to be used will be
drawn from design theory, cognitive science, mathematical modeling and
information theory plus engineering education research. The understanding of the
relationship between design teaching and student learning is far from complete
and the results from this project will help to fill the gap. The results will be
presented at technical conferences and published in professional journals. The
goal is to better prepare students for the practice of engineering through more
effective development of their design talents. The results will increase
student?s interest in engineering and will enhance the number of students who
complete engineering degrees and are ready to fill engineering jobs.
