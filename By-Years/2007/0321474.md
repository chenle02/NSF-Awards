The Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Pharmaceutical
Processing was established at Purdue University to partner with pharmaceutical
companies to gain understanding at the molecular level, to the effects of
processing on critical qualities of pharmaceutical products and to improve
process monitoring with the goal of minimizing validation requirements. The
I/UCRC has become a multi-university Center now encompassing University of
Connecticut, University of Puerto Rico and the University of
Minnesota.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Connecticut researchers will
enhance the Center's expertise in:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Stability behavior and
characterization of proteins in both solution and solid state,&lt;br/&gt;- The
science and technology freeze drying,&lt;br/&gt;- Materials science of amorphous
pharmaceuticals,&lt;br/&gt;- Tablet coating science and technology,&lt;br/&gt;-
Dissolution behavior, and&lt;br/&gt;- The study of disperse systems with a focus
on emulsions, interfacial characterization, and micro-
encapsulation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
