Most modern computer systems have multiple computational cores that require
parallel applications. Unfortunately, developing reliable and efficient parallel
applications is notoriously difficult, in part due to nondeterministic
scheduling, which can context-switch between parallel threads at any arbitrary
program point. The resulting unpredictability and nondeterminism makes it
extremely difficult to develop reliable parallel
software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project proposes to investigate and develop
a better model for parallel programming based on extending simple cooperative
concurrency to deterministic cooperative parallelism. Cooperative concurrency is
a simple non-preemptive model requires minimal synchronization, and under which
even buggy or incorrect preemptive programs often execute correctly. This
effectively reduces the design complexity. Cooperative concurrency is simple but
it does not yield any speedup. This proposal leverages software transactional
memory to extract parallelism. The proposal addresses three tightly coupled
problems: provide simpler parallel semantics, novel techniques to provide
efficient parallel execution, and integrate with existing complementary
techniques like automatic parallelization and thread level speculation. Graduate
and undergraduate researchers some from under-represented groups will be
involved in the research. Overall, the project aims to make a fundamental
advanced toward simpler to program parallel applications, with impacts not only
in the computer science community but also in other fields like mobile systems.
