This project introduces undergraduate mechanical engineering students to
microprocessor interfacing. The student's skills for designing experiments are
enhanced by the ability to interface the microprocessor to basic engineering
sensors and components such as strain gages, thermocouples, LVDT's and stepping
motors. The laboratory equipment that supports this project consists of
microprocessor trainers, analog interfaces and associated software. This
laboratory familiarizes students with modern techniques of measurement. This
award is being matched by an equal sum from the grantee.
