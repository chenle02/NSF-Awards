A workshop on theoretical developments and engineering applications in the areas
of control of infinite-dimensional and stochastic systems will be held at
University of California, Los Angeles. The simultaneous interest in these topics
originated in the late 1960s, with pioneers such as J.-L. Lions in France and A.
V. Balakrishnan in the U.S. laying the mathematical foundations for extending,
to partial differential equations, the basic results of Kalman, from a decade
earlier, on controllability and optimal control for ODEs. The workshop will
bring together researchers working on PDEs and those working on stochastic
control, mathematicians and engineers, researchers with interests in mechanics
and biology and those with interest in finance, the generation that founded the
field and the generation that is carrying it forward towards subjects of
increasing mathematical sophistication and engineering relevance.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The workshop is anticipated to be a milestone event in sharing of
ideas among leading researchers working on the mathematics and control of
complex physical systems. The application topics covered will span a broad
range, including aerospace/defense systems, biology, and financial systems, all
tied though a common mathematical thread. &lt;br/&gt;
