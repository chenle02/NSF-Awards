With support from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Ofer Bar- Yosef and a
large multinational group of collaborators will conduct archaeological research
at the site of Hayonim Cave located in Israel. Hayonim contains deposits rich in
lithics and faunal remains - as well as fragmentary human skeletal material -
which span the time range of ca 160,000 - 120,000 years ago. Excavation and
analysis will proceed over a two year period with a series of related goals.
Materials will be collected for thermoluminescence and electron spin resonance
dating of the deposits. If successful this will provide absolute age estimates.
About 100 square meters of horizontal exposure will be obtained to permit
recording and examination of hearths and spatial distributions of artifacts and
bones. Each of these classes will be analyzed. Reseachers will reconstruct the
lithic operational sequences employed for tool manufacture and microwear
analysis will be conducted to determine tool function. Survey will be carried
out to locate raw material sources. Data from a number of sources suggest that
anatomically and behavioral modern humans first appeared in Africa perhaps
200,000 years ago and spread sequentially to other parts of the world. The Near
East, as the gateway from Africa may provide essential data on this expansion.
Work to date indicates that for a long span of time both modern humans and
earlier "Neanderthal" forms either coexisted or alternated presence in the area.
Just when the first modern humans arrived however is unknown and Dr. Bar Yosef's
research directly examines the suspected period. Hayonim cave is worthy of
concerted research because its deposits not only cover this time range but also
contain well preserved faunal and lithic remains. This research is important for
several reasons. It will provide data of interest to a large number of
anthropologists. It will shed light on the emergence of modern humans and
increase our knowledge of a little understood period of time.
