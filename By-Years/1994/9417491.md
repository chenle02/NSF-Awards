ABSTRACT OPP-9417491 KRUSE This proposal is for support of a North American
Symposium on Harvest Assessment Methods in Rural Northern Communities. The goal
is to better understand the factors, technical, cultural and political, that are
critical to the success of fish and wildlife assessments. Harvest assessment
improvements would help sustain productivity of resources important to northern
communities and help reduce problems of undue government interventions in local
resource harvesting. These issues are central to the development of effective
and sustainable resource use in the Arctic. *** ??
