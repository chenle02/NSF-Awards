Deformation of water-saturated sediment (till) beneath glaciers may, in effect,
lubricate glacier beds. Such deformation has been measured beneath a number of
modern glaciers and may also have contributed to the fast flow of Pleistocene
ice masses with a possibly profound effect on regional climate. Support is
requested to study with a rotary (ring-shear) device that shears a water-
saturated till sample. Because the device can deform a large sample to
infinitely high strains, it can be used to test a much broader range of
hypotheses than traditional soil testing devices. For example, it has been used
successfully to study stress concentrations in shearing sediment and the
consequent evolution of till grain size. Special features of the device allow
continuous observation of the distribution of shear strain, measurement of local
stresses normal to the direction of shear, and isolation of wall effects. In
experiments aimed at better understanding till rheology, both clay-rich and
clay-poor tills will be sheared with the primary goal of determining the
relation between deformation rate and the steady (residual) till strength. In
some experiments the effective normal stress will be varied to investigate the
role of transient pore-pressure gradients on the apparent till rheology. In a
second set of experiments, the evolution of contacts, the preservation of
structures (e.g. sublithified sand clasts), and the development of fabric will
be studied to test field criteria for the identification of highly strained
Pleistocene tills. In addition, grain communication will continue to be studied
with the additional important goal of quantifying the progressive degradation of
selected diatom species as a function of shear strain.
