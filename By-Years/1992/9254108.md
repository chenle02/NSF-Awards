This project will develop an interdisciplinary course sequence aiming to satisfy
natural and social science general education requirements. Three critical issue
science modules and laboratories to be developed are: Global Climate Change,
Energy Options for the Future, and Biodiversity Conservation. In addition to a
thorough treatment of the science and engineering content of these issues, the
course will innovate in content presentation in three explicit ways: (1)
Theoretical knowledge will be integrated with labs and simulations for direct
issue- investigation by the students. (2) All learning will converge on
decision-making activities, including critical evaluations of contemporary news
reports. (3) Decisions will be carried forward through exploration of problem
solving action opportunities in the campus community, permitting students to
use, immediately and in practical ways, what they learn in the course. As a
result scientific knowledge will be communicated in a framework that will more
effectively motivate especially non-science students and enhance creativity and
critical thinking in science and technology. Research will be conducted to
determine the effectiveness of these modules and innovative teaching strategies.
