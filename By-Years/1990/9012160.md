Alice Walters, doctoral student: Dissertation, "Tools of Enlightenment:
Scientific Texts and Instruments and the Dissemination of Ideas in Eighteenth-
Century Britain." During the 18th century, scientific books and instruments--
tangible objects designed to communicate knowledge about the natural world--
acted both as media and merchandise, and did so in remarkably similar ways. Ms.
Walters, working under the direction of Professor John Heilbron, is exploiting
this fact in her dissertation research which seeks to elucidate the role of both
in the dissemination of ideas in 18th century Britain. Ms. Walters distinguishes
four functions of books and instruments as media, defined as measuring,
modeling, magnifying, and manufacturing, which correspond to four different
conceptions of mankind's ability to act on nature. Special emphasis is placed on
the active functions, magnification and manufacture. As commodities, books and
instruments were produced, advertised, sold, and consumed, frequently by the
same individuals for the same reasons. These market activities are examined,
with particular attention focused on the many individuals with professional or
commercial interests in both books and instruments. Finally, the conceptual and
commercial functions of books and instruments are tied together through
consideration of the impact of the various commercial activities on the ideas
communicated by these objects and their presentation.
