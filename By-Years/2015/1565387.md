Information about individuals is collected by a variety of organizations
including government agencies, banks, hospitals, research institutions, and
private companies. In many cases, sharing this data among organizations can
bring benefits in social, scientific, business, and security domains, as the
collected information is of similar nature, of about similar populations.
However, much of this collected data is sensitive as it contains personal
information, or information that could damage an organization's reputation or
competitiveness. Sharing of data is hence often curbed for ethical, legal, or
business reasons.

This project develops a collection of tools that will enable the benefits of
data sharing without having the data owners share the data. The techniques
developed respect principles of data ownership and privacy requirement, and draw
on recent scientific developments in privacy, cryptography, machine learning,
computational statistics, program verification, and system security. The tools
developed in this project will contribute to the existing research and business
infrastructure, and hence enable new ways to create value in information whose
use would have been otherwise restricted. The project supports the development
of new curricula material and train a new generation of researchers and citizens
with the multidisciplinary perspectives required to address the complex issues
surrounding data privacy.
