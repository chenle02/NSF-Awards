The National Center for the Development of Education (NCDE) is conducting a
regional seminar on science-based computer learning/simulation resources for
faculty in two-year colleges, primarily from California. The seminars, based on
an alliance between two-year colleges, campus-based software developers, and the
NCDE, is utilizing instructional materials developed and evaluated by science
faculty. Curriculum tracks within the NCDE program are providing intensive
hands-on opportunity in exploring potential classroom applications and
instructional impacts of instructional technology developed specifically for the
science classroom by science faculty. Participants are working with science
faculty who have developed and are using instructional software in their
classes. Additionally plenary sessions are addressing the major issues affecting
science curriculum in two-year colleges; the dynamics of curriculum development
and reform, the process of software development, and key aspects of technology
utilization in undergraduate instruction in the biological and physical
sciences. The two year colleges are contributing travel funds for the
participating faculty.
