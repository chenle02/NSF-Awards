Intellectual Merit: The identification of coding regions or genes present in the
genome of organisms is generally insufficient if based primarily on DNA sequence
and in absence of experimental verification. Retrospective analysis of genome
annotation with proteomics data improves its quality and completeness.
Unfortunately, proteogenomically improved gene models are rarely incorporated
into the public knowledge base. This project seeks to build a proteogenomics
software pipeline that will enable and improve primary genome annotation. This
pipeline will initially be used to re-annotate 30 prokaryotic genomes from six
representative phyla: euryarchaeota, cyanobacteria, actinobacteria, firmicutes,
deinococcus-thermus and proteobacteria. The anticipation is that tens of
thousands of validated gene models or verified protein maturation events can be
established. As target genomes are improved, the corrections can be propagated
to an estimated 300 additional, highly homologous genomes. To ensure broad
public accessibility, all findings will be incorporated into RefSeq and GenBank.

Broader Impact: The project will facilitate education and training through the
development of a proteogenomics curriculum to be used in bioinformatics and
genomics courses at universities and science workshops. Additionally, two high
school teachers will be mentored in curriculum development.
