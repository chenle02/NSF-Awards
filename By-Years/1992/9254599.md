This 3 week program is for 20 high school teachers per year for 2 years who
will be drawn from all counties within Maryland and Baltimore City. The complete
program integrates math and science with engineering design using both hands on
experiments and video tapes. Participants will be provided with ready to use
modules and laboratory kits that integrate engineering with mathematical and
scientific concepts. Field trips to NASA and NIST are included. During the
academic year follow up the teachers will meet together to discuss classroom
applications, EMTI faculty will visit schools and maintain contact with
participants. EMTI and the NSF young scholars program will be run simultaneously
affording unique opportunities for shared learning and interaction between
teachers, students and University of Maryland faculty. Cost sharing estimated is
