This grant will continue NSF funding for a numerical and analytical study of
magnetic reconnection in solar flares. The new work will extend the area of
research to include a greater variety of possible flare configurations and
include the later phases of flare evolution. To help in this respect support for
a graduate research assistant will be provided. Magnetic reconnection is a
fundamental process in laboratory, space, and astrophysical plasmas. The group
funded here has elucidated some of the main features of reconnection thus
clarifying some twenty years of work by other researchers.
