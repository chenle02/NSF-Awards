OCE 96-18102 Tandon The project will evaluate the contribution of diurnal and
seasonal cycling of the mixed layer to the transformation of water masses in the
upper ocean. This represents an extension of the steady thermodynamic balance
where the air- sea buoyancy flux is compensated by vertical mixing in the
surface mixed layer and the advective buoyancy flux. In this study the diapycnal
flux due to time-dependent (diurnal and seasonal) mixed layer deepening and
entrainment will be quantified. Both data analysis and diagnostic studies of
model output will be used in the investigation.
