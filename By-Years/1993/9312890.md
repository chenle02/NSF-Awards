9312890 Wimberly Previous research supported by the National Science Foundation
led to important information on the adhesion characteristics of fouling
organisms and the resulting effect on the hydrodynamic drag of flat plates. This
research is an extension of this work with the intention of first, continuing
the investigation of the adhesion characteristics of Enteromorpha clathrata and
thus characterizing the effects of antifouling paints on algal growth and
adhesion, and secondly, investigating the effects of rapidly growing
Enteromorpha clathrata cultures to lifting surfaces coated with tributyltin-
based paints. The algal growth patterns on lifting surfaces in relation to
several environmental conditions such as light intensity and quality, pH,
salinity, temperature, nutrient levels and culture age will be investigated. The
results will then be used to mathematically model the consequent impact on flow
field cavitation, the hydrodynamic response and control characteristics of
underwater lifting surfaces and support structures.
