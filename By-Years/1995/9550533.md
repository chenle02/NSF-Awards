9550533 Gagnon VISION AND GOALS: Oglala Lakota College will create an
opportunity for SEM education which does not now exist through Tribal or
mainstream educational institutions. PROGRAMS: Oglala Lakota College and Sinte
Gleska University will develop and administer bachelor's degree programs in
Environmental Science and Software Engineering, and a pre-engineering associate
degree in science. The degree programs will be extended to Cheyenne River,
Standing Rock, and Sisseton Wahpeton Community Colleges through a distance
learning mode. These Tribal Institutions, collectively called the Oyate
Consortium, are Tribally chartered, and serve distinct American Indian
populations - a population which is significantly underrepresented in SEM
education. The model developed can be easily replicated in the other twenty-six
Tribal Colleges. MANAGEMENT: Core management will consist of a Principal
Investigator, a SEM Curriculum Specialist/Co-Principal Investigator, and the
Sinte Gleska Site Coordinator and Vice President. In years two to five site
coordinators from the three other Consortium member colleges will join the team.
The Principal Investigator will report directly to the OLC President. SPECIAL
FEATURES: Oglala Lakota College and Sinte Gleska University, the only accredited
graduate and four-year degree granting Tribal Institutions, have recently gained
land-grant college status. The Oyate Consortium is unique because of strong
collaboration among Tribal colleges and with other universities and industry.
This initiative, the first ever for Tribal College SEM program development, has
potential for unusual impact because Tribal Colleges are community and nation-
builders with the special mission of helping tribes which are sovereign nations,
become more self-sufficient. Oyate Tribal Colleges are unique because they reach
students who are not served adequately by ordinary universities. These are
students who live and work on geographically isolated reserva tions, hold
cultural values not appreciated by mainstream institutions, or who have
extensive family responsibilities. The NSF Model Institutions for Excellence
initiative offers a unique opportunity for the Oyate Tribal Colleges and their
twenty-six Tribal counterparts to reach the underrepresented American Indian
students, and to bring academic and technical expertise to Tribal nations in
ways that may make the difference between extinction and tribal self-
sufficiency.
