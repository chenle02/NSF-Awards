9320521 LANDERS Many serious environmental problems are transboundary in nature
and can only be adequately dealt with through international cooperation. As has
been noted by both scientists and policy makers, this is especially true of the
Arctic regions. The links between airborne contaminants and Arctic flora and
fauna have not been adequately studied or understood. In addition to documenting
the current state of knowledge regarding ecological effects of airborne
contaminants, an international symposium will facilitate the planning of further
scientific investigations and help lay the groundwork for informed environmental
policies. This proposed international symposium on the ecological effects of
arctic airborne contaminants will take place in Reykjavik, Iceland, in October
1993. ***
