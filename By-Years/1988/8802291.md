The translocation of CO2 and chloride ions through gills will be studied using
isolated perfused crab gills. CO2 flux across the gill is a process which can be
complex due to several factors: 1) carbonic anhydrase, which catalyzes the
hydration and dehydration reactions of CO2, is located on the cell surface and
inside the cell; 2) CO2 is generated endogenously by active metabolic processes;
and 3) CO2 hydrated to bicarbonate plays a role in chloride uptake via
C1-/HCO3-exchange. The quantitative importance and contribution of the above
processes to the excretion of CO2 out of the animal and the uptake of chloride
during low salinity stress is poorly understood. This proposal outlines
experiments testing hypotheses which will elucidate the dual (CO2 and C1-) and
related translocation processes. This study, which has general relevance to ion
uptake processes in any metabolically active epithelium, is designed to
determine the existence and location of C1-/HCO3-exchanger, determine the amount
and the fate of the CO2 produced by the gill, measure the quantitative
contribution of endogenously produced CO2 to C1- /HCO3-exchange, and determine
the quantitative function of cell surface and intracellular carbonic anhydrase
in CO2 excretion and chloride uptake. The results have importance to our
understanding of the interplay between acid balance, respiration and ion
regulation of aquatic animals in normal and polluted waters.
