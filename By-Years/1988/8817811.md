A versatile and efficient low- to moderate- resolution spectrograph for general
use on the University of Hawaii's 2.2-m telescope on Mauna Kea will be
constructed. While the spectrograph will be capable of carrying out a full range
of conventional imaging and spectroscopic programs, special attention has been
given to three specific areas important to users: (1) high-angular-resolution
spectroscopy, (2) a spectral range from 3600 A to 2.3 um available in a single
instrument, and (3) an easily accessible slit environment capable of taking a
wide variety of slits, aperture plates, and image slicers. The instrument will
be able to function in conjunction with a piezo- electrically-driven f/35
secondary currently being developed to provide fast guiding for high-resolution
imaging and spectroscopy. The versatility of this instrument-particularly its
abilities to switch between imaging and spectroscopic modes in a matter of
seconds and to work over a wide spectral range- will make "block scheduling" of
the telescope a more feasible option. The consequent reduction in frequency of
instrument changes can be expected to improve the operation of the entire
facility.
