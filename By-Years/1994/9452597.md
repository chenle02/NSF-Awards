9452597 Loxsom The general curriculum, introductory, and upper division courses
in physics, geology and mathematics will be revised so that they introduce and
use a common set of computational software tools as an integral part of their
instructional activities. This development process will seek to duplicate the
success achieved by the revision of laboratory courses in physics (including
general curriculum, introductory, upper division and research courses) so that
they now introduce and use, in a systematic and coherent manner, a set of data-
acquisition and data analysis software tools (Lab VIEW, Kaleidagraph, and IGOR).
In the project described here we will use five computational tools: a simulation
package (STELLA), a statistical package (Mini tab), a numerical calculation
program (Mat Lab), a symbolic algebra package (Mathematica) and a programming
language (C++). We will integrate these packages into the physics, geology and
mathematics curricula at all levels. Students involved in research in all three
departments will use these software tools. A major outcome of the project is
that the faculty and students in physics, geology and mathematics will share
ideas for improving science education.
