9530394 Lwiza In this project, the PIs will study the dynamics of transverse
flow in a coastal plain estuary, specifically the James River estuary in
Virginia. Two parallel transects with high spatial resolution measurements will
be occupied, using an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler, and CTD casts during
two tidal cycles on spring and neap tides. In addition, high temporal resolution
measurements will be made with three current meter moorings at each one of the
two transects and two bottom pressure recorders at either side of the estuary
between the two transects. Three different dynamical regimes in the year will be
addressed, namely, high river discharge (May), low river discharge (August), and
the weakest vertical stratification (October). A number of objectives relating
to the transverse circulation will be addressed, culminating in an evaluation of
the dominant terms in the transverse momentum balance, both from the
observations and from a numerical model.
