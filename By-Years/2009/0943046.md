Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0943046&lt;br/&gt;Principal
Investigator: Zhongmin Shen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Riemannian geometry plays an
important role in many areas of&lt;br/&gt;mathematics and natural science.
Recent study also shows that&lt;br/&gt;non-Riemannian geometry has applications
in mathematical&lt;br/&gt;psychology, general relativity, PDE, navigation
problems, imaging&lt;br/&gt;process, and module spaces, etc. Riemannian geometry
provides&lt;br/&gt;some basic tools to study non-Riemannian spaces. There are
also&lt;br/&gt;new methods developed exclusively for the investigation
of&lt;br/&gt;non-Riemannian spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will
provide a platform for geometers to&lt;br/&gt;communicate with each other and
discuss the research projects for&lt;br/&gt;the future. This workshop will also
provide a good opportunity&lt;br/&gt;for mathematicians to understand non-
Riemannian geometry and find&lt;br/&gt;motivation to work in this area. The
