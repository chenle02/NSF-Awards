Partial differential equations arise naturally in physics, engineering,
geometry, and many other fields, and they form the basis for modeling many
phenomena in the physical world. The proposed work concern nonlinear partial
differential equations, which are especially important due to the nonlinear
effects they are used to model. For instance, such equations turn up in the
study of composite materials. This project will contribute to a basic
understanding of fully nonlinear elliptic equations, thereby providing
scientists and engineers with sharpened insight into various physical processes
and ultimately enhancing the quality of, say, consumer products manufactured
from composites. As part of the project, the principal investigator will train
Ph.D. students, many of whom are expected to continue their careers as
educators. They, in turn, will convey to even younger generations both their
mathematical knowledge and the long-term value of mathematical research not only
to science and engineering but also, in the end, to society.

The PI proposes to investigate the compactness of conformal metrics on a
Riemannian manifold having constant sigma-k curvature for k larger than 1 and
less than half of the dimension of the manifold. For k greater than or equal to
half of the dimension of the manifold, or when the manifold is locally
conformally flat, the compactness result has been proved. A success in
establishing the compactness results would lead to new existence results on
conformal metrics with constant sigma-k curvature. A related problem on
compactness of solutions to the constant Q-curvature equations on Riemannian
manifolds is also proposed. The PI has also proposed to study elliptic systems
arising from composite material. The approach to the study of the compactness of
solutions is to give a fine analysis of blow up solutions to the type of
nonlinear elliptic equations on manifolds. Efforts will be made in advancing
further and deeper understanding of solutions of conformally invariant
equations.
