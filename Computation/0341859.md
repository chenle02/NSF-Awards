The International Conference on Computational Harmonic Analysis is held in
conjunction with the 19th Shanks Lecture Series, featuring Steve Smale as the
Shanks speaker. This conference plays a crucial role in impacting developments
of science and technology based on computational harmonic analysis, identifying
new trends, and providing an important common link to other scientific and
engineering disciplines at large. The emphasis of the conference is on the
state-of-the-art developments on such topics as learning theory, computational
mathematics, and applications to signal/image processing, information
technology, and life sciences. It is intended to highlight computational
mathematics and its connections with interdisciplinary research areas, and
brings researchers and graduate students together for in-depth discussions on
all aspects of computational harmonic analysis.

The field of computational harmonic analysis is a recently established and still
fast growing area of mathematical analysis. It has been providing common links
and tools to other areas of mathematical sciences, natural and life sciences,
and engineering. New developments with a very broad spectrum of applications,
such as wavelets, frames, radial basis functions, spline functions, curve and
surface subdivisions, sampling, and learning theory, have found their
mathematical home in computational harmonic analysis. This forum for
interdisciplinary research is expected to continue for the foreseeable future.
