It is proposed to elucidate the origin and properties of the frequency-shifted
conical emission and breakup of laser pulses into solitary waves observed in
laser-driven atomic and molecular vapors. The studies bear on current issues of
wave propagation in nonlinear media and departures from the adiabatic
approximation of quantum mechanics. Topics include: (1) completion of the study
of conical emission and pulse breakup in two level systems under condition of
moderate self-focusing, (2) similar studies in multilevel systems, (3) studies
of the effects on possible laser isotope separation processes, (4) similar
studies under conditions of strong self-focusing, and (5) investigations of the
possibility of intrinsic optical bi stability in an atomic vapor.
