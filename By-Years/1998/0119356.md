The research is focused on high speed coating of optical fibers, a step in the
draw process that is critical to the quality and low cost fabrication of optical
fibers for telecommunications and other applications. It involves four main
aspects (a) modeling and simulation of the transport processes within coating
applicator/die systems, (b) experimentation with a laboratory off-line system
developed previously, allowing measurements with different operating conditions,
(c) experimentation on a full-scale draw tower, and (d) measurement of specific
properties (thickness, concentricity, integrity, presence of bubbles, etc) of
coatings produced under controlled conditions. The models will be validated by
experiments on the two facilities, particularly at large speeds. The dependence
of coating characteristics on the operating conditions will be established. This
approach will therefore provide a quantitative, systematic, and validated means
to predict and control fiber-coating characteristics.
