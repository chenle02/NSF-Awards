The proposal is to investigate the DMSP satellite database of particle
precipitation during a series of magnetospheric state transitions. State
transitions will include the magnetospheric response to changes in IMF By and Bz
components, precursors and responses to substorm onset, and states of flux tube
refilling. These state changes will be investigated using state variables
determines from DMSP particle data. Such state variables include the ion
isotropy boundary and polar cap boundary - from which can be estimated the polar
cap area. The database includes over 356,000 nightside crossings which will be
investigated statistically, sorted according to substorm phase.
