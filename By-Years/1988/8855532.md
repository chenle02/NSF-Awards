The project; Physics and Life: Summer Institutes for Secondary Science
Teachers, proposes a series of intensive summer institutes for teachers of
physics and life sciences, grades 8-12, to be held in 1989, 1990 and 1991. They
will combine science and the history of science, amplified by an intensive
laboratory training. Some twenty candidates will be selected primarily from
around Minnesota and the upper mid-west to participate in each institute and at
least half of the spaces will be reserved for those teachers who will require
room and board. Teachers will repeat important historical experiments in order
to understand the development of scientific concepts and the mutual enrichment
in physics and biology. Many of these experiments will be conducted with a
simple and inexpensive apparatus and may be used by teachers as demonstrations
or labs. In each field, the historical study will culminate in modern
biophysical experiment. By incorporating parts of these courses into their
school curricula teachers will demonstrate the links between different sciences
and their practical applications; enhance their students' understanding of the
scientific process, improve their experimental skills and problem-solving
techniques, make learning more entertaining, and as a result increase the
enrollment into science courses and improve students' proficiency in science.
The 1989 institute will be on electricity and its applications to biology and
medicine. The course will be based on works and discoveries from Gray and Dufay,
to Du Bois-Reymond, and Helmholtz. The 1990 institute will focus on optics and
vision. The course will be based on works from Archimedes to Maxwell. The 1991
institute will be on acoustics and hearing. The discussion and experiments will
be based on original works from Galileo to Helmholtz. Cost-sharing is
approximately 24% of the National Science Foundation request.
