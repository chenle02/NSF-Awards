This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the continuing work of
Professor Jay K. Kochi at the University of Houston. The study will develop
general concepts of chemical reactivity based on electron donor-acceptor
interactions. The three principal methodologies in which electron-transfer will
be induced are (a) chemical oxidants and reducing reagents, (b) electrochemical
oxidation and reduction, and (c) photochemical quenching and charge-transfer
excitation. Specifically, work will be carried out on: (1) application of the
charge-transfer formulation to organic activation; (2) photo-induced electron
transfer in charge-transfer ion pairs; (3) oxometals in high oxidation states as
electron acceptors, (4) charge-transfer activation of hydrocarbon donors on
metal oxide surfaces; (5) organometallic charge-transfer crystals and polymers.
%%% In this project by Professor Jay K. Kochi the broad applicability of the
electron donor-acceptor concept to a variety of organic and organometallic
systems will be exploited to develop new synthetic procedures as well as
catalytic oxidations both in solution and in the solid state. The utilization of
the charge-transfer phenomenon in chemical dynamics especially of transient ions
and radicals in solution and with potential application to solar energy storage
and molecular memories and switches is included. The synthesis of various types
of solid state charge-transfer complexes will be conducted because of their
semiconductor and ferromagnetic behavior as well as their unusual optical and
magnetic properties.
