Abstract Proposal No: 9712486 Proposal Type: Investigator Initiated Principal
Investigator: Robert D. Tanner Affiliation: Vanderbilt University This grant is
awarded through the Separations and Purification Program sub-element of the
Interfacial, Transport and Separations Program of the Chemical and Transport
Systems Division. The principal investigator is Dr. Robert Tanner from
Vanderbilt University. The research involves development of a technique for
protein separations using foam and bubble fractionation. While it is well known
that bubbling a gas through aqueous protein-containing solutions leads to
protein adsorption on the bubble interface and transport with the bubble to the
solution surface, exploitation of the phenomenon to extract proteins from
solution has been prevented due several inherent problems. Most important
amongst them is the possible denaturation of the protein either as a result of
protein unfolding at the gas-water interface or as a result of shear-induced
denaturation as a consequence of bubble burst. The process is difficult to study
and the parameters that govern the extraction of proteins with maximal retention
of structure/function have not yet been elucidated. The research seeks to
conduct a systematic study of the phenomenon and determine the variables that
affect protein extraction, selectivity and retention of structure/function. The
research would contribute to the fundamental understanding of proteins at
liquid-gas interfaces. From a technological perspective, the studies could lead
to defining operating conditions that result in protein extraction with
retention of structure/function. The method proposed is very inexpensive and
could have significant applications in the extraction and recovery of industrial
enzymes.
