Dr. Christopher A. Makaroff and other members of the Chemistry Department at
Miami University are being supported to continue a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site in chemistry. For the period 1997-99, ten
undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in
basic research projects drawn from the traditional areas of chemistry and
biochemistry. The site features close student-mentor interactions with weekly
group and discussion meetings. Participants are recruited from the region.
