This is an award to provide support for research on the capacity of picoplankton
populations in aquatic environments to take up and store heavy metals. The
investigators plan on investigating the use of an analytical technique involving
x-ray dispersive analysis in conjunction with electron microscopy to determine
the elemental composition of individual cells and their intracellular
components. They plan on identifying specific heavy metal sequestering organisms
isolated from samples obtained from aquatic field locations where waters and
underlying sediments are relatively rich in cadmium, nickel, mercury and other
heavy metals. The role of microorganisms in the environmental cycling of metals
is of importance in bioleaching, biosorption, processing of fossil fuels, and in
biotreatment processing of municipal and industrial wastewaters. The removal of
heavy metals from waters contaminated with them is a also a matter of
considerable interest as their presence may adversely affect environmental water
quality. Results of this research may be applied to modeling the diffusion,
dispersion and interactions of heavy metals of significance in affecting the
quality of environmental waters.
