9601382 Roberts One of the most interesting features of the nervous system is
the fact that it is able to undergo functional changes. These changes may occur
due to experience - learning - or may be based upon internally generated changes
in nerve cell physiology and biochemistry. One common change in nerve cell
function, that has been observed in virtually all organisms including humans,
are the changes that follow the daily environmental cycle of light and darkness.
Interestingly, these daily changes in nerve cell function are not reflexive
responses to the environment, but instead are regulated by an internal timing
system. The internal timing system is controlled by circadian pacemakers (circa
- about dies - a day) or "biological clocks" located in the brain or other
neural structures. Investigation of circadian pacemakers over the past several
years has indicated that disruption in the function of the circadian clock, and
the circadian timing system, leads to multiple problems in human physiology.
Furthermore, the interaction between the circadian timing system (internal
rhythmicity) is of critical importance in gaining a full understanding of an
organism's relationship with its environment. Finally, it has been shown that
biological clocks function through the interaction of many intracellular
biochemical processes such as gene transcription, translation, and protein
modification. The purpose of our work is to investigate the biochemistry of
circadian clock function in a model neural system. In these studies we will
analyze the role played by two specific classes of protein (cyclin-dependent
kinases, and mitogen activated protein kinases) that we propose are important in
the generation and regulation of the circadian rhythm produced in the eye of the
marine snail, Bulla gouldiana. Investigation of several different circadian
pacemakers has shown that clock function has been conserved in a diverse group
of organisms. Thus, our studies should pr ovide general insights concerning the
biochemistry of circadian rhythm generation.
