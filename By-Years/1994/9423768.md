This award provides funding to purchase shipboard instrumentation in support of
NSF-funded research. The instruments will be used aboard the R/V KNORR, a 279
foot vessel owned by the Navy, the R/V OCEANUS, a 177 foot vessel owned by NSF,
or the R/V ATLANTIS II, a 210 foot vessel owned by WHOI. All of these vessels
are operated by the Institution in support of oceanographic research, and NSF is
the primary user of each ship. Instrumentation funded includes a variety of
computer hardware, a thermometer and temperature standard for the temperature
calibration facility, a wire-lowered ADCP, a clean wire system, a portable fiber
optic winch, a magnetometer, Niskin bottles, and CTD sensors. The
instrumentation requested is required for support of NSF-funded cruises aboard
the ships during 1995 and will enhance the scientific capability of the vessels
in the future. ??
