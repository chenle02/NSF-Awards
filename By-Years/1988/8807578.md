This is a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Plant Biology to support Dr.
Terzaghi's research and training under the mentorship of Dr. Anthony R.
Cashmore. The proposal outlines experiments to study light- regulated gene
expression and light signal transduction in photoautotrophic soybean cell
cultures. System development will entail: (1) characterizing greening responses
to light quality and quantity; (2) studying light/dark regulation of specific
transcripts; (3) comparing responses of cells and whole plants; and (4)
developing labeling and other technology to study gene expression.
Photoreceptors will be identified, and the role of protein phosphorylation in
light-signal transduction will be investigated. Dr. Terzaghi's long-term
interest is in the area of membrane biogenesis, with particular emphasis on
lipid membrane components. Since the greening process involves substantial
chloroplast membrane biogenesis and rearrangement, and involves both qualitative
and quantitative alterations in chloroplast membrane lipids, the system
developed during this training period should be a useful one.
