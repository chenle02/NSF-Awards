This is an experimental and theoretical study of the evolution of biochemical
characters which are the end results of metabolic pathways. The experimental
system focuses on the maintenance of lipid glycogen stores in the fat body of
Drosophila melanogaster. Dr. Clark has devised means of quantifying lipid and
glycogen storage, along with the activities of other enzymes. Large-scale
quantitative genetic studies of these traits has shown extensive genetic
variation in both lipid and glycogen storage, and that the variation is in part
explainable by the variation in activities of associated enzymes. Two
experiments will be performed. The first experiment examines the rate at which
spontaneous mutations affecting storage and enzyme kinetic characters
accumulate. Mutations that accumulate on a single chromosome can be isolated and
retained. Over a 50 generation period (each generation takes about two weeks)
series of characters, including lipid and glycogen storage, will be assayed.
Rates of mutation for these complex traits, and for the correlated effects of
these mutations will be estimated. Only a few studies have estimated mutation
rates for quantitative characters, and none of them have an underlying mechanism
to be tested. In order to understand how quantitative traits evolve, good
estimates of this sort are necessary. The proposed research will provide such
estimates. Results of these studies may also find application in the field of
pest management, because positive selection acting on a trait like lipid storage
is not too unlike selection imposed by application of a pesticide. Response can
either be by a specific detoxification, or by complex pathways involving
absorption and excretion. As described in one of Dr. Clark's papers, it is also
relevant to artificial selection regimes that are imposed on growth and fat
contents of a number of agriculturally important animals. The correlated
responses to selection can only be understood in light of the allometric
relations among traits, which are to a large part genetically determined.
