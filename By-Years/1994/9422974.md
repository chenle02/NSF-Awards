This is a study of social processes in exchange networks. It extends a program
of theory-based investigations on power and social exchange into other
fundamental sociological and social psychological processes: status,
distributive justice, and legitimacy. The foundation for this research, Network
Exchange Theory has been tested chiefly within a specialized type of
experimental exchange setting in which agents linked in networks negotiate over
pools of resources under various conditions that govern transactions. This new
research will broaden the scope of Network Exchange Theory by developing and
testing exchange settings more akin to those found in society. To this end, the
researchers will adapt their experimental paradigm to permit valued resources to
enter the exchange system at different network locations, and to move through
the network as exchanges transpire. Agents in the network thus engage in true
exchanges of one type of resource for another, rather than the simpler single-
resource pool-divisions of previous experiments. After calibrating the new
setting and running tests with different network structures, the researchers
will integrate the social processes. Status, distributive justice, and
legitimacy are all predicted to have specific, independent effects on resource
distribution in exchange networks. These occur through their influence on
negotiation tactics and evaluations of exchange outcomes, and are modeled by the
theory. %%% This set of experiments is fundamental scientific research on social
capital, the capacity to gain resources that an individual may have on the basis
of position in a social network and of socially-ascribed status. Thus it is a
contribution to the fundamental knowledge base concerning human capital, testing
and developing formal models of how factors beyond individual skill and
motivation may affect the incomes and careers of individuals.
