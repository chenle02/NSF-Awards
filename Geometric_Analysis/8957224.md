The principal investigator will continue his studies of intersection cohomology
while partially supported by this Presidential Young Investigator award. In
particular, he will work towards a proof of the Borel conjecture which would
extend his solution with L. Saper of the Zucker conjecture. In two other
projects, he will study singular algebraic varieties and a geometric
interpretation of the zeta functions arising in his index theorem. Cohomology is
the dual of homology. In cohomology theory spaces of functions on topological
spaces are studied, while in homology theory the spaces themselves are graded by
their algebraic connectivity properties. The principal investigator will work
toward solving a deep conjecture concerning square- integrable cohomology as
related to intersection cohomology.
