Abstract&lt;br/&gt;PI: Larkin&lt;br/&gt;IOB-0444560&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; During
the development of multicellular organisms, cell differentiation must be tightly
coordinated with cell division. In animals, loss of control of cell division
leads to cancer. In some cell types, a modified cell cycle occurs during
differentiation in which the DNA is replicated without concomitant cell
division, resulting in an increase in nuclear DNA content. The role of this
process, termed endoreplication, is poorly understood. In previous work using
Arabidopsis leaf hairs (trichomes) as a model for cell differentiation, the
SIAMESE (SIM) gene was shown to be required to repress mitosis and establish
endoreplication. The SIM gene has now been isolated by the PI's group, and the
predicted gene product is a good candidate for a direct regulator of cyclin-
dependant kinase activity, which plays a key regulatory role in the cell cycle.
Arabidopsis has a small gene family of about four SIM-related proteins, and
homologs exist in other plant species. The overall goals of this proposal are to
determine the function of SIM in the regulation of endocycling during trichome
development, and to test the hypothesis that members of the SIM gene family may
play a role in integrating the cell cycle with developmental signals in other
aspects of plant growth, such as flower, root, and vascular development. It is
expected that this work will lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms
coordinating the cell cycle with plant development. Additionally, the proposed
work will play a role in the education of graduate students, undergraduates, and
high school students from a wide diversity of backgrounds.&lt;br/&gt;
