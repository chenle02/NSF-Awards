In rapid granular flows, particles interact vigorously with their neighbors
through highly dissipative collisions. At present, there are no theories that
adequately describe these flows. This study will extend methods from the kinetic
theory of nonuniform gases to obtain a complete continuum theory for granular
flows of identical, highly inelastic, smooth spheres. The theory will consist of
balance equations that govern the variations of the relevant mean fields and
constitutive relations that measure the rates at which these means are
transferred throughout the flow. The statistical averaging required to derive
the constitutive theory will be based upon a generalization of the Maxwellian
velocity distribution that applies to systems of highly inelastic particles.
When it is applied to homogeneous shear flows, for example, the theory's results
will be in excellent agreement with the corresponding computer simulations.
Methods of statistical averaging will be employed to derive boundary conditions
for flows of identical spheres that interact, through highly inelastic
collisions, with bumpy surfaces. These conditions will complement the general
flow theory by ensuring that the fluxes of the flow properties relevant to
highly inelastic systems are balanced at these boundaries.
