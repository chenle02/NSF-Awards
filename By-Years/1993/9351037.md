9351037 Rainwater This project provides equipment that is being used to support
a new undergraduate course, Marine Biology, designed for biology majors.
Specific equipment is used for field and laboratory exercises focusing on Texas
coastal barrier island environments and the organisms that inhabit them. Field
exercises include profiles of coastal waters and lagoons, analysis of bottom
sediments and organisms, and studies of benthic communities. Laboratory studies
also physiological adaptations and behavioral interactions of cold- water
organisms, and marine plants and invertebrate animals collected in the field. It
is expected that an increased appreciation of the marine environment will result
from these studies. Moreover, the project will provide meaningful field and
laboratory experiences in marine biology for undergraduate students. ***
