9724987 Emanuel The tropical atmosphere exhibits a large variety of wave
phenomena, ranging from "synoptic-scale " waves of several thousand kilometers
in dimension to the planetary-scale Madden-Julian Oscillation. Complex numerical
simulations of the tropical atmosphere also exhibit a spectrum of waves, but
their characteristics differ appreciably from one model to another. There is
considerable controversy about the dynamics of these waves, particularly
concerning their interaction with moist convection. Some argue that such an
interaction can be unstable an result in wave amplification while others argue
that convection damps the waves. As these waves play a considerable role in
tropical weather and climate, including the genesis of tropical cyclones, there
is much to be gained by improving general understanding of the basic dynamics of
the waves. This project seeks to improve that understanding by carrying out a
number of experiments with simplified models under a variety of conditions. By
excluding many of the complexities of the real world, such as land-sea
contrasts, strongly varying background wind and temperature, and even the
Earth's rotation, an appreciation of the most basic underlying dynamics can be
attained. Experiments will be performed with a hierarchy of models ranging form
sing-column models to fully three-dimensional quasi-geostrophic models. All will
share a common design in that the basic state is one of statistical equilibrium
in which convection, radiation, and large-scale circulation are in balance and
the physical processes of convection and radiation are represented as accurately
as possible. This research effort ultimately will contribute to improved models
and prediction of the tropical atmosphere.
