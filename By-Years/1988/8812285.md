This is a Minority Research Initiation (MRI) planning grant proposal. The
proposed research aims to study the effects of religious participation on mental
health. A pilot study will first be conducted among blacks, drawing on secondary
data (surveys). Based on this study, a larger study will be developed which will
examine possible race differences in the relationship of religion to mental
health. The topic is important and the project is of considerable merit. The
planning grant will provide funds to support a well-trained minority scientist
to plan and prepare a competitive proposal for submission to the MRI research
initiation component. During the planning period, the principal investigator
will conduct analyses of religion and mental health, conduct additional review
of the literature, and establish consultative arrangements with the research
faculty.
