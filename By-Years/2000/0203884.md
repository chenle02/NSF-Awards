Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Gerda Claeskens&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal
ID: DMS-0203884&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Some problems related to
model selection&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first major contribution of this
project is a study of nonparametric tests of function fit in the context of both
density estimation and regression, hereby generalizing existing results in
several directions. The proposed apparatus can be applied to test the adequacy
of any parametric family, subject to the usual conditions of regularity, and is
also suitable for use in higher dimensions. The second research topic focuses
specifically on estimation after model selection and introduces a general
approach to frequentist model averaging. A third line of research addresses the
problem of generalizing the methods mentioned above to the setting of missing
data. This will require the development of new model selection criteria.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of nonparametric testing is to construct an
omnibus test, consistent against essentially any alternative model. Proposed
tests are applicable to almost any parametric family of functions. There are
several reasons why model selection criteria and their asymptotic properties
merit further study, one of the most important ones being that only a minority
of the past research provides a full integration of model selection into
statistical inference. The traditional use of model selection methods in
practice is to proceed as if the final selected model had been chosen a priori,
without acknowledging the additional uncertainty introduced by model selection.
A general framework is developed, in which several modeling and estimation
strategies can be included and compared. Aspects of these problems are addressed
first in the setting of complete data, and then in the general situation of
missing data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
