INT-9722810 Pittel This U.S.-Bulgaria Collaborative Research is on "Nuclear
Structure and its Applications." The principal investigators are Dr. Stuart
Pittel of the Bartol Research Institute in the U.S. and Dr. Mario V. Stoitsov of
the Institute for Nuclear Research and Nuclear Energy. The researchers propose
to focus on three problems of contemporary importance in nuclear structure
physics. One concerns a description of the structure of nuclear matter directly
in terms of quark degrees of freedom through the use of baryon mapping
techniques. A second involves an improved calculation of the response of a new
iodine detector to be 7Be solar neutrinos. Both of these projects build
naturally on earlier collaborative efforts between the PI and his Bulgarian
colleagues. The third, a study of the possible use of a simple analytic shell-
model potential for the treatment of nuclei far from stability represents a new
direction of research. This research in physics fulfills the program objectives
of bringing together leading experts in the U.S. and Bulgaria to combine
complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and
competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit. ***
