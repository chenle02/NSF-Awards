The proposed research targets the investigation of techniques that enable using
Threshold Logic (TL) circuits to implement Systems on a Chip (SoC) devices for
embedded systems. The project proposes to take a unified approach to
simultaneously address TL circuit synthesis and TL gate design. The work also
plans to investigate TL based on nanodevices and the extension of TL to mixed
signal circuits such as Analog to Digital Converters (ADCs). This work also
represents the first collaborative project between these two sites of the
center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcomes of the proposed work have the
potential to help the semiconductor industry produce more reliable and
affordable microprocessors and SoC implementations. The work is supported by the
Industry Advisory Board as well as individual industry members of the center and
has the potential to extend the centers portfolio through collaboration of two
of its sites. The PIs research will impact diverse undergraduate and graduate
students as well as be used as a tool to recruit students to the field.
