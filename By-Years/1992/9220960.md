The quest for a flexible and efficient knowledge representation mechanism is
one of the key research problems in Artificial Intelligence (AI). Instantaneous
matching of a complex object description to a large set of predefined objects is
a key computational primitive in many intelligent systems. This function of
memory based reasoning manifests itself in different activities such as pattern
recognition tasks in computer vision, language understanding or general problem
solving. Simultaneous satisfaction of many possibly conflicting constraints is
another very important functional requirement in intelligent systems, which is
critical for learning, planning and general problem solving. It is generally
believed that humans perform such tasks efficiently (i.e., in almost constant
time) by exploiting massive parallelism in the brain. This research is aimed at
deriving a precise characterization of the utility of parallelism in fundamental
AI problems such as constraint solving and matching. The ultimate goal of the
research is to produce a computational framework for parallel intelligent
systems. Specific research objectives are design of efficient parallel
algorithms for constraint networks, development of methods to integrate multiple
constraint solving activities, and applications of generalized matching and
constraint solving to reactive planning, resource allocation and analysis of
scientific data.//
