This Research Opportunities for Women Career Advancement Award will support
Professor Ratcliff's work in nilpotent harmonic analysis. She will use and
extend a symbolic calculus she has recently helped to develop for
pseudodifferential operators on 3-step nilpotent Lie groups. She will continue
her ongoing study of Gelfand pairs in the context of compact groups acting on
nilpotent groups, and investigate discrete decompositions of distributions on
the Heisenberg group.
