This award is for support of a project designed to provide a high resolution
record of late Wisconsin climatic events in central Alaska. The objectives of
the study are: 1) to recover, analyze and date sediment cores from Wonder Lake,
and 2) to use the dated lake record to interpret alate Wisconsin/Holocene
climatic change. The results of this research will have broad implications to
the nature and timing of rapid/abrupt climatic events during the late Wisconsin
in central Alaska.
