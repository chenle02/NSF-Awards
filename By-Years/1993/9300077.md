The proposed research of the nuclear science group using the Van de Graaff
accelerator laboratory at the University of Kentucky will focus on related
topics in nuclear structure, neutron reactions and scattering, and nuclear
astrophysics. Studies of nuclear structure are primarily oriented toward a)
exploring collective multi-phonon excitations, such as quadrupole- quadrupole,
quadrupole-octupole, and octupole-octupole modes, at low excitation energies, b)
defining the nature of mixed-symmetry or "scissors mode" excitations in deformed
and transitional nuclei, c) defining the separate roles of protons and neutrons
in collective modes, and d) understanding nuclear shell structure and the nature
of nuclear shape transitions. Since transition rates are required to interpret
these phenomena, the techniques developed in our laboratory to measure nuclear
level lifetimes with the Doppler-shift attenuation method following inelastic
neutron scattering are crucial to these investigations. Neutron scattering
studies will concentrate on understanding the differences between excitations
probed by neutrons and by other hadrons or leptons and will complement many
other ongoing nuclear structure investigations. Detailed studies or nuclear
level densities in the bound state region and the energy dependence of level
densities will be pursued. Carefully selected studies in nuclear astrophysics
that are particularly appropriate to our capabilities and facilities are
proposed.
