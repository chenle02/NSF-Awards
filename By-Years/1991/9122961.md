A user mode research program will be carried out in hadronic and
electromagnetic nuclear physics. Data on the spin response function of the
nucleus will be obtained from polarized proton scattering and reactions. The
nature of the effective nucleon-nucleon interaction inside nuclei will be
explored. New multi-nucleon absorption mechanisms will also be explored, both in
pion reactions and in electron scattering. The role of the delta resonance will
be explored in all these studies. Work will be carried out at LAMPF, Mainz,
CEBAF, Saturne (France), and elsewhere. A nucleon polarimeter as well as other
instrumentation will be developed at Rutgers, for ultimate use at CEBAF and
Mainz. Grad students and postdocs will be involved in the instrumentation
development and all other aspects of the research.
