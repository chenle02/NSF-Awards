9455681 Kharas This project will develop a model comprehensive organic
laboratory curriculum that will give students the opportunity to be imaginative
and creative, lead to better understanding of the concepts that underlie
scientific research, and show an important connection between theoretical and
practical organic chemistry. We will design individual exploratory research
projects for the last quarter of a three-quarter laboratory course that will
integrate the instructor's research interests with learning experiences for the
students. The vehicle will be individual organic and polymer syntheses that
combine classic organic chemistry and polymer chemistry. We will also continue
our efforts at improving and assessing the value of this curriculum in ways that
inform the development of the course and guide research on the learning
outcomes.
