The Duke University/ University of North Carolina Oceano- graphic Consortium
will provide shipboard technical services associated with the research vessel
CAPE HATTERAS, a 135-foot research vessel that is owned by the NSF and operated
by the University. A significant portion of the ship's operating schedule in
recent years and again in 1991 is in support of NSF-sponsored research projects.
The Shipboard Technician Program has two components: an at-sea component and an
ashore component. The at-sea component consists of instructing scientific
personnel in the use of shared shipboard equipment; maintenance, repair, and
calibration of scientific instrumentation; instruction and supervision of deck
operations; and providing logistics assistance to on-coming and off-going
scientific parties. On shore activities include the maintenance, repair, and
calibration of shared use seagoing equipment and assisting scientific personnel
in preparing for field work on the vessel. Shipboard technicians funded by this
award have broad responsibilities for providing the coordination and assistance
needed for the successful completion of research projects at sea. The level of
activity and amount of support are closely related to the size and capability of
the vessel, and its scientific outfit and capability.
