The North American fish fauna provides an informative, natural laboratory
useful in investigations of comparative, evolutionary, and -- phylogenetic
relationships. Without these data the fauna is rendered inaccessible for direct
estimates of community formation, evolutionary ecology, and modes and rates of
speciation. Fishes of the family Percidae represent one of the most diverse
groups in North America, yet relationships among many of the species are poorly
known. The objectives of this study are to test previous biogeographic and
evolutionary relationships hypothesis for several darter species, using starch
gel electrophoresis and phylogenetic analyses. Relationships within and between
the target species are extremely useful in resolving recently constructed area
(river) cladograms for many drainages in eastern North America that dated the
origin of the fauna well before the Pleistocene. The study will focus on two
wide-spread species of the percid genus Etheostoma, the relationships of species
within the subgenus Etheostoma (genus Etheostoma), and the phyletic affinities
of this clade to the subgenus Ulocentra (or Nanostoma). The potential gains of
the study are not restricted to revised taxonomy and relationships of
traditionally confusing group. The analysis will supply both a framework for
future systematic studies in percid fishes and improve our understanding of
evolutionary biology.
