Access control policies specify which users may perform which actions on which
resources within which environments. Defective policies may have serious
impacts, allowing unintended access (e.g., bank account withdrawals by a
stranger) or preventing critical legitimate access (e.g., a doctor cannot view
her patient's x-ray). As computer systems become more complex, policy defects
have become more common. However, existing testing methods for detecting faults
in access control policies have not been very successful and there is no
explanation for why they are unable to detect a majority of faults. This project
is investigating the inherent strengths, limitations, and cost-effectiveness of
existing testing methods for access control policies. The results of this
project will provide essential guidelines for planning testing efforts and
selecting appropriate testing methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project focuses
on access control policies expressed in the XACML language. The project is
formalizing fault detection conditions that test cases must satisfy in order to
detect specific types of access control faults. These conditions consist of
reachability constraints, necessity constraints, and propagation constraints of
various faults in XACML policies. They are used to determine the fault detection
ability of a given testing method by evaluating whether or not its test cases
satisfy the fault detection conditions. Based on the collective fault detection
conditions of fault groups, the project is developing a method for generating
optimal test suites using an efficient constraint solver. The optimal test
suites are used to quantitatively measure cost-effectiveness levels of other
testing methods in terms of the ratio between the number of faults detected
(i.e., effectiveness) and the size of test suite generated (i.e., cost). Thus,
the project is a study of benchmarking testing methods for access control
policies.
