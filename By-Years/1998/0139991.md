The primary goal of this program is to develop two-photon lasers that operate in
different regimes and that are based on a new technique for super-enhancing the
two-photon stimulated emission process in laser driven potassium. The
researchers are using this device to explore the operating characteristics of a
broad-area two-photon laser that is expected to spontaneously form two-
dimensional bright localized structures in a dark background (transverse spatial
solitons), a topic of current interested in the nonlinear and laser dynamics
communities. They are also investigating whether the system displays quantum
images, that is, quantum-correlated spatial structures. In addition, the
researchers are performing experiments to determine whether the single-
transverse-mode version of the laser is capable of generating bright
polarization-entangled twin beams of light, which may be useful in application
such as quantum lithography, for example. In the final phase of the project, the
researchers are using an ultra-high-finesse optical resonator to head toward the
regime of strong atom-cavity coupling for two-photon processes, which may find
applications in multiple photon quantum state engineering and the controlled
generation of two-photon states. The research is being conducted in an
interdisciplinary environment that has been successful in recruiting and
retaining women scientists. An international collaboration is another important
educational aspect of the program.
