CBET-0843220&lt;br/&gt;Rabalais&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SGER award
is for urgent research in response to a record Midwestern flood that is
contributing large fluxes of nutrients to the Gulf of Mexico, exacerbating
hypoxia. The investigators will perform mass balances on nutrient fluxes along
the crest of the flood by synthesizing their own monitoring data and that of
other researchers. They have identified and listed key science questions that
remain regarding the development and mitigation of Gulf Hypoxia, and have
formulated a governing hypothesis that record flooding has caused peak nutrient
loadings which will, in turn, cause the largest Gulf Hypoxia ever. Their
research will test this hypothesis. Gulf of Mexico hypoxia is prototypical of
widespread coastal eutrophication caused by excessive nitrogen and phosphorus
export from landscapes and river basins in many regions of the U.S. The research
will have wide applicability across the U.S. in helping to understand the role
of flood events on nutrient drivers and possibly to suggest more effective
policies and management strategies during peak flood events.
