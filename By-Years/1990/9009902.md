Datalog, also known as database logic, is one of the simplest formalisms that
can be used to write rule-based programs; intuitively, Datalog is Prolog without
function symbols. Datalog is the language of choice to write knowledge-based
applications, by adding rules to a relational database system. However, to be
able to use this formalism efficiently, the optimization problem of Datalog
programs must be solved. To solve this problem it is desirable to be able to
detect when a recursive database logic program is bounded, that is, whether the
program is equivalent to a nonrecursive one. This is a central issue in the
optimization of Datalog programs. This research project is concerned with the
characterization of some classes of bounded Datalog programs when the relational
database is consistent with respect to some constraints. The constraints
considered in this research are functional dependencies. This research project
provides a methodology for more efficient query processing in knowledge-base
systems that are being built as extensions of relational database systems. This
in turn makes such knowledge-base systems more feasible for use in practice.
