ABSTRACT LI 9622275 The PI proposes to develop a numerical model of transport
processes and microstructure formation in an electromagnetically-stirred
solidification process. The numerical model complements an ongoing experimental
effort in the PIÄ±s laboratory. Understanding the fundamental processes is
important in casting of fine-grained high-purity aluminum for electronic
applications and high strength aluminum alloys for aerospace applications.
