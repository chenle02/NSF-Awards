This project addresses fundamental issues in causal reasoning with the long
range goal of developing theoretical foundations that will facilitate building
intelligent systems capable of operating autonomously in dynamic and uncertain
environments. This project uses causal Bayesian networks to represent and reason
about causal relationships and to address several related topics, including
axiomatizing causal reasoning, model testing, identifying causal effects, and
causal reasoning in structural equation models. In addition, the project will
produce a causal reasoning software tool that can answer causal queries. Causal
reasoning is intrinsically a multidisciplinary topic and the results of this
project, particularly the resulting software tools, would be useful in other
fields such as statistics, economics, health care, and social sciences. The
educational component of this project includes curriculum development, student
mentoring activities, and efforts to involve undergraduate students in research.
