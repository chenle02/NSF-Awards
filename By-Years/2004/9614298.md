9614298 Aprison The Museum of Science and Industry will develop "Genetics:
Decoding Life," a 4325 sq. ft. permanent exhibit about the basic principles of
genetics, the Human Genome Project, new tools and technology to study life, and
the biomedical and biotech applications resulting from genetic information. As a
result of interacting with this exhibit, visitors will understand the basic
principles of genetics, they will become familiar with the role of genes in the
development of life, they will learn something about how and why scientists used
genetic tools, and visitors will become aware of applications of these
principles and the potential social, ethical, medical and economic outcomes. In
addition to the exhibit there will be a number of complementary outreach
programs. An electronic web site will be created, software used in the exhibit
will be modified into a format suitable for use in schools, computers loaded
with genetic programs will be loaned to Chicago public school groups, churches
and other community agencies, and the content of the exhibit will be used to
enhance special Lamaze and prenatal classes held at the museum. Special
consideration will be given to developing the relationship between the project
personnel and the staff of the Chicago Systemic Initiative. They will work
together to produce a school program about genetics that will be suitable for
grades 5 to 8. School materials will include a teacher's guide for the exhibit,
a program of classroom activities, and materials to be used before and after a
trip to the museum to see the exhibit.
