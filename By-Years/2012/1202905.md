The twelfth meeting of the CNTA is scheduled to take place from June 17-22, 2012
at the University of Lethbridge in Alberta, Canada. The Canadian Number Theory
Association (CNTA) was founded in 1987 at the International Number Theory
Conference at Laval University. The purpose of the CNTA is to enhance and
promote learning and research in number theory. To advance these goals, the CNTA
organizes major international conferences, with the aim of exposing students and
researchers to the latest developments in number theory. The direct impact of
NSF funding will be the training of a significant number of junior American
researchers (graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty), who
will gain the opportunity to participate in the conference. Further information
for this meeting may be found at
http://www.cs.uleth.ca/~CNTA2012/.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference supported
by this NSF grant is in the area of number theory, one of the oldest branches of
mathematics. Number theorists study questions concerning the fundamental
properties of the integers. Although some of these questions may be easily
stated, their solutions often employ advanced methods from diverse fields of
mathematics. Moreover, theoretical results in number theory have a wide range of
applications and have been useful to researchers in cryptography, coding theory,
combinatorics, and theoretical physics.
