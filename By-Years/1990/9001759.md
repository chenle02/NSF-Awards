Two broad aims of this research are to determine (1) the pathways followed by
sugars manufactured in the photosynthesizing cells (mesophyll cells) of the leaf
to the food-conducting cells (sieve-tube members) of the leaf veins, and (2) the
sites at which the sugars are actively secreted, or loaded, and unloaded in
mature (source) and immature (sink) leaves, respectively. Detailed structural
studies, with light and electron microscopes, are complemented by experimental
studies, including localization of 14C-labeled sugars within the leaf by
microautoradiography; plasmolysis studies designed to determine the solute
(primarily sugar) concentrations of the various cell types; and the use of
fluorescent dyes to determine whether substances move from cell to cell via
cytoplasmic connection in their walls (symplastic movement), via the cell wall
continuum (apoplastic movement), or a combination of the two. The results of
these studies will be of long-term practical importance in relation to crop
productivity and will be of great value to investigators interested in relations
of viruses, insects, mycoplasmas, and other parasites, and in the movement of
insecticides and growth regulating substances in cultivated plants. Barley,
maize, and soybean, species to be studied, are economically important plants.
