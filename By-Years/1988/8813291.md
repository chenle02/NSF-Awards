This research will examine concepts in production that are opposed, and attempt
to isolate the points of opposition. Many paradoxes exist in the production
area. In quality the concept of acceptable quality is opposed to the concept of
zero defects. In manufacturing the concept that efficiency is gained through
specialization and fixed lines is opposed to the concept of flexibility. In
inventory the concept of zero inventory and Just- In-Time is opposed to the
concept of inventory as a buffer. Numerous other paradoxes exist as well.
