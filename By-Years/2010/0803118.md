Rodney J. Bartlett of the University of Florida is supported by an award from
the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program to partially defray the cost
of a workshop on parallelization of coupled cluster methods in quantum
chemistry. The workshop is being held in conjunction with the 2008 Sanibel
Symposium and will bring together a diverse group of investigators to discuss
several current topics including efficiency, benchmarking studies and the
development of petascale algorithms. Any recommendations and conclusions
resulting from the workshop will be posted on the Sanibel website a month after
the end of the workshop which is planned for Feb. 23-24, 2008. The results of
the workshop are expected to have a broad impact through the participation of
young investigators from Jackson State University and Florida A & M who have
been invited to the meeting and whose travel costs will be partially defrayed by
this award.
