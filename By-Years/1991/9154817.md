A Conference to Discuss the Presidential Awards for Excellence in Science and
Mathematics Teaching. This project will plan and conduct a conference whose
focus is the Presidential Awards for Excellence in Science and Mathematics
Teaching Program. Conference objectives include the facilitation of
communication among all the states and eligible jurisdictions in regard to:
state, regional and national leadership activities; recruitment of candidates
from historically underrepresented groups; selection procedures; opportunities
for recognition of state awardees; and program management. Attendees will
include the chairs of the state selection committees as well as representatives
from the National Science Foundation, The National Science Teachers association,
the Council of State Science Supervisors and past Presidential Awardees. Funds
will be used to support a conference planning meeting, the conference itself and
a post conference work session. A conference report will be disseminated by
December 31, 1991.
