This award provides support to the Department of Biology at the State University
of New York at Fredonia to continue a successful Research Experiences for
Undergraduates program. The SITE will foster the intellectual growth and
emotional development of 10 undergraduate participants per year by involving
them in a investigation of plant-insect interactions. The research will focus on
the role that amino acids play in attracting insects to plant nectars and on the
role of nectar-derived amino acids in nourishing the nectar feeders.
Participants in the project will collect plant nectars, observe insect behavior,
biochemically analyze the lipid and protein components of insects fed different
nectariferous diets, and test hypotheses that relate the nectar diet to
nutritional status. In each of the three years, this project will be divided
into two parts, summer and winter. The eight summer weeks will offer one week of
introduction to theory and methods, three weeks of directed research on group
projects, and four weeks of independent, participant-originated projects. During
the fall semester, participants will analyze the results of their independent
projects. They will return to Fredonia in January, when they will prepare oral
presentations of their projects to be presented at the Eastern College Science
Conference the following April. Student researchers in this project will develop
through: 1) an increased understanding of ecology, behavior, evolution,
biochemistry, and physiology, 2) hands-on experience with specific field and
laboratory research techniques, 3) practice in critical reading and analytical
thinking, and 4) acquisition of a variety of research support skills. All of
these accomplishments will enhance the emotional maturity of participants, help
define their career choices as scientists, and, in some cases, raise their
aspirations.
