Liquid crystal materials have a potential for detecting and visualizing
ultrasound images. However, because of their low sensitivity, acousto-optical
displays that use these materials have not been pursued for medical imaging
applications. This research investigates new liquid crystal materials capable of
enhanced detection sensitivity of acousto-optical displays by a factor of
10,000. Underlying physical mechanisms are studied in the acousto-optical
interaction, and a foundation is developed for an ultrasonic imaging system for
detection of breast cancer.
