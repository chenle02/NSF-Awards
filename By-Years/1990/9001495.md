The purpose of this workshop is to provide an assessment of current research in
the People's Republic of China in the areas of computer-aided design and
manufacturing (CAD/CAM), production engineering, precision engineering, and
production systems and process planning. It will also afford the opportunity for
interaction between Chinese and United States researchers on these subjects.
Through this interaction, the workshop will calibrate the research of our
Chinese counterparts against that of the United States research community. To
accomplish this a select group of Chinese researchers in the above-mentioned
fields will be invited to the United States to attend the National Science
Foundation-sponsored Conference on Production Research and Technology-Advances
in Manufacturing Systems Integration and Processes, to be held January 8-12,
1990 at Arizona State University in Tempe, AZ. After the meeting, visits would
be arranged for the Chinese researchers to National Science Foundation-funded
Engineering Research Centers in these fields as well as to other University and
industry research laboratories conducting similar work. At the end of the
workshop activity, the attendees of the workshop will be asked to submit a
report detailing their observations and findings, summarizing their own work,
and comparing it to similar work they saw in the United States.
