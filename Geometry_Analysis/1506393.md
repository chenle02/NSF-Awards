This research project studies manifolds with Ricci curvature lower bound. Ricci
curvature is one of the ways that geometers use to describe the degree of
bending in the structure of a space, and it is an essential component of
Einstein's field equation and the study of optimal mass transport. The principal
investigator will study the most fundamental topological information -- the
fundamental group, which summarizes the behavior of loops in a space. Pointwise
bounds on Ricci curvature are known to have major consequences for the global
topology of a space, and these projects will seek similar consequences for
weaker, integrated bounds on Ricci curvature.

This proposal studies the geometry and topology of spaces with pointwise or
integral Ricci curvature bounded from below. Many geometric problems lead to
integral curvatures; for example, isospectral problems, geometric variational
problems and extremal metrics, and the Chern-Weil formula for characteristic
numbers. Recently these conditions have also occurred naturally in work on
Kahler-Ricci flow and Ricci flow in dimension 4. The principal investigator will
study the first eigenvalue and fundamental group of manifolds with integral
Ricci lower bound. The PI will also study metric measure spaces satisfying the
Riemannian curvature dimension condition.
