The Department of Science is purchasing a 300 MHz FT-NMR with proton and
carbon-13 capability and a variable temperature probe for use in a unified
science program. The instrument is permitting the completion of the
implementation of a unique ultra-microscale organic laboratory. Students are
using l-D and 2-D 1H and 13C methods in the analysis of drugs in biochemistry,
toxicology and criminalistics courses. The instrument is also being used
extensively in undergraduate research.
