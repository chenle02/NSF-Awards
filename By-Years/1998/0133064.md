The objective of this research, funded by the Division of Molecular and Cellular
Biosciences and the Division of Chemistry, is to use an integrated approach of
theory and computation to understand variations in quantum yield of tryptophan
fluorescence in proteins. A custom hybrid quantum mechanical-molecular dynamics
method will be applied to the higher charge transfer excited states instead of
the electrostatic effects on fluorescence wavelength from the 1La state to
predict tryptophan fluorescence wavelength shifts due to protein electric fields
and solvation. The study will consider the possibility of both short and long-
range electron transfer to (or from) at least the following implicated sources:
the peptide backbone, protonated carboxylates (Glu and Asp), amide side chains
(Asn and Gln), histidine, cysteine, disulfide bonds, and aromatic groups. The
goal is to determine if there exists a correlation between fluorescence quantum
yield and the incidence of charge transfer states that are particularly low in
energy due to extreme electrostatic potential differences and/or propitious
solvation, using semiempirical and ab initio quantum mechanics applied to super
molecular pairs consisting of tryptophan and a putative electron acceptor/donor.
At least 20 proteins with a full range of quantum yields, along with well-
studied model compounds will be included in the study.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Insight into the details of quenching is of practical
importance because the protein fluorescence is used routinely by scientists to
follow a myriad of transformations involving structural changes in the protein,
for example, folding, unfolding, ligand binding, redox reactions, binding to
other proteins, etc., all dynamic events for which structural information is
often lacking. This work should add new and useful knowledge to the field of
long-range electron transfer in proteins, which is central to photosynthesis and
bioenergetics.&lt;br/&gt;
