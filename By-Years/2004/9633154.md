9633154 Tucholke These investigators from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution
in Massachusetts will study existing oil industry and academic geophysical data
and well samples to understand the history of the early opening of the North
Atlantic Ocean. They will emphasize the conjugate rifted margins of Newfoundland
and Iberia. Their specific study will focus on the Newfoundland margin, and
specifically on the rift basins along the preimeter of the Grand Banks. They
will analyze the character and structural variability of basement, along-strike
segmentation of the rift, the magnitude, timing and spatial distribution of
extension in each rift segment by means of seismic-sequence analysis, and they
hope to establish timing of initial seafloor spreading and the location of the
continent-ocean boundary on this margin. They will model the margin rift
history, using their data as constraints, and they will integrate these data
with similar work ongoing on the Iberia margin which includes ocean drilling.
One expected outcome of this work will be the identification of appropriate
drilling sites on the Newfoundland margin to test hypotheses regarding rifting
history of the conjugate pair of Newfoundland and Iberia. ***
