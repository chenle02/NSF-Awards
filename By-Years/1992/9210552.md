This Research Planning Grant will support a preliminary study of the degree to
which role characteristics and role strains affect physical and mental health.
The investigator plans to use data from the National Survey of Families and
Households. The investigator is particularly interested in how gender and race
affects the relationship among these variables. The planning grant will be used
to develop and test the measurement of variables such as role strain, and mental
and physical health, and to conduct preliminary analyses of the data. The
planning activities supported by this award will allow the investigator to
refine measures and develop an analytic strategy necessary for the development
of a strong research proposal on an important and interesting topic.
