9254694 Kamien Field Museum of Natural History requests a $1,467,422 grant from
the National Science Foundation in partial support of final planning and
implementation of our LIFE OVER TIME exhibit and associated interpretive
programs. This 21,000 square foot, permanent exhibit will provide our 1.4
million annual visitors with an understanding of basic evolutionary principles
and an overview of the history of life from its origins through present. The
exhibit will capitalize on Field Museum's extensive paleontological and
biological collections. Developed in collaboration with the Museum's scientific
staff, the exhibit development team and many outside consultants, the exhibit
will attempt to address complex scientific issues in an informal learning
environment. With a projected cost of $5,775,000. LIFE OVER TIME will open in
1994. ***
