As a fluid-solid separation process, deep bed filters are most effective in
removing small amounts of fine particles from mass quantities of liquid.
Traditionally, the process is used primarily in treating water supplies. In more
recent years, its application has been extended to a number of fields, including
waste water treatment, removal of solids from feed stocks entering catalytic
reactors, purification of molten metal (aluminum) to insure the quality of the
metal ingot, and pretreatment of feed streams involved in many separation
operations, such as membrane and fixed-bed adsorption processes. A significant
part of recent efforts is directed toward achieving a better understanding of
the various phenomena associated with the filtration process. This effort will
investigate the transient behavior of deep bed filters--specifically, the
dynamic change in filtrate quality and pressure drop will be measured in a
controlled set of experiments and correlated with analytical models of particle
reentrainment.
