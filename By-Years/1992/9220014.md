This award will support the development of high-temperature capability for a
rotary direct shear rock deformation system. The primary research focus is to
gain knowledge of faulting/fracture at depth where the ambient temperature is
high. High-temperature capability will also allow ductile rock deformation
studies of direct shear, permitting investigations of rheological properties and
the development of deformation textures in rocks at very large strains. Three
principal areas will be addressed to add high- temperature capabilities:
modification of the sample jacket, modification of the sample grips to allow
space for a furnace, construction of a furnace.
