This RIA award will investigate the effect of microstructural variations on the
radiative shielding capability of microspheres filled with composite materials.
Observed changes in shielding efficiency are to be related to the mechanisms
active for wave front or particle interference of the microstructure under
consideration. Based on these results and theoretical arguments, models of
microstructure dependent behavior will be developed. These models will then be
used to predict enhanced shielding for radiation of different types and for
particles of varying energy.
