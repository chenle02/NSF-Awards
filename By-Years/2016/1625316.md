There has been considerable press describing the poor understanding of science
held by the general public, and extensive research into the misunderstandings of
science held by college students. Attempts to turn science prose into general
prose has often failed to hit the mark, and there is a need for science
professionals to engage actively in informal communication with the public.
Carthage College and the Alda Center for Communicating Science at SUNY-
Stonybrook, are partnering with Dartmouth College, Smith College, and the
Appalachian Mountain Club (AMC), to create and disseminate tools, methods, and
materials that can be utilized by colleges, universities, and informal science
education organizations to develop the science communication skills of
undergraduate STEM students. The program has been successful in training faculty
and graduate students in science communication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project will utilize and adapt the existing science communication training
programs for graduate students and professional researchers as the basis for
creating new tools and training methodologies to prepare undergraduate STEM
students in science communication. It is expected that as these students enter
the workforce, they will be better at communicating and explaining technical
concepts, especially to the lay public, and based on results from the current
program will be more likely to pursue careers in science education. The tools
and methods developed, when adopted by higher education institutions, will lead
to a better-prepared technical workforce, and better understanding of science by
the general public. The program will include a study of the effectiveness of the
interventions through a longitudinal study of assessment and evaluation data
from this effort compared with an expansive five-year data set from prior years
of the outreach program.
