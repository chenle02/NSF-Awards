PI: Entcheva, Emilia&lt;br/&gt;Proposal: 1511353&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI
will develop and validate a new dynamic space-time resolved all-optical approach
to cardiac dynamics. The unique advantages of optogenetic actuation will be
combined with simultaneous high-resolution optical imaging to offer a
conceptually new way of quantifying cardiac instabilities and predict
arrhythmias.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They will demonstrate a general framework for
contactless probing of biological function in space-time by optogenetic means
that can be applied not only to perturbing and observing membrane potential in
excitable cells, but also for the study of cell signaling, gene expression, for
which optogenetic tools exist. The all-optical methodology allows for
straightforward integration of real-time feedback control in vitro and in vivo,
which can yield new insights into biological function and ability to control it.
To broaden the educational impact of the proposed work, the PI, a dedicated
mentor of early-stage trainees, will: 1) collaborate with the BioPREP program at
Stony Brook to recruit academically-strong community college students from
underprivileged background, helping them pursue a career in STEM; and 2) will
integrate the developed techniques into a new formal course on quantitative
optogenetic approaches to the study of biological functions, which will be
offered not only at Stony Brook in a regular format, but also online via the
Coursera educational platform. The evaluation of educational outcomes will be
done by tracking of the career paths of trained students via social media.
