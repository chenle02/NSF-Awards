Spinor condensates possess rotational symmetry reflecting the spherical nature
of ground state atoms in Zeeman degenerate manifolds and isotropic s-wave atom-
atom interactions. A nonvanishing magnetic (B-) .eld, unavoidable in real
laboratory situations, breaks this symmetry and causes different level shifts
for different Zeeman states, profoundly changing condensate properties. This
proposal concentrates on theoretical studies of spinor condensates in magnetic
fields. The primary scientific objective is to advance the frontier of atomic
quantum gases, especially the physics of spinor condensates, which with the
ability of independent control for the motional and internal degrees of freedom,
are promising candidates for engineering nonclassical atomic states and massive
atom-atom entanglement.
