The CombinaTexas 2016 conference will be held at Texas A&M University, College
Station TX on May 7-8 2016. The conference will take place on Saturday and
Sunday to make it easy for researchers to attend, and will feature six fifty
minute plenary lectures and a number of contributed talks, each twenty minutes
long. About 50 participants are anticipated in 2016, with about 20 contributed
talks in parallel sessions. The aim of the CombinaTexas conference series is to
enhance the educational and research atmosphere of combinatorialists in Texas
and the surrounding states, increase communication between mathematicians of the
region, and provide a forum for presentation and discussion of the most recent
developments in the field of Combinatorics. Ever since Texas A&M University
hosted the first conference in 2000, it has been held almost every year at
different institutions in the South Central United States. CombinaTexas 2016 is
the sixteenth conference in this series. The conference will be publicized using
distribution lists and on related conference websites (a conference website is
at http://www.math.tamu.edu/conferences/combinatexas/ including titles and
abstracts of the speakers).

The conference will feature a broad selection of combinatorial research,
including Algebraic Combinatorics, Enumerative Combinatorics, Geometric
Combinatorics, a wide range of areas in Graph Theory, and various applications.
A Special Session on Graph Theory will be led by plenary speakers Professors
Neil Robertson and Guoli Ding. The confirmed plenary speakers are Professor
Bruno Benedetti (U Miami), Professor Guoli Ding (LSU), Professor Fu Liu (UC
Davis), Professor Nicholas Loehr (Virginia Tech), Professor Neil Robertson (Ohio
State) and Professor Anne Shiu (Texas A&M).
