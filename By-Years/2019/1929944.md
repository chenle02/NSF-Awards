This is a grant to support a Sustainable Urban Systems (SUS) workshop. The
workshop is designed to facilitate interaction between urban scholars and
practitioners, and reinforce a foundation for holistic urban sustainability
action. This workshop is to be driven by urban practitioners, informed by urban
scholars, and grounded in existing and emerging real-world urban sustainability
challenges. It will bring together urban sustainability practitioner networks
and research networks to build a joint actionable research agenda for urban
sustainability transformation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This actionable research
agenda will apply the principles of co-production to incorporate new and
existing knowledge from scientific, experiential, and indigenous sources to
directly confront the challenge of urban sustainability transformations, all
while remaining grounded in the needs of practitioners. This co-produced agenda,
and integrating its ideas into active networks, research, and teaching
initiatives, is targeted to to support movement towards sustainable urban
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
