There is widespread research, business and policy interest in the growing impact
of Information and Communication Technologies (IT) on firm productivity, income
and inequality. This project would work with the US Census Bureau to collect a
massive new 55,000 plant dataset on IT use, twinned with detailed firm
management and performance data, and worker income data to investigate the
causes and effects of IT. This would create a Census super-survey to be publicly
available in the Census RDCs for researchers around the US to use, and on-line
as a Public Use Microdata Set (PUMS) for the broad research, business and policy
access. In addition, the project would use this new dataset to undertake
detailed empirical analysis to describe and determine the causes of effects of
computerization, exploiting the rich regional, industry and firm variation in
the dataset spanning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In particular, the project will
combine this dataset with detailed Census plant, firm and worker level data, as
well as external data, to undertake empirical analysis to describe and determine
the causes and effects of the use of IT and variations in management practices
on a range of outcomes including growth, innovation, productivity, employment
and inequality. It will utilize the rich regional, industry and firm variation
in the dataset to deliver both accurate measurement and identification of the
drivers of adoption of these practices. The findings would be highly relevant
for public policy, business decisions and academic research.
