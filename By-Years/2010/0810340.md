This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I SBIR research project will
prototype a MEMS-based hydrocarbon gas sensor. The MEMS-based gas sensor uses a
microfabricated photonic crystal to emit infrared light in a specific portion of
the electromagnetic spectrum. The wavelength can be tuned by design to overlap
an absorption band of methane, for example, to make a small, sensitive,
efficient detector of methane or other toxic or flammable gas. The MEMS-based
approach also includes a microfabricated anti-reflective surface, which uses
microfabricated sub-wavelength features to reduce the effective index of
refraction of the wafer material. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of
this approach is to produce MEMS-based gas sensors having a well defined
absorption band in the infrared. The technique may be readily adapted to make
other gas sensors, such as carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, nitric
oxide, nitrogen dioxide and sulphurous compounds. The microfabricated anti-
reflective structures may be applied to infrared devices such as spectrometers,
optical elements, and other infrared emitters and detectors. Methane sensors may
be made which are inexpensive enough to equip individual members of a mining
team, greatly improving mining safety.&lt;br/&gt;
