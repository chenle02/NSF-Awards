This Math and Science Partnership includes San Francisco State University, the
Berkeley Unified School District, the Jefferson Elementary School District, and
the South San Francisco Unified School District.

The partnership is focusing on improving student performance in algebra by
uniting three distinct groups of educators: middle and high school algebra
teachers (grades 8-10), undergraduate mathematics majors with interests in
secondary education, and graduate mathematics students who teach remedial
college algebra. The cohort is working together to ensure the successful
learning of algebra for students, particularly underrepresented students, at the
high school and undergraduate level. Improved student achievement results from
the collaboration and its emphasis on improving the effectiveness of teachers. A
key component of the project is professional development based on the Japanese
lesson study model that engages teams of teachers and graduate students in
professional discussions centered on classroom lessons. Benchmarks include
increased percentages of students enrolling in and passing both high school and
college algebra courses. Undergraduate mathematics majors, by assisting in the
secondary schools, receive the classroom experience needed to encourage them to
become teachers while improving their teaching capabilities.
