&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this research involves the asymmetric hydroacylation of
alkenes catalyzed by transition metal complexes. In addition, a newly discovered
rhodium-catalyzed [4+2] cycloaddition reaction leading to the production of
hydronaphthalenes and substituted naphthols will be
developed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this Research in Undergraduate Institutions
(RUI) award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the
research and educational activities of Dr. Andrew T. Morehead in the Department
of Chemistry at East Carolina University. Professor Morehead will focus his work
on developing methods for the asymmetric synthesis indanones; a structural unit
found in a large number of natural and synthetically prepared organic systems.
The project will include the training of undergraduates and masters level
students and the broader impact of the work will be mainly in that area.
