The project studies computational methods for learning and generating
distributions of stochastic interacting particle representations of mathematical
models in physics and biology. A new class of computational tools integrating
particle simulation and machine learning will be developed for a wide range of
applications in science and engineering such as modeling and prediction of large
scale pattern formation of bacteria and insects, cancer cell invasion, wildfire
spreading, and turbulent combustion in energy production. The light weight deep
neural networks trained from data generated by particle simulations speed up
prediction significantly, and potentially extend to field data in various
domains with broader impacts. The planned education and out-reach activities
help students, especially under-represented students, on multiple campuses to
pursue advanced degrees and careers.

The mathematical models under study are three space dimensional time dependent
advection-reaction-diffusion partial differential equations challenging to
compute by traditional mesh based methods especially when their solutions
develop large gradients or concentrations at unknown locations. The project aims
to address this challenge through an integrated framework of deep learning,
optimal transport, and field-coupled stochastic interacting particle dynamics,
the so called Deep Particle. The approach is mesh free, self-adaptive and does
not require particle distributions to have invertible mappings between them. The
project also investigates convergence and acceleration aspects of the resulting
algorithms.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
