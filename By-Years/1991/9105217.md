Working with Drs. Thomas Ricketts, Paul Guyer, and Gary Hatfield, Dr. Richardson
is examining the late 19th and early 20th century philosophical and scientific
background in Germany against which logical empiricism was developed in the
1920s. In particular, he is looking at the problematic of seeking the correct
understanding of the role of logic and mathematics in empirical scientific
knowledge that guides most of the scientifically oriented epistemological
schools (Neo-Kantians, Psychologists, Phenomenologists) in Germany during the
fifty years before the rise of logical empiricism. Moreover, he is investigating
the methodological remarks of the leading scientists of this time (Helmholtz,
Mach, Planck, Poincare, Duhem, Einstein) and the interpretation of those remarks
by German philosophers to see how scientific achievements were philosophically
understood in this period. This is part of a larger project to understand the
philosophical and scientific pressures leading to the development of the though
of Rudolf Carnap from his Neo-Kantian first writings through his constructive
program of 1928 to mature empiricism in his work in the 1930s.
