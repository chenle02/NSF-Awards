This project supports attendance by 20 students and postdoctoral researchers at
the Second International Conference on Homotopy Type Theory, to be held 22–25
May 2023 at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. Homotopy type theory is a
new field of Mathematics that draws on multiple disciplines, including logic,
homotopy theory, category theory, and computer science. It is closely tied to
the development of new computerized proof assistants that permit mathematical
proofs to be constructed interactively and verified to be correct. Student
participants will learn about both the theory and practice of such computational
tools, which are becoming increasingly important in the exact sciences.

Homotopy type theory is based on recently discovered connections between
constructive type theory, homotopy theory, and higher category theory. Martin-
Löf’s dependent type theory is a formal system that underlies computerized proof
assistants such as Lean, Coq, and Agda. This system was recently shown to
interpret into certain higher-categories originally developed for homotopy
theory. As a result, it can also be used for reasoning in higher mathematics.
Importantly, the proof assistants based on it can then be used to formally
verify difficult results in these areas not previously attainable by such tools.
Extensions to the system suggested by the new applications also greatly extend
the range of mathematics that can be developed and formalized using proof
assistants. Conference website: https://hott.github.io/HoTT-2023
