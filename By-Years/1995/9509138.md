Abstract FARNET, Inc. NCR-9509138 PI: Jim Williams FARNET proposes a three-year
project to design, develop and deploy an on-line guide to telecommunications
infrastructure, Internet penetration and strategic directions for each of the
United States. No comprehensive resource exists which describes state networking
infrastructure, current capabilities and strategic intentions. FARNET will
proposes to collect information from each of the states, organize the
information and provide gopher and world-wide web servers to the Internet
community. FARNET will be responsible for the collection and organization of the
data, they propose that the InterNIC Database and Directory Services (AT&T) be
the repository of the collected information. The document will have value when
initially produced, the nature of networking in the United States is one of
change. The document will have to be maintained and updated as State
infrastructure or intentions change, it will be of even greater value. The 3
year project will terminate with an information resource that will be self
sustaining with information maintained by each of the states.
