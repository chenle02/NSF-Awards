Abstract 9627465 Sawyer The combustion Institute holds biennial international
meetings for presentation of the latest experimental and theoretical results
across the spectrum of Combustion Science and Engineering. The 1996 meeting will
be held on July 28 - August 2, 1994 at the University of Naples, Italy. The
Combustion Institute encourages outstanding scientists and engineers to
participate in the symposium and assists young investigators in attending. This
has maintained a higher level of activity and interest in combustion than would
have otherwise existed. The Symposium proceedings will be published; funds are
being supplied to help offset these costs.
