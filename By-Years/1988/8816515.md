This project is an experimental and theoretical study of ice crystals in the
antarctic atmosphere and the halos that they produce. The objectives are to make
observations of natural halos at South Pole Station and to sample ice crystals
in order to validate computer models of light refraction and reflection in ice
crystals. Such models have the potential for the remote sensing of atmospheric
conditions. Controlled experiments, such as seeding the atmosphere with dry ice,
will produce artificially generated, but simple and well-formed single- species
crystals. The project provides a unique mechanism for examining the crystal
growth and evolution process in the natural atmosphere; it also allows an
examination of the flaling mode (related to residence time) of crystals in the
atmosphere. It will advance our understanding of the reasons for the growth of
well-formed ice crystals, which is a characteristic of the antarctic atmosphere,
but is not generally observed elsewhere.
