The OneOklahoma Friction Free Network (OFFN) is a collaboration among four
Oklahoma institutions that have significant High Performance Computing resources
available for academic research: the University of Oklahoma, Oklahoma State
University, the Tandy Supercomputing Center of the Oklahoma Innovation
Institute, and Langston University, Oklahoma's only Historically Black
University, along with OneNet, Oklahoma's education, research and government
information and telecommunications network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Triggered by
research needs in high energy physics, numerical weather prediction,
bioinformatics and weather radar, but available for researchers across all
Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines statewide,
OFFN serves as a crucial component of the OneOklahoma Cyberinfrastructure
Initiative (OneOCII), which provides resources and services to researchers and
educators across the state, and which has so far has served almost 100
institutions and organizations, approximately half of them
academic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project addresses key national
Cyberinfrastructure priorities, specifically deployment of friction free
networking and software defined networking capabilities. Objectives
include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Deploy and maintain, at the four institutions,
a research-only network consisting of institutional last mile components that
are independent of enterprise networks, with its internal hub collocated with
OneNet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Apply Software Defined Networking across OFFN,
facilitating end-to-end management, by researchers, of high bandwidth/high
performance data flows through a distributed hierarchy of open standards tools,
giving researchers a new layer of transparency into network
transport.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Provide these capabilities -- OFFN's in
particular and OneOCII's in general -- to all relevant researchers and educators
statewide, and facilitate their use.
