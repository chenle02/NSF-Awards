The investigator and his colleagues study new methods to recover a signal from
a nonlinear processing scheme. Recently two far-reaching discoveries have been
made that connected the nonlinear information (magnitudes of frame coefficients)
to certain scalar products in larger embedding spaces. Thus the initial problem,
which is fundamentally nonlinear, is recast into a linear reconstruction problem
coupled with a rank-one approximation problem. When the linear redundant
representation is associated with a group representation (such as Weyl-
Heisenberg, or windowed Fourier transform), then the relevant tensor operators
inherit this invariance property. Thus a fast (nonlinear) reconstruction
algorithm is possible. This approach suggests a new signal representation model,
where signals are not represented simply by vectors in a Hilbert space, but
rather by operators in a larger dimensional Hilbert-Schmidt like-space, similar
to the quantum state theory. These methods use results from a wide range of
mathematical areas such as harmonic analysis, operator theory, and polynomial
algebras.

Results of this project have a practical application to areas such as signal
processing, optical communication, quantum computing, and X-ray crystallography.
Besides advancing the scientific understanding in applied harmonic analysis,
this project broadens the two-way communication between mathematics and
electrical engineering while promoting teaching, training and learning. The
investigator is training graduate students for a globally competitive STEM force
through his contacts with industry and international research labs. The project
is supported by the Division of Mathematical Sciences and the Division of
Computing and Communication Foundations.
