This proposal is part of an integrated scientific investigation to study the
properties of the Arctic ocean, atmosphere, and sea-ice on a transect between
Murmansk, USSR and Nome, Alaska. It will conduct helicopter-born sea ice
thickness measurements using a unique electromagnetic induction sounding system
recently developed for this purpose. The survey data will be used to assess mean
sea ice thickness and salt content in relation to latitude and longitude. This
information will be useful in providing ground-truth for satellite systems
currently in use and in providing a bench mark for sea ice motion and
thermodynamic models.
