Acquisition of scanning UV-visible spectrophotometers will result in a
significant upgrading of the undergraduate biochemistry laboratory program.
While laboratory experience is an integral and important part of undergraduate
biochemistry education at Cal State L.A., experiments involving modern UV-
visible spectrophotometry have not been implemented due to a lack of appropriate
instrumentation. The new equipment will allow development of spectroscopy-based
experiments that familiarize students with modern techniques and concepts
relating to the structure and function of nucleic acids and proteins.
