9508415 Thompson The Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Hunter College,
The City of University of New York, will purchase a workstation, X-terminals,
and a postscript laser printer, which will be dedicated to the support of
research in the mathematical sciences. The equipment will be used for several
research projects, including in particular: l. Computing the v1-periodic
homotopy groups of SO(n). 2. Computing differential Galois groups in Hamiltonian
dynamics, determining lax pairs of matrices in Hamiltonian systems, and normal
forms in graded Lie algebras. 3. Studying amalgamated product decompositions of
one-relator groups with at least three generators. 4. Computations of the
homology of subquotients of the Lambda algebra, and determining relations among
homology operations in the Morava K-theory of infinite loop spaces.
