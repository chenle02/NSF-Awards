9705752 Hsiang This project lies in the area of differential geometry and its
applications to mechanics. Specifically, the investigator is to pursue a
geometric approach to the three body problems, both in celestial mechanics and
in quantum mechanics. The idea is to introduce a natural metric on the
configuration space of a given mechanical system such that the kinetic energy of
a motion is given by half of the square of speed; one then studies the resulting
kinematic riemannian manifold, making use of the Euclidean symmetry group. In
addition, the investigator is to continue his work on minimal hypersurfaces and
isoperimetric regions. The classical three body problem has to do with
understanding the orbit structures of triples of mass points under gravity. A
key idea in the current project is to study the three body problem with the
kinetic energy of a motion as a starting point. Minimal hypersurfaces are higher
dimensional generalizations of soap film surfaces; they satisfy remarkable
extremal properties.
