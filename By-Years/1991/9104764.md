This research is to determine the S-wave velocity structure of the subducting
Kurile and Japan lithospheric slabs using differential residual sphere
procedures. Past studies have concentrated mainly on P-wave velocity structure,
and considerable controversy continues about the results, especially whether the
slab penetrates the lower mantle. S-waves are more difficult to measure but are
now accessible because of advances in instrumentation. S-waves are more
sensitive to the thermal and chemical structure of the slab and may help resolve
fundamental questions about mantle dynamics.
