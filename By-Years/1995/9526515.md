9526515 Chou The goal of the proposed research is to experimentally demonstrate
an innovative ultra-high frequency polarization-switching vertical-cavity
surface-emitting laser (PS-VCSEL) that we have proposed recently 1 . the
innovative laser is based on our recent development of the artificial quarter-
wave plates that employ nanoscale amorphous silicon gratings with periods less
than the wavelength of light (i.e.: subwavelength) 2 . The unique feature of the
subwavelength-grating quarter-wave plate is that its birefringence is over three
orders of magnitude higher than that in a natural birefringence crystal such as
quartz. Therefore, use of such subwavelength-grating quarter-wave plate will
reduce the extended cavity of PS-VCSEL by three order of magnitude and increase
the oscillation frequency by three orders of magnitude. ***
