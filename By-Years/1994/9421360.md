9421360 Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase) has been
shown to be involved in learning and memory in both mammals and fruit flies.
This enzyme has properties which have suggested that it may be a "molecular
switch", capable of initiating changes in cellular properties. Studies of CaM
kinase in Drosophila melanogaster have shown that this enzyme is required for
learning and memory in an associative behavior. In addition, it has been shown
that the larval neuromuscular junction of flies expressing an inhibitor of CaM
kinase produce abnormal repetitive firing to single stimuli, and have depressed
plasticity. This model system is being used to investigate the molecular basis
of these effects. A mutant lacking CaM kinase provides a template on which to
test theories about the enzymatic properties of the kinase which are required
for normal neuronal activity.
