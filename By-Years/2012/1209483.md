This action funds Lisa Jung of the University of Colorado at Boulder to conduct
a research project, entitled "Exploring reproduction of an invertebrate filter
feeder, the lancelet," during the summer of 2012 at Institute of Cellular and
Organismic Biology in Taipei, Taiwan with host scientist Dr. Jr-Kai Yu.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to explore hormone-signaling
pathways that regulate reproduction in the lancelet. Lancelet is an important
animal for studying vertebrate evolution because it serves as a missing link
between invertebrates and vertebrates and it closely resembles the ancestor that
gave rise to the vertebrates. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is a crucial
neuropeptide for regulating reproduction in vertebrates. Establishing the
presence of a GnRH signaling pathway in this animal is the focus of this
research and can provide undeniable proof that vertebrate GnRH and protostomian
GnRH are, in fact, related and that GnRH is an ancient peptide that arose before
the divergence of protostomes and deuterostomes.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to foster international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware American
scientific workforce.
