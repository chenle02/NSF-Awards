This travel award will provide support for six early career scientists from the
U.S. to attend an international Chapman conference on Arctic magmatism. The
purpose of the conference is to synthesize understanding of geology and
geophysics of the Arctic Ocean and the surrounding continents and to identify
areas ripe for future research. To inform the broader scientific community, the
organizers will publish a white paper summarizing these points and also will
hold a post-conference session at the American Geophysical Union's Fall 2020
meeting. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project ensures early career scientists from
the U.S. will be able to participate in an upcoming AGU Chapman Conference in
Selfoss, Iceland, Large-scale Volcanism in the Arctic: The Role of the Mantle
and Tectonics. It will focus on five themes: 1) Pre-breakup rifting; 2) seafloor
spreading; 3) mantle-derived heterogeneity (including plumes and large-igneous
provinces); 4) subduction related volcanism; and 5) High Arctic Large Igneous
Province and environmental effects extending from the Paleozoic to the present
day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
