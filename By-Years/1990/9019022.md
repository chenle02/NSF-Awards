Forearc deposits are commonly deformed soon after they are formed due to
continuing convergence between plates, however, the style of deformation may
vary depending on convergence angles and rates. Also most modern forearcs are
largely submarine and are difficult to study. This project will focus on
deformation of a Pliocene and Pleistocene forearc exposed on the east coast of
North Island, New Zealand, an area experiencing active deformation and
seismicity resulting from oblique convergence between the Pacific and Australian
plates. The project will involve detailed geologic mapping, strain analysis of
fault sets and investigation of Holocene fault and fold deformation in a region
having a gradation of convergence angles. Results will increase understanding of
both the structure and tectonic evolution of the area and will document strain
partitioning in obliquely convergent margins. It will also provide information
on possible changes in strain caused by increasing obliquity of convergence.
Such information will be applicable in other modern examples of forearc
deformation and in interpreting ancient forearc situations.
