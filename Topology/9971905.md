Abstract: A fundamental problem of quantum topology is that of finding
topological interpretations for the new invariants of 3-manifolds. The first
part of this project places quantum invariants in the context of knot theory and
representation theory. The investigator intends to use this context to analyze
the asymptotic behavior of the quantum invariants of a 3-manifold in terms of
representations of its fundamental group. The second part involves applying the
quantum invariants to form criteria for the existence of symmetries in a
3-manifold.

The field of quantum topology began just over a decade ago with the discoveries
of the Jones polynomial, by the mathematician V. Jones, and with the physicist's
E. Witten's explanation of this polynomial in terms of the topological quantum
field theory. Today it continues to be a dynamic area of research bringing
together constructs and techniques from physics, algebra, geometry, and
topology. The purpose of this project is to investigate further how these ideas
fit together.
