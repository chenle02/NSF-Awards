This research deals with the continuation of previous studies on the toughening
mechanisms in zirconia alloys. The work will focus on two technically important
systems with magnesia and ceria stabilizers, and will extend the previous
microanalytical efforts, primarily via transmission electron microscopy, to
include mechanical characterization and in situ studies of crack propagation.
The study will address the very important question of the R-curve behavior in
these materials, which requires a close collaboration between mechanical testing
and microanalytical procedures. The materials being investigated here, and the
toughening mechanisms being evaluated are extremely important from a
technological standpoint, as the zirconia alloys and derivatives will have
increasing number of applications in various products. Previous development of
these materials has been largely empirical in nature, and development of a
better scientific understanding of the toughening mechanisms in these systems
would greatly aid future development and applications. The mechanisms of
toughening in these materials are quite complex, and understanding the details
of these mechanisms requires careful and detailed scientific analysis of the
materials and the processes occurring therein.
