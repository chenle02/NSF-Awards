9452724 Llamas A four-state consortium will provide a framework for a regional
self-study of the educational and economic barriers to systemic reform, for a
highly impoverished, geographically isolated, and culturally diverse region with
a high minority population. The consortium will organize, liason, and provide
direction and technical assistance to nine coalitions which represent the
geographic and tribal areas. During the Development period, each coalition will
work with its respective community to determine needs and strategies to be
implemented within the framework of RSI, and the consortium will integrate the
needs of the areas into an overall plan for the region.
