This project is to monitor the variability of the dynamic topography, the
transport, and meridional displacement of the Brazil Current in the vicinity of
the Brazil-Malvinas confluence. The project calls for the deployment of inverted
echo sounders (IES) in the current is association with Argentine and French
scientists who will be carrying out an extensive CTD and mooring experiment in
the area. In addition, satellite data will be collected from the area and
analyzed by the U. Miami scientists. These data will form the basis for better
understanding of the variability of the region, and for a more appropriate
modeling effort of the current interactions.
