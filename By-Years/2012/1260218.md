The Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army in Sudan has stopped using child
soldiers while the Lord's Resistance Army in Uganda continued the practice. Why
do some rebel groups in civil wars follow the laws of war while others do not?
This question is puzzling because rebel groups are not usually creators of
international law. Also, in many cases, their rights and obligations under
international law are not clear. Given this legal and political environment and
with often-dominating military-strategic imperatives, under what conditions
would rebel groups follow the laws of war?

To solve the puzzle, this project proposes to study why rebel groups in civil
conflicts abide by international law. Grounded on the theories of compliance and
political legitimacy, the researcher hypothesizes that rebel groups abide by
laws of war when they have political aims to be recognized as a viable political
entity. To test the hypothesis, the researcher will statistically analyze the
behaviors of armed opposition groups in civil wars between 1991 and 2010 to
examine three compliance behaviors of rebel groups: (1) the use of child
soldiers, (2) the killing of civilians, and (3) the treatment of detainees.

The project is important for two reasons. From a scholarly point of view, the
project solves a theoretical puzzle as to why rebel groups would follow
international rules that they did not initially create. The question has not
been fully answered in the existing literature because scholars of international
relations have thus far focused on the behavior of nation-states. From a
practical point of view, the project has broad impacts for human security. As
some seventeen million people have died in civil conflicts over the past half-
century, the answer to the proposed research question will advance our
understanding about when and how to engage rebel groups and encourage them to
comply with international law.
