In response to an Announcement of Opportunity for the Global Learning and
Observations to Benefit the Environment Program (GLOBE) this project is designed
to meet GLOBE goals and objectives of linking scientists and schoolchildren in a
global information network with the ultimate goal of better understanding
Earth's environment and changes that take place within it. This proposal will
support existing protocols, and conduct scientific research with GLOBE data. The
project will continue to support the protocol for the measurement of snow and
cloud cover, as well as soil moisture. In addition, this team will develop new
protocols for the measurement of Surface Temperature, and lead the Soil Moisture
investigation. This team is already using past GLOBE data to do validation work
for the snow detection algorithm and cloud screening technique from the Moderate
Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) on NASA's Terra satellite, and this
grant will allow validation work on the MODIS surface temperature measurements.
This grant will form part of an energy-budget suite of GLOBE investigations that
will cover soil temperature and moisture, atmospheric temperature and humidity,
cloud cover, and aerosol optical thickness - all factors that must be considered
in an energy budget.
