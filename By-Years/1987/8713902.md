This Research Opportunity Award (ROA) will support participation by a faculty
member of a non-Ph.D. granting institution in research at the Princeton
University Cyclotron Laboratory. The faculty member will assist an ongoing
Princeton study of the collective properties of medium-weight and heavy even-
even nuclei. The goal is to compare predictions based on group-theoretic models
with new spectroscopic data.
