The focus of this study is to utilize historical information in order to
examine and document relationships between land use and the character of
lakewater chemistry and phytoplankton biodiversity in a suite of 30 lakes. Three
sets of historical information will be assembled for each of the 30 waterbodies.
The first set of data will consist of a detailed analysis of the siliceous algal
phytoplankton flora for each lake for 1934, 1970, 1990, and for pre-European
settlement. The floras will be determined using microfossil remains from
lead-210 dated sediment cores. The second set of data will consist of lakewater
chemical analyses from the same time periods assembled from actual chemical
records and/or inferred from paleolimnological inference models. The third set
of data will consist of land use determinations for each surrounding watershed
for 1934, 1970 and 1990, derived from high resolution aerial photographs,
historical maps and other archived land use records. The three sets of data will
be used to correlate changes in the chemical and biological status of each lake
with measured alterations in land use for three time periods, the arrival of
Europeans to the 1930s, the 1930s to 1970s, and the 1970s to 1990s. %%% One of
the primary causes of anthropogenic stress on aquatic ecosystems is the increase
in solute content of runoff from catchment basins caused by a change in land
use. Despite this fact, the impacts that changing land cover patterns have on
receiving waterbodies are poorly understood. The availability of detailed
historical records coupled with the ability to extract data from the sediment
record offers a rare opportunity to analyze the effects of land use on aquatic
ecosystems. A fundamental understanding of how changes from one type of land use
to another could alter a nearby waterbody would provide a powerful tool for lake
management. The integration of historical records, as outlined in this study,
could serve as a model for similar projects in other geographic regions.
