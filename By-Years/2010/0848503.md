Flash memory storage devices are now considered to have tremendous
potential&lt;br/&gt;as a new storage medium that can replace magnetic disks.
Flash memory, however, has its own limitations such as erase-before-update and
exhibits poor performance for small-to-moderate sized writes requested in a
random order. The goal of this project is to develop new flash-aware designs and
optimization strategies that allow large-scale transactional database
applications to run efficiently on computing platforms equipped with flash
memory storage devices as a main storage medium. This project achieves its goal
by (1) analyzing the performance implications of different I/O workloads on
flash memory, and the applicability of flash memory to different types of
tablespaces in databases, (2) inventing new paradigms, designs, data structures
and algorithms, hot spot separation, and write optimization techniques, so that
enterprise database servers can run on the target computing platforms
efficiently.&lt;br/&gt;The findings from this project will not only overcome the
limitations of flash memory but also exploit the advantages of flash memory for
transactional database workloads exhibiting randomly scattered data access
patterns.&lt;br/&gt;The paradigms and processing strategies developed can be
applied to other areas such as health-care and sensor-network based environment
study that require data management on flash memory storage systems. The findings
and deliverables of the project will be disseminated broadly in the form of
software packages, research articles, technical reports, and data sets via the
project web site(http://www.cs.arizona.edu/projects/fmdb).&lt;br/&gt;
