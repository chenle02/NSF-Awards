Modern distributed systems increasingly rely on distributed storage and lookup
services. Existing storage and lookup solutions, however, provide only a subset
of high availability, high scalability, and strong consistency semantics. In
this project, we develop Harmony, a distributed hash table (DHT) aimed at
providing very large scale applications with highly scalable, consistent and
available storage and lookup. We address many significant challenges in
delivering on this goal. First, the Internet has unpredictable node and
communication failures, and preserving consistency in this context is a
difficult task. To address this issue, we provide the abstraction of a
collection of self-managing groups that coordinate to ensure atomic updates to
distributed state. Second, consistency often comes at the cost of reduced
availability. In our system, consistency is an inviolable safety property;
availability is provided through replication. Third, coordination mechanisms for
consistent replication and atomic updates often result in performance penalties.
A key insight in our work is that one can improve performance with coordination
mechanisms for delegation and autonomous execution. Finally, by isolating most
of the communication necessary to preserve consistency within a group, we both
simplify our implementation and improve its scalability. Further, adaptation to
changing workloads and resource constraints is easier because it can take place
within a framework for the consistent update of distributed state. If
successful, the resulting storage abstraction should greatly simplify the
development of complex distributed applications.
