PROJECT SUMMARY We seek a new technique for very high speed characterization
and sequencing of polynucleotides such as DNA. The approach relies on the notion
that a linear polymer passing through a suitably small channel or pore in an
otherwise impermeable interface will sequentially modify the local properties of
the pore in a manner that reflects the sequence of monomers in the polymer. Our
recent results using model RNA and DNA polymers that were electrophoretically
driven through a protein channel in a lipid bilayer demonstrate the promise of
this approach, but are limited by the delicacy of the organic protein-lipid
interface which cannot tolerate the denaturants and temperatures required to
eliminate base pairing and other secondary structures in native polynucleotides.
The short term goals of this proposal are to develop a robust, inorganic
interface (silicon nitride) that will duplicate the results obtained with the
organic interface and lead to the development of an instrument for very high
speed sizing of native polynucleotides. Accomplishing these short term goals
will demonstrate the feasibility of using a small channel in an inorganic
interface as the base on which to develop a novel sensing device for high speed
sequencing of single DNA molecules. Because this approach eliminates several of
the currently required preparatory chemical steps in DNA sequencing, and because
it depends on inherently rapid, molecular events, success with this method will
be an extraordinarily important advance that should reduce the time and cost of
nucleic acid sequencing by several orders of magnitude.
