New experiments in modern optics will be introduced, and the introductory
teaching laboratory in waves and optics for non-science students as well as for
physics majors will be modernized at the University of Chicago. New
instrumentation would allow experiments in fiber optics, image processing and
Fourier optics, in addition to those in holography, diffraction and
interference, polarization, laser physics and photo- electric effect. Today,
students encounter applications of the new optical technology in the outside
world: fiber optic communication, laser compact discs, bar code readers, laser
surgery and holograms. This contact and awareness of modern developments will be
exploited by novel experiments in the undergraduate teaching laboratories. New
physical science courses for the non-science student have been developed
recently at the University of Chicago and there is an urgent need to create new
experimental protocols in modern optics.
