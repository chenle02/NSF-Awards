This research, part of the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, utilizes
laser based spectroscopies to investigate the reactions between first row
transition metal atoms, dimers, and trimers with various oxidants. Also, the
reactions of carbon monoxide entrained metal atoms with oxidants like ozone or
the halogens will be surveyed. The goals of this work will be to establish
reaction energetics and to obtain electronic structure information about the
molecules involved in these reactions. Completion of this project is expected to
provide new data which will offer new insights into the dynamics of metal
surface oxidation and catalytic oxidation processes. A combination of
chemiluminescent probes and mass spectrometry will be used to explore the
dynamics of metal cluster oxidation, to establish optical signatures for the
metal cluster oxides and halides, and to study the electronic structure of
transition metal clusters. A high flux continuous flow metal entrainment source
will be employed. In addition, the possibility of using a continuous-flow metal
supersonic expansion or a laser vaporization based pulsed cluster source will be
explored.
