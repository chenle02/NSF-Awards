This project is designing and implementing gateway exams in the general
chemistry course for pre-engineering students. Recognizing the service nature of
this course, we are identifying skills and abilities that are part of general
chemistry which provide important building blocks for advanced engineering
courses. These traits go beyond declarative knowledge of specific chemical facts
and incorporate key conceptual development and problem solving strategies. A
diverse advisory panel including faculty from Chemistry, Engineering and
Educational Psychology is serving a facilitating role in this project. The first
objective of the project is to identify, with input from this panel, the skills
and abilities taught in general chemistry that are core to the engineering
curriculum. Instruments are being devised to measure the competence of students
in these areas. The resultant examinations are being used to assure minimum
competency of students who pass the general chemistry course. Students who meet
the minimum standards are assured of a passing grade in the course, though
higher grades require more than minimal competence on this subset of content.
The logistics of administering retakes of gateway exams in large lecture courses
is being addressed.
