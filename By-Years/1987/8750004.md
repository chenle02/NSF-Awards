The primary goal of this project is to develop laboratories that will give
students of psychology, psychobiology, and related health sciences hands-on
experience with state-of-the-art equipment and procedures to understand recent
advances in the theoretical and applied use of the "Fourier-analysis" hypothesis
of spatial vision. Under this project a visual-image synthesizer and small
computer are requested so that laboratories involving psychophysical testing
procedures with sine-wave grating stimuli can be developed. Students will learn
to test human contrast sensitivity, to interpret the resulting contrast-
sensitivity functions, and observe the effects of manipulating the conditions of
testing. A set of demonstrations will be developed for use in non-laboratory
oriented classes.
