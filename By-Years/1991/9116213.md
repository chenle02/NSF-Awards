Recent developments in long period seismology provide an opportunity to
constrain the large scale framework of tectonics through seismic velocity
variation in the oceanic upper mantle. Resolution has been improved to a level
of about 100 km and important details of ridges and hotspots can be observed. In
order to improve the seismic structure and discover further correlation with
tectonic features, the principal investigator will work on the following: (1)
extension of surface wave data to obtain better coverage in the southern
hemisphere, (2) analysis of shorter period surface waves to improve resolution
within the lithosphere, (3) waveform analysis of S, SS, SSS,... and P, PP,
PPP,... type body waves in order to increase depth resolution, and (4) joint
analysis of seismic, geoid, and topography data to examine consistency of
models.
