A major obstacle in developing scientific literacy is the misconceptions that
people have and which they will retain unless the misconceptions are identified
and challenged methodically. A powerful approach for the identification of and
challenge to misconceptions is the 5E teaching cycle (engage, explore, explain,
elaborate and evaluate). Although this approach has been applied somewhat in
K-12 education, it has seldom been used at the college level, especially for
large enrollment courses. The objective of this project is to identify and
address misconceptions about ecology and evolution using the 5E teaching cycle
in large enrollment courses. The project is focusing on developing pre- and
post-assessments that identify misconceptions for each unit of the courses, by
applying results and techniques of published studies about misconceptions.
Assessments are being tested at other institutions. In addition, 5E teaching
cycles are being developed that explicitly challenge the misconceptions.
Excellent materials for engaging students and appropriate instructional
technology for the 5E phases are already available, but what is needed is
assembly of these into effective 5E cycles and linked units. The 5E cycles will
be developed and tested. The aim is that: 1) students develop a better
conceptual understanding of ecology and evolution, 2) students have a more
positive attitude about science, 3) students have a more positive experience in
large enrollment courses, and 4) future teachers learn how to implement the 5E
teaching cycle.
