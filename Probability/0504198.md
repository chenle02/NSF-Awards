This research will advance the understanding of new mathematical connections
between different theories that model physical phenomena of significant
practical interest. Starting from intuitive formulas for the conditional means
and conditional variances of stochastic processes, the proposer will study the
class of associated orthogonal martingale polynomials and use them to construct
new Markov processes. These polynomials will be described by a q-commutation
equation which will provide a new link between the noncommutative and
commutative probability, and will tie together theories as different as
Hammersley's probabilistic models of long-range misorientation in the
crystalline structure of metals and Frisch and Bourret parastochastic models of
turbulence convection.

The project will advance the understanding of connections between the classical
probability which is the foundation of statistics, and the non-commutative
probability which is a foundation of quantum physics. It will be advanced
through personal research, through research with graduate students, and through
cooperative activities with several mathematicians in USA and in Europe. The
results will be disseminated broadly and in a timely manner through the use of
the Internet, through presentations at conferences and workshops, and through
research publications.
