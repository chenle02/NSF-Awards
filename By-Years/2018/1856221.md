The mathematician Stefan Banach defined a mathematical object that we now call a
Banach space. The theory of Banach spaces extended certain work of Volterra and
Hilbert, among others. Operators on Banach spaces form the mathematical models
for many objects in physics and engineering. Banach space operator theory has a
long history within mathematics itself and is connected to other areas of
mathematics, including partial differential equations and algebraic topology.
The focus of this project is on certain aspects of the theory of operators on
Banach spaces that have relevance for physics, engineering, and various areas of
mathematics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goal of this project is to extend
useful results concerning operators on Hilbert spaces to the setting of Banach
spaces. For instance, the extent to which results about extensions of
C*-algebras hold for algebras of operators on Banach spaces is considered. Since
many proofs about operators on Hilbert spaces do not directly generalize to
operators on Banach spaces, it is expected that extending these results requires
different approaches. Results from Banach space theory, especially the use of
probabilistic techniques, are expected to be useful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
