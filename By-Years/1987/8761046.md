This SBIR project will study the effects on layer interface abruptness of OMCVD
reactor design. Three different verticle reactor configurations will be
investigated: the pancake-shaped susceptor, the barrel-shaped susceptor, and the
dual susceptor. Although all three configurations are vertical reactors, the gas
dynamics and thermal profiles in all three are different. These differences are
expected to lead to vastly difference surface conditions and interface
formation. This study will focus on the generation of a data base and
understanding of III-V heterostructures and interfaces, especially in the
GaAs/AlGaAs system. A preliminary model to describe interface formation for the
different reactors of interest will be developed. The completion of Phase 1 will
identify growth experiments that need to be carried out in order to verify the
model. Phase 2 will involve growth and characterization of heterostructures to
feedback into the model, and to allow prediction of interface formation. The
combined phases 1 and 2 work should lead to a understanding of the fundamental
mechanisms involved in interface formation in OMCVD. Such understanding will be
necessary for the design and fabrication of the next generation of III-V
devices.
