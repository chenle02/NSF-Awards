David Reichman is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and
Computational Methods program in the Chemistry division to develop new
theoretical tools for the study of structure and dynamics in complex systems
that are expected to exhibit novel and useful properties. The rational design of
new materials with novel functionality is the ultimate goal of theoretical and
computational chemistry. Two such examples are the development of a new
framework to understand the relaxation of electrons and holes in organic
semiconductors that will lead to improved light-emitting and photovoltaic
devices and a new theory for understanding ultra-stable glasses that have
demonstrated promise for drug delivery and the development of materials with
tunable mechanical properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research
focuses on two main projects. The first focuses on a computational means of
treating quantum charge and energy transfer and non-equilibrium quantum
transport in strongly interacting condense phase systems. The second focuses on
the dynamics and the structure-dynamics relationship of glass-forming liquids.
All phases of the proposal make use of approaches recently developed in the
Reichman group, including the recent development of the real-time stochastic
bold expansion for the calculation of out-of-equilibrium transport properties in
correlated condensed phase systems, as well as a novel microscopic approach for
the description of dynamical correlation functions in supercooled liquids and
glasses.
