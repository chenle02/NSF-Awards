9423818 Turcotte This research is to combine the mathematical expertise
available at the International Institute of Earthquake Prediction Theory and
Mathematical Geophysics, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, with the evolving
physics research in this country on complexity. The Moscow group is a world
leader in statistical studies of seismicity. The PI is a leader in the discovery
of new approaches to complex physical systems, especially self-organized
criticality as applied to regional seismicity. Realistic models for regional
seismicity will be developed from the wide range of available slider-block
models that exhibit self-organized criticality. These models can be used as test
beds for potential statistical approaches. Combining these two approaches should
advance our understanding of earthquake mechanics, improve earthquake hazard
assessment, and advance earthquake prediction techniques. This research is a
component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program. *** ??
