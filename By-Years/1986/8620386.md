This is a proposal for studying statistical mechanics and dynamics of surfaces
and interfaces. These are important problems of great current interest. Their
studies are expected to lead to a better understanding of structure and behavior
of materials. Dr. Kardar is a young scientist who has already made some
important contributions in this field. He is eminently qualified to do the work.
