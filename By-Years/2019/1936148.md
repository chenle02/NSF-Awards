The Marquette University ADVANCE Adaptation project is designed to improve
equity for STEM faculty at Marquette. Marquette is a Catholic and Jesuit,
Carnegie R2 higher research activity university. Demographic data, climate study
results, and input from focus groups have been used to identify two key equity
and inclusion challenges that will be addressed with this project: 1) recruiting
women and underrepresented faculty effectively, and 2) improving department
level climate. Adaptations to evidence-based best practices to be implemented
are planned to focus on the academic department as the primary unit of change
for institutional transformation. The project is designed to gain insight into
the ways intersecting identities affect faculty experience to implement
appropriate strategies for improving department climate.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will test the adaptations of strategies for
recruiting and mid-career success that have been demonstrated at other ADVANCE
sites that are best suited to institutions in times of rapid institutional
change and growing ambitions like Marquette University. The project will include
new research into use of climate study data to identify issues and facilitate
change. The collaborative activities that cut across horizontal (department and
college) as well as vertical (faculty in all ranks, department chairs, deans,
and other campus leadership) boundaries will serve to build "communities of
practice" committed to diversity, inclusion, collaboration, and the success of
all members of the university community, including faculty and students. The
ADVANCE adaptation project will complement the expected establishment of an
Institute for Women's Leadership at Marquette which is anticipated to be the
home for ADVANCE efforts after the project ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NSF
ADVANCE program is designed to foster gender equity through a focus on the
identification and elimination of organizational barriers that impede the full
participation and advancement of diverse faculty in academic institutions.
Organizational barriers that inhibit equity may exist in policies, processes,
practices, and the organizational culture and climate. ADVANCE "Adaptation"
awards provide support for the adaptation and adoption of evidence-based
strategies to academic, non-profit institution of higher education as well as
non-academic, non-profit organizations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
