The Department of Chemistry has recently completed an extensive review and
revision of the curriculum. A central and novel feature of the new curriculum is
fourth-semester course called Synthesis that supports a number of new curriculum
goals, including independence, involvement, and early experiences in research.
To be fully successful, Synthesis should be taught in an environment where there
is easy access to the tools required for purification and characterization of
compounds and further structural studies, The equipment obtained through this
project. allows the department to fully realize this goal. A graphics package
updated the IBM nmr spectrometer, dramatically enhancing accessibility for less
experienced operators. A preparative, radically accelerated chromatograph
affords separations that are rapid enough for routine use. Finally, computers
and software allow in-lab molecular mechanics modeling routinely during the
course of more traditional lab work. With these and other available tools and
labs that are designed around chemistry that is conceptually accessible at the
second-year -level, student are able to formulate their own questions and
propose and execute experiments to explore those questions. The institution
contributed to this project in an amount equal to the NSF funds.
