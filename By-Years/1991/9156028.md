This project will develop and extend computer-based education that enables
students to visualize abstract aspects of general chemistry. The software
addresses a real learning problem, that of making the transition from two to
three-dimensional representations of objects and models. Existing physical
models of adequate sophistication are helpful, but they take laboratory time and
space, and do not allow views of interior details, nor transitions between
views. In problem solving, therefore, we focus on mathematical/physical
intuition instead of the application of particular algorithms. We help the
students to make connections between physical reality and mathematical
expressions. The computer can show both the exterior of a model and make a
seamless transition between exterior and interior views, including various
intermediate states. To assure the effectiveness of such simulations, we use
sophisticated graphics, sound, and responsive quasi-tactile interaction to
engage the students fully in the learning experience. We will first complete a
module on bonding, to be followed by modules on gas laws, crystal structures,
and solids.
