This award will provide support for the sixth annual UNCG Regional Mathematics
and Statistics Conference, to be held November 5-6, 2010 at the University of
North Carolina at Greensboro.

The conference promotes education and research in the field of mathematics and
statistics specifically tailored for undergraduate and graduate students to
present results of their research and to allow students of all levels (high-
school, undergraduate, graduate) to interact with and learn from each other.
Moreover, faculty mentors and high-school teachers will have an opportunity to
observe and network with peers and find possible collaborators.

While there are various programs across the nation geared towards high-school
students, this conference will provide them an opportunity to actively
participate in a conference. They will be introduced to current interesting
topics in mathematics and statistics by undergraduate and graduate students
making it seem more accessible than being introduced by faculty.

In regard to broadening the participation of underrepresented groups, it is
estimated that women and minorities (who are currently underrepresented in
mathematical research) will account for around half of the participants who will
be funded by this project. Students from these underrepresented groups will be
especially encouraged to participate in the conference and to apply for funding.
