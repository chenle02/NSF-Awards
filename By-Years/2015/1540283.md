Many computer scientists have realized that, in order to productively model and
study the Internet and its novel computational phenomena, they need models and
insights from disciplines such as game theory and economic theory, while many
economists have found that a computational point of view is essential in order
to understand a world in which markets are networked and the default platforms
of economic transactions are algorithmic. Algorithmic Game Theory (AGT) stands
at the intersection of these two fields. It has had significant practical
impact, in a broad range of applications including online, matching and
assignment markets, internet advertising, information diffusion, airport
security, etc.

This workshop will showcase the impact ofÂ  AGT on practice, and explore avenues
for increasing the field's practical impact, including connections to machine
learning, data science, and financial markets.
