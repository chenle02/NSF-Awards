This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project is to develop a
commercial growth process for single crystals of KBe2BO3F2 (KBBF) using
hydrothermal techniques. KBBF shows exceptional promise as a deep UV non-linear
optical material (NLO). NLOs are vital for the development of solid-state lasers
with wavelengths below 200 nm for use in photolithography, micromachining and
spectroscopy. The sub-200 nm region is extremely inaccessible and optics for
those wavelengths are quite rare.

The successful development of commercial KBBF will enable laser applications
such as frequency doubling and wavelength mixing in the deep ultraviolet.
Currently, this material is unavailable in the open market. China has invested
heavily in developing this material but has embargoed its export.
