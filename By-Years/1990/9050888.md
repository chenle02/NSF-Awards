In a department that has, over the past five years, modernized and enhanced its
biology curriculum and introduced much new equipment, the introduction of flow
cytometry can further enhance the students' education. A new benchtop flow
cytometer is being introduced in the non-majors biology course, the introductory
sequence for majors, and in six upper division laboratory courses, as well as
student research projects. Thus, many students can benefit from this new and
rapidly expanding technology, which will greatly enhance their preparation for
graduate school, medical school, or industry. This sophisticated instrument can
serve as a focal element in a curriculum designed to offer introductory through
advanced students a progression of vertically-integrated, hands-on experiences
with modern biological tools. The college will contribute an amount equal to the
award.
