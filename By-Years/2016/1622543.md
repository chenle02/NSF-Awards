A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the
STEM instructional and research capacities of specific institutions of higher
education that serve the Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the STEM
curricular offerings at these institutions expands the opportunities of their
students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for
research studies in areas that may be culturally significant, and encourages a
community and generational appreciation for science and mathematics education.
The focus of the proposal from the University of Montana (UM) is on developing
faculty at tribal institutions, so they too will be able to support the needs of
their students. In addition, UM continues to build and strengthen collaborative
efforts with the Montana tribal colleges, which could provide more opportunities
for tribal students to do research at UM. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University
of Montana will expand upon a pilot to provide tribal college faculty exposure
to UM researchers and research opportunities. Tribal college faculty will be
offered laboratory rotations to gain familiarity with various research groups on
the UM campus, while investigating lab reach practices that are appropriate for
the tribal colleges' campus lab infrastructures, the needs of their students,
and the knowledge, skills, and abilities of the tribal college faculty members.
The research group model will continue to strengthen a faculty network as tribal
college faculty come to the UM campus for one week during the summer and have
two additional meetings during the subsequent academic year.
