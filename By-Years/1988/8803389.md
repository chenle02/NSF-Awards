Funds are requested to upgrade a computer system to be shared among four faculty
members, their associates and their students. The present system, based on an
outdated Ridge 32 computer, is inadequate to handle the tasks of general
crystallographic computing, least-squares refinements of protein structures at
the atomic level, protein dynamics, energy minimization, surface adsorption, and
the requirements as a host machine for an Evans and Sutherland 300 color
graphics instrument. An upgrade to a Ridge 5100 computer system will increase
our throughput by a factor of 10, and allow us to solve and refine the 3-D
structures of macromolecules too large for our present computational
capabilities. Selection of an upgraded Ridge computer is not only cost-
effective, but also will permit direct transfer of all software developed over
the last five years.
