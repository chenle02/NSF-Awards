Thrombin is the blood protein that is capable of stopping bleeding (hemostasis)
and activating platelets to release growth factors that promote bone growth and
healing. Current thrombin products all have one or more safety issues, including
antigenicity, risk of transmitting infectious diseases, and cytotoxicity. The
existing market for thrombin products worldwide is $1.4 billion annually. The
team has developed a technology that provides surgeons the means to prepare
thrombin from the patient's own blood without including cytotoxic chemical
stabilizers. The proposed innovation enables a new thrombin therapeutic to be
generated not only for hemostasis applications, but also for regenerative
medicine applications as cell delivery scaffolds. This team is the first to
create autologous thrombin that poses no risk of an immune response,
transmitting an infectious disease, or causing a cytotoxic reaction at the site
of placement. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Currently, there are four thrombin products
on the market: 1) Thrombin-JMI from King Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which is derived
from cow's blood; 2) EVITHROM from Ethicon, Inc., a Johnson &amp; Johnson
Company, which is derived from pooled plasma from 60,000 human donors; 3)
RECOTHROM from ZymoGenetics, Inc. which is rDNA derived from cultured mammalian
cells; and 4) CLOTALYST from Biomet, Inc., which is autologous thrombin
containing 20% ethanol added as a chemical stabilizer. The team has validated
the chemistry for preparing thrombin from either whole blood or plasma, devised
a practical (alpha prototype) Autologous Thrombin Device that is assembled from
commercially available materials suitable for human use to practice the
chemistry at the point of care, written an 'instructions for use' document,
generated a comprehensive Product Requirements Document, and has filed
provisional and utility patent applications.
