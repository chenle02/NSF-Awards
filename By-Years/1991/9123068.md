Despite the intensity with which the aurora has been studied at radio
wavelengths, there remains a gap in the ground measurements between a few
hundred kiloHertz, the upper range of VLF experiments, and a few tens of
megaHertz, at which riometers operate. A number of ground observations indicate
that emissions are generated by the aurora in this frequency range, but the
observations are spotty, and the nature and even the existence of these
emissions remains uncertain. There is some theoretical work justifying the
investigation of auroral emissions using ground- based instrumentation, but more
systematic observations are needed to lay the groundwork for further theoretical
progress. Under a previous NSF grant, a PC-based instrument for monitoring 0.1-5
MHz radio waves from remote sites has been developed and operated for one
Winter, a preliminary analysis of the data has been done, and publications on
this related subjects have been prepared or published. In the next year, we
propose to continue collecting radio data from Alaska with an improved version
of the instrument. We further propose three specific plans for completing the
analysis of last year's data and the data from the upcoming year. The goals of
the further year of study are: 1) to provide a solid start towards clearing up
the uncertainty regarding the existence of and/or natures of LF/MF/HF emissions
observable on the ground from aurorae; 2) to determine whether the method of
using PC-based radio receivers in the Northern Hemisphere shows promise for
longer-term observations of auroral emissions in the frequency range; and 3) to
complete several specific data analysis goals which are achievable with data
collected last year, and which will be enhanced by a further year of data.
