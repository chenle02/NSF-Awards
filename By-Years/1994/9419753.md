9419753 Cadle the Herpetology Collection of the Museum of Comparative Zoology is
one of the largest and most comprehensive collections of its kind. Well more
than half of the world's named species of amphibians and reptiles is
represented, including representatives of all families. The collection is
exceptionally rich in types and important historical collections. The collection
is heavily used by the international scientific community, as documented by
citations approaching 50 papers per year in papers authored by scientists on all
continents. This project will accomplish the task of retrospective capture of
the collection database using the software system MUSE. Concomitantly, ongoing
cataloguing using the system will be done by permanent curatorial staff. At the
end of the grant period, it is expected that the entire database of more than
300,000 records will be recaptured, and loan invoicing, labeling, and collection
queries fully functional using the computerized system.
