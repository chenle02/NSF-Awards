This two-year project seeks to change the way middle school teachers think
about mathematics. Two one-semester courses for the inservice training of
teachers will be developed and tested by a software development firm, two
institutions of higher education, and an educational collaborative in the Boston
area. Centered on the use of computers, these courses will take advantage of
student materials developed with previous or current NSF support and will be
designed to foster the teachers' skills in mathematical inquiry. Evaluation will
assess the changes in teachers' understanding of and attitude towards
mathematics, and in their classroom practice. An amount equal to 22% of the NSF
award is being contributed as cost-sharing by BBN Laboratories, the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts, Lesley College, the University of Massachusetts at Boston,
Technical Education Research Centers, the Education Collaborative for Greater
Boston, and Apple Computer.
