This project, sponsored by the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation,
is an 18 month project to provide information and resources to 50 carefully
selected, outstanding high school biology teachers from all regions of the
country. The subject content of the program is the study of the relationship of
the human species to its global environment. The program begins with a four week
summer institute held at Princeton University during the summer of 1991, staffed
by a faculty of college and university scientists enlisted nationwide. Institute
activities include presentation - discussion sessions, computer and computer
modeling activities, as well as experiments and demonstrations that can be used
in the high school classroom. These activities culminate in the development of
units that can be used to integrate the information into high school biology
curricula. During the following academic year, the participants implement these
activities in their own classrooms and conduct in-service and outreach sessions
on these activities in their local areas. Teams of the very best participants
conduct one-week workshops at sites throughout the country in succeeding
summers, thus reaching less well-prepared teachers, who are the ultimate target
of the program. The National Science Foundation is a participant in a much
larger program of the Woodrow Wilson Foundation, so that NSF funds are being
matched at a 6.75:1 ratio.
