The award from the Chemistry Division supports an Undergraduate Research Center
(URC) planning grant. The PI is Iraj B. Nejad, assisted by co-PI, Jenny S. Chen.
Mount San Antonio College (Mt. SAC), a two-year institution, will partner with
the University of California at Los Angeles, Occidental College, and California
State University at Los Angeles to pilot a program that provides research
opportunities for Mt. SAC students at these partner institutions. A bridging
program will be developed that includes a multi-level recruitment strategy,
student orientation and preparation, mentorship, student support at the research
institutions, a Mt. SAC Conference Day and presentation of research results, and
program evaluation. The PIs will develop a freshman-level "Orientation to
Research" workshop and a sophomore "Introduction to Research" course in
collaboration with faculty at the four-year institutions. Collaborative research
projects will be developed to encompass more students and allow them to
experience a smooth transition to a four-year institution. The planning period
will be used to develop further partnerships with two-year and four-year
institutions and federal laboratories leading to development of a undergraduate
research center that will provide research opportunities for community college
students at the partner schools.
