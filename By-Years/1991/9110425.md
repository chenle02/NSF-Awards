The design, construction and operation of facilities in extreme environments
present difficult problem, shared among a diverse group of architects,
engineers, scientists and managers. Example of efforts underway are the design
of space and planetary stations, facilities in and under water, research
stations for the polar regions, and remote dwellings. Although the environments
are quite different, many of the problems of supporting human life in these
environments are shared. The exchange of experience and knowledge among those
working in this field can be valuable in addressing these problems. This grant
provides partial support to a conference, the International Design for Extreme
Environments Assembly, which will take place at the University of Houston,
November 12-15, 1991. The conference will provide a setting where experts from a
variety of countries and disciplines can meet to share information about solving
practical problems, both for today and the future.
