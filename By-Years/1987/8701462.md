This is a recommendation for support of research on the mechanisms by which
polysaccharides produced during microbial growth bind copper to sediments in a
flowing stream of water. Results of this research may be applicable to
understanding how other metals in trace concentrations are removed from water
polluted by their presence. Results are also expected to define more clearly the
role of bacteria and their associated exopolymers in sediment processes,
particularly those involving the retention and mobilization of metals. This is a
renewal of work initiated under NSF 8521693 results of which have led to the
isolation of reactive polymers from sediments in a natural stream and selection
of the most efficient process for identification of the uronic acid content of
the microbial exopolymers found in river sediments as a step toward their
complete characterization. Elucidation of the metal- binding characteristics of
microbial polymers in natural aquatic systems may eventually lead to their
application in the recovery of metals from abandoned mineral processing wastes
and industrial process wastewaters. This project has objectives consistent with
those of the Environmental Engineering Program with special relevance to the
element dealing with diffusion, dispersion and pollutant interactions under the
influence of physical, chemical and biological processes in the environment. The
proposal leading to this recommendation is also consistent with objectives
outlined in NSF 83-59, "Research in Undergraduate Institutions". The
investigator's qualifications are appropriate for the work to be done. Award is
recommended as a Standard Grant in the amount of $230,244 for 24 months starting
on July 1, 1987.
