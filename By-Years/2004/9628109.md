While existing research shows that reactive congestion control mechanisms are
capable of providing high video quality and channel utilization for point-to-
point real-time video, there has been relatively little study of the reactive
congestion control of point-to-multipoint video, especially in ATM networks.
Problems complicating the provision of multicast, feedback-based, real-time
video service include (1) implosion of feedback returning to the source as the
number of multicast destinations increases, and (2) variance in the amount of
available bandwidth on different branches in the multipoint connection. The
proposed research addresses and solves the two problems mentioned above by
introducing and investigating a new service for real-time multicast video.
Multipoint feedback mechanisms are used to adaptively control the transmission
rates of each layer of a multi-layered video stream. The proposed service relies
on adaptive, multi-layered coding at the video source and closed-loop feedback
from the network in order to control the high and low priority video generation
rates of the video encoder. It also supports a minimum bandwidth guarantee and
the best effort support of video traffic exceeding the minimum rate. To study
these mechanisms, mathematical analysis, simulations, and empirical experiments
using the ATM testbed network available to the P.I. are employed.
