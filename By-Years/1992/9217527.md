This is a grant to conduct a workshop composed of NSF grantees whose awards were
made in the new area of inter-disciplinary research known as Coordination Theory
and Collaboration Technology (CTCT). The purposes of the workshop are: First, to
provide a forum for the exchange of knowledge in the form of perspectives,
findings, methods and theory for this young, interdisciplinary field. Second, to
provide an opportunity for the field to coalesce and grow. While certain subsets
of the community of the researchers mingle at various professional meetings, as
a whole, these investigators do not have regular contact. Third, this provides
an opportunity for the research from these projects to be made more visible to
the Washington based research funding and policy community. This workshop
represents a planning opportunity for the IT&amp;O Program. The future research
agenda for CT2 funding and community building is an important part of the
workshop program. The workshop is held on July 8 through July 10, 1992 in
Washington, DC. A workshop report will be prepared and made available through
publications and in response to requests.
