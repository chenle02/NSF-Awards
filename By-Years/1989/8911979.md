The Highlands Biological Station is a year-round facility for research on the
ecology, systematics and biogeography of plants and animals of the southern
Appalachian Mountains. The location of the Station near the crest of the Blue
Ridge, in a region of high biological diversity, provides exceptional
opportunities for field-oriented research which addresses basic scientific
questions in ecology and evolutionary biology. Highlands is an international
center for research on two disparate taxa, the flesh fungi (Basidiomycetes) and
the lungless salamanders (Plethodontidae). Both groups have high species
diversity in the region, in part because of the coupling of a moderate
temperature regime with high precipitation. This project will provide funds for
purchase of a compound microscope and camera, to be used in the scientific study
of these and other organisms at the Station.
