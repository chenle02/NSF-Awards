The Mississippi Museum of Natural Science (MMNS) will develop a program over the
next two years aimed at teachers and students in grades 3-7. The project will
develop teacher kits and "hands-on" exhibits tied to the new state curriculum
and to the science television series "3-2-1 Contact". The MMNS is a division of
the Mississippi Department of Wildlife Conservation and is designated as the
official natural science museum by the State Legislature. The Museum has been in
operation for 50 years and, since its inception, has served as a resource for
classroom teachers. Mississippi has approximately 500,000 public school students
attending about 1,000 schools. One third of these children are considered to
live below the poverty level and 50 percent are from minority groups--a priority
for the NSF. The MMNS has had success with a small pilot project which
coordinates science concepts taught in the television series "3-2-1 Contact"
with exhibit programs at the Museum. Over the next two years MMNS will expand
their "hands-on" exhibits and develop science kits for use in the classroom in
coordination with the new state curriculum and the television series. The kits
will include museum objects, suggested activities and a teacher's guide. During
the first year a series of "Contact Days" will be held with teachers and
students across the state to develop and test the effectiveness of the project
along with a lecture program by minority and women scientists. During the second
year the exhibits will travel to schools across the state.
