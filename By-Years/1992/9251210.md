A 200 MHz Fourier transform nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer will
be incorporated into nine undergraduate laboratory courses. These include
courses in organic, physical, analytical, and biological chemistry. Experiments
will include compound identification, kinetics, thermodynamics, and various two-
dimensional techniques. The project will affect not only chemistry majors, but
also biology/microbiology, pre-medical, pre-veterinary, pre- pharmacy, and pre-
chiropractic students. Students will become proficient in hands-on use of an
important experimental technique and will learn much about computer-controlled
instrumentation and signal processing.
