University of Missouri at Kansas City received a grant to build an imaging
database management and analysis system that can integrate multiscale and
multimodality structural genomic information with microarray gene expression for
comprehensive and integrative analysis of a biological system. It is widely
recognized that microarray imaging is limited by its poor reproducibility and
accuracy. Recent progress in high resolution genomic probe development along
with advanced image analysis techniques provides complimentary information to
microarray gene expression. The project team will develop image processing and
signal analysis algorithms to extract visual quantitative traits and structural
genomic signatures from the results of high resolution genomic imaging
techniques such as fluorescence in situ hybridization imaging and microarray
based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH). These quantitative structural
signatures will then correlate with microarray gene expression patterns.
Finally, this multiscale structural/functional information will be integrated
for an improved characterization of biological systems. The anticipated results
will include a publicly accessible genomic imaging database analysis system in
the life sciences community that will allow a biologist to answer the following
ambitious and significant questions: "How chromosomal rearrangements (molecular
karyotype) cause visual differences (phenotype); how they are correlated with
gene expression patterns (genotype); and furthermore, how the integrated
approach can lead to an improved characterization of a biological system?" The
impact of this project will be further expanded by partnering with industries,
outreach to minority and high school students, and by developing innovative
bioimaging curricula. Additional information can be found at
