This research will explore the decadal-scale interannual variability of the
stratosphere, with the goal of increasing our understanding of the effects of
both internal and solar-driven interannual variability and how these signals
propagate through the atmosphere. Several signals or forcings have been
identified which may account for many of the year-to-year changes in the
stratospheric circulation. These signals include the quasi-biennial oscillation
of the tropical stratosphere, the 11-year solar cycle, secular trends (possibly
due to global climate change), El Nino/Southern Oscillation and tropospheric
signals, and low-frequency modulation of higher-frequency signals. The approach
will be to use a combination of observational data analysis and numerical
modeling to explore the existence, causes, and propagation of decadal-scale
signals in the stratosphere. Observational work will exploit gridded atmospheric
data sets, rocketsonde observations, and satellite- and ground- based ozone
measurements. Techniques such as correlations, composites, and empirical
orthogonal functions will be used to identify interannual signals in the data.
The effect of changes in solar output on the earth's recent climate is not well
known. Likewise, decadal variations of the earth-atmosphere system apart from
solar influence are poorly understood. The understanding of the interannual
variability of the stratosphere is important not only because of its links to
the troposphere, but due to possible identification of secular global climate
trends and the role of solar variability in determining the global climate. #
