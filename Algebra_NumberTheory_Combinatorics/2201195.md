This project is in algebraic geometry, an active branch of modern mathematics,
originating in the theory of diophantine equations. The main objects of study
are algebraic varieties, which are solution sets of systems of polynomial
equations in several variables. The goal of the project is to develop methods to
measure how unconstrained the solutions of these equations are. More precisely,
it aims at understanding several invariants of algebraic varieties, constructed
by modern techniques using methods from algebraic geometry, arithmetic geometry,
and number theory. The project includes concrete problems for graduate student
training and incorporates the use of computational resources and algebraic
software packages. In more detail, the PI will use methods from Galois
cohomology of function fields, properties of algebraic cycles over non-
algebraically closed fields, K-theory, and degeneration techniques, to prove
results in the following directions: (1) rationality and stable rationality for
families of algebraic varieties, in particular for fourfolds fibered by del
Pezzo surfaces; (2) equivariant birational invariants; (3) variation of Chow
groups of algebraic cycles, in particular over number fields; and (4)
reconstruction of birational classes from set-theoretical data.
