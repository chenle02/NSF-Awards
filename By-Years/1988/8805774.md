P.I.s will investigate new evidence that the clastic sediments of the Lower and
Middle Cambrian of Avalonian North America did not accumulate on a stable
platform. Differential subsidence across the block-faulted Avalonian orogen may
have exerted an influence on local accumulation rates, sedimentary completeness,
onlap- offlap direction and distribution of communities. P.I.s will establish
precise intra-regional correlations in the Lower Cambrian of eastern
Newfoundland through the use of small shelly fossils and traditional trilobite
biostratigraphy. Marker beds will also be used. In addition to extending a small
shelly fossil biostratigraphy and a synthesis of depositional tectonics from the
Lower into the Moddle Cambrian of eastern Newfoundland, this project will
further document the timing and pattern of diversification of metazoan life in
the early Paleozoic.
