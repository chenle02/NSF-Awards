This Career Advancement Award will enable Dr. Jeanette Adams to broaden her
research program. She will work with an expert in theoretical studies to learn
the approaches of ab initio and molecular mechanics calculations. She will also
work with a leading practitioner in phase space calculations. Dr. Adams has
developed a productive program in mass spectroscopy. The new directions she will
undertake will enable her to apply theortical methods to the interpretation of
mass spectroscopic processes. These methods will complement the experimental
techniques she has developed. %%% This proposal builds a theoretical component
into a strong experimental program in the technique of mass spectroscopy. It
will help to develop new approaches to a powerful analytical technique with
applications to the understanding of biological systems and metabolism
