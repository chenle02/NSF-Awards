This Research Opportunity Award funds a project "Effects of Prestrain and
Strain State on Uniaxial Tensile Properties of Sheet Steels" at Southern
University in support of the Colorado School of Mines' Industry/University
Cooperative Research Center for Advanced Steel Processing and Products. This two
(2) year project is reporting to the Center's Industrial Advisory Board. The
project is studying the effects of strain rate and prestrain on mechanical
properties of ultralow carbon sheet steels and bake hardenable steels. The
relationship of microstructure to physical properties is being established using
the facilities of both universities. The Principal Investigators are competent
and have the facilities to conduct the research. The Program Manager recommends
that Southern University be awarded $100,000 for two (2) years.
