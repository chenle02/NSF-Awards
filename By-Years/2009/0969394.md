One of the main objectives in contemporary nuclear research is the discovery and
quantitative characterization of new phases of strongly interacting matter at
very high temperatures and densities, most notably the Quark-Gluon Plasma which
is believed to have ruled the Universe in the first few microseconds of its
evolution. A fascinating aspect of this field is the possibility to recreate
this kind of matter, for a short moment, in the laboratory, by colliding heavy
atomic nuclei at high energies. This project aims at advancing the theoretical
understanding of the Quark-Gluon Plasma, and to develop phenomenological
signatures of its creation and properties in nuclear collision experiments, as
e.g. conducted with the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider at Brookhaven National
Laboratory. Electromagnetic radiation and particles containing heavy quarks are
particularly suitable to extract information about the hot and dense matter
formed in heavy-ion collisions. It is planned to relate this information to
fundamental properties of the strong interactions (Quantum Chromodynamics, or
QCD), to illuminate the generation of the visible mass in the Universe and the
confinement of quarks and gluons into nucleons, the building blocks of atomic
nuclei.

Basic research by graduate-student and postdoctoral researchers is integrated
with educational activities aimed at undergraduate and regional high-school
students, including previously established summer research and Saturday Morning
Physics programs at Texas A&M University.
