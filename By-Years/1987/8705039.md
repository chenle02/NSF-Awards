This research effort is aimed at understanding the basic metabolism of microbial
and mammalian cells and to use that information to alter the productivity of the
reaction system. A liquid scintillation counter will be used for the following
projects: (1) effects of biopolymer particulates on the metabolism and ecology
of bacterial biofilms; (2) enhanced enzyme productivity in Hansenula polymorpha
by substrate composition and growth rate transients; (3) influence of adhesion
on the metabolism of microbes genetically-engineered for xenobiotic compound
degradation in the ground water; (4) thermochemical control of secondary
metabolite quality, yield, and production rate-synthesis of the polysaccharide
Xanthan by Xanthamonas campestris; and (5) engineering studies of kinetics and
optimization of monoclonal antibody production by a hybridoma.
