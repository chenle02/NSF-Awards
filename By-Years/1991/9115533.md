This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program and the
Instrumentation and Instrument Development Program will help the Department of
Chemistry at California Institute of Technology acquire a 400 MHz NMR
spectrometer which will be used in research investigations in the following
areas of chemistry: 1. Mechanistic Studies of Organotransition Metal Catalyzed
Oxidations 2. Polymerization Reactions 3. DNA and RNA Recognition 4. Development
of High-Spin Hydrocarbons 5. Small Designer Peptides 6. Synthesis of Natural
Products Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
available to the chemist for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It
is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectroscopy is essential
to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR
studies are useful in areas such as polymers and catalysis, and in biology.
