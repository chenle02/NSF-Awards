ABSTRACT

Removal of ultrafine particles, particularly in the nanoscale, pose a challenge
to the semiconductor industry and other industries manufacturing material with
clean surfaces. The laser assisted particle removal (LAPR) is a promising method
for efficient removal of fine particles when other methods fail. Depending on
where the laser energy is transferred and how the particle is separated from the
surface, the LAPR is categorized by the PIs into four mechanisms. The objective
of the proposed GOALI project is to investigate the physiochemical mechanisms of
LAPR by experiments and computational analyses. A model will be developed to
clearly explain the underlying physics of energy transfer and particle removal
depending on the laser wavelength, particle size and the characteristics of
medium surrounding the particle.
