This award will help to support student attendance at the 53rd IEEE Annual
Symposium on the Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS) in New Brunswick, New
Jersey, on October 19 through October 23, 2012, as well as to support attendance
by some qualified postdoctoral fellows who do not have other sources of travel
funding. FOCS and its sister conference, the ACM STOC meeting, are the premier
broad-based conferences on the Theory of Computing. FOCS has a record of
strongly encouraging participation by students, for whom the conference serves
as a valuable educational experience, both for the technical content of the
talks and for the opportunities for networking that it provides. In recent
years, the annual FOCS conference has been attended by eighty to one hundred
students who have comprised more than a third of all attendees. This award will
provide partial support to twenty or more students, covering shared hotel rooms
and travel. (Student registration will be supported by other means.)
