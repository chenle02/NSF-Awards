Professor Kuranishi has been very active in leading the Geometry Group at
Columbia University. At present there is strong interest in this group in
studying a number of deep problems in the area of CR geometry and
pseudoconvexity in several complex variables. This is an area in which Kuranishi
has made a number of spectacular contributions and still is working very solidly
in this direction. He also intends to research on metrics of positive sectional
curvature, mainly with the complex quadric surface as a suitable test case. This
seems to be quite a rich program which is likely to filter out to the graduate
students and postdoctoral workers who are actively working in his group.
