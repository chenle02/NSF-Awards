Supernova 1987A, the closest supernova seen in nearly four centuries, and the
most intensely studied, is rapidly turning into a supernova remnant as the
ejecta from the explosion now strikes the circumstellar envelope shed by the
star over the last million years. In this project, this process will be followed
using a combination of archival, optical, infra-red and ultra-violet programs,
plus space-based studies. Previous observations taken by Dr. Crotts of the three
dimensional structure, velocities, density and composition will establish the
nature of the pre-explosion nebula and the mass loss processes that created it,
while new observations of the excitation of this nebula by the X-ray and extreme
ultra-violet flux created in the collision will enable Dr. Crotts to re-analyze
it once more. In addition to this study of a supernova remnant, Dr. Crotts will
continue to use light echoes from the supernova explosion to explore the
interstellar medium in the 30 Doradus star-formation region, to study the echo
of the ultra-violet pulse from supernova shock breakout through the progenitor
star's surface, and accurately to determine the distance to the Large Magellanic
Cloud - a fundamental rung on the extragalactic distance ladder.

Dr. Crotts will also explore the application of his image differencing software
to biomedical imaging - specifically how the image processing algorithms used to
trace changes in the appearance of supernova echoes can track changes in other
data sets, prominently CT-scan dye tests used for early detection of cancerous
growths. The light echo data will also be used in renderings and animations as
part of several public-access demonstrations of the fascinating structures
revealed by light echoes.
