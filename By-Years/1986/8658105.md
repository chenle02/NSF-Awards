This is a Presidential Young Investigator Award proposal. The PI will examine
the functional adaptation of bone to a mechanical environment. The effects of
electromagnetic mechanisms will also be researched. Accurate measurement of
skeletal strains will be used to help understand the control of stimuli which
induce bone growth and the mechanism of adaptation itself.
