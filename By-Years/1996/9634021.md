Abstract ATM-9634021 Avissar, Roni Rutgers University Title: Bidirectoral
Ecosystem-Atmosphere Interactions Workshop; National Space Research Center, Sao
Jose dos Campos, Brazil: July 8-11, 1996 This is a grant for a workshop that
will synthesize and stimulate research on vegetation-climate interaction and
modeling of the relevant processes. This will result in three kinds of products:
1) frontier papers on the climate-vegetation interactions, 2) a critically
needed and healthy interaction among the scientists of related but different
disciplines, and 3) background support for the upcoming international
experiment, the Large-scale Biosphere- Atmosphere (LBA) experiment. This is
important because efforts to develop climate system models are presently
hindered by incomplete knowledge about land-surface interactions.
