Shallow lakes and ponds may cover up to 40 percent of the land surface in Arctic
lowland regions. Many of these water bodies traditionally freeze solid during
the winter, preserving sub-lake permafrost and keeping soil carbon stocks
immobile at depth. Slightly deeper lakes maintain some liquid water beneath
floating ice, causing deep thaw zones in otherwise continuous permafrost.
Evidence suggests that thinner ice growth in response to warmer, snowier winters
is pushing many bedfast ice lakes to floating ice regimes. If such a regime
shift becomes pervasive across lake-rich landscapes, resulting permafrost thaw
and enhanced moisture and heat flux could generate positive feedbacks, further
amplifying this regime change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project examines the
extent and dynamics of bedfast and floating ice lakes in relation to
hypothesized interactions and feedback with permafrost and climate. A
combination of remote sensing, field monitoring and geophysical measurements,
experiments and physical models are used to isolate processes, quantify
interactions and project changes. Project findings will be relevant locally for
native village subsistence and for water supply to the petroleum industry, and
globally for scientists studying permafrost thaw and Arctic climate change.
