This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). State-of-the-art first-principles quantum mechanical
calculations will be used to understand the mechanical properties of dielectric
coatings such as Ta2O5. Mechanical properties affect thermal noise in materials
that can limit the performance of ultra high-precision interferometers, such
those employed in the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory
(LIGO), or the frequency stability of cavity-stabilized laser systems. Advanced
LIGO, the next major upgrade of LIGO now under construction, is expected to be
limited by thermal noise in the most critical 50-150 Hz band while the
performance of several state-of-the-art frequency stabilization systems is
limited by thermal noise at frequencies as low as a few Hz.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is of general, societal importance to design dielectric
coatings with desired properties. The proposed research activities have
applications in many high precision optical measurements far beyond LIGO, for
example, time and frequency measurements. The computational approach that
characterizes materials will also be useful in a variety other areas such as
nano-scale science, material science, and bio-science. The project will also
provide rigorous training for graduate students in computational physics.
