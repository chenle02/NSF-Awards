1126373&lt;br/&gt;Ferry&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mass spectrometry (MS) is one of
the leading analytical tools exploited by the metabolomics community. Despite
technological advances, it remains impossible for a single piece of MS
instrumentation to provide all of the information sought in global analyses. As
such, all of the centers of excellence in metabolomics utilize pipelines that
exploit multiple analytical platforms (e.g., LC-MS, GCEI-MS, GC-CI-MS). The
proposed AB Sciex TripleTOFTM 5600 is a high resolution, exact mass MS/MS
platform that is specifically designed to provide the resolving power sought by
the metabolomics community. This instrument provides a mass resolution of up to
40,000 full width at half height (FWHH) in both positive and negative ion modes,
exact mass (1 ppm RMS) with a dynamic range of up to five orders of magnitude, a
rapid acquisition rate (20 Hz) that fully exploits the resolving power of UPLC,
and absolute sensitivity more usually associated with triple quadrupole
instruments operating in Selected Reaction Monitoring (SRM) mode. In short, this
instrument offers speed, accuracy and versatility to explore complex samples
from a large user group with diverse needs.
