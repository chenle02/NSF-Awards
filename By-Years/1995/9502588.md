The focus of this research is the preparation of cyclopropenyliophanes,
cyclophanes based on the aromatic cyclopropenium ion and preparation and
reaction of cyclopropenes containing additional unsaturated moieties. The focus
of the educational plan involves the development of activities aimed at giving
undergraduate and graduate students `hands-on` learning of chemistry. With this
CAREER award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research and
educational plan of Dr. Michael M. Haley of the Department of Chemistry at the
University of Oregon. Professor Haley will focus his research efforts on the
synthesis of novel compounds containing the theoretically interesting
cyclopropene system. The focus of Haley's educational plan involves the
development of activities aimed at giving undergraduate and graduate students
`hands-on` learning of chemistry.
