This collaborative research project seeks to understand the nature and
determinants of long term changes in humanity's competence to deal with global
environmental risks. It views that competence as a product of possible
interactions among various domestic, state, and international actors: in
particular the scientific community, non-governmental organizations, private
sector interests, national governments, the media, and international
organizations. Changing competence is characterized in terms of the changes in
the performance of six management functions: risk assessment, the placing or
risks in context, response assessment, strategy formulation, policy
implementation, and monitoring/evaluation. The principal theoretical goal of the
project is to establish the major processes by which such changes occur, the
determinants of those processes, and how both change with time. Special
attention is paid to determining the extent to which cumulative learning, as
opposed to changing bureaucratic structures, interest configurations, or power
alignments, underlies observed changes in management. The principal applied goal
is to establish the most important factors constraining cumulative improvements
in functional performance, and to characterize policies that might be expected
to improve prospects for learning how to manage global environmental risks.
These goals are pursued as part of a larger international collaborative effort
involving detailed case studies of how 8 countries have dealt with the risks
posed by climate change, ozone depletion and acid rain. The work focuses on
changing social competencies that have emerged from the interactions of one
particularly influential country -- the United States -- with the family of
organizations over the last 30 years.
