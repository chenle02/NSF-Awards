Several types of geophysical observations indicate that the lithosphere in the
southcentral Pacific is undergoing diffuse north-south extension. As a partial
test of this hypothesis, the Principal Investigator will survey a previously
uncharted series of echelon ridges that extend for over 2500 km from the East
Pacific Rise to the northern edge of the Tuamotu archipelago. A major
implication of the stretching hypothesis is that some volcanic activity in the
west Pacific may be related to tensional failure of the lithosphere rather than
numerous mantle plumes. The goals of the survey are to first establish that the
ridges exist where they have not been charted, and that they are continuous. The
ridges will also be dredged for petrologic and age studies, and the magnetic
signature of the ridges will be determined.
