The Riemann mapping theorem is an old, beautiful, and tremendously useful device
which can be used to pull back the explicit formulas for the classical objects
of potential theory on the unit disc to arbitrary simply connected regions in
the plane. The unit disc is the quintessential example of a double quadrature
domain,i.e., a quadrature domain both with respect to area measure and boundary
arc length. Professor Bell and his collaborators have been working on an
improvement to the Riemann mapping theorem which replaces the unit disc by a
double quadrature domain which, rather than being far away like the unit disc,
is close to the original domain. Bell has proved that many of the classical
objects of potential theory associated to a double quadrature domain are
elementary functions which are simple combination of the coordinate variable and
the algebraic Schwarz function, and consequently may be easily computed. Thus,
it becomes possible to make minor, but subtle, alterations in a region to make
it have many of the desirable properties of the unit disc. This approach has the
virtue of being potentially applicable even in the multiply connected and
Riemann surface setting, where the Riemann mapping theorem is unavailable.

The objects of potential theory and conformal mapping are pervasive in
Mathematics, Science, and Engineering. Although these objects are well studied,
they continue to be a source of exciting and potentially applicable new
mathematics. Professor Bell will express the classical objects of potential
theory associated to a two dimensional surface with holes in terms of simple and
computable analytic objects. These results may give rise to new and practical
methods for expressing and zipping the solutions to classical problems in
differential equations, conformal mapping, and potential theory. Because humans
best perceive higher dimensional objects by taking a series of two dimensional
slices, the tools developed could find important applications. Some of the key
ideas behind this program grew out of a summer undergraduate research project
that Bell directed in 2008, and a noteworthy component of the project is a
significant commitment to mentoring and training undergraduates and graduate
students involved for a career in mathematics.
