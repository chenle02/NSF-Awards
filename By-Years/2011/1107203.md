Funds are provided to examine the impact of sea ice on the distribution and
abundance of zooplankton, and how they are partitioned among top predators. To
this end, new and historical data will be used to test a series of hypotheses
and answer questions relating to bottom-up and top-down control of large
crustacean zooplankton and their impact on the flow of carbon and energy in the
ecosystem. From the examination of these hypotheses, new mechanisms will be
derived and old ones re-evaluated. Existing numerical models will be used to
assess the relative importance of these mechanisms. Existing conceptual models
will be tested, and new conceptual models of carbon and energy flow will be
developed. Such a study of the eastern Bering Sea shelf ecosystem is timely.
Some of the most direct effects of changing climate will be on sea-ice - its
extent, duration, timing of retreat, and inter-annual variability. Sea ice in
turn controls ocean temperature/salinity, timing of the spring phytoplankton
bloom and thus the extent of export/remineralization of fixed carbon. Crustacean
zooplankton can be a choke-point in the flow of carbon and energy through the
food chain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Bering Sea ecosystem provides roughly half
the commercial seafood landings in the United States, as well as significant
resources for subsistence fishermen. Major fluctuations in these stocks have
occurred in the past and been associated with climate variations. Improved
management of these important fisheries should be enabled by the understanding
derived from this project.
