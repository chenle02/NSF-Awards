A transmission electron microscope and accessories will be purchased to increase
students knowledge about cellular biology. The instrument will be used by
students enrolled in courses in electron microscopy, microtechnique, and cell
biology. The instrument will be used by the students to make electron
micrographs that will be used by students in other courses, including
developmental biology, histology, plant morphology, and freshman biology. The
university will provide 50% matching funds.
