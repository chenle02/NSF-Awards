A deep survey of galaxy redshifts in a 1 degree x 100 degree strip on the sky
will be carried out using dedicated time on the new McGraw-Hill Observatory
2.4-meter telescope. The galaxy catalogue will be provided by M. Geller, J.
Huchra, and M. Kurtz of the Center for Astrophysics who are conducting a
complementary photometric survey and collaborating on this project. The
catalogue will be derived from photodensitometer scans of the Palomar Sky
Survey. Some of the most difficult galaxies will be measured with the Multi-
Mirror Telescope (MMT) at Mount Hopkins. Measurements of redshifts for about
2000 galaxies will be carried out. The typical redshifts will be about 24,000 km
per second. The survey strip is chosen for observational convenience alone, and
should constitute a "fair" sample of the Universe. It runs down the middle of
the strip surveyed by deLapperant, Geller, and Huchra in 1986, but extends to
over twice the depth of their survey. Among the issues which this survey will
clarify are: (1) the upper limit on void volumes; (2) the relationship between
rich clusters and the structures that surround them; (3) the galaxy luminosity
function; and (4) whether low luminosity galaxies are distributed in structures
similar to the more luminous ones. Finally, a few dozen galaxies with peculiar
spectra, especially active galactic nuclei, should be discovered.
