This research involves population and behavioral studies of the superb fairy-
wren, a species of bird that lives in Australia. This work will contribute to
our knowledge about the biology of this species and the avifauna of Australia
generally. More important, it will add to our understanding of evolutionary
processes affecting reproductive biology and social behavior of nonhuman
species. Superb fairy-wrens are interesting because they live in large social
groups, the offspring from one generation remain in the territory and help the
parents raise young in successive breeding attempts, and social mates are often
related to each other. This great potential for inbreeding among closely related
individuals appears to have been solved by fairy-wrens in what may be a unique
manner: females in each group mate promiscuously with males from other groups.
This research is attempting to verify and study the mechanisms by which
individual fairy-wrens avoid inbreeding and the relationship between the
species' mating system and the patterns of morphology and plumage coloration. As
the research uses molecular techniques in determining the patterns of mating,
the work will also add to our knowledge of genetic variation within and among
families in this species, and the use of DNA fingerprinting as a means of
identifying sires of offspring.
