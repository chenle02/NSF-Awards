The objective of this research is the measurement of (integrated) water vapor
using the Global Positioning System (GPS) of satellites wherein the travel times
between the satellite and the receiver at the earth's surface can be used as a
calibrated measure of the integrated water vapor along the signal propagation
path. Independent measurements of the same quantity will be made by microwave
radiometers and conventional radiosondes.
