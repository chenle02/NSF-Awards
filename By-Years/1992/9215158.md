This award provides renewed funding for the Earthquake Engineering Research
Institute's (EERI) Learning From Earthquake Program (LFE). Since the program was
initiated in the mid-1970's, EERI has gathered and disseminated information that
has contributed to improved preparation, response and reconstruction practices
in seismic areas. EERI's post-earthquake field investigations take into account
all aspects of earthquake hazards reduction and contribute to achieving the
objectives of the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program. The project
will continue to provide the following services: (1) coordinate post-earthquake
field investigations, (2) provide a central earthquake information
clearinghouse, (3) produce research guides and response plans, (4) draw
conclusions learned from earthquake field investigations, and (5) disseminate
information to improve the state of hazard mitigation practice.
