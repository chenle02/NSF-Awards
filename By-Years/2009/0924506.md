Anthropologist Dr. Jonah Steinberg, University of Vermont, will undertake
research on the experience of childhood across cultures, and children's capacity
for autonomy, resistance, and agency. The research will be carried out in India,
where he will focus on the process by which village children in India become
"street children." There are some rural regions of India in which it is common
for village youth to run away to the city. In such regions running away appears
to be a widely-accepted life option. In this three-year project Dr. Steinberg
seeks to ascertain why it is the case that this is occurring with such
frequency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Narratives of arrival on the street will
initially be elicited from a sample group of street children in Delhi. The
street children also will be surveyed to identify the villages and regions that
produce the greatest numbers of runaways. A selection of those villages will be
chosen for ethnographic research about the practice of running away in rural
areas, as well as to investigate how the practice is culturally framed and the
degree to which it is understood by both adults and children as an ordinary and
routine element of the life course. This will also contribute to insights about
which villages and households produce the greatest numbers of
runaways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research has the potential to shed light on
the relationship between large-scale historical processes of urbanization and
the small-scale emotional lives in individual homes. The research also will
broaden understandings about why street children become street children to begin
with, no matter where they live, and will generate advice on the expansion of
rural or semirural services that might protect them from ever having to face the
risk they face once on the streets.
