Virtually every animal and plant species exhibits genetic variation for a
variety of enzymes involved in the control of metabolism. Only a few studies
have clearly established the relationships among genetic variation for a
specific enzyme (genotype), the mechanistic, biochemical expression of that
variation, a nd its relevance to the physiology and phenotype of the whole
organism. A more integrated approach to examine the biological significance of
genetic variation for a single enzyme involves detailing the effects of that
variation on the overall rate of energy flow through the metabolic pathway in
which the enzyme is embedded. The proposed research will use this approach to
attempt to establish a causal explanation for observations for a strong
relationship between genetic variation for a specific enzyme and production-
related traits in the bay scallop. The proposed mechanism which explains these
observations involves the genotype-dependent inhibition of the energy flow
through the specific enzyme step and its associated metabolic pathway caused by
demands for increased energy flow through a competing pathway. The proposed
research will examine the expression of genetic variation at this enzyme step by
using radioisotopes to measure the rates of flow through this enzyme as well as
through its overall pathway when the enzyme is artificially inhibited with a
product from the competing pathway. The results will be significance in areas as
diverse as evolutionary biology and biochemistry to those concerned with the
significance of genetic variation to economically important traits such as
aquaculture and agriculture.
