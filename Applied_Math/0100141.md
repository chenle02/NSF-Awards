This research program concerns questions at the intersection of commutative
algebra, integer programming, and discrete geometry. The link between these
fields is made via toric ideals and their Groebner bases. The first set of
questions concern the characterization and construction of toric initial ideals
without embedded primes. Answers to these questions will provide new structural
results in the theory of integer programming via the classical technique of
group relaxations due to Gomory and will extend recent work in this area by
Serkan Hosten and the proposer. The second set of questions concern the toric
Hilbert scheme, a parameter space for all polynomial ideals with the same multi-
graded Hilbert function as a given toric ideal. A central open question about
these schemes is whether they are connected. The proposer will work with Diane
Maclagan on this connectivity question, building on their recent construction of
a graph on the monomial ideals of the scheme which is connected if and only if
the scheme is connected. Over the past decade, the proposer has contributed to
the development of several new theories in discrete optimization using algebraic
techniques and has worked on the application of the resulting, non-traditional
algorithms to practical problems. The research that has contributed to these
theories brings tools from algebra, combinatorics, optimization and discrete
geometry to bear on problems from all of these fields. The application of
algebraic techniques has led to new understanding in the field of integer
programming, a branch of discrete optimization, but tools and ideas from
optimization have also led to new results in algebra. This interplay of ideas
and techniques has shed light on questions from each of these areas and promises
to lead to greater insight and advancement. The proposer works with students on
some of the computational aspects of the research and plans to involve students
in the development of software that implements these algorithms. The proposer is
also interested in curriculum development in subject areas related to this
research at the University of Washington.
