A series of laboratory experiments using state-of-the-art techniques aimed at
quantitatively studying the interaction between short and long surface waves
will be conducted. Detailed measurements of the waves and associated kinetic and
potential energy field will be made in two laboratory facilities (SIO and Delf
Hydraulics) to examine the effects of wave scale and wave age.
