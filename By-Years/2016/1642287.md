ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;PI: Scala, Melissa &lt;br/&gt;Proposal:
1554027&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal focuses on developing a high-
throughput imaging technology to measure drug response and cellular metabolism
in tumor cells cultured with cells in their native environment. The data
obtained will be used to predict tumor response to multiple drugs, providing
information that can be used to optimize drug treatment for the individual
cancer patient. The Educational Plan, which includes a new undergraduate course
in optical imaging, has a strong emphasis on outreach activities directed at
middle and high school students and girls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interference
light sheet Fourier Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (iLS-FP-FLIM) will
be created and information obtained by imaging NADH and FAD coenzymes in human
breast cancer cells grown in a mouse model. This will be used to predict tumor
response to multiple drugs, providing information that can be used to optimize
drug treatment for the individual cancer patient.
