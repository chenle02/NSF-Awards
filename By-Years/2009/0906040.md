This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).

The intent of this research is to develop general-purpose low-cost astronomical
instrumentation that can be used by interested members of the community.
Traditional radio astronomy instrumentation is highly specialized one-off type
of hardware. This research will develop and optimize modular, connectible, and
upgradable hardware components based upon Field-Programmable Gate Array
technology, and platform-independent open-architecture software to drive the
hardware. The components will be usable for single dish and interferometric
radio astronomy data capture and analysis, and will offer relatively low-cost,
common, scalable radio astronomy instrumentation to the worldwide radio
astronomy community at large.
