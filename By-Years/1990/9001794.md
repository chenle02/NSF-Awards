This research involves the quantum field theory of fermions on the Poincare
disk and the hard hexagon model - a lattice gas model in statistical mechanics.
The research on the quantum theory of fermions will involve expressing the
Schwinger functions in terms of certain nonlinear deformation equations. These
equations will then be analyzed both in the Euclidean limit and in the conformal
field theory limit. An important aspect of this work is the extension of the
existing theory to the noneuclidean setting which may lay the groundwork for
extensions to Riemann surfaces of a more general type. The research on the hard
hexagon model will involve derivations of differential equations for the
partition function and density functions. An attempt will be made to extend
these equations to the hard square lattice gas, a model that is 'not solvable'
by present techniques. This research is in the general area of theoretical
physics and deals with isomonodromy deformations and applications to conformal
field theory, statistical mechanics, and scattering theory.
