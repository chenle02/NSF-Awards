9529145 Sidhu Telenix Corporation - "Simulation and Analysis of Mobile-IP
Protocol" This award supports a one year project to conduct simulations of
mobile-IP and present the results through the Internet Engineering Task Force to
designers of mobile-IP software. The purpose is to provide data to assist in
understanding the mobile-IP environment to guide implementations now in
preparation. It is aimed primarily at IPv4, though the results will be useful
for IPv6 as well.
