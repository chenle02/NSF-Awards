0435795&lt;br/&gt;Molnar&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several lines of evidence point
toward some kind of change in the balance of geodynamic processes acting on
Tibet and concurrent changes in environmental conditions approximately 8 million
years ago. Whether the principal triggering event was brief, or took place over
several million years depends somewhat on which data are considered most
suggestive. As is typical, the relevant data are all flawed or weak in some way,
but they are sufficiently suggestive to merit an investigation into how Tibet
has grown in the past 10-20 Myr and how that growth might have affected neaby
environments. This award provides support for an exploratory field investigation
to determine how the P.I.s might explore the interrelationships between
geodynamic processes occurring within the crust and upper mantle and
environmental changes that occurred within and surrounding Tibet, as well as
possibly global changes. Specifically, the P.I.s would be able to meet with
their Chinese colleagues, see first hand the field areas where data would be
gathered, and examine and assess the suitability of existing Chinese data
bearing on the problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some potential outcomes of a
broader scope include an understanding of a much larger climate change, not just
the Asian monsoon, but also changes that led to global cooling and the Ice Ages.
The US scientists that would participate comprise a group that includes 4 junior
scientists of diverse backgrounds and the field trip will provide an opportunity
for them to become involved with a possible large, international,
multidisciplinary project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
