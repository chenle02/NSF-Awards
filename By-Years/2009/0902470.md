This project develops an educational pathway for students in Agriculture
Education that articulates between local high schools, Modesto Junior College
(MJC), and five California State Universities. The curriculum is designed and
implemented in consultation with the Agriculture Education Steering Committee,
comprised of MJC faculty, 13 area high schools, and representatives from the 5
partnering California State University Agriculture Programs. An Associate of
Science degree is to be submitted to the State in Agricultural Science.
Additionally, specific strategies are researched and implemented for recruiting,
retaining and supporting future Agriculture Education students. These methods
include program presentations, print and digital media, on-going communication
with high school teachers and counselors, and a state-wide database. Special
attention is given to approaches for students, including minorities, who have
not typically pursued Agriculture as a career. Toward this end, an Agriculture
Education Pathway Scholarship program is established, and a cohort approach to
coursework is implemented, including an advising and mentoring component, cohort
leadership training, and a Summer Institute for student success.
