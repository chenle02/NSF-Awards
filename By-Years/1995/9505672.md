This is a joint U.S.-Taiwan workshop on oceanic microwave remote sensing
techniques proposed by Dr. Dennis Trizna, University of Delaware and Professor
Jin Wu, National Cheng Kung University. The proposed workshop is focused on
three kinds of microwave instruments: altimeter, scatterometer, and radiometer
in oceanic research application. The proposed participants are specialists in
the microwave field. The topic of the workshop is important for both the U.S.
and Taiwan. The investigators from both countries stand to benefit from this
interaction. The Taiwan scientists can become familiar with recent scientific
and technological advances and the U.S. researchers can use this opportunity to
access the new facilities available in Taiwan. This workshop is to be held on
August 9-11, 1995 at the Lewes campus of the University of Delaware. The project
is jointly supported by the National Science Foundation and the Taiwan National
Science Council.
