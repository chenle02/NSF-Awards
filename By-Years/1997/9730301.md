9730301 Morris Convergent margins are places where a large percentage of the
crustal material is recycled at the subduction zones and yet poorly understood.
Funds are provided to hold an international workshop entitled Subduction Factory
to bring together marine geoscientists to plan an integrated and
multidisciplinary study focused on one or two of the Earth's convergent margins.
The targeted margins will be have to be drillable in the incoming plate, the
forearc, the arc, and possibly the backarc, using existing and riser drilling
technologies. The Subduction Factory is a high priority issue identified under
the MARGINS initiative. The workshop will be held in the summer of 1998 and some
35 participants are expected.
