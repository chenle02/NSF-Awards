This research program builds upon ongoing research in VLSI computation and
layout theory. Upper bounds of VLSI computing networks laid out according to the
rules of the VLSI model will be developed. Outstanding open problems--such as
area-time optimal networks for integer division and graph problems--will be
investigated and the power of'hybridization' of basic networks will be explored.
Specifically, it appears that a few highly regular inter connections such as the
linear array, the mesh, the tree and its relatives, the cube and its
substitutes, have greatcomputational power and are likely to be the basic
constituents of anysignificant VLSI architecture. Efficient techniques for the
automation of VLSI designs will be developed; the wire routing problem, and the
moduleplacement problem will be addressed. Some restricted cases of channel
routing problem of multiterminal nets will be studied, particularly the
specialized problem obtained by placing a bound on the maximum number of
terminals of a net. Routing techniques in arbitrary planar domains will also be
developed.
