9726385 Nocedal, Jorge Northwestern University Challenges in CISE: Metacomputing
Environments for Optimization By combining distributed hardware, network
hardware/software infrastructure, optimization tools, and informational
material, this research will produce metacomputing environments for optimization
powerful enough to tackle problems of unprecedented scale and complexity. The
project integrates fundamental algorithmic and applications-oriented research in
optimization with research in software infrastructure for distributed systems
management. New algorithms that use the powerful but heterogeneous, high-latency
environment of the metacomputer platform will be developed to solve key problems
in targeted application areas. The optimization tools will include interfaces
that link the client workstation to the metacomputer server in novel ways. The
environment will be able to execute in tandem with data-gathering and modeling
resources elsewhere in the network. Focus areas for the algorithmic research
include combinatorial optimization, integer programming, global optimization,
and nonlinear programming, with target application areas of transportation,
telecommunications, molecular conformation, and weather forecasting. Software
infrastructure research will focus on the resource allocation, scheduling,
persistency, and security mechanisms needed to maximize the usefulness of the
environment, from the viewpoint of the optimization tools and their users. The
project will make use of the GUSTO metacomputing testbed being constructed by
the Globus project.
