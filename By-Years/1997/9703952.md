Robt. Mifflin Abstract for DMS-9703952 Abstract for Space Decomposition Methods
in Nonsmooth Optimization The proposed research concerns developing theory and
methods for implicitly combining polyhedral and quadratic approximation to
produce a rapidly convergent algorithm for minimizing a nonsmooth function of
many variables. The idea is to use a bundle method to determine a so-called VU-
space decomposition such that on V-space the cutting-plane aspect of bundling
works fast and on U-space a quasi-Newton approximation of a Hessian of a
U-Lagrangian can be employed. Such methods can be used to solve large or
complicated optimization models via separation of variables or constraints. For
example, a water pressure control problem of finding values for flow rates and
pump pressure gaps to minimize pumping cost subject to maintaining water
pressures in allowable ranges at all points in a pipe network can be solved via
separation of the variables. If the flow rates are fixed then the subproblem of
finding optimal values for the pressure gaps is an easy-to- solve linear
minimization problem. With this approach the outer problem of finding optimal
values for the flow variables is a nonsmooth problem whose solution can be found
efficiently via the techniques to be developed. The computational methods
proposed for development are significant because they can be applied in many
practical decision-making situations. These include decomposition of large or
complicated models such as those occurring in allocation of scarce resources,
traffic assignment, manufacturing, structural engineering, logistics and
strategic planning. The pipe network problem in the first paragraph is an
important example occurring in civil infrastructure design. It illustrates the
need to make trade-off decisions when considering conflicting design criteria
such as simultaneously having high reliability and low cost. Another area of
applica tion is in power system planning subject to environmental protection
constraints. These decision models will increase in importance as deregulation
of the energy supply sector takes effect. These problems naturally decompose
into higher level problems of deciding which types and sizes of power generation
plants to build and lower level problems of deciding how best to operate the
various units to meet daily energy demand. Additionally, this research fits in
well with ongoing efforts in high-performance computing, because its methods
will utilize parallel processing to solve larger or more complex decision-
making problems than are currently possible to solve.
