NeTS-ProWiN: Spectrum-Agile Wireless Available Networking
(SWAN)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jose Garcia-Luna-Aceves, University of California-
Santa Cruz&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award
0435522&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ad hoc networks
demonstrated to date operate on pre-assigned portions of the spectrum, which
limits their connectivity and the efficiency with which the available spectrum
is used. Ad hoc networks are assumed to work independently of the Internet and
attach to it only through a few access points. Furthermore, wireless routers are
considered to be different from Internet routers, and routing in ad hoc networks
today is independent of spectrum management or the availability of wired
links.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SWAN (Spectrum-Agile Wireless Available
Networking) project addresses the above limitations by enabling wireless
spectrum utilization in far more efficient ways than it is possible today, and
by making wireless links an integral part of the Internet. The expected results
in SWAN include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(a) Wireless Available Networking: SWAN
will develop an architecture and protocols that transform the concept of ad hoc
networking into wireless available networking, such that Internet routers use
radio links opportunistically, in much the same way as wired links are used
today by routers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(b) SMASH (Statistical Multiplexing of
Available Spectrum Heuristics): SWAN will develop algorithms, protocols, and
etiquettes for the dynamic sharing of the available spectrum based on the
statistics of information flows. This way, routers determine in a distributed
fashion which portion of the spectrum they can use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(c)
Policy-based Routing: SWAN will develop the first policy-based routing protocols
for wireless enabled networks, with which routers manage the topology and paths
of wired and wireless portions of the Internet based on administrative, quality-
of-service, and spectrum-utilization policies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
