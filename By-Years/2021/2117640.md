Non-Ribosomal Peptides (NRPs) represent a diverse class of natural products that
include antibiotics, immunosuppressants, anticancer agents, toxins,
siderophores, pigments, and cytostatics. NRPs have been reported in various
habitats, from marine environments to soil, and even human microbiome. However,
the discovery of novel NRPs remains a slow and laborious process because NRPs
are not directly encoded in the genome and are instead assembled by Non-
Ribosomal Peptide Synthetases (NRPSs). This project will develop computational
techniques for discovering novel bioactive NRPs through the integration of
computational mass spectrometry and genome mining. A summer pre-college program
in computational biology and outreaching to under-represented students in
Pittsburgh area through STEM junction symposiums will be carried
out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop algorithms for discovering
novel bioactive NRPs through the following parts. First, the accuracy of
prediction of adenylation domain (A-domain) substrate specificities will be
improved through the incorporation of the 3-dimensional structure of domains.
These features will be further used for identifying A-domains that encode novel
chemistries in RefSeq microbial genomes. Second, algorithms will be developed
for predicting the post-assembly modification of NRPs from the modification
enzymes present in their gene cluster. Then, probabilistic models will be
developed for matching predicted NRPs against mass spectra. These methods will
be used to search the publicly available microbial genomes and mass spectra from
RefSeq and global natural product social (GNPS) molecular networking
infrastructure. The software and results of this project will be available to
the scientific community through

statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
