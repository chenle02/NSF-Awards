The investigators would host a two-day workshop of 20 leaders in geoscience
education, learning sciences, and the application of learning science to STEM
disciplines. The goals of the workshop are to define the compelling research
issues about learning in the geosciences, discuss avenues for disseminating
existing research on learning, and initiate broad-based planning and
coordination of activities. The participants in the workshop will discuss
classroom experiences that are believed to be critical barriers to learning,
define existing research that is applicable to learning geosciences, define new
work on learning in the geosciences, and agree on specific steps. The meeting
will produce a report with recommendations for disseminating research on
learning. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop is believed to be the first step
in a series of activities to integrate research on learning into undergraduate
geoscience education.
