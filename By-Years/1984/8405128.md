This research project concerns a primarily experimental investigation of
transport phenomena in porous media. The work is based on optical techniques
that are capable of accurately determining the temperature distributions in
porous materials. This subject area has gained in importance because of its
relevance in many technological processes. The present emphasis on physical
experiments is in accord with the recommendation from a recent workshop convened
to define future directions for research in this field.
