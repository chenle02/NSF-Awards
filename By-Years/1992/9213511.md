The principal objective of this three-year project is to conduct a participant
observation study that examines the changing identities of undergraduate
engineering students as they transform themselves from novice freshmen into
graduating seniors prepared for employment or advanced training. The major
product is a book length manuscript co-authored by the three members of the
research team. With guidance from a panel of consulting advisers, the authors
will provide a step-by-step account of how engineering students understand and
experience their education as a sequence of value choices and judgments to be
made as they move through their engineering curricula. A guiding hypothesis is
that the high value engineering curricula place on the calculus based
engineering sciences as the foundation of engineering problem solving is linked
to the establishment of other social dimensions of engineering identities, and
to under-representation of women and minority students. A second objective is to
make available to other researchers approximately 2,500 pages of indexed
transcriptions from taped focus group meetings and interviews with undergraduate
engineering students at a large land-grant university. Finally, by providing a
longitudinal account built upon data from transcriptions, participant
observation, surveys, and document collection, this study will make a unique and
much-needed contribution to our analytic understanding of the character and
problems of engineering curricula.
