ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OCE-0353311&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An investigator
from the University of Massachusetts will participate in an upcoming Japanese Fe
fertilization experiment called SEEDS II taking place in the Western Subarctic
Pacific Gyre. Participation of this investigator in the cruise will add
expertise in the area of nitrogen and carbon isotopic biogeochemistry to
understand the fate of the Fe-stimulated production of organic matter.
Specifically, the investigator plans to analyze samples collected both inside
and outside of the fertilized patch for the following parameters: (1) dissolved
inorganic carbon, nitrate, ammonium and dissolved organic matter; (2) total and
size fractionated suspended particulate organic matter; (3) meso- and
macrozooplankton; (4) sinking particulate organic matter collected by in-situ
large volume filtration; and (5) diatoms, both whole and frustule bound organic
matter, as well as large phytoplankton. Results from this study will allow the
investigator to document the pathways and fate of the resulting enhanced organic
carbon production within the fertilized patch thereby furthering our
understanding of the influence of Fe fertilization on the oceanic biological
pump. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
