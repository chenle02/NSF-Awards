This dissertation research project examine how arctic plant communities may
respond to global climate change, and the consequences that changes in community
structure may have for ecosystem functioning. Field manipulations of community
structure and temperature, combined with growth chamber experiments will be
used, to determine how the competitive interactions of the major tussock tundra
species change with increased temperature. Field transplants of major treeline
species along with seed germination studies will be employed to determine the
controls over tree migration into tundra. The student will examine how
individual species affect system processes such as productivity, decomposition
and nutrient cycling, and CO2 and CH4 flux, using the previously mentioned
community manipulations, as well as laboratory soil incubations. The Arctic is
an appropriate system for this study because the low number of species allows
whole-community manipulations. Furthermore, dramatic increases in temperature
are expected to occur at high latitudes in the near future. This study is
significant because it links community structure with ecosystem processes. ** //
