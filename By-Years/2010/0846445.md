Technical: This project aims to produce fundamental knowledge about the
molecular level mechanisms of atomic layer deposition (ALD). In particular,
atomic layer deposition of metal oxide films from alkyl amide precursors and
water on GaAs surfaces is studied. GaAs due to its intriguing surface chemistry
provides a suitable system to test and further our understanding of the
molecular level mechanisms and kinetic processes involved in the atomic layer
deposition process. Furthermore, its increasing technological importance make
such as study very timely as it aims to bridge a gap of fundamental knowledge in
the literature. A comprehensive approach that includes both in-situ monitoring
of the surface chemistry using infrared spectroscopy as well as extensive ex-
situ analysis of the materials and interface properties is used during the
research project.&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical: The project addresses basic research
issues in a topical area of materials science with high technological relevance.
Graduate students from diverse backgrounds are trained in an interdisciplinary
field, and a much needed interdisciplinary laboratory course in materials
characterization is introduced to complement an existing lecture course in the
physics of surfaces and interfaces. Undergraduate students from disadvantaged
backgrounds, as well as participants of the McNair program at the University of
Maryland Baltimore County, are mentored during a summer research program with
the goal to encourage their interest in scientific careers.&lt;br/&gt;
