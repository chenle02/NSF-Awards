9531865 Jenkins In this project the PI will participate in two hydrographic
surveys as part of the Atlantic Circulation and Climate Experiment (ACCE), a
U.S. contribution to the International World Ocean Circulation Experiment
(WOCE). The two surveys will cover the central/western basin of the North
Atlantic along 52deg W and 66deg W during the summer of 1997. Specifically, the
PI will provide support to collect and analyze water samples for their content
of Helium-3 and Tritium in order to use them to study water mass formation and
circulation on time scales ranging from a few months to a few decades. This time
scale is critical to the overall objectives of ACCE.
