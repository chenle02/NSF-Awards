Biocomplexity research at the University of the Virgin Islands (UVI) will focus
on areas of biodiversity, ecosystem connectivity, and biocomplexity-related
coastal oceanography. Biocomplexity in the Caribbean Coral Reefs (BCCR) provides
a comprehensive mosaic of biological and physical interactions at the ecosystem
level. Geographical information system (GIS) capabilities of the university's
conservation data center will be utilized to integrate data from the research
and provide the spatial pattern analysis of Caribbean coral reefs needed for
BCCR research. EPSCoR supported research infrastructure improvements will
enhance the study of biocomplexity, strengthen undergraduate research
activities, develop appropriate graduate programs, and improve the supporting
information technology and geographic information systems at the university,
broadly impacting the research enterprise and the community.

The education and human resources component seeks to strengthen teacher
professional development in math and science, increase the number and quality of
undergraduates majoring in science and pursuing research experiences, and
increase the linkages between K-16 students and science curriculum with the
research faculty at the University of the Virgin Islands. The Virgin Islands
EPSCoR (VI-EPSCoR) program will undertake an intensive planning effort involving
biocomplexity research and education to further gain expertise in coral reef
conservation at national and international levels and graduate program
development in marine science. The supplemental planning contributes to UVI's
current efforts to sustain research activities and infrastructure improvements.

The Biocomplexity in Caribbean Coral Reefs focus area relies on the University's
strengths in marine sciences and the unique natural advantages of the Islands'
central location within the Eastern Caribbean. The ultimate goal is to foster
competitive research and education initiatives for the U. S. Virgin Islands
(USVI).
