The objective of this Young Investigator Opportunity award is to formulate and
test a model that explains and predicts the terms of surrender negotiated
between warring parties. This research contributes to the extant literature on
war consequences in several ways. First, the model specifies how individual
preferences and expectations, domestic constraints, and international conditions
affect the bargaining power of the war participants and, as a result, their
ability to negotiate favorable terms of settlement. Second, the model integrates
the literature on war outcomes and war termination, leading to expectations not
only about severity of the settlement but its timing as well. Finally, the model
establishes a link between the domestic consequences of war, on which work has
proceeded rapidly, and the international consequences of war which has received
much less scholarly attention. This preliminary investigation has many important
implications. First, a model which explains the consequences of war will be
extremely relevant to the literature on war causes if we make the very
reasonable assumption that the decision to wage war is conditioned at least in
part on the expectation of the results of war participation. Second, the
empirical results will extend existing research on the influence of regime type,
the relevance of international alliances, and the importance of such
psychological factors as resolve and aspirations to international relations.
Finally, the project provides a general theoretical framework, tha of
bargaining, to understand and evaluate both the domestic and international
consequences of resorting to force to realize political gains.
