The objective of this project is to model how consumers make purchasing
decisions in a world that includes manufacturers and government policy. The
model is an engineering design tool that will help automobile designers
understand their market in the context of the social, public and physical
environments. Psychology and marketing researchers have improved models of
consumer choice by modeling a two-stage decision process in which consumers
first use screen their purchase options to narrow their choices to a
consideration set, and then select a final product from this set. This work
incorporates screening and consideration sets into models of optimal product
portfolio design decisions and energy policy decisions. Simulation experiments
test the hypothesis that using the "consider-then-choose" choice model improves
enterprise-level model performance across a variety of scenarios. The project a
government-industry-academic workshop, a policy white paper, a session at a
technical engineering design conference, and peer-reviewed
publications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work enhances currently-used models of
consumer choice in which every alternative is evaluated via continuous trade-
offs. For example, ignoring non-compensatory consideration behavior may result
in poor design decisions for alternate fuel vehicles (AFVs), leading to
increased CAFE compliance costs and missed opportunities for greenhouse gas
reductions. Automakers must design AFVs acceptable for all customers, not just
early adopters, and enhanced models of consumer decisions are an important part
of meeting this challenge. Consideration rules may restrict the potential market
for AFVs, perhaps due to size, cost, or brand alignment. Forecasts of
transportation energy policy impacts, particularly the effectives of purchase
incentives, are incomplete without including consumer consideration rules. Such
policy can be more effective when it broadens what individuals see as viable
options for personal transportation.
