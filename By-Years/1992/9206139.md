There are a number of problems to be studied. Three problems concern
percolation. The cluster size distribution and closely related aspects of the
geometry of finite clusters will be examined for a continuous model in which the
probability of a bond being occupied is a function of its length; the spread of
th distribution of the passage time in first passage percolation will be
studied; and finite clusters in the Fortuin-Kastelyn random cluster model will
be examined and the results applied to the Ising model conditioned to be less
magnetized thatn is typical. Research in interacting particle systems and
cellular automata will center around four model which have applications in
physics and biology: a catalytic surface reaction model, a threshold forest fire
model, a cancellative system with mass extinction, and a model for the even-odd
theory of food chains. Results to be sought concern the asymptotic behavior of
these model and phase transitions. The investigator will study systems in which
small-scale randomness produces large-scale phenomena which are essentially
nonrandom. Such systems have long been an object of study in mathematical
physics, and more recently also in biology. A standard physical example is a
magnet, in which individual iron atoms have randomly aligned magnetic poles,
with a slight tendency for nearby atoms to have parallel alignments. Depending
on the temperature, this tendency may or may not be reflected in a large-scale
nonrandom amount of magnetization of the chunk of iron.
