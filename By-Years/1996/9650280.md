The emphasis of this project is the acquisition of equipment, computers, and
software in order to provide undergraduate students in the Department of
Materials Engineering with a strong laboratory experience in polymers
engineering. This focus is accomplished by providing the students with a
"complete" engineering experience. They use fundamental knowledge and apply it
to a creative design sequence in order to solve a practical problem in polymer
engineering. Specific goals of the effort are to introduce the students to
state-of-the-art software used in the industry for design and optimization of
injection molding molds and to injection molding processing parameters; to
provide the students opportunities in the operation and principles of injection
molding; and to allow the students the opportunity to compare their predictions
from the software to real part fabrication. To achieve these goals, the contents
of a currently offered course can be revised. In order to improve the teaching
effectiveness and alleviate the current problems, the project develops
laboratory modules focusing on the use of C-MOLD, a state-of-the-art software
package, for the prediction of flow times, pressure, temperature, warpage and
shrinkage, and degree of crystallinity during fabrication of plastic parts; the
experimental validation of the modeling predictions on a fully instrumented mold
with pressure gages and thermocouples; and the design of a mold and the
optimization of processing conditions to produce a part that the students select
and design. Students give an oral presentation in which they are required to
convince a manager that the part is possible to produce, an improvement over
current technology, cost effective, and marketable. They also produce the
technical/marketing brochure that would be used in sales.
