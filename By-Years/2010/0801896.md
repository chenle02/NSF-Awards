Abstract&lt;br/&gt;ECCS-0801896&lt;br/&gt;H. Schmidt, University of California-
Santa Cruz&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective: The objective of this research is to
investigate the dynamic response of single nanomagnets within the type of dense
arrays that will be found in applications including magnetic data storage,
memory, or biosensor arrays. The approach to this effort will be to use time-
resolved magneto-optic Kerr (MOKE) spectroscopy in conjunction with optical
near-field resolution to measure magnetization changes of single nanomagnets
surrounded by magnets in dense arrays. Pre-commercial prototype samples will be
fabricated and provided by the industrial partner, Hitachi Global Storage
Technologies (HGST).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: The dynamic
magnetization response is a natural limit for the operating speed of future
nanomagnetic devices, and a thorough understanding of both the intrinsic
magnetization dynamics as well as the influence of dynamically changing magnetic
fields from nearby neighbors is essential to optimize device performance. Here,
it is proposed to gain this knowledge by (i) developing time-resolved
magnetization detection of a single nanomagnet within a dense array using both
far-field and near-field MOKE, and (ii) measuring dynamic magnetic properties of
individual metal multilayer nanomagnets in dense arrays with sub-picosecond
resolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The collaboration with HGST
will ensure rapid translation of the results of this research to commercial
magnetic storage devices, resulting in broad societal impact through a paradigm
change in the way data are stored. HGST will also provide educational
opportunities for students at different levels through summer internships and
involvement in sample characterization for the project. In addition,
undergraduate students from underrepresented minorities will be recruited to
participate in the research.&lt;br/&gt;
