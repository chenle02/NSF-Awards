0702600&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vitamin C: A Framework for Generating Analyzers for
C Programs&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jerry James&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
intends to increase the level of confidence in software systems deployed in
mission-critical environments by providing a comprehensive platform for
analyzing various aspects of software correctness. More precisely, it focuses on
developing a deductive program transformation framework for automatically
generating specialized analyzers for C programs in an aspect-oriented way. In
contrast with code analyzers that take arbitrary programs as input, this
research will show how to synthesize a code analyzer that is specialized to the
program under analysis and the correctness aspect under consideration. Such
specialization will open up new vistas for making code analyzers more efficient
than is currently possible, as well as providing a platform for experimenting
with different program analysis algorithms. The project will lead to the
development of a deductive framework for a new class of modal logics. In
addition, it will lead to a study of the application of partial evaluation and
program transformation techniques for generating efficient program analyzers
suited to particular analysis problems. The results of this project will be used
to aid open source developers in analyzing their software projects, and to
introduce students to mathematically rigorous techniques for reasoning about the
correctness of software.&lt;br/&gt;
