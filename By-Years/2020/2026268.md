Nontechnical Description&lt;br/&gt;Collective behaviors occur on all scales of
living systems, from organism to tissue to cell to molecules. While various
scientific groups work on these phenomena across many disciplines (evolution,
biology, physics, engineering, etc.), research on collective behaviors is not
well coordinated. The goal of the conference is to bring together and build a
community of researchers working in the field of collective behavior across
scales and across disciplines. The award will provide travel and registration
support to facilitate participation in the Gordon Research Conference on
Collective Behavior, to be held June 6-11, 2021 at Salve Regina University in
Newport, RI. The requested support would enable graduate students and postdocs
to participate in the conference, as such promoting the mentoring and inclusion
of early stage scientists in the formation of the collective behavior community.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description&lt;br/&gt;The Gordon Research
Conference on Collective Behavior will bring together scientists, engineers, and
mathematical scientists, and consists of nine sessions, with formal morning and
evening sessions, and interactive afternoon poster sessions to enable personal
interactions designed to initiate trans-disciplinary collaborations. Through the
interactive program, the conference will contribute towards the establishment of
an enduring inclusive trans-disciplinary community and encourage the
participation of women and underrepresented researchers in the area of
collective behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
