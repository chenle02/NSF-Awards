The objective of this research is to delineate and quantify the physical
interactions or linkages between atmospheric, terrestrial and aquatic systems in
the Arctic. Hydrologic and meterologic data from the North Slope of Alaska will
be synthesized and incorporated into a numerical model that describes pathways
of mass and energy between systems. This modeling work will be augmented with
field data on stream flow, nutrient movement and energy fluxes at system
interfaces. The proposed models will offer new insights into land-surface
feedback processes within the Arctic system.
