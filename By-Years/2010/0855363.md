AST-0855363 PI: David DeVorkin Institution: Smithsonian Institution

This award provides funding to install and operate for one year a professional-
grade astronomical observatory on a terrace of the National Air and Space
Museum, located on the National Mall. The observatory will provide a focal point
for activities associated with the 2009 International Year of Astronomy (IYA).
Programming will include viewing of the sun, moon, and brighter planets during
the day and in evening hours. IYA-related exhibits and activity-based and
inquiry-based public programming will include the appreciation of the sky,
recapturing and preserving the dark night sky, telescopic optics and
spectroscopy, and the national observatory system. The activity by its nature is
designed to have significant broader impact; it will reach millions of visitors
annually to the Nation?s Mall and the National Air and Space Museum.
