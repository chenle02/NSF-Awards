*** 9312581 Yacout This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project
seeks to extend and refine a photon backscatter technique for detecting
corrosion that is hidden from direct external observation. The technique
involves scanning a collimated source photon beam (and its associated collimated
detector) over limited ranges near an external surface, offering rapid
nondestructive examination. Phase II will be concerned with demonstrating
operation and optimizing design of laboratory prototype equipment to inspect
systems that have both thin (< 4 mm) and thick (> 4 mm) external layers (covers)
in both planar and cylindrical geometries. A simulation code developed during
the Phase I study will be upgraded to incorporate polyenergetic source emission,
both slab and general cylindrical geometries, photon detection over distributed
energies (allowing spectral analysis of simulation results), and an expanded
material library that will allow a variety of conditions to be simulated. The
code will be used to identify promising design conditions for experimental
investigation. Laboratory bench-top prototype equipment will be designed,
constructed, and tested over a range of both design and sample variables. Design
variables will be optimized for both thin- and thick-cover conditions. The
methodology has direct application to detection of hidden and inaccessible
corrosion in various man-made systems including aircraft, ships, pipes, storage
and processing tanks, buildings and bridges. Damage to such structures due to
corrosion costs many millions of dollars per year and compromises safety. ***
