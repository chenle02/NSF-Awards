9501312 Snow A neutron polarizer for low energy neutrons will be developed for
use in fundamental symmetry tests, including tests of time reversal invariance
and weak interaction coupling constants. The latter will be used to test the
unitarity of the matrix describing weak transitions between the different quark-
lepton sectors, which in turn tests the fundamental assumption of three
generations of quarks and leptons. The polarizer will be based on neutron
interactions with optically-pumped polarized helium-three. Experiments will be
conducted at the National Institute of Standards and Technology research
reactor. Research in this area will advance our understanding of the electroweak
interaction and fundamental neutron physics, both high priority activities in
contemporary nuclear physics. This project represents development, construction,
and utilization of major state-of-the-art equipment and the education of
graduate and undergraduate students and postdocs.***
