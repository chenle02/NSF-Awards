Abstract&lt;br/&gt;CTS-0130720&lt;br/&gt;A. Gast, Gordon Research
Conferences&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Partial travel support for Young speakers in
the early stages of their careers and for senior graduate students and postdocs
are requested for this 2002 Gordon Conference. The major objective of this
Gordon Conference is to provide a forum for new and established scientists and
engineers in colloidal, macromolecular, and polyelectrolyte solutions to discuss
and exchange information. The conference will facilitate discussion and
exploration of ideas at the forefront of the many complexities of the charged,
macromolecular, interfacial and solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference
has always had interdisciplinary participation from the engineering, physics,
chemistry, and biochemistry communities. An important component of the
conference is the inclusion of young scientists and engineers.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The various session in the conference include self
assembly on surfaces, self assembly in solutions, ordering and nanostructures,
proteins at surfaces, single molecule analysis, DNA sequencing, flow and
microarrays, and polyelectrolytes in biophysics.&lt;br/&gt;
