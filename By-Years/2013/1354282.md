For many years, it has been known that ion channels control muscle contraction
and nerve function. Dr. Bates' group recently showed that ion channels are also
important for cells to determine what type of cells they should become. It is
completely unknown how an ion channel communicates with other known
developmental signaling pathways to participate in cell-fate decisions. The
Bates lab uses genetics and light-controlled channels to figure out exactly how
ion channels communicate with the proteins that have long been known to specify
cell fate decisions. These experiments will determine how different ion flow
controls animal development on a molecular level. Dr. Bates has mentored several
high school students, over twenty undergraduate students, and graduate students
in laboratory research. Funds from this NSF grant enable her to continue
inquiry-based teaching and mentoring. In addition, she encourages under-
represented groups in science by teaching summer programs for under-represented
groups in science.
