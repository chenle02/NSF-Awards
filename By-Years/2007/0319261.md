Dwarkadas&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hot stars, more massive than about
eight solar masses, tend to have strong, high-speed outflows of gaseous
material, which can result in the formation of wind-blown nebulae around these
stars and also can produce effects on the interstellar medium. Recent
observations, which have explored the nature of these nebulae with unprecedented
resolution, have revealed a variety of aspherical morphologies, with bipolarity
being a common theme. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using the theory of radiatively
driven winds and numerical simulations, the formation and evolution of these
circumstellar nebulae, and the origins of the bipolar structure, will be
investigated. These winds are modulated by physical processes such as stellar
rotation, gravity darkening, bistability jumps, magnetic channeling of the
outflow, and inhomogeneities in the stellar atmospheres. The effect of these
processes, both individually and cumulatively, on the latitudinal variation of
the winds, and thereby on the morphology of the surrounding nebulae, will be
explored. Furthermore, the impact of this circumstellar medium on the subsequent
evolution of the massive star as it ends its life in a supernova explosion will
be investigated. The results will be compared to recent and archival data in the
optical and X-ray regimes. &lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
