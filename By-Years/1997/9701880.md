ABSTRACT OPP-9701523 OPP-9701880 BROOKS, STEVEN MASLANIK, JAMES NATIONAL OCEANIC
AND UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION This research project is a
key component of a large, coordinated, multi-investigator program, Surface Heat
Budget of the Arctic (SHEBA) Ocean. The research program will be conducted for
14 months from a ship frozen into the ice pack. These investigators will utilize
measurements of the flux of heat from different surface ice conditions of the
permanent ice cap of the Arctic Ocean. Their results will help determine how
atmospheric and oceanic heating is coupled to adsorption of heat by the ice.
These measurements are critical to understanding how heat is reflected or
absorbed by the sea ice as it melts in the summer and thickens in the winter in
response to seasonal variations in climate. The measurements of surface ice
conditions will be incorporated into a modeling program that makes an essential
contribution to the measurements and modeling by the SHEBA team of researchers.
This project will be integral to the full SHEBA measurement program of
atmospheric and oceanic variables conducted with a large array of instruments on
the ice floe and aircraft flying above as well as ice and ocean property
measurements made on and below the ice floe. The combined set of measurements
and sea ice models in SHEBA will allow refinement of climate models for the
Arctic region. Those improved models will lead to better predictions of the
climate and the permanence of the Arctic ice cap under a proposed global warming
that could occur if atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are increased above
present levels.
