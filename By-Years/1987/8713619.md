Dr. Metiu is supported by the Physical Chemistry Program to work on the
development of theoretical methods to compute the rate coefficients of some of
the most basic thermal processes in surface science: diffusion of hydrogen on a
metal surface and the desorption of hydrogen on a metal surface and the
desorption of alkali from metal surfaces. These are prototypes of two of the
most common chemical processes: proton transfer over and through a barrier and a
curve crossing from an ionic neutral state. They are both induced by the thermal
fluctuations on the surface and are thus simple examples of reactions taking
place in a condensed medium. In addition, Dr. Metiu and his students plan to
work on the photodissociation of CH3I. A quantitative connection between the
dynamics on the upper states and the spectroscopic signals given by the
decomposing molecule will be established. This research program will be assisted
by the acquistion of a new computer workstation that will strongly enhance the
computational power available to support this program. By acquiring the new
workstation, Dr. Metiu's group will accelerate appreciably the turn around time
for the computed results and will have good access to the NSF-supported
supercomputer centers. This additional hardware is provided under NSF initiative
to support Computational Science and Engineering.
