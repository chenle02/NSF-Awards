In a continuation of a previously successful Research Experiences for
Undergraduates Site effort, eight different meteorological organizations ranging
from a university to a National Weather Service Office will host up to ten
undergraduate students during the Summer of 1992. The students will attend
lectures, be exposed to a wide variety of research, academic and operational
activities in the fields of meteorology, electrical engineering and computer
science. Additionally, each student will be assigned to and work with a senior
professional on a topic matched as closely as possible with the students
interest. Partial support for this effort will be provided by the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
