0216197&lt;br/&gt;Chilkoti&lt;br/&gt;A group of investigators at Duke University
and North Carolina State University request funding to purchase an imaging X-ray
photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) for the shared use of faculty. This request is
motivated by an urgent need for contemporary surface analysis tools, especially
XPS, in the research of participating faculty and the lack of such
instrumentation currently at Duke University or in the Research Triangle area
for shared use. The proposed Axis Ultra (Kratos Analytical Inc.) instrument
allows XPS of both conductors and insulators with an energy resolution of &lt;1
eV and a spatial resolution of ~10 um. This instrument will be used by the
research groups of nine faculty at Duke University in the following departments:
Biomedical Engineering (Chilkoti, Reichert and Truskey), Chemistry (Craig,
Grinstaff, Liu, and Pirrung), Materials Science and Engineering (Zauscher), and
Electrical Engineering (Massoud). In addition, two faculty at North Carolina
State University in Chemical Engineering (Genzer) and Chemistry (Gorman) are
also core investigators in this proposal, because of their pressing need for
high spatial- and energy-resolution XPS in their research. The instrument will
be located in the Shared Materials Instrumentation Facility in the Levine
Science Research Center at Duke University, and will be used in diverse projects
that require high spatial and energy resolution XPS. &lt;br/&gt;
