NSF 0429753 Autostereoscopic Visualization and Geometric Computing
for&lt;br/&gt;Biological Macromolecules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The planned
research seeks to develop tools and techniques for&lt;br/&gt;visualization and
geometric reasoning for large proteomics data. The&lt;br/&gt;proposed research
has three main components -- implicit-function-based&lt;br/&gt;representations
for proteins, faster computation of protein&lt;br/&gt;electrostatics, and real-
time auto-stereoscopic visualization. The&lt;br/&gt;research will develop a
unified framework of implicit functions that&lt;br/&gt;can compactly and
efficiently represent non-bonded protein properties&lt;br/&gt;including protein
electrostatics and accessibility. By tightly coupling&lt;br/&gt;these
properties, implicit-function-based representations will likely&lt;br/&gt;result
in synergistically favorable crossovers in the solutions to
these&lt;br/&gt;problems. Further, providing adaptive, progressive, and
hierarchical&lt;br/&gt;representations for implicit functions will allow them to
be used in&lt;br/&gt;multiresolution schemes for storage, transmission, and
computational&lt;br/&gt;steering. Protein electrostatic interactions are of
central importance for&lt;br/&gt;many biological processes. Autostereoscopic
visualization of proteins&lt;br/&gt;and their properties is important in
understanding the 3D structure of&lt;br/&gt;proteins. The proposed research will
develop new methods for rendering&lt;br/&gt;implicit surfaces and volumes using
the recent advances in graphics&lt;br/&gt;hardware as well as adapt efficient
methods for autostereoscopic displays&lt;br/&gt;with personalization.&lt;br/&gt;
