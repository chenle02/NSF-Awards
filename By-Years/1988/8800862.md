This project is concerned with developing a theory of relative structure for
abelian groups. The approach is through a series of equivalence theorems. The
principal investigator will concentrate on Butler groups and global Warfield
groups. In particular, the research will focus on establishing an equivalence
theorem for arbitrary pure subgroups of completely decomposable groups. This
project is in the general area of abelian group theory and is concerned with the
classification of abelian groups. Although the classification of finite abelian
groups has been well understood for a century, the classification of infinite
abelian groups remains elusive. This research involves this old problem of
classification of the infinite abelian groups, approached by new tools from
logic and analysis.
