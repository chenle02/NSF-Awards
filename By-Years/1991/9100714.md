This contract is for the conduct and data processing of the Survey of Graduate
Students and Postdoctorates in Science and Engineering, conducted annually to
yield data on the field distribution, sources and types of support, sex,
citizenship, and racial/ethnic background of students enrolled in graduate
programs in science and engineering fields, and on the number, sources of
funding, sex, and citizenship of science/engineering postdoctorates employed by
institutions of higher education. The contractor will generate detailed
statistical tables displaying survey results and provide technical support as
needed. As part of its requirement under the National Science Foundation Act, as
amended, to provide a central clearinghouse for the collection, interpretation,
and analysis of data on the current and projected availability of scientific and
engineering resources and personnel in the United States, NSF collects and
disseminates statistical data on detailed characteristics of graduate science
and engineering enrollment in academic institutions. Data derived from this
survey series are used by internal NSF management and the National Science
Board. as well as by analysts at the Federal, State, and institutional levels to
predict changes in the supply of scientists and engineers and, in combination
with demand projections based on other sources, to generate early warning of
possible imbalances of supply and demand.
