This project will study the sources of low-frequency variability in the extra-
tropical atmosphere using simple numerical models of the general circulation and
focusing on the role of synoptic variability in generating low-frequency
motions. These investigations, to be carried out using the two-layer primitive
equation model on the sphere, will comprise the following: 1) Detailed
diagnostic studies of the dynamics of low-frequency variability generated during
long integrations of the full model, with and without orography. These
simulations are designated the "controls". 2) Studies of "truncated" models that
exclude the scales at which high-frequency variability is generated. Only the
average effects, computed from the controls, of the high-frequencies will be
included. Low-frequency behavior in these models will, therefore, be autonomous
to large spatial and slow time scales. 3) Experiments that include the forcing
of low frequencies by synoptic variability: the linear and nonlinear time-
dependent barotropic responses to the forcing calculated from the controls and
to stochastic models of that forcing. 4) comparisons, between the control and
truncated models, of the loss of predictability of low-frequency motions. This
work will lead to an understanding of how synoptic scales contribute to low
frequency variability of the atmosphere and will enhance our capability to
predict seasonal climate.
