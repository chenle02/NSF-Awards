This project of Appalachian State University is a three-year program to develop
a statistical education program in the middle school and secondary schools of
North Carolina. Key features of the project include the development of a cadre
of resource teachers, linking the program to state resources, and interaction
between middle and secondary school teachers. The major activities are summer
institutes and conferences during the academic year within three divisions of
the state. The total number of participants is 201, consisting of seventy- two
middle school teachers, ninety-six high school teachers, and thirty- three
coordinators. The project builds on two previous and successful projects at
Appalachian State. Appalachian State University and the North Carolina
Department of Public Instruction have contributed an amount equal to 24% of the
National Science Foundation request.
