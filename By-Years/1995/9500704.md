9500704 Schwarz The proposal consists of several projects, devoted to
mathematical problems of quantum field theory. In particular, we are planning to
use the technique of supergeometry to prove new theorems giving conditions of
exactness of semiclassical approximation. The methods of quantum field theory
will be used to construct invariants of some geometric structures. Almost all
projects are related to string theory, which is now considered as having a
chance to describe all interactions existing in Nature. We will try to construct
the hypothetical "universal string theory" and reach a deeper understanding of
the dimensionality of the space in string theory, using methods of axiomatic
quantum field theory. Quantum field theory is a subject which overlaps central
areas of research in both mathematics and physics. In physics it is at the heart
of the attempt to understand the fundamental particles from which all matter is
formed. In mathematics it is a body of techniques which have wide applications
in areas such as geometry, analysis and probability. The underlying goal behind
this research is to make progress towards the aim of uncovering the fundamental
theory which unifies the forces of nature. ***
