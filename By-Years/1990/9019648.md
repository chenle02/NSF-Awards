The extraction of quantitative information from fluorescent probes in living
cells using videomicroscopy is emerging as an exciting new approach to the
problem of visualizing cell dynamics. Probes which sense cation and anion
concentrations, pH and membrane potential allow temporal visualization of these
processes, especially dyes which produce images at two different wavelengths. A
potentially more exiting application is kinetics of multiple dyes in the same
living cell. Present research instruments use rotating filter wheels to change
wavelengths and are relatively slow in their data collection rates. Also the
high costs for hardware and software prices these custom machines out of the
range of most laboratories. Professor Morris and his group are developing a
novel design of fluorescence video digital imaging microscope, which captures
two video images simultaneously. It is capable of both single excitation/dual
emission, for simultaneous observation of two probes in the same live cell. It
has no moving parts allowing data collection at any rate for which compatible
cameras and storage devices exist. The data collection system uses the AT-
bussed PC computer and standard RS-170 video equipment which reduces the cost of
the system. Thus it represents state-of-the- art technology at very affordable
prices.
