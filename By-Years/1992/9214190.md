High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) is a technique
critical to the characterization of solid-state materials, including ceramics,
inorganic membranes, nano-composites, semiconductors, heterogeneous catalysts,
geologic and extra-terrestrial materials. Research programs utilizing HRTEM at
the University of New Mexico involve assessment of radiation effects in ceramic
materials, volcanic and cosmic dust studies, high pressure phase transformation,
synthesis of ceramic fibers and ceramic thin films and coatings, the processing
of micron-or submicron-sized particles, design of strained- layer optoelectronic
devices, studies of surfaces and interfaces and leaching studies of nuclear
waste glasses. This 200 keV, 0.2 nm point- to-point resolution HRTEM will become
part of the existing Electron Microbeam Analysis Facility.
