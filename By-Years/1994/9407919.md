9407919 Power Relatively little is known about the impact of viruses on natural
plant populations. The objectives of this research project are to measure the
movement of a plant virus between natural and agricultural communities and to
determine the effect of this virus on wild grasses growing in old-field
succession sites. This project focuses on the barley yellow dwarf virus, a
widespread virus transmitted to both wild and cultivated grasses by aphids. This
research will improve our understanding of the relationship between viruses and
their wild and native hosts and on the potential for disease and genetic
material to spread between agricultural plants and their wild relatives and vice
versa. The results will have direct application in plant pathology, pest
control, and agriculture. They may also have application to environmental-impact
studies of the field cultivation of genetically altered crop plants.
