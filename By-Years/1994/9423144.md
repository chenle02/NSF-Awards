This research addresses the problem of structure inference from sparse data. In
2-D, for instance, the idea is to infer curves from points or oriented edges. In
3-D, it is to infer surfaces from points, curve elements, or surface elements.
The idea is to explicitly detect junctions between curves or between surfaces.
The approach involves a non-linear polling, in which active sites "vote" by
generating likely continuation patterns. The result of this poll is a saliency
map where compatible votes reinforce each other, and incompatible ones do not
interact. The implementation is in the form of a non-linear vector convolution.
This research will integrate the 2-D scheme with edge detection; derive a
saliency operator to detect and make use of end-pointformations in 2-D; combine
intermediate results from the various 2-D saliency operators; derive operators
to infer surfaces, edges, and vertices in sparse 3-D data; and adapt line and
surface extraction techniques to work with the saliency maps. This research
should enable improvement of existing edge detectors by improving contours and
making junctions and end-points explicit; enable inference of illusory contour
from end-point formations; and enable inference of dense surfaces from sparse
stereo or motion matches, even in the presence of transparencies.
