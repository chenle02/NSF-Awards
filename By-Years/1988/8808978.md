This research is to understand, through simulation and experimental studies, the
failure mechanisms of new high-density and high-speed memory technologies such
as silicon DRAM's (dynamic random-access memory) with trench-type cell
capacitor, GaAs (Gallium Arsenide) HEMT (High-Electron Mobility Transistor)
SRAM's (static random-access memory) and CMOS (complementary metal oxide
semiconductor) neural network associative memories. Based in this fault
characterization, Dr. Mazumder proposes to develop appropriate test
methodologies. His research is in three phases. The first phase investigates a
new on-chip double-error correction circuit for the multi-megabit Silicon DRAM.
This circuit will correct double-bit/word-line soft errors that cannot be
corrected by conventional error correcting circuits. In the second phase, he is
developing a comprehensive fault model and efficient parametric test algorithms
for high-speed GaAs HEMT Static RAM; and is investigating built-in self-test
circuits to generate the algorithms. The third problem is how to test neural
network associative memories and a study of error correction capabilities of
such memories in the presence of faulty components and erroneous input data.
