The focus of this research is the preparationof thioquinones,
chalcogenofulvenes, chalcogenofulvalenes , nonclassical thiophenes and
thiophene-based macrocycles. Results will lead to a better understanding of the
properties of such compounds and subsequent application to the design of organic
materials in the area of synthetic metals, superconductors and materials with
nonlinear optical properties. With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program is
supporting the research of Dr. Michael P. Cava of the Department of Chemistry at
the University of Alabama. Professor Cava will focus his work on the preparation
of compounds that have the potential to lead to application in the areas of
synthetic metals, conducting polymers and nonlinear optics.
