Cobb, Sharon U. of Florida This proposal examines the matter of financial
services within the context of one offshore financial center-the Isle of Man.
Offshore markets are those for currencies, loans, bonds and other instruments
which exist beyond the reach of regulation by the original national economies.
The Manx economy is now dominated by the financial sector which comprises 35
percent of the island's GNP and 15 percent of its workforce. The research will
attempt to explain the very rapid growth of the Isle of Man's financial sector
over the last twenty years, identify what type of niche market may exist, and
the role of the island's financial sector in the global financial network.
Factors such as legislation, technology, networks, labor characteristics,
location and political stability are thought to be important ingredients of
success. The research methodology is based upon personal
interviews/questionnaires with representatives of approximately 80 financial
services firms on the island. The study will provide empirical evidence on the
reasons for the growth and will also offer comparative insights with studies of
other offshore financial centers. The results will strengthen the theory of
financial services within the global context.
