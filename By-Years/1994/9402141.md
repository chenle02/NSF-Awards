This research addresses various areas of cryptography that have a significant
interaction with combinatorics. The three primary areas of research are: (1)
secret sharing schemes; (2) authentication codes; and (3) resilient functions.
Secret-sharing schemes allow shared computation of a secret key by certain
specified groups of people; they have applications in any scenario where shared
access or shared control is important. codes are a fundamental cryptographical
tool used to guarantee that information has not been altered, and that it
originated with the intended sender. Resilient functions are a type of
cryptographic function that have application to different problems, including
designing of stream and block ciphers and key exchange protocols. All of these
areas involve combinatorial theory in an essential way. Combinatorial designs,
graph theory, error-correcting codes, and linear programming all play an
important role in this work.
