A framing effect occurs whenever a person is influenced by the way in which
information is described or presented (framed). This Research Planning Grant
will assist in the development of a research program which provides an intensive
evaluation of differences in the encoding and processing of information as a
function of positive and negative frames. Recent evidence within the domain of
decision making under risk and related research in psychology suggests that
complex cognitive differences may exist in response to information that is
perceived as positive or negative. Several potential measures of positive and
negative framing effects will be examined to establish their usefulness and
feasibility. These measures include assessments of preferences in risky choice,
information acquisition and use, response consistency, response times, changes
in attitude, attentional biases and memory effects. Studies will be proposed
within typical experimental frameworks and well as within the context of mass
media. The overriding goal is to increase our knowledge of how cognition is
influenced by the framing of information.
