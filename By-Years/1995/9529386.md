In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry
Division, Dudley Herschbach of Harvard University will continue his studies
using molecular beam techniques to examine the effect on reactive collisional
and spectroscopic processes of the alignment of molecules in static electric or
magnetic fields. The current project proposes to develop a more general method
of spatially trapping molecules than investigated previously which uses an
intense laser field to confine suitable molecules for times on the order of
hours. In addition to constructing the trapping apparatus, the PI will use
directional molecules to study phenomena such as rotationally inelastic
collisions of oriented molecules, vector correlations in atom-diatom reactions,
and the shift of chemical equilibrium induced by molecular alignment in a strong
magnetic field. Normally, when molecules react chemically, the mutual
orientation of the colliding partners is completely random. Prof. Herschbach is
developing a general method for orienting the molecules prior to reaction in
order to see if there is an effect on the outcome. Using this technique,
chemical reaction mechanisms can be elucidated at an unprecedented level of
detail. The use of oriented molecular targets in molecular beam studies of
chemical reactions will lead to much more accurate and detailed pictures of gas
phase reaction mechanisms.
