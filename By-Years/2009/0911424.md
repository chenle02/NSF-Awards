The Analytical and Surface Chemistry (ASC) program will support the research
project of Prof. Steven Sibener of the Department of Chemistry at the University
of Chicago. Prof. Sibener and his students will elucidate how the reactivity of
adsorbed species on a surface is influenced by the local structure and ensemble
configuration of adsorbates. Prof. Sibener and his students will couple
variable-temperature UHV-STM instruments that have been developed in the Sibener
laboratory with supersonic and hypersonic molecular beams in order to
systematically explore heterogeneous reaction mechanisms at the molecular level.
This ambitious program will significantly advance our understanding of
interfacial and molecular reactivity, generating fundamental knowledge for
refining our understanding of mechanistic chemistry. The project will provide
excellent training opportunities to undergraduate students, graduate students
and postdoctoral fellows who wish to develop greater understanding of
heterogeneous chemical systems. Prof. Sibener and his students will promote the
understanding of fundamental chemistry in K-12 students and focus their efforts
on students from under represented groups.
