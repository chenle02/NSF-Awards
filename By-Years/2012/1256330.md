Some groups of organisms, like beetles, contain incredible numbers of species,
but most groups contain far fewer species. Likewise, some groups of animals and
plants show dramatic variation in form and function, yet species in many other
groups are so similar that only experts can tell them apart. This variation in
diversity among groups is one of the most striking patterns in biology, yet its
causes are still not understood. The proposed research will develop new
mathematical, statistical, and computer-based tools to help scientists explain
why biological diversity varies so dramatically among different kinds of
organisms. The new methods will be applied to a number of animal groups,
providing a high-resolution window into the historical processes that have
shaped the diversity of life on Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will
create statistical methods and computer software that will enable researchers to
study complex processes that have occurred over millions of years using genetic
data from living species. The methodological tools will be optimized for the
analysis of massive datasets, thus complementing recent NSF initiatives to
reconstruct and analyze the relationships between all living species. The
project will establish an international collaborative network and will provide
extensive training in computational and quantitative biology for undergraduates,
graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers through workshops and mentoring.
