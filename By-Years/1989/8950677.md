A fiber optics instructional laboratory is being developed to create more
enthusiasm and greater understanding of applied electromagnetics. The optical
fiber is an excellent pedagogical mechanism because it allows manipulation of
guided electromagnetic energy is the visible portion of the spectrum. The
laboratory will consist of a numerical modeling and computer simulation
workstation, an experimental characterization of optical fiber coupling and
propogation, and an experimental investigation of a protype fiber optics system.
This project is being matched by an amount equal to the award.
