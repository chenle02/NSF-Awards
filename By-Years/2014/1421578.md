Transmitting large numbers of photos in a wireless environment with bandwidth
constraints is challenging. In this project, the research team aims to develop a
framework to quantify the quality of crowdsourced photos based on the accessible
geographical and geometrical information (called metadata) including the
smartphone's orientation, position and all related parameters of the built-in
camera. From the metadata, information such as where and how the photo is taken
can be inferred, and then only the most useful photos may be transmitted.
Specifically, the project addresses three closely intertwined issues in
resource-aware crowdsourcing. The first part investigates how to select photos
based on the collected metadata by considering two scenarios: Point of Interest
where the selected photos should be about a specific location or object, and
Area of Interest where selected photos are related to an area. For both cases,
various algorithms are designed to quantify the coverage of the photos based on
the metadata, and then to select the minimum number of photos based on the
coverage requirement, or to select a predefined number of photos to maximize the
photo coverage. The second part focuses on metadata transmission and redundancy
removal when crowdsourcing is based on peer-to-peer (P2P) communications. The
third part investigates techniques to automatically and accurately generate
metadata based on sensors available on most off-the-shelf smartphones.

The proposed research could potentially have substantial impacts on emergency
responders and service providers by allowing them to identify the most useful
information from crowdsourced photos under resource constraints. The results
from this research are likely to foster new research directions on supporting
resource-aware crowdsourcing in wireless networks. The project will engage
under-represented students in the proposed research. The scholarly discovery of
this project will be disseminated broadly to the community.
