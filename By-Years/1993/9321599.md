9321599 Gensel Under the direction of faculty adviser Dr. Patricia Gensel at the
University of North Carolina, graduate student Douglas Jensen is studying fossil
materials of the extinct group of early land plants known as zosterophylls,
which are thought to be related to the extant genus Lycopodium. Specimens from
numerous museum collections are to be examined in an effort to amass data on
comparable features of the stem, root, and spore-bearing structures of these
primitive plants, in order to improve delimitation of recognizable species and
genera and to infer phylogenetic relationships among the taxa. Of theoretical
interest, the study will also include an investigation of how fragmentary fossil
materials may be used in compiling data matrices for phylogenetic inference. New
collections of fossil zosterophylls from around the world provide new sources of
data for improved taxonomic discrimination in this group of primitive land
plants and for rigorous hypotheses of phylogenetic relationship.
