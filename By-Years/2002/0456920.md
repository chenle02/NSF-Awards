An Industry/University Cooperative Research Centers (I/UCRC) planning meeting
has been awarded to determine the feasibility of the Ohio State University with
Virginia Polytechnic Institute of establishing a new I/UCRC for Smart Vehicle
Concepts. The faculty members involved from the two universities have
significant research programs in ground transportation and have been active in
automotive systems and smart materials. The Center will focus on novel and
emerging trends in vehicle design where smart structures, next-generation
suspension or mounting devices, vastly improved actuators or valves, and
intelligent sensors will be integrated to develop ground vehicles of the future.
