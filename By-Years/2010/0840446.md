This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award from the Chemistry
Research Instrumentation and Facilities Multiuser Program (CRIF:MU), Professor
Kim C. Calvo and colleagues Matthew J. Panzner, Claire A. Tessier, Wiley J.
Youngs, and Christopher J. Ziegler from the University of Akron will acquire an
X-ray diffractometer. This instrument will support research in inorganic and
organometallic chemistry in areas such as metal-ligand interactions and provide
information on molecular stacking and other intermolecular interactions as well
as aiding in recognizing reaction byproducts, and providing evidence for the
presence of metal hydrides and agostic interactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An
X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three-
dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and
provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of a molecule
relative to neighboring molecules. The studies described here will impact a
number of areas, including chemistry, materials chemistry, and biochemistry.
This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research.
