Kink bands are pervasive structures developed in foliated rocks deformed at mid
to upper crustal levels, and hold the potential to provide determination of
finite strain and principal stress orientation for the episode of deformation
that produced them. This project will investigate the mechanics of kink band
formation in foliated rocks by the integration of theoretical modeling, detailed
observation of naturally-occurring kink bands, and experimentation. By relating
the orientation and geometry of kink bands to the mechanical response of an
anisotropic medium under states of stress, this work should provide a strong
basis for the mechanical interpretation of kink bands as a tool in regional
tectonic studies.
