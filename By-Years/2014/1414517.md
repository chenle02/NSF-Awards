Understanding the serious effects of extreme events in the Sun, solar wind,
magnetosphere and ionosphere system has societal urgency as these events are the
ones what can cause damage to systems in space and on the ground. Over the past
few years it has become increasing evident that the system needs to be studied
as a whole. However, to do so requires combining large amounts of data ranging
from solar remote sensing to in situ observations in the magnetosphere and
ionosphere. Large scale models of the entire system are needed to organize and
interpret the diverse observations. Just determining how to do this is a
significant task. The goal of this proposal is to demonstrate the value of
synoptic analyses for producing new discoveries about how connections within the
geospace system create new or modified phenomena, for raising new questions
about individual processes by looking at things from a different perspective,
and for developing innovative ways of leveraging all the information from global
models and diverse data sets into the most complete picture possible of the
geospace response and the solar drivers. The final outcome of this work will be
a review article referencing all of these and previous synoptic work, drawing
together the broader picture with lessons learned which will serve as a
reference for the details of achieving data/model closure
