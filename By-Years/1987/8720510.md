This award will provide partial funding toward the acquisition of an
inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometer (ICP) by Washington University
in St. Louis. The new instrument is to be housed in the University's Department
of Earth and Planetary Sciences and will be used to provide elemental analysis
of rock and water samples needed in the course of the Department's research
projects and teaching programs. Currently active research that will be making
use of the instrument's capabilities include projects in low temperature
experimental geochemistry, sedimentary petrology, ore genesis, and
extraterrestrial geochemistry. The ICP unit will provide the capability to
completely analyze the trace and major element composition of very small samples
(less than 20 milligrams) of rocks, minerals and aqueous solutions. Such samples
are now beyond the capability of the Department's current analytical systems.
