This workshop is titled,Cell and Molecular Biomechanics: Advancing Mechanics in
Biology and Medicine, to be held May 10-13, 2008 in Atlanta, GA. With recent
advances in bioengineering and life sciences, there is an increasing need to
study the mechanics of living cells and biomolecules as related to biology and
medicine, understand the molecular basis of mechanosensing and
mechanotransduction in living cells, systematically measure the mechanical
behavior of single cells and biomolecules, and develop constitutive models and
simulation tools for quantitative analysis of the mechanical function of
proteins, cells and tissues. The specific goals of this 1.5-day workshop are: to
bring together researchers in applied mechanics, bioengineering, biophysics,
biology and biochemistry to identify critical issues and challenges in
developing mechanics of biology and medicine; to demonstrate the critical needs
and potential impact of mechanics-based studies in improving the quality of life
and human health; to discuss the cutting-edge research in this field and
facilitate interdisciplinary studies; and to identify mechanisms of encouraging
and supporting researchers in applied mechanics to enter this very promising
field. This award will cover the travel expenses of selected workshop
participants, and other Workshop expenses. The presentations and discussions at
the Workshop will be summarized in a report to NSF, and a position paper
published by the ASME Journal of Applied Mechanics (JAM). If successful, this
workshop will help develop biomechanics at the cellular and molecular levels,
stimulate the application of mechanics to cell biology and molecular medicine,
facilitate interdisciplinary studies, and help train the next-generation leaders
in applied mechanics and bioengineering. Therefore, this award has the potential
to generate a broader impact to the fields of applied mechanics, bioengineering,
biology and medicine.
