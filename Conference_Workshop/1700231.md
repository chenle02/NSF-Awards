The proposal requests funding to help defray the expenses of U.S. participants
in the conference "Hilbert Function Spaces 2017" that will be held at a facility
of the University of Milan in Gargnano, Italy from May 29 - June 2, 2017.
Additional information is available on the conference website
https://events.unibo.it/hfs2017

The focus of the conference will be on Operator Theory, Function Theory, and
Harmonic Analysis and their applications. These topics in pure mathematics are
important, for example, in optimization, engineering, quantum physics, and
signal theory. It is important that the next generation of U.S. researchers be
informed of the state-of-the art and future of this field. This award will
enable the participation of graduate students, junior researchers,
underrepresented groups and other U.S. based researchers without support to
participate in this meeting. This program will have significant impact in the
field of function spaces and the future careers of junior investigators.
