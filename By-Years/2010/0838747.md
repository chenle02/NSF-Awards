The University of Massachusetts-Amherst is renewing its participation in the
e-Design center, an I/UCRC center that was created in 2003. The lead institution
is Virginia Tech, and the center at present includes three universities and
approximately seventeen industry members. The mission and Vision of the NSF
Center for e-Design is to serve as a national center of excellence in IT-enabled
design and realization of manufactured products. E-Design involves
conceptualizing, designing and realizing a product (or system) using methods and
software tools that allow for interoperability of remote and heterogeneous
systems and support collaboration among distributed, multidisciplinary
stakeholders.

The University of Massachusetts (UMass) will bring expertise in three of the
four Center thrust areas, including: New Design Paradigms and Processes, Design
Optimization, and Enabling Information Infrastructure. Researchers at UMass will
be focused on the development and application of engineering ontologies related
to product design to enable seamless collaboration and interoperability of
engineering tools and people in a distributed web-environment. The joint
research efforts of researchers at the other Center institutions (Virginia Tech
and University of Central Florida) both complement and strengthen the work at
UMass.

The proposed Center renewal will enable UMass to continue its key research and
leadership role in the Center, as well as contribute significantly to the
successful development and preparation of graduate and undergraduate students.
Benefits to students will include integration of resulting work into coursework
and engineering curricula, as well as internship opportunities. The center will
provide a unique experience to students who can interact and collaborate with
industrial researchers and engineers. Research and educational findings will
continue to be disseminated nationally and will have a significant impact on US
industry as a whole.
