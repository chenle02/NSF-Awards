The Chemical Catalysis Program supports the efforts of Professor Felix N.
Castellano for the investigation of both heterogeneous and homogeneous
approaches to photocatalytic hydrogen production from water. The effort targets
the photochemical preparation, characterization, and photocatalytic properties
of titanium dioxide (TiO2) materials decorated with highly dispersed metallic
platinum and palladium nanoparticles. Photocatalysis is evaluated in aqueous
solutions using bandgap excitation in the presence of hole scavengers and in the
analogous visible-light sensitized materials using select surface bound
ruthenium(II) and osmium(II) complexes in the presence of appropriate
sacrificial electron donors. Various cobalt compounds are tested for their
hydrogen-producing ability in concert with "charged" TiO2 in aqueous solutions.
Homogeneous photocatalysis schemes exploit reductive quenching pathways that
have recently led to significant enhancements in catalytic turnovers. The use of
alternative sacrificial electron donors in these homogeneous schemes has led to
unprecedented catalytic turnovers while greatly expanding the inventory of
potentially useful sensitizers.

This project addresses interdisciplinary research that contributes to the
fundamental knowledge base of converting solar light to an environmentally-
friendly, non-carbon based, combustible chemical fuel. The photocatalytic
systems considered in this research project offer better atom economies and the
potential for much higher efficiencies than other systems. The project fosters
the scientific and professional education of undergraduate and graduate students
as well as postdoctoral associates and visiting scientists. Professor Castellano
participates in various K-12 STEM education efforts including the Imagination
Station of Toledo and the annual "High School Science Days" that take place on
the Bowling Green campus.
