This proposal sustains efforts to characterize exospheric conditions and
coupling with the ionosphere and thermosphere. Three campaigns for simultaneous
observations of the geocoronal Ha (6563 A) emission and incoherent scatter radar
measurements of the topside ionosphere at Arecibo, PR are planned and a single
campaign at Sondrestromfjord, Greenland is planned. The project also takes
responsibility for advanced analysis of the extant CHARM (Collaborative Ha and
Radar Measurements of the Coupled Thermosphere, Ionosphere, and Exosphere)
initiative dat base.***//
