This project is examining the university/industry technology transfer process as
it occurs in projects in the National Science Foundation Industry/University
Cooperative Research Centers (I/UCRC). A pilot project based on studying the
technology transfer of projects from two I/UCRCs at Lehigh University is
developing a strategy for tracking results of research from the university to
the corporation. A systematic procedure for tracking the technology transfer is
being developed. The tracking procedure is then being tested on a new group of
I/UCRC projects.
