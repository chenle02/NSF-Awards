This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
Informatics for FY2001. The fellowship supports research and training at the
postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational,
computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the
fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a
career in biological informatics in which research and education will be
integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics
at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through
these fellowships will play important roles in training of the future workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled "New techniques
for analyzing the representation of auditory stimulus features by ensembles of
cortical neurons." This project is concerned with the analysis of stimulus-
related information contained in firing patterns of ensembles of 16 or more
simultaneously-recorded neurons in auditory cortex. Statistical pattern
recognition techniques are used to characterize relationships between the
acoustic properties of sounds in space and information-bearing features of
neural responses.
