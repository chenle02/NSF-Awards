Electro Rheological (ER) fluids have the ability to change their viscosity
several orders of magnitude when subjected to varying electrical fields. This
unique property allows the development of "smart" composite materials to control
the damping coefficient of high performance products, such as robot arms,
aircraft wings, and helicopter rotors. The expedited research to be performed
with this grant will explore the use of ER fluids in relation to heat transfer
based products such as solar windows, thermal switches, heat exchangers, and
electronic device thermal controls. The thermophysical properties of the ER
fluids will be determined as a function of temperature and applied electrical
field, and an experiment will be performed to prove the concept that the fluids
are suitable for thermal switches. With the sensitivity of the thermal
properties to the electrical field revealed, the impact of thermally smart
materials on the field of heat transfer design can be determined.
