The goal of this two-day workshop is to examine how principles of neural
computation may be used to enhance our understanding of human speech perception
and production. The workshop will focus on one specific principle of neural
computation: the role of endogenous brain oscillations in speech perception and
production. This framework has the potential for increasing the accuracy of
models for speech perception and production as well as improving the performance
of systems associated with human-machine interaction (including automatic speech
recognition and text-to-speech systems).
