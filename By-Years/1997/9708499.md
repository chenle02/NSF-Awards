9708499 Langreth The work of this senior and distinguished PI contains several
related components. One of them is a density functional theory of long-range
interaction between microscopic and mesoscopic bodies. Another looks at a theory
of electronic dissipation, non-adiabatic charge transfer and potentials and
rates for atoms and molecular species moving and reacting at a solid surface. A
third component is an initial foray into the theory of transport in quantum dots
using techniques previously developed by the PI for non-adiabatic charge
transfer. %%% The work of this senior and distinguished PI is related to the
properties of metals and insulators at a surface. The work explores the new
physical phenomena which are seen as an electron, an atom or a molecular specie
moves near a surface. These include very subtle, long range and technologically
important questions of forces between small bodies and between a small grain and
a surface. They include complex questions of charge transfer, when does it
happen and how. Finally there are attempts to understand transport in very small
metallic grains. ***
