The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program supports Professor Zare in a
detailed investigation of kinematically constrained reactions, which offer the
unique possibility of directly viewing the role of reagent approach geometry in
reacting systems. The experiment attempts to achieve an understanding of
reaction dynamics at its most fundamental level. In the reaction of Ba atoms
with HI molecules, the translational energy is specified using molecular beam
techniques and the BaI product state distributions are determined with laser
induced fluorescence. Angular momentum constraints give detailed relationships
between the incoming impact parameter and the resultant detailed product state
distributions. Optical pumping of the reagent molecule is used to specify the
internal state and ultimately the degree of alignment of the HI molecule,
yielding state-resolved information on the correlation between reagent approach
geometry and the resulting product distributions.
