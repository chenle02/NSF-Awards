The problem addressed by this project is the inference of 3- D attributes of a
moving object from a sequence of noisy images of the object. The 3-D attributes
of interest are the translational motion and position, to a global scale factor,
the rotational motion and position, and the object structure, again to a global
scale factor. This research, high image noise levels are allowed, perhaps as
much as 20% of the object image size. Such noise levels can occur even in high
resolution imagery, whenever the image of the object is small relative to the
sensor field of view. The approach taken in this proposal is to model the 3-D
rigid body motion using the principles of kinematics. The kinematic equations
propagationg translation and rotation are written in the form of a state space
model. The noisy feature points or lines form the measurement model. Given that
point or line correspondences over a long sequence of frames are available (or
established) our goal to develop recursive and batch techniques for the
estimation of 3-D motion and structure parameters. Performance measures such as
the theoretically attainable lower bounds for the estimated parameters will be
derived. Extensions to the two camera problem will also be attempted and
algorithms developed will be tested on both synthetic and real image sequences.
