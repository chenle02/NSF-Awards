Safety-critical systems refer to systems whose failure or malfunction may result
in death or serious injury to people, loss or severe damage to equipment, or
environmental harm. One key issue is whether it is safe to operate wireless
devices for monitoring, control, and coordination in these systems, or whether
current wireless devices can safely coexist with these critical devices? This
project develops novel and holistic solutions to monitoring, policing and
assessing the coexistence of wireless devices in and near safety-critical
systems. Intellectually, the project advances the state-of-the-art in both
algorithm design as well as experimental systems related to safety-critical
applications through 1) the design of a distributed passive monitoring system
that captures cross-layer information regarding radio frequency activities, 2)
the development of device profiling and identification algorithms for
characterizing and tracking active devices, 3) the development of wireless
advisory to identify and make recommendations on the proper responses to
potentially safety hazardous conditions, and 4) validation through real-world
experiments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Addressing the co-existence issues of
wireless devices for safety-critical applications has far-reaching societal
impacts. Ensuring the safe operation of wireless technologies in or near safety-
critical applications can automate the process, reduce human errors, and avoid
safety hazards. The interdisciplinary nature of this transformative research
contributes to the development of the nation's future workforce by ensuring that
undergraduate, pre-doctoral, and postdoctoral students receive the didactic and
research experiences necessary to engage in integrative and team approaches to
solve complex problems.
