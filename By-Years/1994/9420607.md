This project involves the research of a cultural anthropologist from
Pennsylvania State University. The project will test the evolutionary
significance of a system of social paternity among a tribal group in lowland
Venezuela which allows multiple males to claim paternity of a child. When
paternity is recognized, the adult has responsibilities to care for the child as
a parent. The hypothesis is that some mothers (in regions with high male death
rates due to homicide) will claim that men have paternal ties to the mothers'
children in order to increase their own, and their children's chances of
successful survival. The project will collect reproduction data on about 70
women to add to the investigator's data base, and will complete data on about
800 children. This research is important because it will test a theory of the
positive functions of `multiple paternity` in a relatively simple forest-
dwelling social group. This will advance our understanding of the likely social
arrangements of primitive social groups in human history.
