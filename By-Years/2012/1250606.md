This project investigates contemporary U.S. sexual assault trials, focusing on
how legal norms for trying sexual assault and interpreting consent have been
shaped by medico-legal evidence and expertise. In a post-forensic age, medico-
legal evidence has captured the civil and scholarly imagination, drawing on
public resources while shifting practices within the sexual assault trial.
Ethnographic study at the site of the trial focuses on the process of sexual
assault adjudication in order to identify how various actors assemble, represent
and use evidence and expertise in the legal forum. Combining anthropological and
criminological backgrounds, investigators use court observations, interviews,
and trial transcripts to analyze the ways in which evidence produces cultural
narratives of sexual assault within the trial setting. This study identifies
where institutional practices introduce jurisdictional variation. Investigators
will observe sexual assault adjudication in three branches of the Milwaukee
County Circuit Court, and interview forensic nurse examiners, victim-witness
advocates, attorneys, expert witnesses, and judges.

Incorporating grounded theory and feminist perspectives, this study explores the
cultural value of forensic evidence. It engages researchers across a range of
disciplines, including legal anthropology and sociology, gender, and social
studies of science and medicine. Despite public cries for accountability and
legislative efforts to insure rape kit processing, researchers know very little
about what types of evidence are most compelling, how evidence is made
compelling, and how it impacts decision-makers in sexual assault trials. This
project fills gaps in research on sexual assault adjudication by examining the
inclusion and presentation of medico-legal and forensic evidence in the
courtroom, particularly as evidence is used to make claims about consent and
credibility.
