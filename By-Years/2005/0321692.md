This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a
ceramic hydrogen fuel appliance (CHFA) using ceramic microreactor modules (CMMs)
using a low-cost, net-shape manufacturing process, and a new material, that was
developed in the Phase I project. The new material developed was demonstrated to
have excellent capability for cost-effective microfabrication of ceramic
components with sub-micrometer precision. Further, it has good materials
properties, including very high component surface area and thermochemical
stability to temperatures as high as 1000 degrees C, that make it an ideal
material for fabrication of CMMs. The commercial and broader impacts of this
technology will be as hydrocarbon fuel reformers that supply hydrogen to fuel
cells used as auxiliary power units (APUs) on board automobiles/trucks.
