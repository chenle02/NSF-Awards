A team of four geometers will investigate a variety of problems in complex
differential geometry, Riemannian geometry, and related areas. The role of
spaces of algebraic cycles in universal constructions in topology and homology-
cohomology theory will be carefully studied. Work will progress on establishing
the existence of Kahler-Einstein metrics on open manifolds, on the structure of
p-Kahler spaces in Moishezon geometry, and on the structure of Riemannian
4-manifolds with boundary. The team of investigators will establish more of the
ground work necessary for the understanding by physicists of our four
dimensional space-time. The connections between the branch of mathematics
broadly referred to as "differential geometry," and cosmological physics dates
back to Einstein; the mathematical theory which Einstein applied goes back even
further to Gauss and Riemann in the nineteenth century. The group being funded
here maintains close connections with physicists, and steers their research in
directions of current excitement both to mathematicians and physicists.
