The objective of this work is to characterize the dynamic processes that couple
highly excited molecular states with the dissociation and ionization continua. A
new multiparticle detector will permit the simultaneous investigation of the
energy and angular distributions of several electrons and ionic fragments
produced from a single molecule in strong field excitation. Specific objectives
include (1) characterization of the competition between dissociation and
ionization in multiphoton excited molecules, (2) determination of the electron
energy distribution from electrons arising in multiple ionization, and (3)
determination of the temporal sequence of photon absorption in Coulomb
explosions.
