Many computational and combinatorial problems can be reduced to problems in
geometry. For example, from a data set, we can generate families of points or
lines in the plane. This leads us to study the structure of finite families of
geometric sets. Surprisingly, many breakthroughs in this area use tools from
equivariant topology, which may, at first glance, seem far detached from the
original goal. This project will reinforce the connections between computational
geometry, combinatorics, and topology. Success in the objectives of this project
will illuminate new connections between these areas. The project will also
establish a program to prepare students from minoritized groups for summer
research opportunities in mathematics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The topological
problems of this proposal deal with high-dimensional mass partition problems,
such as the Stone-Tukey theorem. The project focuses on establishing connections
with general fair partition problems (related to envy-free partitions) and
problems related to the intersection patterns of convex sets. These are areas in
which crucial results use similar methods. This project will show that said
similarity is a consequence of a deeper connection between the families of
problems listed. This work will yield new insight into how one can leverage
topological tools to solve combinatorial problems. The project also includes
computational applications to problems in supervised
learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
