9501330 Ruderman This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project
addresses the need for a process to grow large Zinc-Germanium-Phosphorous (Zn-
Ge-P) single crystals of high optical quality and low absorption in the 1 to 3
micron optical region, at low cost. The research objectives include: (1)
measuring phase equilibria in the Zn-Ge-P system; (2) extending understanding of
the defect structures in these crystals; (3) determining the role of important
impurities; (4) developing a new synthesis and crystal growth process; (5)
annealing studies of grown crystals to decrease optical absorption; and (6)
extensive characterization of grown crystals. These Zn-Ge-P crystal with
improved optical transmission and crystal quality will provide efficient
generation of tunable laser radiation from 2.5 to 12 microns. Potential
applications include remote detection of contaminants, defense uses in laser
jamming and warning systems and enhanced spectral analysis techniques for
chemical analysis.
