Research under earlier Phase I and Phase II SBIR awards to Continuum Dynamics
showed that the addition of fixed panels to the rear of a tractor-trailer rig
reduced air drag by 10% and suggested that reductions as large as 25% might be
achievable. The current Phase I SBIR award aims at identifying drag reduction
devices which are retractable, stowable, and which approach a 20% reduction in
air drag. Various geometries will be tested on a modified passenger van.
Measurements will include wind speed and direction, ground speed of the vehicle,
and pressure distribution over the aft region of the van. In addition, high
speed films will be made to reveal overall flow patterns. It is estimated that
reduction of air drag by 20% for the nation's existing trailer fleet would save
2 billion gallons of diesel fuel a year. The associated favorable impact on the
US fuel usage and air quality would be considerable.
