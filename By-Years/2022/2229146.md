This award will support students from institutions of higher learning in the
United States to participate to the 61st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control
(CDC), to be held in Cancun, Mexico, December 6-9, 2022. The CDC has been for
over fifty years the worldâ€™s leading annual forum for scientific and engineering
researchers who share an interest in systems and control theory, and in the
foundations of automation technology. As in the past, the 61st CDC will feature
the presentation of contributed and invited papers, tutorial sessions, as well
as plenary and semi-plenary sessions and workshops. The conference brings
together academic and industrial researchers and students who share their latest
research ideas and discuss needs for further development of the field in light
of current and anticipated developments in applications and
technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The range of topics covered at the annual CDC
is extremely broad, mirroring the varied applications of control and systems
theory. The system-theoretic approach has played a critical role in the
development of many contemporary infrastructures and technologies affecting
everyday life. Today, for example, system and control-theoretic tools are
central in the design, operation, and security of cyber-physical systems, where
they can inform researchers about ways to operate large networks (e.g., power,
communications, computer, transportation, and health-related
networks).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students receiving travel funds from this award
to attend the CDC will have many opportunities to interact with members of the
professional community in a stimulating setting, and to exchange ideas with a
broad group of colleagues. The large number of workshops before the conference
and the interactive format of many of the presentations will allow additional
opportunities for training and learning. Specific outreach efforts will be
devoted to advertising the conference and the student travel award program to
under-represented minorities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
