Dr. Peter Wolczanski of Cornell University proposes to investigate the chemistry
of low-coordinate inorganic/organometallic complexes supported by bulky
siloxide, silamide, silimide, thiolate, and acetylide ligands. In particular,
the small molecule activation chemistry of these systems will be explored, and a
new class of metal-organic solid state materials will be developed, with an
emphasis on comprehensive training of the graduate students involved. A major
goal is to generate a greater understanding of the thermodynamic aspects of C-H
bond activiation by `tying` C-H bond activations to energetically similar ligand
substitutions, and by measuring equilibrium isotope effects and comparing them
to theory. Also, C-N bond cleavage reactions will be explored, especially as
they relate to HydroDeNitrogenation processes. Mechanistic studies and
systemization of oxidative addition processes of these systems is a general
research goal, and studies of early transition metallaradical based C-H bond
activation chemistry and metal organic solid-state compounds with covalent
networks are included. The chemistry of a class of unique inorganic complexes
with bonds to nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and carbon substituents will be studied
for two reasons. One is that these compounds display unusual and unique
reactivity with C-H and C-N bonds in other molecules, and have implications for
improving industrial processes. The other is that they can be used as molecular
precursors in the synthesis of novel materials of high complexity. These studies
place experimental studies in a theoretical framework, and it is hoped that the
fundamental chemistry discovered will lead to improved methods of controlling
the reactivity of hydrocarbons and of designing interesting materials.
