CTS-9500413 Edith M. Sevick University of Colorado - Boulder A device will be
developed to measure the pressure drop and volumetric flow rate through
membranes. The equipment includes a pump, flow meter, computer and data
acquisition software and other peripherals. The equipment will be used to
investigate the shear response characteristics of porous membranes coated with
an absorbed layer of polymer. The polymer brush may lead to a new type of
microvalve that will allow flow control without mechanical parts or feedback
loops. The effects of polymer characteristics and pore size distribution will be
studied. The device may find applications in filtration and other separation
techniques, as well as biomedical devices.
