Abstract: Current techniques used for metrology are plagued by slow measurement
speed, susceptibility to surface interactions, and some techniques can even
deform the measured surface due to tip wear on the surface. Development of new
tools to address these challenges could spawn a new era in the area of nano-
metrology, and nano-assembly of structures. Such systems can have significance
in the area of electronics, optical, and biological applications. This
integrated research and education GOALI proposal centers around the development
of elastic wave resonators and integration of Ag2Ga nano-needles and
photomechanical actuators to enable precise tools for nanomanipulation, nano-
metrology and nano-assembly. The principle of elastic wave resonators is a
method by which single and multidimensional standing waves propagate at a rate
of kHz to MHz along a high aspect ratio micro-scale filament. The magnitude of
energy contained within the "wave packet" compared to the flexibility and
stiffness of the filament enable pronounced standing waves to be generated and
sustained along the filament. The proposal objectives are to investigate the use
of nanoscale standing wave probe resonators for metrology, understand the
electro-mechanical limits and scaling issues of such resonators, develop
mathematical models and develop applications in nano-assembly. The educational
aspects of the proposal are utilizing research based undergraduate course in
nano-mechanical resonators, internships at industrial sites, graduate level
course on nano-mechanical resonators, and opportunities for underrepresented
students in this exciting area.
