9322828 Simchi-Levi The emphasis in this research is to perform a theoretical
analysis of vehicle routing problems with the objective of developing robust and
efficient algorithms for the problems. The objective is to be attained through
the understanding of the underlying theoretical structure of optimal solutions
and using the results to develop practical and efficient algorithms that take
advantage of this structure. To understand the underlying structure, different
variant forms of vehicle routing problems will be analyzed to develop and
implement different algorithms. This research has a good potential to produce
some additional insight into the vehicle routing problem. Such insight is
critical in developing efficient algorithms for this class of problems. Vehicle
routing problem exist in both the public and private sectors. Improvement in the
vehicle routing can produce efficiency in fleet management, and consequently,
significant savings in travel time and operating cost. The importance of this
problem is well demonstrated by the support the research is receiving from a key
member of the users community of the research output, namely, school systems.
