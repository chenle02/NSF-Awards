ABSTRACT The principal investigator proposes to study the use of porous silicon
layers for improving the performance of vapor sensors. Silicon layers have
demonstrated capacitance sensitivity to the amount of vapor absorbed and their
use will permit the development of miniaturized sensors which can operate at
high temperatures. By optimizing the pore structure, these sensors will have
improved sensitivity and with the inclusion of thermoelectric cooling/heating
can sense a large range of vapors. Miniaturization will allow for local control
of processes and temperatures.
