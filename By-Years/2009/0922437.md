Language, like walking or other everyday activities, is skilled behavior.
Speaking involves coordinating different organs in the vocal tract as their
movement unfolds in space and time. The proposed research aims to understand the
relation between speech movement timing and syllables. A core objective is the
development of rigorous analysis techniques for understanding syllabic
structuring. The research will use existing databases of articulatory and
acoustic recordings of English and Arabic. English and Arabic have different
patterns of allowable consonant sequences across and within syllables, making
the comparison a good test case for the research.

Syllables are ideal for studying the link between speech timing and linguistic
ability. Previous work has shown that developing the skill of reading may
require mastery of the timing of speech movements. Syllables are thus crucially
implicated in reading because speech movement timing depends on the syllable
structure of the specific language. Syllable structure is also implicated in the
error patterns of patients with apraxia of speech. The availability of
techniques for assessing syllable structure would offer valuable tools for
understanding normal language development as well as impairment or developmental
delay in patients and child populations.
