This research will advance our knowledge of user-generated doctor ratings on the
Internet, thereby providing the basis for improving these systems and increasing
their value for better consumer choices. In so doing, the research will achieve
a more general advance in our understanding of online reputation systems. The
study has three aims: (1) to examine the supply of online doctor ratings,
including their prevalence, growth trends, and the factors that affect rating
posting behavior; (2) to assess the informedness of online doctor ratings,
especially whether these ratings truly reflect the quality of the doctor or
whether they are biased and misleading, and (3) to understand the use and
impacts of online doctor ratings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite the growing
popularity of online physician ratings, there is surprisingly little study of
this emerging trend. What motivates patients to provide online ratings? To what
degree do the ratings reflect a doctor's clinical quality? How do patients use
these ratings, and how are their decisions affected as a result? In what
situations should patients be cautious when using online doctor ratings? Can the
user interface design and information display be improved to make the ratings
more useful? The research represents the first systematic study of these
fundamental questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Findings from this study will have a
direct impact on the policy and practice of quality transparency in healthcare.
They will be particularly beneficial for senior citizens, who require more
medical services, but they also will be incorporated into new college
curriculum. Furthermore, upon completion of the study, the methods and non-
proprietary data will be made publicly available to further enhance the research
and education infrastructure.
