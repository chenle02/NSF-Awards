9353080 Leuth Tarleton State University will initiate a 6 week residential,
Young Scholars project in earth science, life science, meteorology and chemistry
for thirty rural students entering the 9th and 10th grades. Activities and
instruction are centered around a central environmental science theme: non point
source pollution in two watersheds. Scientific methodologies focus on pollution
identification and remediation. The program provides classroom instruction,
lab/field exercises, seminars on ethics and forums on career opportunities.
Students generate, synthesize and present data in a final two day seminar for
parents, peers and school teachers. In the follow up activities, students return
to TSU for re-sampling and analysis of waters and biologic materials. ***
