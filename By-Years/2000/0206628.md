The goal of this project is to understand the evolution of complex genetic
architectures and the role they play in the early stages of speciation. The
study involves three phases: (1) Line crosses between flour beetles (Tribolium
castaneum) collected from populations around the world to produce all 1st and
2nd generation hybrids. These crosses are then analyzed statistically to
quantify the contribution of genetic interactions; (2) Population structure -
for the line-cross populations, we will assay mtDNA sequence and microsatellite
marker variation to quantify the genetic divergence among them; and, (3) Mapping
- A microsatellite linkage map will be assembled to find regions of the genome
responsible for hybrid incompatibility. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gene interactions
are important to speciation because negative genetic interactions are necessary
to lower hybrid fitness. On the other hand, a major reason for the success of
commercial agriculture is increased hybrid productivity. This study will
contribute to the understanding of gene interactions and the understanding of
how geographic and genetic divergence among related populations leads to
decreased fitness in some cases but increased fitness in others. &lt;br/&gt;
