Administrative and Logistical Support for a Series of Expert Workshops on
Japanese Technology Evaluation. The overall objective of the Japanese Technology
Evaluation (JTECH) study is to assess Japanese research and development in
selected high- technology areas and to compare the Japanese efforts with those
in the United States with respect to their potential impact on the long-term
economic competitiveness of the United States. The assessments will be carried
out by panels of U.S. experts who will tour Japanese research and manufacturing
facilities as possible, review key Japanese technical literature, and prepare
draft reports of their findings. These reports will be reviewed by additional
experts at a series of workshops. So far, seven fields of technology have been
assessed in the first two phases of the study. This award is for administrative
and logistical support in connection with the third phase of the study, in which
an additional three technologies will be assessed. Work performed under this
award will include assisting in the definition of topics for assessment,
recruitment of panel members, translation and provision of appropriate Japanese
technical literature to panel members, organizing expert workshops, and editing
panel reports.
