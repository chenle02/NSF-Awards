This project will use data obtained from the Kepler satellite to search for
transiting planets in open star clusters. All data are already obtained. One of
the main goals is to improve the accuracy of stellar ages using stellar rotation
techniques(gyrochronology), which has applications to other fields of stellar
astronomy. This work will be used to constrain planet formation models in open
star clusters. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the work include making
the data publicly available and training undergraduate students in research,
including experience with reduction and analysis of stellar spectra for stellar
properties, radial-velocities, and binary star orbits, and with time-series
photometric data for transiting planets and stellar variability(rotation).
