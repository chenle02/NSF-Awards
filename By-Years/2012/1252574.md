EarthCube is a joint venture between the Directorate of Geosciences and the
Office of Cyberinfrastructure at the National Science Foundation. It is a
community-driven effort to design and implement an effective data and knowledge
management system for the geosciences that will integrates disparate data sets
and web services and serves all members of the geoscience community. This 2-day
workshop at the University of Colorado brings together investigators and other
interested parties who have been tasked with developing cyberinfrastructure
components that are potential candidates for inclusion in the final architecture
and design of EarthCube. Participants at the workshop will be tasked to
synthesize community input from the June EarthCube meeting and sequence the
series of proposed milestones and events included in community-created road maps
of key cyberinfrastructure capabilities that were generated over the course of
the last six months. The overarching goals of the workshop will be to propose a
workable cyberinfrastructure framework for EarthCube and work out a provisional
timeline for its implementation. Participants will consist of key individuals
already working on potential EarthCube architecture components, as well as those
from newly formed special interest groups such as those interesting in having
EarthCube link to and incorporate biological datasets; those seeking to serve
the needs of geoscientists who work with unique sample-based data, as opposed to
large homogeneous datasets coming from sensor arrays; and those trying to
develop software to allow direct ingestion of data from laboratory instruments.
Broader impacts of the workshop lie in the area of building infrastructure for
science and engineering.
