The persistence and physico-chemical degradation of plastics in the marine
environment is increasingly recognized as an important though little understood
problem with potentially broad scientific and public implications. To address
this issue, a research team at the Sea Education Association (SEA) will conduct
environmental exposure studies and analysis of plastic debris collected from the
Pacific (over 11 years) and North Atlantic and Caribbean Sea (over 26 years)
that have been archived by the SEA. With this study, these workers will address
basic questions regarding the problem of plastic degradation and persistence in
the sea. As such, the proponents are in a position to obtain potentially
transformative results that will be of global significance. In addition to the
broader scientific significance of an improved understanding of plastics
degradation in the marine environment, this study will provide valuable
opportunities for training undergraduate students and K-12 teachers.
