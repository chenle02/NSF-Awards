This study will assess the commercial impact on U.S. industry of U.S. federal
laboratories' scientific and technical outputs. The assessment will be from the
perspective of industry. Using data from a recent comprehensive study of 297
federal laboratories performed by the U.S. GAO, a population of federal
laboratories will be defined. From that population a stratified probability
sample about 40 federal laboratories will be drawn. The laboratories' Office of
Research and Technical Applications Ä±ORTA! (or the equivalent) will provide
information about technical activities of the laboratories and outputs used by
industry. The technical activities of the laboratories and outputs used by
industry. The technical activities examined include not only the direct products
of federal laboratory research, development, and demonstration (RD&amp;D)
activities, but also the indirect transmission of knowledge and know-how. From
ORTA records, a sample of industrial users will be developed. The study will
gather qualitative and survey data from industrial users on such questions as
how the users became aware of federal laboratories' products, barriers to use of
the products, commercial value of the products, and level and types additional
technical development performed by the user. The study will also examine a set
of "non-users." The industrial users will be asked to identify firms similar (in
size, product lines, market share) to their own. The investigators will then
contact those similar firms, identify "non-users" of federal laboratory
products, potential interest in those products, and perceptions about
requirements for using federal laboratory outputs. This design will (a) explain
patterns of laboratory- industry interactions, and (b) assess the commercial
impacts of the federal laboratories.
