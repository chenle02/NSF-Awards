Recent research suggests that changes in deep ocean water formation occur
rather abruptly over the geological time span, leading to rapid climatic
changes. This project will focus on numerical modeling of changes in the rate of
deep water formation and its effect on the climate system, using energy balance
models of both the atmosphere and the deep ocean. The work would enhance our
understanding of rapid oscillations in the climate system that are known to have
occurred over the last deglaciation episode, especially around 10,000 years ago.
