The PI will investigate several aspects of polynomial mappings and related
matters. One topic involves orbits of complex polynomials. The proposer will
study when the cartesian product of finitely many such orbits has infinitely
many points in common with an algebraic subvariety of affine space. This is a
dynamical analogue of the Mordell--Lang conjecture about intersections of
subgroups and subvarieties of group varieties. Another topic is to determine the
polynomials over a field of positive characteristic inducing mappings with
certain properties; these properties can be recorded in the monodromy group of
the polynomial, so the problem is to determine polynomials with prescribed
monodromy group. Via a splitting field construction, polynomials with unusual
monodromy groups give rise to curves with large automorphism group. Such
polynomials could thus be classified if one could classify curves with large
automorphism group over an algebraically closed field of positive
characteristic, which is the next topic the PI will study. A fourth topic is the
theoretical and algorithmic analysis of the problem of computing the
intersection of two subfields of the field of rational functions, along with
generalizations to mappings between curves. A final topic addresses connections
between discrete mathematics and algebraic geometry, for instance via connecting
certain combinatorial objects (Kloosterman sums) with parameter spaces (Shimura
curves).

This project focuses on polynomials. The classical topic of dynamical systems
studies the orbit of a number under a polynomial, which is the collection of
numbers obtained by repeatedly applying the polynomial to the number. For
instance, the orbit of the number 1 under the polynomial f(x)=3x+1 is 1, 4, 13,
40, and so on. One question is when one such orbit can contain infinitely many
numbers whose square is in an orbit of another polynomial. More generally, the
PI will study when there is a polynomial relationship between infinitely many
points in one orbit and infinitely many in another. The proposer intends to
determine all examples of this phenomenon by proving new results about certain
types of identities of the form a(b(x))=c(d(x)), where a, b, c and d are
rational functions (i.e., ratios of polynomials).
