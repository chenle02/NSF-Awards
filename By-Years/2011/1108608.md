The first main thrust of the proposal is the analysis of the random fluctuations
of solutions to equations with random coefficients. The investigator and his
collaborators will develop asymptotic models for random fluctuations for several
classes of partial differential equations and will use these models as
Benchmarks to assess the validity of upscaling algorithms. These models will
also be applied to the understanding of the random fluctuations of high
frequency waves propagating in heterogeneous media. Such fluctuations control
the accuracy of reconstructions of buried inclusions in cluttered media. The
second main thrust of the proposal is the theoretical and numerical analysis of
hybrid inverse problems as they appear in medical imaging. Such inverse
problems, which are actively researched in the biomedical imaging community,
promise to devise novel imaging modalities that combine high resolution with
high contrast.

Partial differential equations with random coefficients and their numerical
solutions are ubiquitous in applied sciences and engineering and find direct
applications, e.g., in the quantification of uncertainties in geological basins
and other large scale environments, in atmospheric effects that participate in
the analysis of global warming, and in the manufacturing of composite materials.
Photo-acoustic Tomography and other novel medical imaging methods in the class
of hybrid inverse problems offer to revolutionize the practice of medical
imaging by providing an unprecedented combination of high contrast and high
resolution capabilities.
