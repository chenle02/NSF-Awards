This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will synthesize
and coat doped Zinc Oxide (ZnO) as a transparent and conducting thin film on a
polymer substrate for flexible flat panel display applications. The objective is
to find a low-cost alternative to widely use Indium tin oxide. Thin films of
doped nanocrystalline ZnO will be coated on flexible polymer substrates using a
proprietary plasma coating technique. The target temperatures will be less than
100 degree C. During the Phase I, these low cost coatings will be developed and
their performance parameters will be studied, which will be followed by
extensive field-testing and scale up studies in the Phase II
effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commercially, important applications of ZnO as a
TCO (transparent conducting oxide) include: Flat-screen-high definition
television (HDTVs), high-resolution screens for portable computers,
electrochromic mirrors, defrosting mirrors, touch panel controls, and
electromagnetic shielding. The market potential for such products is increasing
exponentially owing to the microelectronics revolution and has become a part of
everyday life.
