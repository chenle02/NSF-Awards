This award will establish a Research Training Group in the Analysis of
Biological Diversification. The faculty group includes members of the
Departments of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology,
and Geology. The funds awarded will provide stipends for undergraduate, graduate
and post-doctoral trainees, and will defray part of the cost of trainee's
research. In addition, funds will be used to purchase specialized research
equipment to be used by trainees and to bring investigators from other research
and academic institutions to the campus for seminars. University resources will
augment the funds provided by NSF in most of these categories. Molecular,
developmental, and population biologists, as well as systematists, ecologists
and paleontologists, have developed distinctive approaches to the study of
biological diversity. Owing to the way in which students have been trained
traditionally, the connections among these approaches have not been explored in
detail. While their individual research interests are as diverse as the list
above, the faculty have formed this group with the aim of using phylogeny, which
can be viewed as the history of diversification, as an approach to the
integration of these disparate perspectives.
