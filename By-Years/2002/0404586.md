The proposal is to support travel for a combination of junior and senior
researchers to attend the 3rd International Symposium on Advances in
Computational Heat Transfer, April 19-24, 2004. The International Centre for
Heat and Mass Transfer will host the conference, which will held aboard the MS
Midnatsol cruise ship on a cruise along the Norwegian coastline. This
international conference on computational techniques applied to heat transfer
will assemble scientists and engineers working in fields related to, and
requiring, computational methods for modeling all modes of heat transfer,
including coupling with fluid flow. The requested funds will provide partial
travel support for 12 emerging researchers and 6 senior researchers. The senior
participants will deliver keynote addresses at the conference. Computational
hardware and software, and their applications to the fields of heat transfer and
fluid flow, are changing rapidly. The conference will provide technical
exchange, identification of the state-of-the-art, and the projection of future
needs and trends in numerically solving such problems. The conference should be
beneficial to the US participants and will expose them to new and exciting ideas
and concepts from the international participants. The previous conferences in
this subject have attracted the most prominent researchers from around the
world, such that the scientific impact of the discussions is extremely valuable
with interchange across many disciplines. In addition, in conjunction with his
colleagues at the conference, the PI will conduct an assessment of
cyberinfrastructure needs for the advancement of computational heat transfer and
fluid mechanics and will deliver a report to the Program Director within 60 days
of the conclusion of the conference. This award has been funded by the Thermal
Transport and Thermal Processing of the Chemical and Transport Systems
Division.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
