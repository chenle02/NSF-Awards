The Minority Research Centers of Excellence (MRCE) program was established in FY
1987 to provide substantial resources to upgrade the research capabilities of
the strongest and most productive predominantly minority institutions. This
planning grant project lays the foundation for a plan that will increase the
institution's quality of research and research-related training. Specifically,
support for this project will permit the establishment of an MRCE advisory
committee of scientists and engineers, local leaders, and industrial
representatives who will assist the institution in evaluating its current and
future potential for performing meritorious research during the next five years.
Jackson State University will develop strategies to strengthen research in
chemical physics and nuclear magnetic resonance. In addition, cooperative
program with the Lawerence Laboratories at Berkeley and Livermore will be
reassesed. Dual degree programs in chemistry and chemical engineering will be
implemented with the California Institute of Technology at Davis and Santa
Barbara. This institution has the facilities and personnel to develop a Minority
Research Center of Excellence. The Foundation has supported this project because
the proposed work can lead to the performance of meritorious research and will
increase the participation of minorities in science and engineering.
