This research project, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
Program, is concerned with the preparation, properties, and interactions of
colloidal dispersions. A combination of synthesis and physical characterization
is used to understand the properties of matter in this finely divided state,
particularly the optical, magnetic, electric, and adsorptive properties of these
materials. Nanoscale particles are synthesized using double and triple jet
precipitation methods. The physical characterization of these materials will
focus on the adhesion phenomena. The magnetic and optical properties of very
finely divided solids have many practical applications in magnetic recording
devices, fillers, and coatings. An understanding of the synthesis of these
materials, and a correlation of their properties with the controlled size and
morphology of the particles is the focus of this research project. Chemical
synthesis and physical characterization combine to develop an understanding of
these interesting and technologically important materials.
