The proposed research seeks to test the hypothesis that chemical and physical
weathering in proximal alluvial systems will show systematic and measurable
variations between glacial and nonglacial systems. To accomplish this, the
investigation will attempt to quantify the natural variation of chemical and
physical weathering in granitoid-sourced proximal alluvial sediments in end-
member glacial and nonglacial systems, when other, "non-climatic" factors (e.g.
provenance, drainage basin area and relief, sample grain size, sediment facies)
are controlled. If chemical weathering in the proposed hot-humid, hot-arid, hot
semi-arid nonglacial systems and the cool-wet, cold semi-arid, and cold-arid
glacial systems show systematic variations, then chemical indices may be used to
help differentiate paleoclimatic conditions. Continued reliance on students
provides a broader impact of this proposed research and firmly grounds this
effort in its educational mission.
