This project will continue and expand the study of the upper atmosphere,
especially auroral phenomena, using photometry and riometric techniques. The PI
has developed a new imaging riometer (relative ionospheric opacity meter) system
called IRIS (Imaging Riometer for Ionospheric Studies). The first two IRIS's
were installed at South Pole Station and Sondre Stromfjord, Greenland. A third
IRIS will be installed at Iqiluit, NWT, Canada later this year. There are also
broad-beam riometers operating at several frequencies at South Pole, McMurdo and
Iqiluit as well as auroral photometers at South Pole and McMurdo. Iqiluit is the
magnetic conjugate to South Pole. These instruments constitute a unique network
with which to study auroral effects in both magnetic hemispheres simultaneously.
The principal investigator is an internationally respected expert on the effects
of precipitating electrons on the atmosphere.
