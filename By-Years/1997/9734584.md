Varky&lt;br/&gt;9734584&lt;br/&gt;The free-living nematode, Caenorhabditis
elegans, is one of the best-characterized metazoans and it is amenable to many
of the most powerful genetic technologies available. It is, therefore, an
appropriate experimental organism for the study of many developmental processes,
including meiosis. There are a number of cytological differences between male
and female meiosis. In male meiosis, spermatocytes normally undergo two equal
divisions leading to the formation of four spermatids. In females, on the other
hand, the meiocytes undergo unequal cell division leading to the formation of an
ovum and the polar bodies. The biochemical basis for these differences is not
known. Several mutation screens have identified a large number of mutants
defective in spermatogenesis. Morphological characterization of these mutants
led to the identification of a group with defective primary spermatocytes that
failed to complete meiotic division. The mutants fall into ten different
complementation groups (early acting Spe genes). The specific aims for this
proposal are to genetically, phenotypically and molecularly characterize the
spe-25 gene, a gene which preliminary characterization suggests is one of the
earliest acting Spe genes. It has been mapped to a well-characterized region of
chromosome III that should optimize the molecular
characterization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The analysis of these genes in a model
organism will enhance our knowledge of the male specific meiotic event in a
metazoan organism. Moreover, the proposed experiments are particularly suited
for the involvement of undergraduate students in a "hands-on" laboratory
environment.&lt;br/&gt;
