When can a global topology support a local structure modeled on a classical
geometry? A "classical geometry" means the structure of a manifold invariant
under a transitive action of a Lie group. For a fixed topology, the space of
such structures is a natural object, with a rich geometry and symmetry of its
own, associated with the topology and the homogeneous space. The study of
deformation spaces of geometric structures was initiated by Charles Ehresmann in
the 1930's. It unifies what have been disparate areas of research in the 19th
century (crystallography, holomorphic differential equations and conformal
mapping, development of projective geometry and non-Euclidean geometry). The
subject became prominent through the influence of William Thurston in the
1970's. The prototype of this theory is the space of hyperbolic geometry
structures on a closed surface, which by the classical uniformization theorem,
identifies with the Teichmueller space of the surface. Our project explores
three recent developments - geometric structures on 3-manifolds, higher
Thurston-Teichmueller theory, and Anosov representations - where the rich
structure of Teichmueller space generalizes to deformation spaces of more
complicated geometries. The intimate relations of this subject with many other
fields of mathematics underscores its central role in mathematics.

This project synthesizes disparate mathematical subjects: the topology of
manifolds, various kinds of geometry, algebra and dynamics. The Moebius band is
an example of a two dimensional manifold with only one side. It describes, for
example, the collection of all straight lines in the plane. The universe we live
in is an example of a three dimensional manifold. The position and velocity of a
satellite or missile is described by a point in a six-dimensional manifold.
Different kinds of geometries distinguish special properties of manifolds. The
Moebius band is naturally described using the projective geometry inspired by
the work of Renaissance painters. Cartographers used conformal geometry to
produce more accurate maps of the world. Differential geometry enabled Einstein
to develop his theory of gravitation. Chemists use the algebra of groups to
classify crystals. The periodic table of chemical elements is intimately
connected to the group of rotations of space. Much of this mathematical
landscape remains unexplored. Using modern computers, students can contribute to
this investigation. The exploration of explicit examples and their interactions
provides problems for talented students, inviting them to the excitement of
mathematical research.
