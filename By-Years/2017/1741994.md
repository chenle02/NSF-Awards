With five years of funding from the NSF Scholarships in Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) program, the University of Scranton will
provide scholarships to 25 students who have demonstrated financial need and
academic achievement. The scholarships will support students who are pursuing
bachelor's degrees in the STEM disciplines of biology, chemistry, computing
science, mathematics, and physics/electrical engineering. Key features of this
program include common seminar courses for the scholarship students to help them
develop an identity as a member of the STEM community, outreach activities with
local schools, and an independent research experience supervised by faculty
trained in mentoring. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to
recruit, retain, and graduate 25 low-income students in STEM disciplines. The
project will provide scholarships that will offset the expected family
contributions to their education. The program will focus on developing students'
STEM self-efficacy through 1) shared seminar courses, 2) mentoring based on
research-backed multi-mentor models, 3) training in problem-solving tactics, 4)
undergraduate research experience, and 5) structured cohort-building activities
in and out of the classroom. Measures of outcomes including retention and
placement after graduation will serve as indicators of project effectiveness.
Measures of the quality of faculty and peer mentoring and the effect of multiple
mentors on student success will contribute knowledge relevant to development of
other programs aim on improving the participation of low-income students in
STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
