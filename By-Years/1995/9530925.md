9530925 Hansell The PI proposes to purchase shipboard instrumentation in support
of NSF-funded research. The instruments will be used abroad the R/V Weatherbird
II, a general purpose research ship owned and operated by the Bermuda Biological
Station for Research (BBSR), Inc., a Bermuda based United States non-profit
research and education institution. The proposal concentrates on increasing the
reliability and extent of data collection capabilities aboard the Weatherbird
II. Instrumentation includes a relative humidity sensor and precipitation gauge
for the ships IMET system; backup dissolved oxygen sensor and pump for the CTD
package, along with an altimeter for the rosette; backup thermosalinograph,
remote temperature sensor and diaphragm pump for the underway system; and a
dynamic color correction capability for the liquid scintillation counter. ***
