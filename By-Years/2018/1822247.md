This IUSE conferene project, Pedagogical Initiatives in Linear Algebra, will
develop, hold, and follow up on a conference for 55 faculty in the U.S. The two-
day workshop will include mathematicians and mathematics educators listening to
plenary talks and panel discussions by experts in the field. They will then work
together to examine current issues in Linear Algebra teaching and learning and
to develop new pathways for studying and implementing more evidence-based
teaching. The project aligns with the national effort to improve STEM Education
by introducing and refining research-based strategies for the teaching of linear
algebra, and more broadly, other proof-based mathematics courses at the
undergraduate level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project goals are: a) move forward
on producing an instructional and research guide for linear algebra (first
course and second course); (b) work toward writing research- based
recommendations for teaching and learning of linear algebra; (c) generate new
research questions; and (d) encourage collaboration between research
mathematicians and mathematics educators. The products after the conference will
be plans to develop and publish a new instructional guide for teaching linear
algebra, curricula recommendations, and a themed journal
publication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
