Funded under a Research Initiation Award, research on unsteady turbulent jets
will be carried out. The investigation will be experimental. Various
acceleration and decelaration rates of the jet flow rate will be explored to
determine the effect of various types of flow pulsations of mixing, spreading
and turbulence characteristics within the jet. Relevance of the research is to
intermittent burners, ejector type thrusters, and unsteady pollution dispersal.
