This project follows an earlier effort that studied fifteen different
manufacturing technologies in 1042 manufacturing plants. The 1993 study
developed benchmarks on technology use to help manufacturers and policy makers
make informed decisions about manufacturing technology. Its findings indicate
that the skilled use of soft and hard manufacturing technologies have a
significant effect on plant performance, measured by sales per employee and
return on investment. This new study updates the benchmarks and examines more
closely the skilled use of technology. Once again, the National Association of
Manufacturers and Auburn University are providing significant support to this
effort. The study uses questionnaires and on-site interviews and observations to
identify factors enhancing and impeding skilled use; these procedures have been
enhanced to assure higher rates of return for the questionnaires. The
information provides data to model the effect of factors such as the
effectiveness of training, training effort, technology infrastructure and the
learning capability of the plant on skilled use. Via a sub-contract, the project
will also develop alternative models, including structural and neural models to
study the collective effect of several input variables on output or performance
variables. The project is expected to result in publications, including one
through The Manufacturing Institute (NAM). The data will be archived at Auburn
University.
