9527273 Smith Alternation between explosive and non-explosive eruptive modes at
Mt. Pelee provides an excellent natural example to study the relationship
between volatiles and eruptive mechanism. Accordingly, this project will test
quantitatively the hypothesis of Smith and Roobol (1990a), which state that the
main control on eruptive style of Mt. Pelee is not magma composition but gas
content: volatile-rich magma generate explosive Plinian activity and volatile-
poor magma generates Pelean activity. This will be accomplished by measuring the
contents of pre-eruptive volatiles (H2O, CO2, Cl, F, and S) using microinfrared
spectroscopy and electron and secondary ion mass spectrometry microscopy (ion
probe) on juvenile glasses and melt inclusions in phenocrysts from both Plinian
and Pelean deposits of Mt. Pelee. Trace elements will be measured using an ion
microprobe. The evolution and degassing history of the volatiles will be
interpreted within a framework of fractional crystallization models based on
major and trace elements and open versus closed system degassing models.
