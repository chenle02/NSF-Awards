An international workshop on ?Changes of the Greenland Cryosphere? is scheduled
to take place August 25-27, 2009, in Nuuk, Greenland. The workshop will cover a
broad range of topics on the experimental and theoretical investigations of the
Greenland ice sheet, sea ice and permafrost. The workshop will contribute to an
exchange of information on changes occurring in Greenland and the surrounding
ice-covered oceans and frozen ground. It will include invited presentations by
leading scientists and engineers involved in monitoring and modeling rapid
changes in the Greenland ice sheet, sea ice and permafrost. This proposal
requests funds to partially support travel and other related expenses for the
participation of US graduate students, post-doctoral researchers and early-
career scientists in the workshop. The PI requests funds to partially support
about 15 participants. He also proposes to hold a small meeting of US
researchers involved in research of the Greenland ice sheet to discuss and plan
focused observations and modeling activities on one or two key outlet glaciers.
