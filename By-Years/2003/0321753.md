The gut ecosystem of termites is only about 1 microliter in volume, but contains
a highly-structured community consisting of several hundred, unique microbial
species. Many of these are poisoned by oxygen. Operating together within their
insect host, these microbes play well-established roles in the global cycling of
carbon and nitrogen. However, our understanding of this ecosystem is yet in its
infancy. The PI has discovered that iron is found abundant in the guts of
several lower termites examined, and that its reduction supports a heretofore
unrecognized gut niche. The research seeks to reach an understanding of the
impact that the biogeochemical cycling of iron has on the carbon and electron
flow in, community structure of, and trace and greenhouse gasses emitted from
this fascinating ecosystem. The program involves the training of undergraduate,
graduate, and postdoctoral scientists pursuing a fundamental understanding of
how small yet complex ecosystems function.
