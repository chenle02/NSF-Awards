An organic carbon analyzer and an ion chromatograph are used in the
environmental engineering technology program to supplement instruction related
to water, wastewater, solid waste, and hazardous waste treatment technology, and
assessment of water quality. Laboratory experiments combined with lectures give
students a thorough understanding of key environmental problems, the most modern
techniques for quantifying them, and the applications and limitations of these
techniques.
