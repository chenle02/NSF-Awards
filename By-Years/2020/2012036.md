Strongly gravitating systems, such as black holes, serve as natural setups to
test the validity of our current theory of gravity - Einstein's theory of
general relativity (GR). Identifying any deviations from GR will radically
enhance our fundamental knowledge about the structure of space-time, gravity and
quantum mechanics. This project aims to reveal unknown structure of GR in the
strong field regime and quantum aspects of black holes. Using both conventional
analytical methods and innovative techniques imported from high energy physics,
new insights on the physically relevant solutions will be reached. These
findings will be important to resolve the exact shadows of binary black holes,
gain insights in black hole jets purely in terms of a gravity-free quantum field
theory and restore quantum information in black holes. The outreach plan of this
project will create new opportunities for professional development for graduate
and undergraduate students and address the needs of the local elementary schools
lacking solid science programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More precisely, the
research objectives of this proposal are the following. First, construct
efficient computational methods for imaging (including movies) the exact shadows
for extremal, un-equal mass or eccentric binary black holes applying the so-
called quasi-static methods. Second, establish a new holographic duality for the
Blandford-Znajek mechanism of energy extraction from rotating black holes. Last,
provide a robust methodology to explain how the physical information falling
into a BH in GR is encrypted in its event horizon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
