Montana State University proposes to transform their main campus through a
systematic approach that operationalizes Self-Determination Theory (SDT). Guided
by their institutional context, the social science literature, and the tenets of
SDT they propose a number of activities to achieve three main goals established
to increase the participation and advancement of women in the STEM fields. Their
goals include improving research capacity; improving work-life balance; and
improving cultural attunement. To achieve these goals they propose several
unique initiatives including the development of policy to encourage
interdisciplinary research; a care-giving leave donation pool; and the use of
diversity depth hires (incentives to hire women in STEM departments with low
representation.) Their robust test of SDT has strong potential for broader
impacts both on their regional campuses and across the country.
