In response to the rapid emergence of data-driven science and research ("Big
Data"), the University of Washington (UW) NSF-funded Cyberinfrastructure (CI)
Engineer works jointly with UW science and research teams to apply scalable,
virtual constructs to passive network infrastructure. These efforts are meant to
provide meaningful constructs (data analysis results and/or visualizations) to
researchers as quickly and transparently as possible. The CI Engineer focuses on
solutions for Big Data transfers, storage, and retrieval and reducing the
complexity associated with information sharing among large collaboration teams.
Domain research projects enhanced and enabled through these activities span
astronomy, physics, and genomics at UW. UW's CI Engineer assists scientists in
using optimized UW research network configurations that includes a 40G campus
backbone, Science DMZ, and a 100G connection to global research network
infrastructures, and, as appropriate, identifies opportunities to apply
virtualized network resources, such as dynamic circuit services and cloud
storage. The UW CI Engineer actively participates in UW's several data-driven
science initiatives such as eScience Institute and the Data Science Studio, as
well as collaborates in national and international programs aimed at serving
scientific discovery.
