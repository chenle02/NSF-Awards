This project focuses on special geometric structures, known as Kahler-Einstein
metrics, which represent generalizations of solutions to Einstein's equations
for gravity, as wells as structures called instantons, which generalize
solutions to Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism. These structures play
pivotal roles in modern theoretical physics, particularly in areas like string
theory. More specifically, this project is mainly concerned with how these
structures can develop defects, known as singularities, and to what extent the
resulting object has a predictable shape, when viewed in the large. The
successful resolution of these problems will substantially enhance our
comprehension of the intricate interactions between various research directions
in mathematics. This project will also have broader impacts, as it will give
rise to numerous fascinating and interconnected questions offering ample
research and training opportunities for graduate students keen on exploring this
captivating field. The PI's research will be concentrated on several lines of
investigation. Firstly, the PI plans to investigate the structure of complete
Calabi-Yau metrics with Euclidean volume growth. The PI, along with J. Zhang,
has already achieved a satisfactory structural theory under the assumption of
quadratic curvature decay. However, the general scenario poses more significant
challenges, necessitating the development of novel technical tools. Secondly,
the PI is interested in understanding the collapsing phenomenon in canonical
metrics. In this regard, previous collaborative work with R. Zhang has made
substantial progress, specifically in the context of 4-dimensional hyperk√§hler
metrics. Extending these findings to other settings holds paramount importance
for their applications in geometry. Lastly, the PI will delve into related
questions concerning Hermitian-Yang-Mills instantons. While parallel questions
can be raised, answering them will require the incorporation of intriguing new
techniques.
