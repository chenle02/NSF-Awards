During each of the summers 2005-2007, eight undergraduate students will
participate in an eight-week research program in the Department of Theoretical
and Applied Mathematics. The primary focus of the REU project is mathematical
training, active participation in research, and mentoring. The students will
work on research projects that are within their grasp, and which present real
opportunities for new discoveries that will be of value to the mathematical
community. The projects will emphasize applications of algebra, number theory
and linear algebra. The program is designed to involve participants in
meaningful and significant ways in the current research of the directors, while
providing maximum opportunity for independent development. The students will
gain experience in communicating mathematics by presenting talks to each other
and to a wider scientific community. It is expected that some, but not all, of
the research will lead to published papers.
