This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in geological
sciences among Paul R. Silver, Carnegie Institution of Washington, and David
Mainprice and Alain Vauchez of the Technophysics Laboratory at the University of
Montpellier in France. The investigators will make measurement of shear-wave
splitting on teleseismic shear waves, and use them to study the past and present
deformation of continents during tectonic events, such as orogenies and rifting
episodes. The main objective of the proposed research is to take measurements on
upper mantle deformation. In particular, the investigators will study the
relationship between mantle deformation and crust in various orogenic settings.
Measurements and observations will use data from stations in the Appalachian
Mountains, the Basin and Range Province (western United States) and the
Pyrenees. The proposed research requires knowledge in three distinct disciplines
represented by the participants. The U.S. investigator brings expertise in
seismology. This is complemented by French expertise in petrophysics and
structural geology. Results from the research will advance our understanding of
the evolution of continents and plate movement and tectonics.
