A computer graphics system will be acquired for macromolecular structure-
function analysis. The instrument will be used to support a variety of research
projects in biochemistry and molecular biology. Among the projects to be
supported are: 1) the structure of a flavoprotein dehydrogenase; 2) enzymes
involved in carbon dioxide metabolism, notably ribulose bisphosphate
carboxylase/oxygenase; 3) hemoprotein model com- pounds for hemoglobin and
cytochromes; 4) drug-nucleic acid interaction; 5) metallothionein; 6)
fibronectin; 7) NADPH- cytochrome C P-450 reductase; 8) acetyl-CoA synthesis;
and 9) mechanism of aconitase. The research projects employ a variety of
physical, chemical and biochemical methods for providing structural and
functional information of the macromolecules being studied, with the emphasis
being placed on the interpretation of X-ray diffraction data and NMR data. A
fully interactive, high resolution computer graphics system is an indispensable
adjunct to three dimensional structure analysis of biological macromolecules.
This system will be used for working on the detailed atomic structure of
crystallized proteins (by fitting models to electron density maps), for
providing detailed analysis of the mode of binding of ligands or substrates to
proteins and enzymes, for performing protein structure comparisons, for modeling
protein-ligand and enzyme-substrate interactions, and for visualizing
macromolecular structural details in an accurate and informative manner. The
results of the molecular representations allow a more detailed understanding of
macromolecular structure to emerge and contribute to our fundamental
understanding of the functional role of proteins and to current efforts in
biotechnology.
