This project, funded by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry
Program, focusses on several aspects of the chemistry of complexes that contain
the ruthenium- pentamethylcyclopentadienylnitrosyl moiety. Specific objectives
include 1) the investigation of carbon-carbon bond formation in alkyl-
chloromethyl complexes, 2) generation of alkyl complex cations (by protonation
of dialkyl precursors) and the study of their reactions with nucleophiles such
as water, amines, alkynes, olefins and CO, 3) generation of the
rutheniumpentamethylcyclopentadienylnitrosyl dication and examination of its
reactions with nucleophiles. The information obtained from these studies are
expected to provide insight into C-C and C-E (E = N, O) bond formation, alpha
and beta migratory insertion and elimination processes, oxidative
addition/reductive elimination of C-H bonds, and catalytic oxidation of
alcohols. %%% This project involves the study of the fundamental reactivity
properties of a class of organoruthenium compounds. The results of this work are
expected to impact several types of catalytic reactions of significant
technological importance.
