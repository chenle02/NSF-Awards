9310642 Rinaldi This research deals with studies on the application of novel,
recently developed nuclear magnetic resonance techniques to polymer structure
characterization problems. Simple problems concerning polymer modification
chemistry and copolymerization chemistry will be explored initially to allow the
nuclear magnetic resonance techniques to be perfected and to provide experience
in their application. Later, more complex problems will be investigated. The
studies will be conducted by Professor Peter Rinaldi whose specialty is nuclear
magnetic resonance spectroscopy and Professor H. James Harwood jointly whose
specialty is in synthesizing polymers and applying chemical and physical
techniques to problems of polymer microstructure characterization. New nuclear
magnetic resonance techniques developed in Professor Rinaldl's laboratory will
permit selective observation of structurally important polymer fragments, and
will permit extraction of long-range structural information not previously
obtainable by other means. These techniques are ideally suited for polymer
characterization studies that require the detection of labeled nuclei that are
present in low concentration in these polymers. It is expected that these
studies will bring forth new information on detailed polymer structure as a
function of polymerization method. ***
