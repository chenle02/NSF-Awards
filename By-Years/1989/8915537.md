This experimental research is focused on turbulence in stratified fluids. Two
flow configurations will be investigated: a horizontal round turbulent jet and a
vertical buoyant plume. Both will be propagated into a linearly stratified
ambient background, with stable density stratification. The fluid, though
containing density gradients, is made up from a mixture of two components in
such a way that the index of refraction is almost uniform, thus permitting
Laser-Doppler-Anemometry. The dynamics of turbulence, and its collapse, will be
studied. Results have application to mixing and dispersion in stably stratified
fluids: lakes, reservoirs, and the atmosphere under inversion conditions.
