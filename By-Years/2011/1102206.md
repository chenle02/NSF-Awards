Project Summary: The program focuses on developing a new class of high-
resolution, high-speed, low-power-consumption, full-color electronic paper
displays (E-PADs) using molecular motors as active components. The specific
molecular motors to be used are redgreen-blue (RGB) tri-station catenanes. The
proposed research will (1) investigate the electrochromic properties of RGB
catenanes in polymeric matrix, and (2) construct a prototype color-switchable
E-PAD based on RGB catenanes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:
Artificial molecular motors and machines such as RGB catenanes represent a
promising and challenging field of interdisciplinary research. If successful,
this research could lead to a new technology for energy efficient, high speed
and full color display technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: In
addition to its technical contributions, this NSF project will impact society by
implementing vigorous education and outreach programs that are closely
integrated with the proposed research and designed for groups at all levels.
Underrepresented students will participate extensively in the proposed research.
