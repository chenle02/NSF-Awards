Three distinct, yet connected areas of non-linear interactions in plasma
physics are studied experimentally: Langmuir turbulence in unmagnetized plasmas,
non-linear waves and instabilities in non-neutral plasmas, and non-linear
whistler wave-particle interactions. The validity and limitations of weak
turbulence theory and the transition from weak to strong Langmuir turbulence
will be investigated. Nonlinear wave particle interactions in the magnetosphere
will be simulated and anisotropic whistler instabilities will be studied. Non-
neutral plasmas will be investigated in a regime where non-linear interactions,
such as ponderomotive force effects, can be explored. The research will lead to
improved understanding of fundamental processes in non-linear plasma
environments.
