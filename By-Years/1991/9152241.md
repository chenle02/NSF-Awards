This project models a computer-integrated manufacturing system around a typical
business environment. The laboratory integrates a plurality of disciplines from
secretarial science, business administration, electronics, mechanical design,
and manufacturing. The laboratory provides an environment where all areas of
technology are able to experience the actual problems involved in bringing a new
product into successful manufacturing. The equipment provides the manufacturing
terminus to the system. Secretarial science students perform document design,
order entry, and customer interface. Electronics students are involved in
design, installation, and maintenance of the network subsystem. Mechanical
design students design both the basic product and the individual unique parts of
each order. Manufacturing students perform the actual mechanical manufacturing,
and business students perform the project administration and financial control.
