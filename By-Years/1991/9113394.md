This project will convene a joint US-Italy workshop among architects, design
engineers, and policy researchers/planners with direct experience in seismic
rehabilitation and construction to discuss the architectural aspects of seismic
retrofit and reconstruction. The focus of this workshop is the relationship
between architectural design and seismic strengthening: the unique design
problems created, the architectural concerns generated by conflicting
requirements, and issues raised in construction, and the impact these changes in
the built environment have on occupants and on the surrounding community. While
past efforts have been focused specifically on damage assessment and
strengthening design, this workshop looks at the architectural implications of
seismic strengthening and its effect on completed buildings, as well as the
context for design policy changes. Among the American and the Italian
participants, the architects and engineers will address the question of how
retrofit is accomplished, while the planners and policy researchers will ask if
retrofit can be accomplished socially and politically.
