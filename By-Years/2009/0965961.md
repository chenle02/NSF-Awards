Jackson State University (JSU), a Historically Black College and University,
serves academically talented but often economically disadvantaged students. The
Computer Science Department has historically been a leading producer of African
Americans with the BS degree in Computer Science. While the demand for such
professionals is on the increase, current national enrollment in the discipline
does not meet the demand.&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the Students Promoting Interest
in Computing supported by Educational&lt;br/&gt;Scholarships (SPICES) are
to:&lt;br/&gt;1. Provide the economic means for more highly qualified,
economically disadvantaged, students to enroll in and complete the Computer
Science BS degree program;&lt;br/&gt;2. Provide opportunities for SPICES
Scholars to receive professional mentoring through a faculty to scholar
mentoring program and a peer to peer mentoring program,&lt;br/&gt;3. Provide
enrichment activities including research and internship opportunities to enhance
scholar's professional skills; and&lt;br/&gt;4. Provide enhanced communication
and leadership opportunities for Scholars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project
awards 12 four-year scholarships to entering freshman and 2 two-year
scholarships to transfer students. Traditional and social media activities are
used to promote SPICES. A peer mentoring model has been adopted and modified to
fit the unique needs of the SPICES program. This project addresses the need for
more members of an underrepresented group to become highly trained graduates in
computer science.
