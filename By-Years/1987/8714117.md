This proposal requests instrumentation for a protein and nucleic acid chemistry
facility at Yale University. The facility serves l38 investigators at Yale, the
NIH, and 30 outside institutions. Thus, it serves as a regional resource center
that meets the needs of a diverse group of investigators whose problems require
either peptide separation, amino acid sequencing or analysis, or peptide
synthesis. The facility is a clearing house for protein chemistry techniques and
methodologies.
