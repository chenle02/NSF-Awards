A MRG will be established which focusses on toughening of glassy polymers by
second phase rigid polymer particles, a topic of great importance to new
engineering plastics and composites. It is fundamental in approach, attempting
to elucidate toughening mechanisms. It combines expertise from the field of
ceramics, where transformation toughening mechanisms are well established, with
expertise in polymers, where these same mechanisms need to be tested and
applied. The interdisciplinary research program will attempt to lay the
foundation for new high performance plastics and matrix materials for advanced
composites.
