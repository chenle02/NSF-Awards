The red algae (Rhodophyta) are richly represented in marine environments from
the tropics to the polar regions. They are readily distinguished by their color,
the result of a unique combination of photosynthetic pigments, and by the
universal absence of flagellated cells, an apparently ancestral condition. Most
species are capable of sexual reproduction. The life cycle typically involves
three generations or phases: a haploid sexual phase, a diploid phase that grows
in a semi-parasitic fashion directly on the female plant, and a free-living
diploid phase. It has been suggested that the triphasic life cycle and complex
patterns of sexual reproduction and spore development that characterize nearly
every family of red algae evolved as compensation for an inefficient
fertilization mechanism in the absence of motile sperm. Some of the most
elaborate reproductive structures are found in the Gigartinales, a large order
currently containing about 40 families. The Gigartinales, like most red algae,
are composed entirely of branched filaments in which the cells are linked by
special structures called pit connections. These cellular connections can be
specially stained and observed by light microscopy, and the stages of vegetative
and reproductive growth thus followed cell by cell, event by event. Dr. Max
Hommersand of the University of North Carolina is making comparative studies of
growth and reproductive development in several problematic groups of
Gigartinales, to determine consistent patterns that reflect taxonomic
relationships. The morphological evidence obtained will be used to test
hypotheses about the multiple origins of auxiliary cells and connecting
filaments in relation to other taxonomic characters. Results obtained in this
study will be used in revising the classification of these red algae and to
determine evolutionary lineages among them.
