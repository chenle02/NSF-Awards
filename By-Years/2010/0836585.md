This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) in Engineering program
entitled "NUE: NanoCORE (Nanotechnology Concepts, Opportunities, Research and
Education)at the Florida A&amp;M University (FAMU)-Florida State University
(FSU) College of Engineering", under the direction of Dr. Ongi Englander, is
designed to introduce aspects of nanoscale science and engineering into the core
undergraduate curriculum beginning in the freshman year. The NanoCORE program
will infuse and integrate nanoscale science and engineering (NSE) as a permanent
component of the undergraduate curriculum, present multiple opportunities for
undergraduate learning of concepts in NSE and create opportunities for
undergraduates to pursue nanotechnology related research activities.
