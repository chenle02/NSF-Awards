9712079 Pirmez This grant will support participation in a research cruise to the
Magdelena and Orinoco fans on the Spanish ship Hesperides. The PI will
synthesize morphologic data on the channel systems to determine the effect of
tectonics and turbidity currents upon the Magdelena Fan. A secondary goal is to
determine whether channels on the Orinoco Fan are braided and if so what process
might control this.
