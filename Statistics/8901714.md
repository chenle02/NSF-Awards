Freedman will work on questions about the foundations of statistics: how to
characterize prior beliefs, and when do such beliefs lead to good statistical
procedures; how to look at high dimensional data; what happens to standard
statistical procedures under nonstandard conditions; how to test statistical
models. These questions include the following topics: partial exchangeability
and sufficiency; the consistency of Bayes estimates; asymptotic normality of
posterior distributions; the bootstrap technique for estimating standard errors;
the application of regression models to social science data.
