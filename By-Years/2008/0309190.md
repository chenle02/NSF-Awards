These PIs propose to evaluate Ecological Network Analysis (ENA), a modeling
technique used to characterize trophic structure and to trace energy flow in
ecosystems. The graduate student's research plan combines field and modeling
activities to: (1) determine the sensitivity of ENA to detect changes in trophic
relationships; (2) quantify the effects of uncertainty of input on model
predictions; and (3) validate ENA using independent techniques. This award will
facilitate and enhance the validation effort by providing support to analyze
stable isotopes of carbon (13C) and sulfur (34S) to complement nitrogen isotope
(15N) data that will be forthcoming from existing support. The combined use of
N, C and S isotopes will allow for improved estimates of carbon sources used by
different organisms and testing ("validation") of alternative ENA algorithms.
The PIs hope to improve overall understanding of the utility of ENA for
scientific and environmental management communities.
