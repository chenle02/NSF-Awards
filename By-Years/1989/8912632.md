Although work by avocational archaeologists has shown that the state of
Missouri is rich in prehistoric rock paintings and engravings, no comprehensive
and systematic research has been done on this rich data source. Under the
direction of Dr. David Browman, Ms. Carol Diaz-Granados will examine these
materials as part of her doctoral dissertation research. She has contacted three
individuals and been given copies of their notes and records. In addition, she
has begun to collect information on other previously unreported sites through a
questionnaire mailing to the 600 members of the Missouri Archaeological Society
and has contacted professionals in adjoining regions. A field survey will follow
up all replies, and the location of materials will be verified. The data will
then be recorded and the paintings and engravings photographed in a standardized
way. In a following analysis, groupings will be discerned and each will then be
analyzed for individual elements, motifs, theme content, and structure.
Locational analyses will include related environmental variables. The result
should provide insight into the function of rock graphics as a means of
information transmittal. While archaeologists agree that in principle rock art
provides a valuable source of data for reconstructing prehistoric societies, in
practice little emphasis has, in North America at least, been placed on this.
Data, if published, are usually scattered and hard to synthesize. Different
recording methods are used. Also, no widely acceptable techniques exist for the
analysis of data. Ms. Diaz-Granados project should help to remedy this situation
and, hopefully, provide an exemplar and stimulus for this field. This research
is important for several reasons. First, it will assemble a large data base
which will be of interest to many archaeologists. Secondly, it will increase our
understanding of North America's past. Finally, it will assist in the training
of an extremely promising young scientist.
