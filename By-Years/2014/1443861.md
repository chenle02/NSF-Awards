The goal of this research is increase the consumer's quality of service in
environments where more and more services are competing for use of the radio
spectrum. It is widely believed that future regulation of the spectrum will
change from the current static environment, where opening new channels for
communications takes years, to highly dynamic environment where smart radios
will jump from frequency channel to frequency channel. In this dynamic
environment, the consumer will share the spectrum with many different types of
devices, including radars, other phones, Wi-Fi servers and a host of new smart
devices.

The new smart devices will constantly change their frequencies, data rates and
modulation schemes, thereby creating a dynamic, more uncertain, environment. The
scientists will explore how uncertainty influences the characterization of radio
spectrum usage. The focus is on the sensing and decision-making aspects of the
problem rather than management issues. The scientists will apply their
experience with Artificial Intelligence and transfer techniques of dynamic
problem solving from other domains. The proposed study has the potential to
develop decision support models that will inform new policies for spectrum
management in the future.

This research project's primary aim is to advance the knowledge and
understanding of wireless communication scenarios to enrich the spectrum
decision process in cognitive radio by evaluating the impact of uncertainty on
the different cognitive cycle changes of adaptive radios. To achieve this goal,
they propose to identify, classify, and characterize the random and
deterministic variables present in a typical wireless scenario and model their
causal relations, using probabilistic graphical models, such as Bayesian
networks and influence diagrams.
