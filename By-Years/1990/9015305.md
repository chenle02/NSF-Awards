A training and research plan is described for the continued development and
application of an already existing two- dimensional radiation
magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) code to problems in astrophysics. Applications will
be performed for three important problems: accretion disk dynamics, molecular
cloud collapse during star formation, and the dynamics of the solar corona.
Planned improvements to the treatment of the microphysics in the code is
expected to produce more realistic results. Utilizing the already implemented
algorithm for solving the radiation transfer equation in two-dimensions, self-
consistent radiation intensity maps will be computed during the course of these
simulations for direct comparison with observations, forming the basis of an
interactive "numerical observatory". The code will be implemented on a variety
of machines at the NCSA to benchmark the performance of different architectures
on the algorithms for MHD and radiation transfer. IN particular, the code will
be implemented on the massively parallel Connection Machine.
