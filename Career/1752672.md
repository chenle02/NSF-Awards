The project supported under this CAREER award will use the mathematics of
networks to understand how living cells maintain a healthy balance of nutrients,
like iron. In healthy cells, many chemical reactions take place all the time.
Scientists think of these reactions as forming a network, like a wiring diagram,
with connecting wires describing the movement of nutrients and metabolites
through a cell's chemical reactions. Knowing the entire wiring diagram is not
necessary for understanding the fate of individual nutrients, but the many
interconnected circuits make it difficult to isolate only the part of the
diagram important for certain activities, such as maintaining iron levels. This
research will use mathematical techniques (specifically, algebraic geometry and
dynamical systems) to find the simplest components in a reaction network that
allow a cell to exhibit observed behaviors. Results will be tested using
laboratory observations of how yeast cells manage and transport iron.
Complementing the research projects will be educational activities centered
around a Directed Reading Program in which undergraduate students will gain
experience reading and presenting mathematics with the help of graduate-student
mentors.

The dynamics observed in living systems is much more than the sum of its parts.
Systems biology, therefore, seeks to understand how biological components come
together to generate emergent, systems-level behavior. A current bottleneck in
systems biology is the lack of mathematical theory relating system structure to
emergent behavior. Accordingly, this project will develop a theory of reaction
systems tailored to biological networks. The investigator will build on her
recent work that has helped clarify how bistability and other phenomena emerge
in real-life systems. The aims here are to discover new criteria for
multistationarity in reaction systems, and to answer the question of when Hopf
bifurcations are preserved when new components are added to a network. These
results will be used to answer important biological questions pertaining to how
cells process information and how iron levels are maintained within cells.
Specifically, the aims are to investigate the capacity for bistability and
oscillations in phosphorylation networks, and to determine which components of
iron-trafficking networks keep cellular-iron levels tightly regulated. Overall,
the research will generate results well-suited to analyzing a large class of
networks arising in living systems.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
