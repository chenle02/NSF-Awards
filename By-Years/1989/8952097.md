Prospective elementary and middle school teachers are using a computer lab
consisting of networked Apple IIg's to work with special software that can be
used in elementary and middle school mathematics instruction. The students are
learning BASIC and LOGO and are learning how these languages can be used in
instruction in the schools. The university will match the award with an equal
amount of funds.
