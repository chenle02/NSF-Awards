This project will sponsor a mentoring program for women and minority
researchers in statistics to help launch them in their research careers. During
each summer, when the Department of Statistics at Stanford hosts 20 to 40
visitors, many from abroad, three statistical researchers from underrepresented
groups will work with mentors to develop their own research. The mentoring
responsibilities of the faculty toward these summer post-doctoral fellows will
include collaborative work, advice on research avenues and on publication, and
introduction to the active research community in the particular subspecialty.
Continuity in the mentoring relationship is expected between the two summers of
the post-doctoral fellows residency as well.
