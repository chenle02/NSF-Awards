Measurement of threshold charged pion production will be carried out for proton-
proton scattering, including spin degrees of freedom, in order to explore model
dependencies of the fundamental reaction mechanisms. This work will be done at
the internal target facility of the Indiana University Cyclotron Facility. In
addition, work on the important inner tracking chamber of the CEBAF large
acceptance detector will be carried out. The latter is in support of an approved
experiment at CEBAF for which this Pitt group is the lead group. In this
activity, the quark sub-structure of nucleon resonances will be probed through
their momentum transfer dependence.
