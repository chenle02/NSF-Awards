9357474 Hershfield This is a NSF Young Investigator Award in which novel
perturbative techniques will be used to compute the nonlinear current-voltage
characteristic for tunneling through a single strongly interacting atom or
defect. This type of system can be realized in atomic asperity junctions, small
area lithographically patterned tunnel junctions, point contacts and quantum
dots. %%% ***
