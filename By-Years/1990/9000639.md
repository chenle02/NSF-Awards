An interinstitutional REU site is established. The program will provide ten
selected undergraduates research opportunities in the mechanical engineering and
engineering science department encompassing the mechanical, materials and
bioengineering subject areas. The specific research topics selected for the
program are of fundamental, as well as, current engineering interest including
several to be conducted with external support and collaborations. A five-member
faculty team from the host institution will supervise the project activities.
Research projects are thermal compatibility for metal- ceramic systems,
properties of liquid metal-liquid insulator interfaces, control-structure
interaction of large flexible spacecraft, and diffraction studies of defect
substructures in bulk single crystals. Participants will be recruited from both
inside and outside the host institution with special attention given to
attracting qualified minority, handicapped and female students. The
interinstitutional cooperative arrangement is intended to facilitate the
recruiting effort, allow several participants to work in on-going joint projects
to gain research experience and generally enhance the impact of the REU program
by spreading its benefits beyond host site. Productive participation of the
students in the project activities will be assured through a concentrated ten-
week summer involvement, pairing of internal and external students on individual
projects and carefully planned orientation and post participation activities.
The program will terminate with written reports and oral presentations of the
project results by the participants.
