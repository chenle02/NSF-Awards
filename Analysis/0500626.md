Abstract:

The principal Investigator proposes in this project to work on a number of
problems in the area of several complex variables and Cauchy-Riemann Analysis.
These problems are not just important from the point of view of complex
analysis, but also from the perspective of non-linear analysis, partial
differential equations, complex singularity theory and mechanical engineering.
More specifically, the PI wishes to further the present understanding of various
rigidity phenomena in complex analysis and complex singularity theory. The PI
would like to continue his previous investigation on the holomorphic invariant
theory for real submanifolds embedded in the complex Euclidean spaces. The
investigation of the intrinsic connections of the holomorphic theory of real
submanifolds in a complex manifold with many well-known problems in classical
mechanics, non-linear partial differential equations and classical dynamics will
also be pursued. The PI intends to carry out the simultaneous embedding problem
for a CR family of embeddable compact strongly pseudoconvex three-dimensional CR
manifolds. Various geometric and analytic properties for Cauchy-Riemann mappings
will be studied, too. Complex numbers and the theory for functions with complex
variables have become, since the 19th century, indispensable tools in many areas
of mathematics and in its application to other areas of science and engineering.
Indeed, the solutions of many problems in the applied sciences could ultimately
depend on improvements in these complex analytic tools and a better
understanding of their basic properties. For instance, in material science, the
standard method for treating multi-directional stresses in a uniform way is to
represent them as complex numbers or, in more complicated situations, as complex
functions. It then turns out, for instance, that the direction of the
propagation of cracks in materials is related to the properties of certain
equations associated with these complex numbers or functions. Results of the
research to be carried out in this project may lead to the discovery of new
properties of solutions of these equations, which would then translate to a
deeper understanding of the related mechanical properties of materials.
