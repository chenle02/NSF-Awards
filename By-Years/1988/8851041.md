PROJECT CREATE is a cooperative project of the Northmont, Ohio, City School
District and scientists and engineers from local industry and governmental
laboratories. It will develop materials and facilities for teaching science in
the elementary grades and work with the district's teachers to enable them to
effectively utilize these with their classes. Once developed and proven in use,
the teaching materials will be disseminated through state and national
educational organizations. The district, with strong industrial support and
participation, will develop and equip a "micro-tech satellite" -- a room with
science equipment and exhibits -- in one of its schools which can be used by all
the district's elementary teachers. It will be used for in-service activities
for teachers and by the district personnel and industrial/governmental
scientists/engineers who will be developing hands-on science and mathematics
curriculum materials to fit the following sequence: Grades K-1, plants; 1-2,
animals; 3, environment; 4- 5, earth science; 5-6, physical science. The use of
the partnership concept is intended to insure that both the science and the
pedagogy will be sound, up-to-date, and well integrated. Cost sharing by the
partners will total at least 50% of the NSF funding.
