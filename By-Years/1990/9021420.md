The proposed four-month planning grant will create an interinstitutional
consortium known as the Southwest Minority Alliance. The Alliance will develop a
five-year plan to implement a series of recommendations from recent national
reports focusing on minority participation in science and engineering at the
undergraduate and graduate levels. Five components will initially serve as
cornerstones of the Alliance: 1.) Formation of institutional consortium to pool
counseling and transitional support resources from high school to undergraduate
school to graduate school; 2.) Development of clear articulation agreements to
offer binding transfer from one participating institution to another; 3.)
Operation of residential summer science and academies for students beginning at
the seventh-grade level to enrich science knowledge and experience; 4.)
Establishment of a freshman-year, college-based program to increase student
participation and opportunities for success in undergraduate programs in science
and engineering; 5.) Involvement of the private sector in educational
enhancement activities such as tutoring, mentoring, and advising minority
students. During the four-month planning period the Southwest Minority Alliance
will create and mobilized the infrastructure necessary to carry each of these
components forward during the implementation phase. The Alliance members will
devise innovative means to increase the retention and baccalaureate acquisition
rates of minority students interested in science and engineering careers.
