This project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, is
directed towards the development of enzyme immunoassay type sensors for the
selective quantification of biomacromolecules. During the tenure of this three-
year standard grant, Professor Meyerhoff and his students at the University of
Michigan will investigate the fundamentals of operation of thioctic acid self-
assembled monolayer bound enzyme-antibody electrodes capable of assaying protein
antigens in untreated whole blood. Novel sensors are introduced having the
capability of assaying human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and prostate specific
antigen (PSA) at the part-per-trillion level in undiluted whole blood. Future
efforts will be geared towards the miniaturization of sensor devices which are
capable of automated, multi-component analyses of protein analyte over a wide
dynamic concentration range. In addition, Professor Meyerhoff is also continuing
his efforts in developing enzyme- linked binding assays (ELBAs) whereby the
complexation and binding sites of charged biological macromolecules that
interact specifically with glycosaminoglycans can be characterized. The latter
techniques are used in the assessment of carbohydrate structure and content of
intact glycoproteins. Few analytical probes can rival the sensitivity and
selectivity for biological macromolecules as exhibited by enzyme-antibody type
sensors. These devices are capable of sub-part-per-trillion detection of protein
analyte present in complex matrices such as whole blood and waste water.
Professor Meyerhoff and his students at the University of Michigan are advancing
new generations of these devices which are capable of assaying mixtures of
protein analytes over wide concentration ranges with minimal sample
pretreatment. This analytical technology will be broadly applicable to
biotechnology, clinical chemistry, and pharmaceutical research and manufacture.
