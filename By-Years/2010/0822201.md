PI: Pankaj Jaiswal (Oregon State University)&lt;br/&gt;CoPIs: Maria Gandolfo-
Nixon (Cornell University), Dennis Stevenson (New York Botanical
Garden)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plant Ontology (PO) is a uniquely effective tool to
bridge the knowledge developed by genetics, molecular biology, cell biology,
taxonomy, botany, and the genomics research communities. During the course of
this project, a common set of controlled vocabulary terms describing anatomical
structures and developmental stages of the flowering and non-flowering plants
will be developed. This will produce resolution to the divergences between the
numerous terminologies used by different genomics projects and the nomenclatures
used for various plant parts as described classically by plant taxonomists and
anatomists as well as across other botanical subdisciplines. The standardization
of definitions and naming of the vocabulary terms in the PO that describe either
a plant structure or developmental stage provides a framework for fostering
consistency in describing gene expression profiles and observed phenotypic
traits. The consistent use of PO in descriptions, allows plant biologists and
breeders to make meaningful cross-database and cross-species queries to discover
patterns of similarities and dissimilarities, and discover the nature of
evolutionary innovations. Also, it will allow the examination of the functions
of genes and the genetic interactions associated with plant developmental
processes and their contribution to agronomic and commercially significant
phenotypic traits, such as improved disease resistance and biomass yield.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project website is http://www.plantontology.org. All
the contents and results of the project will be released to the public from this
website resource. The project outreach program will organize teachers' training
workshops and exhibits for students and general public. The focus of these
workshops/exhibits will be Plant Biology awareness.
