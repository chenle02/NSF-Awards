9418803 Herbst This project is concerned with the chemistry that occurs in
interstellar clouds and other cool astronomical objects. Most of the molecules
are organic in nature although the most abundant molecule is simple molecular
hydrogen. In addition to the gas phase molecules, astronomers are also able to
detect condensed phase molecules that are located on mantles surrounding the
cores of dust particles. Dr. Herbst will employ new and improved chemical models
for a variety of astronomical regions ranging from interstellar clouds to
circumstellar envelopes to planetary nebulae. The development of molecular
complexity is one of several problems that will be investigated because of the
presence of relatively large carbonaceous molecules.
