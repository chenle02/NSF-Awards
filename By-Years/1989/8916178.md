This project will investigate, develop, and demonstrate techniques for
interfacing users to multiple databases drawn, initially, from a set of medical
information databases offered by or accessible to the National Library of
Medicine (NLM). Consideration also will be given to the use of high definition,
computer programmable, display technology to assist in iconic rendering, dispay
tailoring, and presentation of image data. The user workstations employed will
contain or have access to detailed knowlege of the content of each database and
access methods needed to obtain information from them. The project will exploit
access to the medical databases in unformatted ("native") mode, allowing for
greater flexibility in the re-use of retrieved information. The project plans to
make use of the NLM Medical Subject Heading and Universal Medical Langauge
research to aid in keyword access to database contents.***
