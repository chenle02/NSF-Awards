Lennarz MCB-9422460 The XIIIth International Conference on Glycoconjugates will
be held in Seattle, Washington, August 20-26, 1995. The Symposium which is
sponsored by the International Glycoconjugate Organization is the major
international meeting of scientists in glycoconjugate research. In order for
junior scientists to attend and to present their data and to have further
excvhange on the international level it is necessary to obtain travel funds for
them. Therefore the Society for Glycobiology is requesting travel funds for
junior scientiqts. The mechanism of selecting awardees will be on a competitive
scientific basis. %%% In the past few years much research has provided evidence
that the carbohydrate chains on proteins play an important function in the
diverse properties of those proteins. This conference will report on studies
carried out at many sites around the world on the basic processes whereby these
carbohydrate chains are assembled and how they function. *** ; Oh +' 0 $ H l S u
