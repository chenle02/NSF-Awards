New techniques and new applications continue to expand the field of microwave
engineering. At the same time, the number of engineering students trained in
this important field continues to be inadequate. The design and testing of
microwave circuits is now based on CAD packages and sophisticated test equipment
that was not available a few years ago. Undergraduate students presently receive
a strong theoretical background in microwaves including CAD experience, but
modern microwave test equipment is lacking. The test equipment is needed to
introduce a series of microwave-circuit design projects in two existing senior
laboratory courses. Two state-of-the-art network analyzer systems together with
some additional software are being acquired. With these new resources, senior
electrical engineering majors will carry out complete projects, encompassing all
phases of design, construction, and testing. The projects, while having
practical significance, will also stress the underlying basic electromagnetic
theory.
