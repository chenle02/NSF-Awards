The series of international conferences on Port and Ocean Engineering Arctic
Conditions have been held biennially since 1971, and have provided an
outstanding forum for presentation of new research findings on ice, sea ice,
seafloor processes, coastal and offshore structures, icebreaker technology,
Arctic oceanography and meteorology, and operations in cold weather conditions.
The Ninth International Conference on Port and Ocean Engineering Under Arctic
Conditions, POAC-87 will be held at the University of Alaska-Fairbanks, on
August 16-21, 1987. Over 160 papers will be presented, and the papers together
with conference discussions will be published in a multi-volume hardbound
archival Proceedings. This grant provides partial support for the publication of
the conference proceedings.
