Assembly of an actomyosin contractile ring that constricts the cell around the
spindle equator is essential for cell cleavage. The molecular basis underlying
the organization and constriction of the contractile ring is well documented,
yet the mechanics of how actin filaments redistribute and assemble into the ring
remains largely unknown. Accumulating evidence suggests that spindle
microtubules may mediate equatorial distribution of actin filaments. However, it
is unclear how microtubules interact with actin filaments in living cells. The
long-term goal is to understand the mechanics of the contractile ring assembly
by focusing on the interaction of microtubules with actin filaments and the
incorporation of filaments into the ring. The hypothesis is that radiating
spindle microtubules mediate transport of actin filaments and that pre-
accumulated myosin II motors drive the incorporation of actin filaments into the
contractile ring. The specific aims of this project are to mechanically create
an optically clear environment in living cells and dissect the mechanism of
microtubule-mediated transport of actin filaments and the mechanism of actin
filament incorporation into the contractile ring. These aims will be
accomplished by using a newly-developed approach that employs multimode micro-
techniques to surgically remodel spindles and cells so as to mechanically
dissect microtubule-mediated assembly of the contractile ring. This unique
approach combines classic micromanipulation and microinjection with modern laser
microbeam surgery using digital-enhanced polarization/fluorescence microscopy
and spinning disc confocal microscopy. Thus, the approach permits direct
micromanipulations of both non-labeled and fluorescently-labeled cytoskeleton in
living cells and in vitro. This project will provide research training for
undergraduate and graduate students.
