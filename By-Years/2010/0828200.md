PROPOSAL NUMBER: 0828200&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION: Duke University&lt;br/&gt;NSF
PROGRAM: PHY ? ELEMENTARY PARTICLE ACCEL USER&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR:
Goshaw, Alfred T.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: Travel Grants for Graduate
Students to American Physical Society&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a proposal
for the support of the travel of students to the APS meeting being held on April
12-15, 2008 in St. Louis, Missouri. At the April 2008 APS meeting, students will
be able to sample physics represented by the divisions of Astrophysics, Nuclear
Physics, Particles and Fields, Physics of Beams, Plasma Physics, Computational
Physics. In addition they will be able to partake in the activities in the
Forums on Education, Physics and Society, International Affairs, the History of
Physics and Graduate Student Affairs, as well as those of numerous topical
groups. A Committee appointed by the APS Division of Particle and Fields Chair,
Natalie Roe, will make the selection of the students receiving travel support.
The DPF Secretary-Treasurer Alfred Goshaw will administer the grant through Duke
University. It will provide support to students that would otherwise be unable
to attend and participate in the stimulating atmosphere of an American Physical
Society meeting.&lt;br/&gt;
