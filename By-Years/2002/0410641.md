Intellectual merit: This project is adapting Kenneth Bogart's NSF-funded project
Teaching Introductory Combinatorics by Guided Group Discovery for a required
discrete mathematics class at Oregon State University. The current notes and
method are being adapted for larger class size, for more heterogeneous student
mathematical backgrounds and motivations, and for some differences in course
material. There are plans to reorder and supplement material, as well as to add
more exposition to reduce the students' dependence on the instructor. An ongoing
challenge in this adaptation project is to maintain discovery while expanding
discussion and encouragement, which seems to be necessary in a larger class. In
addition to the adapted notes, an instructor package is being disseminated
containing both a summary of the elements of Dr. Bogart's method and anecdotal
advice collected from instructors during the project.

Broader impact: The skills of communication and working together promoted by
group discovery are useful for all majors in mathematics, and they are
especially valuable for future teachers. This adaptation of Dr. Bogart's notes
provides this opportunity for students in classes whose size is more typical of
required courses at state universities.
