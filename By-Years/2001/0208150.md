Lower crustal and upper mantle rocks commonly show localized ductile shear
zones, characterized by a finer grain size than the host rocks; such strain
localization implies a strain weakening process. Dynamic recrystallization
accompanying dislocation creep is a major process tending to reduce grain size,
and several distinct mechanisms of dynamic recrystallization have been
identified; for quartz these define three 'regimes' of dislocation creep, with
distinctly different microstructures as well as mechanical behavior. The low
temperature, higher stress process of grain boundary bulging produces strain
weakening and localization in both quartz and feldspar, whereas the higher
temperature process of subgrain rotation does not. Previous work on olivine has
focussed on high temperature, low stress creep, although there are indications
of bulging recrystallization and strain localization at lower temperatures. The
goals of this project are to quantify the constitutive behavior and piezometer
relation for bulging recrystallization in quartz, and for olivine to verify the
existence of this process, determine the conditions over which it operates, and
quantify the strain weakening it produces. The results should allow more
accurate modelling of lithospheric deformation.
