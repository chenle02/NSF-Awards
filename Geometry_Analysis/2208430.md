In the study of mathematical objects, a key role is often played by the
symmetries of the object?particularly when the object has many symmetries. This
research investigates ways of characterizing, describing, and studying spaces
with many symmetries in various dynamical, geometric, and topological settings.
These questions often require learning, adapting, and applying ideas and
techniques from many areas of mathematics. This work has connections with
diverse areas of mathematics: from differential equations to theoretical
computer science to descriptive set theory to number theory. Graduate student
funding will be used to train a new generation of experts.

The main thrust of the project is to exploit connections between a wide set of
areas to further understand fundamental structures related to lattices in Lie
groups. A major focus is the study of group actions on manifolds where the PI
recently made major advances on conjectures of Zimmer's. Another major focus is
on the structure of hyperbolic manifolds where the PI recently made a
breakthrough on a question of McMullen and Reid. Other topics include studying
how manifolds with many hidden symmetries (dense commensurators) relate to
several classical questions in geometry, topology, and group theory.
