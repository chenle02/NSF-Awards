Convex optimization is an important area of mathematical optimization. Recently
a new and powerful theory of condition numbers for convex conic linear
optimization problems has been developed. These numbers capture the intuitive
notion of problem conditioning as a measure of problem sensitivity to
perturbations in the input data. They are important in studying many of the
behavioral characteristics of these problems. This research investigates the
role that conditioning plays in problem behavior. Of particular interest is the
performance of algorithms for solving the problem, and the ability to perform
meaningful sensitivity analysis on the problem data. Two distinct but related
avenues of this research are developing methods of preconditioning of
optimization problems (i.e., finding an equivalent reformulation of the problem
at hand which possesses better properties) with the eventual goal to explore and
quantify various preprocessing methods in practical optimization algorithms, and
extending the notion of problem conditioning to practical problems which often
lie outside the conic linear form, leading to better understanding of problem
behavior, ability to perform meaningful sensitivity analysis, and potential
improvement in performance of algorithms. &lt;br/&gt;The broad goal is to
improve the modeling and solution capabilities of optimization, which is a
fundamental tool of operations research. The specific focus is on exploring the
methods to measure and improve the so-called "conditioning" of optimization
problems, i.e., identifying the underlying properties of the problem at hand
that dictate problem behavior, such as sensitivity of the solutions to
perturbation in the problem data, the relative ease or difficulty of solving the
problem via numerical algorithms, etc. Recognition of these properties motivates
obtaining improved formulations and solution techniques of many optimization
problems of great practical importance.
