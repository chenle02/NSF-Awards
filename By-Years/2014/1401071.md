This grant encourages the careers of new researchers by providing travel support
for student authors of accepted papers at the Financial Cryptography 2014
conference. The FC conference is prestigious, and the students' work will stand
alongside some of the most impactful research in the field. FC's research agenda
includes SaTC's Trustworthy Computing System Perspective and Social, Behavioral
and Economic Sciences Perspective. The nature and inspiration of the field
encompasses at its foundations the invention of cryptographic means to support
social protocols such as contracts, exchange, and information
intimacy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The effect of the proposed activity is to sustain
and expand the vibrancy of Financial Cryptography research, and research of
allied fields, by connecting promising young students of the field to the
research community. Their presence at the Financial Cryptography conference will
establish relationships that will continue for decades, and guide the young
researchers' careers.
