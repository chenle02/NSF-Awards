An important feature of traditional economic theory is the extreme degree to
which the institutional structure of markets is simplified, and often not
considered as an integral part of the market mechanism. This approach is never
entirely appropriate. When individuals or firms perceive a way in which the
efficiency of the trading process can be improved, they may be able to realize a
profit by establishing an institution or market which makes this improvement.
The exclusion of the processes which determines market structure is a serious
deficiency of conventional analysis for at least for two reasons. First, to
adequately understand the functioning and evolution of markets requires the
explicit modeling of institutional features. Secondly, welfare questions
concerning the efficiency of resource allocation in market economies cannot be
addressed nearly as convincingly if market structure is not accounted for
explicitly. The purpose of this project is to investigate the endogeneity and
operation of financial markets and institutions and the implications for the
efficient allocation of resources.
