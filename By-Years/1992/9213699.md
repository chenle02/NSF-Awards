This project focuses on control strategies for power systems when they are
operating near their limits. I is attempting to extend the L infinity robustness
results to include complex signals. This of specific interest to the robustness
analysis of power systems, were load changes and network admittance changes
result in uncertainty dealing with complex admittances. In addition, the HVDC
and SVC control will be incorporated in the robustness control procedure. A
systematic procedure to design HVDC and SVC control parameters is also proposed.
The analytical methods proposed and the algorithms developed will be tested on a
realistic power network and the results obtained will be compared with those
obtained by conventional analysis.
