The principal investigator will experimentally determine the equilibrium
solubilities of several geologically important silicate minerals at elevated
temperatures and pressures. Measurements will be made in aqueous solutions
containing either salt, argon, or carbon dioxide. Resulting data will be used to
model fluid-rock interactions that occur during metamorphism of the Earth's
crust.
