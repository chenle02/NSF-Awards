This is a study of electrogenerative processes, i. e. processes for producing
chemical products with byproduct electric power. The emphasis in this study is
on electrodes for electrogenerative processing of substrates dissolved in a
liquid phase. Methods for formulating and preparing the requisite
electrocatalysts to optimize the selectivity are investigated. Selected
processes include integrated flue-gas teatment in which sulfur dioxide is
converted to sulfuric acid and nitric oxide is converted to ammonia or
hydroxylamine; processing of biomass to convert alcohols to aldehydes and
ketones; and "galvanic cementation" to recover metals such as copper and tin
from waste streams. Electrogenerative proceses are fundamentally attractive
because they capture the energy released in the chemical process (which would
traditionally be released as wasted heat) in a form that can be readily
transported and reused. In addition the three processes at the center of this
study all use bothersome environmental pollutants as raw materials. These
processes should be advantageous from perspectives of cost, energy conservation,
and environmental protection.
