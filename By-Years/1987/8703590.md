The primary objective of this project is to increase basic understanding of
several important mesoscale features of the lower troposphere of western North
America that are produced by the complex terrain of the region. The greater
emphasis will be given to low-level phenomena that are trapped by the coastal
topography such as the coastal southerlies and along shore surges that are
observed within a few hundred kilometers of the coast from Baja, California to
British Columbia. Closely connected with the coastal southerly currents re
mesoscale coastal eddies, such as those observed off California (e.g. the
Catalina eddy). A second project will be to examine the diurnal and semi diurnal
surface pressure variations over the United States both to create a valuable
diagnostic tool and to better understand the mesoscale variations and physical
mechanisms of diurnal pressure change. The final component of the proposed
research will be the examination of the mesoscale troughing. Such troughing is
associated with the Puget Sound convergence zone and contributed to the
destruction of the Hood Canal Bridge in 1979.
