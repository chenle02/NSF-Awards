An exploding demand for information services is pushing databases toward
specialized and often incompatible approaches. Yet, the best solutions to the
formidable technical challenges of each sub-field are often found in the
convergence of techniques and models from different approaches. For instance,
advanced active database systems support rule activation by complex temporal
events, while complex patterns of temporal events have been the focus of
languages for time-series analysis and temporal queries. Significant benefits
are expected from the confluence of these areas of research. Moreover, the
capability of reasoning with time is critical to model the dynamics of active
databases, and to avoid undesirable rule behavior, such as non-termination. This
project pursues a unified approach to the design and query optimization of
languages for time-series analysis, temporal reasoning on databases, and active
rules with composite events. In addition, the project is developing more
effective temporal semantics for active database rules, and providing methods
and tools to predict and control their behavior. This research will provide
capabilities for a wide range of government and industrial applications that
must reason with and manage temporal data.
