The Gateways to Science Careers (G2SC) program is designed to provide
undergraduate students with access to innovative science and mathematics
education research. As a Research Experiences for Undergraduate (REU) site at
Stanford University, this project would place 15 students per year in a summer
training program and mentoring project that involves two primary activities.
First, students will work as research assistants in three STEM education
laboratories. G2SC will recruit students from across the nation to participate
in the program, with particular focus on recruiting African-American students
and through a collaborative effort with Historically Black Colleges and
Universities. Second, students will receive year-long training and mentoring
regarding graduate admissions. The objective of this project is to provide
students mentoring and apprenticeship programs that will support their interest
in STEM education careers. The students' participation in research and
publishing in STEM education has the potential to help build capacity for
participation of underrepresented groups in STEM education
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The G2SC program intends to impact the way
students interested in STEM careers envision themselves as members of the STEM
education community. Through their direct research with leading African-American
scholars in STEM education and their research groups, the participating students
will be engaged in authentic apprenticeships that extend beyond a summer academy
into the academic year. By offering this program to 15 students per year, the
goal is to assist 45 students towards careers in science and mathematics
education research. The broader impact of this project involves its capacity to
provide a model for the recruitment and training of STEM education researchers.
This project has the potential to produce 45 STEM educators and education
researchers. The REU site and the research associated with this project may also
provide evidence regarding the effectiveness of pipeline programs.
