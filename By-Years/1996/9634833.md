9634833 Chui This grant provides funding for an industrial-university
collaborative project on applications of splines and wavelets to surface
analysis and synthesis for CAD modeling. The industrial partner will create an
opportunity for the participating university researchers and students to work on
real-world problems under the guidance of industrial experts. The specific goal
is to develop and implement an autonomous system for detecting and correcting
surface waviness, using a spline-based wavelet transform and basis functions
that constitute the designed surface. If this project is successful, this
research will lead to a unified design database tied to a single common
geometry, thus precluding any unnecessary rework in surface design and
eliminating costly changes in the hardware development program. It will also
lead to a standard surface calculation procedure for the aerospace industry that
will significantly reduce scheduling time and cost for aircraft design and
manufacture. It is expected that other industries, particularly automobile,
tool, and parts, will benefit from this research on surface analysis and
sunthesis for CAD modeling.
