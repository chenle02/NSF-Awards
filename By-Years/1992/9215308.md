This program proposes to determine the scope of the solubilization phenomena of
bimetallic etheralkoxides. It aims to pursue this type of reactions toward sol-
gel synthesis of multicomponent oxides other than 123-YBCO. The complexation of
copper, nickel, cobalt, and zinc theralkoxides with sodium, potassium, rubidium,
cesium, strotium, barium, and lanthanum etheralkoxides will be investigated. The
limiting stoichiometries will be determined in each of the cases where soluble
bimetallic complexes are formed. The crystal structures of the bimetallic
complexes will be determined with the use of the Reitveld refinement analysis.
%%%% This proposal seeks to produce mutually soluble precursors and to
understand the formation of these complexes. It will carry forth this type of
complexation reactions toward the preparation of multicomponent oxides. This
work has the potentials of expanding greatly the availabilities of precursors
for the sol-gel synthesis method of producing multicomponent oxides.
