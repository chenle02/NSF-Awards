9626747 Churchill A collaborative effort between the PI and Colombian
colleagues, this project will provide a complete floristic treatment of the
mosses of Colombia. The Colombian moss flora contains 68 families, 256 genera
and 889 species, and is estimated to represent 10% of the total worldwide
diversity of mosses, 30-40% of the Neotropical moss diversity, and 53-60% of all
mosses in the tropical Andes. The emphasis of this proposal is concise species
descriptions, but higher taxa (genera and families) will also be described so as
to make the work useful to workers in Venezuela south to southern Peru as well
as those in Colombia. A database of 15,000 collections of Colombian mosses, as
well as the text of the Prodromus Bryologiae Novo-Granatensis (in both English
and Spanish) and a catalogue of Colombian moss types will be made available via
the Internet in addition to the results of the current project. Species
descriptions and distribution maps will be added to the Internet server in
regular updates. This project will have significant impact on knowledge about
neotropical mosses, which play an important role in maintaining and preserving
montane landscapes.
