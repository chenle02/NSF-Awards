This is a transfer of funds to the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Wallops
Flight Facility (NASA WFF) for management and engineering services in support of
NSF-sponsored satellite mission to be launched by the National Reconnaissance
Office in August 2010. The NSF sponsored nano-satellite is a "triple (3U)
cubesat" that will utilize the Poly-Picosat Orbital Deployer (P-POD) system. The
purpose of the NSF nano-satellite mission is an atmospheric science experiment
aimed at investigating Terrestrial Gamma Ray Flashes. NASA WFF will provide
technical assistance to NSF for the preparation, documentation, and test of the
cubesat system. WFF will also work with the launch sponsor, and launch provider
to provide necessary assurances that the Cubesat spacecraft will not adversely
interfere with the primary spacecraft, either technically or via schedule
delays. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
