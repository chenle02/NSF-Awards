Arizona State University seeks to understand how open-ended, hands-on Making
work and activities can reflect student learning gains in formal engineering
education, particularly in an undergraduate, product-based course. The aim is to
expand understanding of what Making and learning through Making in the context
of engineering design education might be. The results generated during this
study will describe the learning trajectories of engineers as they learn Making.
These results will illustrate educational pathways within the engineering
education curriculum that could be further studied. By examining the engineering
student Making learning experience this work can impact the quality of
engineering design teaching.

The intellectual merit of this project will be the advancement of knowledge of
the learning pathways of Making through capturing empirical evidence in the
engineering classroom using multiple qualitative methods. This exploratory
project will address the relationship of a Making mindset and engineering design
practice. The results will have the potential to highlight routes to Making
learning that can illustrate pathways to engineering as well as a means for
faculty and institutions to adopt a Making mindset approach in engineering
design learning that is more inclusive.

This project is a part of NSF's Maker Dear Colleague Letter (DCL) portfolio (NSF
