This research program is to be conducted on materials and fabrication approaches
for producing superconductor-insulator-superconducting (SIS) tunnel junctions
based on refractory metals; studies of mixer noise and conversion efficiency in
the quantum-limited regime will be carried out, in collaboration with
researchers at Univ. of California, Berkeley. Frequencies of interest in the
millimeter-wave band are approximately 100 GHz and above approximately 300 GHz.
