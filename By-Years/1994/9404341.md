9404341 Kan The principal investigator proposes to analyse the global wave
structures for systems of conservation laws governing three-phase flows in
petroleum reservoirs. Global solutions to these equations with arbitrarily large
initial data will be constructed by showing the convergence of various finite
difference schemes and the vanishing viscosity method. He also plans to study
the eqautions governing two dimensional steady irrotational transonic gas flows
past an obstacle. Solutions to the inviscid problem will be constructed by
studying the convergence of the zero-viscosity limit of the corresponding
viscous problem. The model equations to be studied in the first problem are
qualitatively similiar to various models used in practical petroleum reservoir
simulations. The mathematical study of these equations should add to our
understanding of the processes of secondary and tertiary oil recovery from oil
fields. The equations to be studied in the second problem can be used to
describe the flow of air past an airplane wing. The mathematical studies of
these equations are therefore relevant to many aerodynamics applications.
