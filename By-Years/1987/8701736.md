Frohman intends to pursue the solution of problems in three- manifold topology
and geometry, and in combinatorial group theory, using tools from minimal
surfaces, group actions on R- trees, and real algebra. The application of
techniques from such widely separated areas is indicative of the ultimate unity
of mathematics.
