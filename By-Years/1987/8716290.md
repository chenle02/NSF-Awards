This project is a collaborative effort between William Emery at the University
of Colorodo and Albert Bradley at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. It is a
feasibility study for developing an electronic bathythermograph (EBT) that would
serve a similar purpose as presently-used expendable XBTs. A probe with sensors
would be released from a moving ship. It free-falls through the water column,
collecting and storing temperature and pressure data to some specified depth.
The probe would then be spooled back in and retrieved by an attached synthetic
line. After recovery, stored data would be dumped and the instrument prepared
for additional deployments. Anticipated advantages of the reusable EBT over the
XBT are improved data quality from repeating use of the same sensors, direct
measurment of pressure as a function of depth, reduced logistic costs, and
potential use on volunteer observing ships. The recent introduction and
availability of very thin and strong, long-chain polymer line, suggests that
such retrievable probes are now feasible. The project will result in a technical
feasibility report, and might possibly be the mechanical engineering proof-of-
concept basis for a full instrument development proposal.
