This proposal seeks to deploy middleware capabilities to extend and enable the
NSF Network for Computational Nanotechnology (NCN) nanoHUB facility. Resources
in support of NCN at Purdue will be integrated with Condor-G and other
middleware capabilities, and share access with Teragrid and University of
Wisconsin grid assets. It is on this nanoHUB grid that NCN-driven applications
and thousands of nanotechnology science users will be enabled. The project takes
developed middleware components ranging in maturity from prototype to fully
mature and integrates them into an end-to-end set of services as part of an
overall distributed system environment over a 3-year time frame. Middleware
technologies include the PUNCH/InVIGO facilities at Purdue, Condor, and SODA.
Nanotechnology applications to be enabled include NEMO and nanoMOS. Users will
access this shared cyberinfrastructure through a nanoHUB web
portal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
