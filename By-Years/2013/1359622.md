This award provides support for junior scientists to attend Hot Quarks 2014: A
Workshop on the Physics of Ultrarelativistic Nucleus-Nucleus Collisions for
Young Scientists. The format of this workshop is unusual in that only junior
scientists (graduate students, postdocs, and early career faculty members) can
attend. The workshop is focused on the exchange of scientific information
related to understanding the behavior of matter at extremely high densities
and/or temperatures. Such a state of matter is expected to have existed soon
after the Big Bang. Participants will be discussing results from experiments at
the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at Brookhaven National Lab, and the Large
Hadron Collider at CERN, in Switzerland. Research in this area contributes to
our fundamental understanding of the nature of matter and has implications for
other areas of science, such as cosmology. Focusing on the participation of
junior scientists plays an important role in educating the next generation of
experts in nuclear science who will be essential to the Nation's future in this
area.
