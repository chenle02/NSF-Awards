Durable optical coatings will be an important part of large telescope and
astronomical instrument design in the future. Many elements, some of
considerable physical size, will be involved. Coatings with long useful
lifetimes will increase performance, reduce cost and minimize risk from
handling. The research program carried out under this SBIR Phase I award will
examine the usefulness of a new coating technique that utilizes a low voltage,
high current plasma. The structure of coatings produced with this new technique
will be investigated and compared with that of more conventional coatings. The
research is anticipated to lead to application in the production of more durable
optical coatings for commercial and defense applications in addition to its
value in astronomical instrumentation.
