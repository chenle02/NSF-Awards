An analytical and experimental investigation will be performed to study the
impact damage in fiber-reinforced laminated composites and the effects of their
curvature and ply orientation on the damage. The analysis will be able to
predict the extent and the types of damage in flat and curved composite
structures due to transient dynamic impact. Stresses and strains in laminates
will be calculated by a proposed finite element method which is based on
transient dynamic analysis with the consideration of material and geometric
nonlinearities. Failure will be predicted and damage progression will be
simulated by the proposed failure analysis. The failure analysis will include a
continuum mechanics approach for in-plane damage and a dynamic fracture model
for delamination growth and arrest. A user friendly computer code based on the
analysis will be developed during the course of this investigation. The code
could serve as a design tool to evaluate the impact resistance of given
composite structures and to select optimal configurations of composite
structures for a given application. Experimental tests of flat and curved
composite structures will also be performed to assess the validity of the model
and the computer simulations.
