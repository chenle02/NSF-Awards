Medium energy physics research on hypernuclear spectroscopy and muon catalyzed
fusion will be performed. The hypernuclear studies will be carried out as part
of the CEBAF Hall C and Hypernuclear Spectroscopy System (HNSS) collaboration.
The HNSS Phase I and II is a fully approved CEBAF experiment to measure photo-
and electroproduction of hypernuclei. Ongoing work in muon catalyzed fusion will
continue in connection with an approved TRIUMF and Vienna. At CEBAF,
responsibilities include: design review of the SOS spectrometer particle
identification system, construction of the electron spectrometer's scintillator
hodoscope and alignment hardware, and participating in the design of a trigger
method to correlate electron-arm information with the Kaon-arm, producing an
efficient hypernucleus trigger at an acceptable rate. Also, a prototype beam
intensity and position monitor for Hall C, based on a commercial SQUID
magnetometer will be tested. For work at TRIUMF large area, cryo-capable silicon
diodes will be produced for detection of stopping charged fusion products from
muon catalyzed fusion in layered frozen hydrogen targets. ***
