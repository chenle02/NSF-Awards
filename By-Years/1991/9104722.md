Testicular growth in American tree sparrows occurs in spring in response to
increasing daylength. By early summer, male tree sparrows become unresponsive to
long days (i.e., they become photorefractory), and their testes regress. This
project explores the physiological mechanisms that turn seasonal breeding on and
off. The first phase tests the hypotheses that (1) a thyroid hormone (T4)
simulates longs days (and thyroidectomy, short days), and (2) for
photorefractoriness to be induced, T4 must be available when male tree sparrows
experience long days. The second phase examines the hypothesis that brain
receptors for excitatory amino acids (e.g., L-glutamate) transmit processes
photic information (from brain photoreceptors, the biological clock, and/or
elsewhere) to neurons that control the secretion of reproductive hormones from
the pituitary gland. The ultimate goal of the project is to strengthen and
extend understanding of the physiological basis of seasonal reproduction.//
