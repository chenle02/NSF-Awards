The goal of this project is to investigate a new class of stochastic
probabilistic models, that make inferences and extract high-order dependencies
from high-dimensional data. This research builds upon work that recasts existing
unsupervised algorithms such as factor analysis, principle component analysis,
and independent component analysis as energy-based feedback models. The
diffusion network perspective investigated in this project affords new nonlinear
generalizations of existing models, generalizations which are easily extended to
overcomplete and undercomplete cases, and in which inference is relatively
simple. Learning in diffusion based approaches is efficient and neurally
plausible, making them good candidates for engineering applications and for
modeling of neural and cognitive processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new models
will be explored using a synergistic combination of theoretical work and
computer simulations. Their practicality will be tested by applying them to a
variety of exciting and difficult machine perception tasks, including efficient
representation of natural scenes, person identification and facial expression
recognition, and reconstructing three-dimensionally transformed faces from 2-D
video.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because of their unique capabilities to model high-
dimensional data in a nonlinear fashion, the diffusion networks studied in this
project are likely to be important in a diverse group of fields including data
mining, computer vision, and computational neuroscience, and could outperform
existing algorithms in a wide variety of applications, including human computer
interaction, image processing, and law enforcement.&lt;br/&gt;
