Many unconventional pairing mechanisms of electronic origin have been proposed
for superconductivity in heavy fermion compounds and high Tc superconductors.
While the measured Fermi surfaces of UPt3 and YBa2Cu3O7 seem to agree with the
predictions of band theory and experiment which indicate the limitation of the
local density approximation and the important role of quantum charge or spin
fluctuations. Here, they discuss the origins of these discrepancies based on
their understanding of the Hubbard/Anderson model Hamiltonian. Both band
structure calculations and model simulations are essential to understand the
computer programs for finite temperature Monte-Carlo simulations, as well as a
new efficient algorithm for zero- temperature variational Monte-Carlo
simulations in which a Gutzwiller projection operator is used to restrict charge
fluctuations in noninteracting wave functions. They will continue along these
lines to (1) study the novel properties in systems of almost-localized Fermi
liquids, and (2) develop techniques for first principle variational quantum
Monte-Carlo simulations. In particular, they will investigate the ground state
properties of Fe, where the magnetic energy was underestimated by the local-
density approximation, and therefore a wrong ground state crystal structure was
predicted.
