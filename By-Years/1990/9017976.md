This is a continued study of the experimental determination of the dissolution
and precipitation kinetics of silicates and aluminosilicates as functions of pH,
temperature and the Gibbs Free Energy of reaction ( G); to examine the surfaces
of the reacted minerals using surface analytical techniques (e.g. XPS, AES, STM,
AFM) which when combined with rates determined from solution chemistry using
flow-through reactors will provide information on surface reaction mechanisms;
and to apply the rate data obtained to model low temperature, predominantly
meteoric water diagenesis of a Jurassic feldspathic sandstone in the North Sea.
Our experimental work is the first to describe both dissolution and
precipitation rates of major rock-forming silicates and aluminosilicates as a
function of G, as well as the first to measure precipitation rates in phases
more complex than quartz. Incorporation of the full rate laws in an accurate
two-dimensional hydrodynamic model of fluid flow in porous media should result
in the first completely quantitative physical and chemical explanation of
diagenesis in a dynamic sedimentary basin.
