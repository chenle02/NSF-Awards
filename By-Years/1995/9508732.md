With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program and the Office of
Multidisciplinary Activities are supporting the research of Dr. Paul J. Scheuer
of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Hawaii, Manoa. Dr. Scheuer
will focus his work on gaining an understanding of marine ecology and
biosynthesis and seek leads for the discovery of compounds having important
biological properties. The focus of this research is the elucidation of the
constituents of sacoglossan and cephalaspidean mollusks and of their algal or
molluskan diets and the study of a sponge of order Verongida to determine the
origin of the cyano/isocyano functions in marine sponges. Another focus involves
the screening of sessile, soft-bodied invertebrates for interesting biological
activity.
