The critically acclaimed film "STAND AND DELIVER" accomplished the formidable
task of focusing national attention on the achievements of minority students in
higher mathematics. As a motivational tool for educators, the film's value can
hardly be overstated. "STAND AND DELIVER" will now have a second life as a play
for the stage. The intimate human drama of the story of Jaime Escalante and his
inner city A.P. calculus class will be re- written and confined to one set - a
classroom - making it a natural for the theatre. Best of all, junior and senior
high schools already have the resources to stage a first-rate production. Since
almost all the roles depict students and teachers, "STAND AND DELIVER" should be
a natural choice for school drama clubs across the country. The transformation
of the movie into a play will take place in three stages: First, the screenplay
is adapted into a stage play. Second, the initial stage production is mounted.
Third, the play is published and made available to schools and theatre companies
for local performances.
