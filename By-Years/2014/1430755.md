This project investigates the mobilization of toxic mining contaminants in the
Lake Superior basin. The investigator will conduct archival research and oral-
history interviews, and she will develop a geo-spatial database. She plans to
link her historical research with contemporary policy and regulation issues, and
to engage with local communities, including Native Americans in the region.

The investigator is a well-known environmental historian whose previous work has
drawn on multiple disciplines and generated significant media interest; she has
a network of contacts that includes a documentary filmmaker and relevant
stakeholder groups. The project will produce a narrative of environmental
history with the potential for overlap with important questions of technology,
culture, and society. It will be of interest to citizen scientists, a wide-array
of scholars, and the general public. The most important broader impact of the
project is that it might very well influence contemporary policy and law-making.
