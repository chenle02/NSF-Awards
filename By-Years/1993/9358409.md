9358409 Bonnecaze Fundamental mechanisms and phenomea of transport and mixing of
dense particulate flow will investigated using tomographic imaging, advanced
micromechanical models and numerical simulations. His research on two-phase flow
materials with random microstructure has applciations to electrorheological
fluids, multiphase processes and materials production. ***
