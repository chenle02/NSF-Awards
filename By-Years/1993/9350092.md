Cincinnati's self-study is directed by Steering Committee that is broadly
representative of the community, educators, business, informal science, and the
Ohio Department of Education . The self- study will begin with a review of
current practices including goals, available equipment and technology, community
resources, teacher qualifications, model programs, and others. New data will be
gathered from the broad community through surveys, interviews, and observations.
The data will be carefully analyzed and recommendations for improvement made by
the Steering Committee. Public fora will be held in the city to share the data
and recommendations and to gather comments on them to be included in a final set
of recommendations and a plan for improvement of science and mathematics
education based upon the data and recommendations. The award period is for 12
months, starting February 1, 1993
