The reflectivity algorithm for laterally varying earth models is too slow to be
practical for modeling refraction data when the vertical direction is the
imbedding direction. However when the horizontal direction is made the direction
of imbedding the cost of computation increase (at most) linearly with source-
receiver offset. In general the horizontal propagator has a continuous spectrum
and a point spectrum. The point spectrum is large and troublesome to locate at
body-wave frequencies but the location of the continuous spectrum is always
known. By adding a low-velocity lower half space to the model the continuous
spectrum is enlarged at the expense of the point spectrum. We propose to treat
lateral heterogeneity by coupling together the continuous spectra of adjacent
vertical slices.
