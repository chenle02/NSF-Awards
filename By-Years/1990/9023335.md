This Faculty Award for Women Scientists and Engineers is made to Dr. Ruth J.
Williams of the Department of Mathematics, University of California, San Diego.
Dr. Williams will continue working in her research interest in probability,
specifically on stochastic processes. Her primary focus to date has been on
multidimensional diffusions and their applications in physical, biological and
social sciences, as well as in engineering. She plans to investigate stochastic
integral equations and nonlinear PDE's and their connection with stochastic
processes. The NSF Faculty Award for Women recognizes the high quality of the
awardee's record in teaching and scholarship as well as potential for continued
significant contributions to scientific research, the academic profession, and
the education of future scientists. Dr. Williams will continue her work on
stochastic processes, an area of probability theory. Particulary noteworthy is
her appointment to an Associate Editorship to a leading journal of probability.
