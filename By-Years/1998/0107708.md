Corporation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: NGS: Virtual Worlds and Simulation
Conference (VWSIM'01)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the last several years,new
advances have been made in creating collaborative virtual places, populated by
both intelligent agents and human players. Unlike the usual homogenous
simulation system, part of the strength of a Virtual World (VW) is its ability
to become the common meeting ground for a variety of different types of
computer-based processing capabilities. During January 7-11, the Society for
Computer Simulation will hold its fourth Virtual Worlds and Simulation
Conference (VWSim'01) in Phoenix, Arizona. Although this conference has always
been noted for its diversity, this year we are making a special effort to bring
in several users of distance education amd telemedicine. The requested funds
will support researchers in the areas such as distance education and distance
medical projects, teachers and healthcare practioners who will report on ongoing
VW projects in The Navajo nation and in rural Alaska.&lt;br/&gt;
