Research on unique soft x-ray wave-length dispersive instrumentation is proposed
to fulfill important process monitor needs in the semiconductor industry. ARACOR
experience in designing and successfully applying multilayer synthetic
microstructures to obtain both wave-length discrimination and focusing of soft
x-rays is utilized as a key parat of this work. This proposal details how the
novel x-ray optic elements provide large solid-angle collection efficiency and
focusing of fluorescent soft x- rays to yield quantitative, non-destructive
measurement of elemental materials within measurement times of one to two
seconds instead of minutes as for x-ray energy-dispersive instruments. The
rapidity of measurement allows application as a process line monitor with the
capability of unambiguously determining the elemental concentrations across the
wafer surface. A unique and extremely significant application which comes
directly from high flux counting is the ability to determine the projected range
of ion implanted species. The proposed research in Phase I is primarily
theoretical, with major emphasis on determining the parameters characterizing
the multilayer synthetic microstructures. The final result to be obtained in
Phase I is the design of a characterized prototype instrument.
