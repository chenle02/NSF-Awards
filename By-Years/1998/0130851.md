BITS: Fixational eye movements in biological and artificial vision systems

Summary

The proposed research project has two goals: (1) to determine the specific
contributions of small eye movements to the representation of visual information
in the brain, and (2) to export such mechanisms to machine vision systems. To
accomplish these goals, this project will integrate computer modeling of neural
populations, robotic experiments and psychophysical experiments with human
subjects to analyze the statistical structure of neural activity under natural
viewing conditions. The proposed research will first characterize the influences
of eye movements on the spatial selectivity of thalamic and cortical cells
during natural viewing conditions. Then, the activity dynamics of neuronal
ensembles will be studied, both in terms of efficiency of visual representation
and in relation to the results of psychophysical studies on the hierarchical
structure of spatial visual processing. Finally, we will analyze the possible
involvement of small eye movements in the recovery of distance information
during binocular free-viewing of a 3D scene. Studies will be conducted with the
dual purposes of providing new insights on the brain and considering possible
applications to machine vision systems.
