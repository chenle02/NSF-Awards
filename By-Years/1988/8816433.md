The aqueous ionic milieu influences long-range intermolecular interactions
between DNA molecules, the degree of expansion or condensation of the DNA
molecular coil and the short range helical structure. Within each of these
domains, there are striking transitions not yet clearly understood on the basis
of existing polyelectrolyte theory or nucleic acid chemistry. Dr. Bloomfield's
goal is to understand the forces mediating these transitions. Some of the
techniques to be used are dynamic laser scattering, small angle X-ray and
neutron scattering, UV-visible, CD and laser Raman spectroscopy and chemical
probes. Theoretical techniques will also be used. DNA undergoes some striking
phase changes. All of these transitions depend strongly on ionic strength as
well as on other variables such as polymer concentration, molecular weight,
temperature and specific ion effects. Molecular biology has thus far concerned
itself primarily with coding- type data. However, at a higher level, the choice
of a code which is used (i.e., the DNA) has control mechanisms built into it
which are widely believed to involve in part, binding of other control molecules
to the DNA, and in part, changes in the DNA conformation. Knowledge of ways in
which DNAs are likely to interact must precede some types of understanding of
control mechanisms and the experiments proposed here treat precisely this
problem.***//
