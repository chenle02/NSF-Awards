Frequent measurements of the total flux density and linear polarization of
extragalactic radio sources will be made at a frequency of 4.8, 8.0 and 14.5 GHz
using the Michigan 26 meter radio telescope. Theoretical models will be
developed and fitted to these data to study the physical conditions in the
emitting regions and to study the particle energy generation mechanisms. These
observations will be supplemented by Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI)
observations in collaboration with other researchers. Observations will also be
made at 0.85, 1.4 and 2.7 GHz with the National Radio Astronomy Observatory 91
meter telescope to investigate the broad-band characteristics of low- frequency
variable sources. Specific objectives of the research include: a) to obtain high
time-resolution, multifrequency polarization and flux density data of isolated
outbursts in order to test detailed theoretical models of the source emitting
region, b) to develop more sophisticated models of shocks propagating in
relativistic jet flows which constrain more of the physical parameters of the
emitting regions, c) to better understand the relative importance of intrinsic
and extrinsic and mechanisms as causes of decimetric variability, and the nature
of the "intermediate frequency gap" , d) to improve global models of active
galactic nuclei through simultaneous, broad- band (Ultraviolet or X-ray through
radio wavelengths) observations, and e) to obtain morphological information of
selected sources to test models of the emitting regions.
