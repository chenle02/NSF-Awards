The University of California, Irvine, will offer a physics research program for
nine undergraduate students. The program involves research projects with a
variety of research groups under close faculty supervision. Research areas
include searches for anomalous long-range forces, theoretical condensed matter
physics, observational astrophysics, theoretical neurobiology, scattering
studies of surface physics, experimental plasma research, and experimental
particle physics. Student interaction will be provided through seminars. A post-
summer follow-up program will also be conducted. This project is supported under
the Program of Research Experiences for Undergraduates to help ensure an
adequate supply of scientists for the future.
