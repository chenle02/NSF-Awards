Argonne National Laboratory along with the University of Chicago, the
University of Illinois at Chicago, Northwestern University, and Fermi National
Accelerator Laboratory propose that an NSFNET NSS be located at the Argonne main
facility in Chicago. The Argonne National Laboratory is a large, multiprogram
facility owned by the U.S. Government and operated by the University of Chicago
under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy. This proposal will provide a
major access point to NSFNET, to CICnet, and to the National Research and
Education Network. It will provide access to national resources by the academic,
government, and industrial research enterprises in the Chicago area and provide
access to major research resources located in the area by scientists throughout
the nation. These resources will be made even more accessible by establishing an
interagency gateway at Argonne between NSFNET, ESnet, MILNET, and the NASA
Science Network. Furthermore, Argonne and its four partners in this proposal are
committed to provide whatever support may be needed to ensure the success of the
node in providing excellent NSFNET access service in the Chicago area for
inbound and outbound network traffic.***
