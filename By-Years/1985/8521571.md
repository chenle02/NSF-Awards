This project's goal is the development of an alternative varying capacitance
machine. Phase I has demonstrated that by introduction of dielectric material
into the working gap of a varying capacitance rotating machine in combination
with a novel arrangement of machine elements will increase substantially the
power of the machine. Phase II will investigate extension of the concept to the
design of a practical machine.
