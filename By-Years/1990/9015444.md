The Early Cambrian metazoan radiation involved a period of lower metazoan
evolution coupled with a relatively abrupt diversification of body types, many
now extinct, during the Cambrian. This history implies a sequence of changes in
genetic control or morphological pattern formation to encode the sequence of
novel architectures. This project will investigate the relations between (1) the
indications of early body types furnished by trace and body fossils and the
implied evolution of pattern- formation capabilities of the genome; and (2) the
radiation of (chiefly segmented) body types of higher invertebrates and the
implied pattern of change in the tiers of genetic-regulatory control.
