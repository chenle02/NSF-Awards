9622305 Phillips This project is a study of differential equations from two
areas, the Ginzburg--Landau equations as they apply to superconductivity and the
calculus of variations related to nonlinear elasticity. Features of solutions to
the Ginzburg--Landau equations are to be studied. Experimental evidence for the
materials they model and numerical simulations for the equations themselves
indicate that stable solutions contain coherent pattern formations (vortex
arrays). It is proposed to analyze solutions for simple geometries (e.g.
cylindrical rods and thin films). The principal investigator seeks to establish
the existence of these patterns and to understand the mechanisms that bring them
about. He also seeks to determine how one can control the patterns (pin the
vortex distributions). Doing this will lead to a better understanding of the
models and to estimates for the effectiveness of a material to carry a
supercurrent when subjected to an applied current or a magnetic field. The
second part of the proposal deals with the regularity of solutions to
variational problems related to nonlinear elasticity. P. Bauman and the
principal investigator have established that solutions to certain boundary value
problems from two dimensional elasticity are locally Lipschitz continuous
homeomorphisms. It is proposed to investigate whether or not these solutions
have singularities. Analytically this is to ask if the solutions are
differentiable everywhere. %%% Scientists describe how a given material can
conduct an electric current or how an elastic body can be twisted and bent by
expressing such phenomena as solutions to mathematical equations (called partial
differential equations) based on the underlying physics in each instance. The
principal investigator studies the features of these solutions. For example in
the case of a superconducting material (a material that can conduct electricity
very efficiently) it is observ ed that the current naturally circulates around a
symmetric array of points called vorticies. It is also observed that if the
current is sufficiently strong the array begins to drift causing the current to
die off and superconductivity is lost. Pattern formation and the onset of
instability are features that can be investigated through the solutions.
Understanding and being able to predict these features is important both for
theory and engineering applications. ***
