Carnivorous pitcher plants are a fascinating example of adaptation to nutrient-
poor soils. Remarkably, the pitcher insect trap evolved three times
independently in plants. How did the pitcher evolve from a flat leaf? Did each
separate evolution of the pitcher involve the same genetic changes, or do they
represent completely different ways of making a similar structure? To address
these questions, this study will apply genetic findings from model plants to
test hypotheses of the genetic changes responsible for the evolution of the
carnivorous pitcher from a flat leaf. This research will evaluate expression
patterns and silencing of genes known to be involved in leaf formation and
compare their role in the three groups of pitcher plants.

This research will provide research-based training for high school and
undergraduate students with diverse backgrounds. Furthermore, the ability of
these plants to excite public interest will aid in the communication of both
scientific principles and the findings of this study through various media
formats. This study has possible benefits for the application of biotechnology.
The establishment of a method for silencing genes, as proposed for the study of
leaf development in pitcher plants, could help advance protein harvesting
technology and gene discovery in plants of agronomic importance.
