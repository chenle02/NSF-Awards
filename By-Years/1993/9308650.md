9308650 Kay We propose an in-depth investigation of charge and heat transport in
semiconductor field emission devices via two-dimensional numerical simulations.
The major goal of this work will be to examine heat generation and dissipation
within emitter structures to answer fundamental questions concerning field
emitter failure mechanisms. This investigation will also provide insight into
routine operation of these devices. A new prototype test array of field emitter
devices currently under development and fabrication here at Northeastern
University will provide a wealth of data for experimental correlation
unavailable anywhere else. Transport in the emitter interior will be modeled
using the semiconductor driftdiffusion equations and the heat flow equation.
Targeted areas of study will be the physics of disruptive breakdown and the
effects of Joule heating, with substantial effort devoted to analyzing "whisker"
structures which provide area of local field enhancement. ***
