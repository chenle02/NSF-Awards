Under the direction of Dr. Gary Feinman, Ms. Susan Kepecs will conduct her
doctoral dissertation research in the Chikinchel region of the Yucatan peninsula
of Mexico. In this archaeological research, she will conduct a surface survey to
locate large sites which were occupied during Early and Late Postclassic
periods. From these a group will be drawn for more intensive analysis. Small
settlements and other features will be surveyed and mapped. Surface
distributions of elite architecture, housemounds, trade goods, and other remains
will be plotted. Subsequent analysis will reveal relationships between
architectural indicators of social class and the remains of economic activities.
Through a comparison of Early and succeeding Late Postclassic sites, it will be
possible to determine how economic and related social organization changed over
time. Archaeologists have long been interested in the "decline" of the Mayan
empire. The Classic period saw the construction of temples and other major
monuments and associated large scale ceremonial activity. In the succeeding
Early and Late Postclassic periods, these large centers were abandoned and the
population dispersed into smaller groups. Traditionally this has been
interpreted as a "decline." However, others argue that what is involved is a
change in economic organization characterized by decentralization and increasing
economic competition between groups. Because economic and social organization
during the Postclassic period have not been well examined, it is not possible to
choose between these two options. Ms. Kepecs research will provide much needed
data. A major goal of archaeology is to understand the processes which lead to
the rise and decline of complex societies. The Mayan case has provided a
textbook example of social decline and many researchers have attempted both to
discover the cause and to generalize to other societies. Ms. Kepecs' research is
important because it will shed additional light on this question.
