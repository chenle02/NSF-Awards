Lu&lt;br/&gt;1312659&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The goal of this project is to
investigate electronic structure models and their connections to macroscopic
models from an applied mathematics perspective. The electronic structure models,
in particular the density functional theory (DFT), are widely used to model
materials and chemical systems from first principle. These models give rise to
many interesting and challenging questions to applied mathematicians. The
principal investigator focuses on the following aspects in this
project:&lt;br/&gt;1. Derivation of continuum theory of solid materials from
electronic structure models.&lt;br/&gt;2. Mathematical analysis of electronic
structure models in the presence of the exchange-correlation
energy.&lt;br/&gt;3. Construction and analysis of force-based multiscale methods
for electronic structure models.&lt;br/&gt;4. Development of the frozen Gaussian
approximation for electron dynamics in crystals and waves in periodic
structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Electronic structure models are fundamental
and indispensable tools in physics, chemistry, and material science. Further
progress in this area needs better mathematical understanding of these models.
This project develops more accurate models of materials from the quantum
mechanical level. The understanding of mathematical properties of these models
leads to more efficient algorithms to help extend the applicability of first
principle calculations to macroscopic systems. Beyond the field of quantum
chemistry, the proposed research contributes to related areas of applied
mathematics, for example, applied nonlinear analysis, multiscale modeling and
simulations, and numerical analysis. The investigator plans to combine research
with education activities, including curriculum development to prepare students
for interdisciplinary research.
