ABSTRACT



Principal Investigator: Kahrobaei, Delaram Proposal Number: DMS - 0758054
Institution: CUNY New York City College of Technology Title: The Second New York
Women in Mathematics Conference



The proposal requests funding for the New York Women in Mathematics Network
(NYWIMN) Conference to be held at the New York City College of Technology
(NYCCT), CUNY on May 2nd, 2008. The one-day conference will be the second in the
series. The first NYWIMN Conference was held on December 9th, 2006 at the CUNY
Graduate Center. The conference is being organized by Delaram Kahrobaei and
Victoria Gitman of the NYCCT, who successfully organized the 2006 meeting. The
conference will consist of invited talks by women mathematicians, a poster
session by graduate and undergraduate women students, and a panel discussion of
issues affecting women in mathematics.

The meeting will be in the fields of algebra, combinatorics, and logic, with
added emphasis on interdisciplinary research and establishing connections
between mathematics and computer science. The organizers will focus on the areas
of combinatorial, geometric, and computational group theory, applications of
model theory to algebra and combinatorics, computational complexity, and set
theory. All these areas are relatively new to mathematics. They have developed
in response to the deep interconnections discovered in the last century between
theoretical mathematics, algorithmic processes, and formalizing our notions of
information. Because these areas are so young and so wide in scope and
application, the most fascinating questions still remain to be answered. These
questions will determine how theoretical mathematics and the world of modern
technology will reinforce each other in the near future. The first objective of
the conference is to advance our knowledge in these areas by supporting women
mathematicians who work in them and promoting research collaboration among them.
The second more global aim of the conference is to increase the participation of
women in the mathematical sciences.
