Digital image processing and analysis equipment is a prerequisite for
conductingvideomicroscopy studies of dynamic interfacial phenomena in oil-water-
surfactant systems; this project will acquire a digital image processing and
analysis system for improving image quality and extracting quantitative
information from the recorded images. Dynamic behavior accompanying contact of
surfactant solutions with nonpolar and slightly polar oils will be investigated
using a novel vertical cell technique which allows a clear view of the growth
ofintermediate phases and of spontaneous emulsification. These studies
arepertinent to understanding the mechanism of detergency and to various types
of nonequilibrium behavior which occur during enhanced oil recovery processes.
Diffusion path theory will be extended and used to interpret the results. A
major effort will also be directed toward investigating the dynamic behavior of
emulsions, especially emulsion breaking and inversion processes.
