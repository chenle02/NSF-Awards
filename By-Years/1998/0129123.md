Abstract Rick Lindroth and Caroline Awmack Proposal 0129123

Increasing concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and ozone (O3) are
anticipated to exert widespread impacts on ecosystems. Exceedingly little is
known, however, about the effects of these factors on the dynamics and genetic
structure of populations of interacting species. The purpose of this research is
to assess the independent and interacting effects of elevated CO2 and O3 on the
dynamics of a host plant - herbivore - natural enemy model system. This research
will be conducted at the Aspen FACE (Free Air CO2 Enrichment) facility in
northern Wisconsin. Studies will be conducted to evaluate the long-term impacts
of CO2 and O3 on the population dynamics of natural assemblages of red clover,
pea aphids, and two natural enemies (ladybeetles and a parasitic wasp), and the
importance of genotype in influencing such interactions. Results will improve
our understanding of the relative importance of competition as well as bottom-up
and top-down trophic interactions for community dynamics, in the context of
global environmental change.
