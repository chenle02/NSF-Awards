Curricular materials for undergraduate education in chemical measurement and
instrumentation science are being developed and implemented by faculty members
at 20 public and private doctoral-granting, predominantly undergraduate, and
minority-serving institutions. This includes three historically black colleges
and universities (HBCUs) and one hispanic-serving institution (HIS). The
materials are inquiry- and problem-based modules on measurement techniques and
methods. Integrative contextual modules that use measurement techniques and
methods in the context of a larger scientific question or problem are being
developed as well. Modules are designed to be used in a variety of formats
(e.g., classroom activity, homework assignment, laboratory project) and modified
to suit the particular needs of an instructor or institution. Many of the
materials are designed to be undertaken by students working interactively in
small groups. Faculty teaching expertise and student-learning outcomes are being
expanded and improved at the institutions involved in this project. Over 900
students a year benefit by developing their ability to solve problems, work
independently, and think critically. A workshop is being offered for faculty
members at HBCUs and HSIs to develop faculty expertise in the use of the
inquiry-based electronic resources and promote the utilization of the materials
outside the project development team. The materials developed in this project
are being disseminated through the NSF-funded Analytical Sciences Digital
Library (ASDL), http://www.asdlib.org/, an open-access, peer-reviewed and
annotated collection of electronic resources on chemical measurements and
instrumentation for students, instructors, and practitioners of the analytical
sciences.
