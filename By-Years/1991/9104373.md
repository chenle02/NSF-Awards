This award funds a postdoctoral research fellowship in plant biology for two
years. The project entitled "Mechanism of B locus paramutation in Maize" is to
be carried out in the laboratory of Dr. Vickie Chandler, University of Oregon.
The applicant received his Ph.D. training in the molecular biology of the
bacterial transposon, Tn7. In his postdoctoral training, Dr. Kubo will focus on
mutational events that occur in maize when a specific pair of B chromosomes are
present. The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Plant Biology are designed to increase
the number of outstanding young investigators in plant biology.
