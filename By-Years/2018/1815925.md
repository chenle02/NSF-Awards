Software has bugs, quite commonly in libraries that are created by third-party
developers. Unfortunately, a bug in any library enables attackers to take
control of an application. Furthermore, since popular libraries are used across
thousands of applications, these libraries become a high-leverage target for
attackers. This work improves the security of software by stopping bugs in one
library from impacting other portions of the application. This makes it much
more difficult for attackers to compromise software and harm users.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;This work builds a novel mechanism that can take legacy programs and
convert them into a series of components that are isolated into different
domains called cages. Cages are isolated from each other in a way that is
similar to how operating system virtual machines are isolated. Each cage may
have its own file system and network interface, and may handle system calls in a
different manner. This includes the potential for blocking system calls that
should not be needed by a cage, for example to disable the network interface in
libraries that do not need it. This isolation also includes resource and
performance isolation for a specific cage, preventing a malicious or buggy
library from crashing or harming an application. The team is working to not only
develop a research prototype for the effort, but also to use this work to secure
large software projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
