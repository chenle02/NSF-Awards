9217028 Sorbjan The PIs propose to use large eddy simulation model with a nested
grid to develop new and improve existing parameterizations of dynamic and
thermal effects in the atmospheric mixed layer. Initially, idealized simulations
of the following four regimes of the convective boundary layer will be
performed: (1) non- penetrative and shearless, (2) penetrative and shearless,
(3) non- penetrative with shear, and (4) penetrative with shear. From these, a
comparison of non-penetrative and penetrative shearless regimes will be used to
investigate entrainment processes on the top of the CBL. In addition, a study of
the shearless and sheared regimes will be performed to develop a
parameterization the sheared CBL. Furthermore, they will also investigate
effects of moist convection with cumulus-humilis type of clouds on dynamics of
the mixed layer. Finally, they will attempt to test parameterizations of the
sheared CBL regimes through comparison with observations taken during the
Phoenix and the Stormfest experiments. The developed parameterizations are hoped
to be used in numerical weather prediction and climate simulation models. ***
