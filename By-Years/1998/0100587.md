This proposal concerns questions in higher dimensional Arakelov theory
and&lt;br/&gt;algebraic K-theory. The PI intends to extend results of previous
work with&lt;br/&gt;Soule on motivic weight complexes of algebraic varities to
the arithmetic case.&lt;br/&gt;In collaboration with J. Hu, he intends to use
the deformation to the normal&lt;br/&gt;cone techniquess for Arakelov theory
(developed by J. Hu in his thesis) to the&lt;br/&gt;case of stacks. He also
intends to study questions in arithmetic geometry&lt;br/&gt;related to the
Mordell conjecture using methods from differential algebra
and&lt;br/&gt;Arakelov theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This proposal deals with
arithmetic geometry and algebraic K-theory.&lt;br/&gt;Arithmetic geometry is the
study of the properties of equations with&lt;br/&gt;coefficients that are whole
numbers, and using methods both from number&lt;br/&gt;theory (the study of
properties of whole numbers) and algebraic geometry, which&lt;br/&gt;studies
geometric figures that can be defined by the simplest of
equations,&lt;br/&gt;namely polynomials. Algebraic K-theory studies properties
of linear equations&lt;br/&gt;using methods from geometry. The questions and
phenomena which arise from&lt;br/&gt;combining number theory and geometry serve
as driving forces in much of&lt;br/&gt;contemporary mathematics research.
Moreover, arithemetic geometry has&lt;br/&gt;contributed to many applications
including cryptography and theoretical&lt;br/&gt;computer science.
