9312930 Suiter AGI will continue and expand the scope of its geoscience
undergraduate minority scholarship program with the addition of several new
elements. In 1993-96, AGI will award 70 to 80 scholarships annually, with awards
averaging $2,500 per award. The proposed program is national in scope with
scholars being evaluated and selected through a competitive process. In addition
to increasing the number of scholarships awarded, AGI will provide new features
in the program that will address many of the recognized barriers to ethnic
minority participation. AGI will also increase its monitoring and evaluation of
the program through periodic and systematic review by participants, program
staff, and advisory personnel.
