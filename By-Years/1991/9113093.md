Understanding of men and women in American society encompasses broad
understanding of the attitudes of the diversity of racial and ethnic groups
within it. One important aspect of that understanding is a knowledge of women's
sex roles. This Minority Research Initiation Planning Grant studies
comparatively the sex role attitudes of married and unmarried African American
women in order to develop a conceptual framework for examining these attitudes
which takes into consideration the social and historical context of the
experiences of African Americans. Data from a national cross-sectional study of
Black adults and a re-interview subsample of this cross-sectional survey will be
analyzed to assess the significant predictors of the married and unmarried
women's sex role attitudes. This project will enhance our understanding of the
factors contributing to the development of attitudes about women's sex roles.
This project also provides an excellent opportunity for a promising young
scholar to lay the foundation for building a more comprehensive model of sex
role attitudes than currently exists.
