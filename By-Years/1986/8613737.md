This is a recommendation for an award to support research on fundamental factors
that affect the efficiency of the process by which small discrete particles
suspended in water and wastewater agglomerate to form more readily settleable
masses. Almost all systems for treatment of water and many for treatment of
wastewater involve the addition of chemical agents to produce a precipitate that
acts as a flocculating agent, the activity of which is affected by engineering
design of the basin within which the agglomeration is conducted. Results of this
research may be applied to improvement of the design of these basins to maximize
the agglomeration, minimize the amount of chemicals used and energy required for
mixing, and improve the performance of this process. This project's objectives
are consistent with those of the Environmental Engineering Program and the
investigator's qualifications are appropriate for the work to be done. Award is
recommended as a 2-year Continuing Grant, the initial increment of which is for
$62,265 for 12 months starting on January l, 1987.
