This award by the Division of Materials Research provides partial support for a
Gordon Research Conference on Aqueous Corrosion to be held on July 25-30 at
Colby-Sawyer College in New London, NH. With this award, Professor Scully will
organize a conference, the theme of which will be "Progress, Needs, and
Opportunities in Aqueous Corrosion Science". The broader objective of this
conference is to stimulate exchange information and ideas among scientists and
educators on a number of recent advances in understanding the field of metal
corrosion and the transitions of these processes from pits to cracks. In
addition, corrosion prevention by coatings and additives, multiscale modeling on
the corrosion mechanisms, and microstructural and nanoscale aspects of corrosion
are some of the other topics to be discussed. This conference will be discussing
an important topic of current interest, when many communities are facing the
presence of lead in drinking water by corrosion. Hence, science involved and how
to prevent this are of great importance. A number of educators, researchers and
students are expected to present their studies, and the NSF support would be
used primarily to support students, speakers and young faculty and scientists.
