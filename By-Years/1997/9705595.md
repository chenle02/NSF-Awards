Webb 9705595 The investigators and colleagues organize an international
conference on mathematical models in medical and health sciences at Vanderbilt
University. The conference involves approximately 100 talks and 175
participants. There are 11 plenary talks in such areas as models of the HIV
infected immune system, models of normal and pathological blood production
systems, models of tumor growth and treatment, models of pancreatic function,
wavelet analysis and medical imaging, models of the emergence of drug
resistance, models of epidemiology, models of DNA and hereditary abnormalities,
and models of nerve impulse conduction. The conference has special sessions in
cancer models, diffusive systems in biology, epidemic models, models in
immunology, models of cell population dynamics, optimization and control in
biological models, medical imaging, and cure models in survival analysis. The
scientific purpose of the conference is to stimulate research in theoretical
mathematical models in areas of biology, medicine, and health and life sciences.
The focus of the conference is to bring together mathematicians, biologists, and
medical researchers to a forum that promotes interdisciplinary collaborations. A
major aim of the conference is to involve young researchers and to stimulate
their research goals and directions. The participation of recent Ph.D.
recipients and graduate students is a substantial part of the conference
program. The scientific and educational significance of the conference is
evidenced by the wide range of research topics presented, the diverse
participation of researchers from mathematics departments, biology departments,
engineering departments, medical research institutes, and pharmaceutical
companies, and the active participation of graduate students and young
researchers.
