EAR-0207340&lt;br/&gt;Valley&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will investigate
the magmatic history of the Earth's crust over the past 4.4 billion years. The
mineral zircon will be analyzed for oxygen isotope ratio, U-Pb age, and rare
earth element concentration. The high melting temperature, chemical inertness,
and hardness of zircon creates a time capsule of geochemical information that
lasts virtually forever in samples with low amounts of radiation damage. New ion
microprobe and laser techniques for high precision and accuracy, and/or high
spatial resolution will be employed. Single domains within zoned zircons will be
analyzed. Igneous minerals will be studied from selected terranes of early
Archean, Proterozoic and Mesozoic through Cenozoic age. Archean samples will
include detrital zircons from the Jack Hills, Western Australia, where we
discovered the oldest known sample of the Earth in the past grant period. The
younger samples will document processes of crustal reworking in the Idaho and
Sierra Nevada batholiths of the western U.S. Analyses of zircon will be compared
to new data for magmatic garnet, baddeleyite, titanite, epidote, rutile and
quartz. In combination, these results will provide a record of evolving
compositions including pre-magmatic xenocrysts, magmatic phenocrysts and a range
of post magmatic alteration minerals.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;These studies of
zircons and associated igneous minerals will have broad significance for
understanding the origin and evolution of the Earth's crust. Studies of the
Archean (4.0 to 4.4 Ga) zircons provide the only evidence of the earliest
conditions on Earth. The recent hypothesis of a "Cool early Earth" will be
tested, which has implications for the timing of the first oceans and the origin
of life.&lt;br/&gt;
