The main focus of this project is on the development and/or complexity analysis
of efficient algorithms for solving convex optimization (CO) problems. Many
problems in economics, natural sciences and engineering can be formulated as
convex optimization (CO) problems. In particular, these include first-order
methods with low CPU time and memory space requirements in order to solve
extremely large CO instances. This investigation will also lead to the study
efficient algorithms in the context of the saddle-point (SP) problem and
variational inequalities (VI) due to their close connection to CO. New
algorithms for solving CO will be developed by either handling the instance as
is, or by reformulating it as a SP problem or VI, and then using an efficient
algorithm for solving the reformulation.

If successful, the results of this research will lead to: 1) new and/or better
algorithms for solving CO problems, and; 2) new complexity results for existing
(e.g., augmented Lagrangian penalty) and/or new (e.g., variants of the block-
decomposition) methods. As a by-product, this project will also lead to the
development of new software packages, which will increase and improve the
existing tools available to practitioners for solving CO problems arising in
many applications in economics, natural sciences, and engineering.
