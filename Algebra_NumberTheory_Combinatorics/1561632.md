This award supports research in algebraic geometry. Focused primarily on
varieties defined by polynomial equations, algebraic geometry is an ancient
subject that plays a key role in numerous fields of mathematics, both pure and
applied, as well as in physics. The main theme of this project is that a broad
class of geometric objects, so called Calabi-Yau varieties, come with a natural
system of coordinates. Informally speaking, creatures living on a Calabi-Yau
variety should be able to perceive natural, intrinsic quantities whose values
determine their precise position. As these geometric objects play a fundamental
role in diverse areas of mathematics, these intrinsic quantities should play a
similar fundamental role in theoretical physics, particularly in superstring
theory. Since string theory models suggest that extra dimensions of spacetime
comprise a Calabi-Yau variety, this study suggests there are corresponding
fundamental intrinsic quantities, not yet understood, in our world. This
research project aims to deepen and advance knowledge in this field.

The main objective of the proposed research is to continue the investigator's
collaborative work to generalize the classical theory of theta functions for
abelian varieties to polarized Calabi-Yau varieties, both open (i.e. log) and
compact. More precisely, the goal is to give a canonical basis for the vector
space of global sections, and a formula for the structure constants for the
multiplication rule in the coordinate ring, expressed in the canonical basis, as
counts of holomorphic disks on the mirror. The existence of such generalized
theta functions points to the existence of a geometrically meaningful
compactification of the moduli space, vastly generalizing the compactificaton of
polarized abelian varieties and the theory of the secondary polytope, and at the
same time suggests a synthetic construction of the mirror in terms of the
canonically described ring. The project includes a detailed scheme for
constructing the compactification in dimension two, and the synthetic
construction of the mirror in full generality, by counting rigid analytic disks.
