9632811 Anlarge Our objective is to develop new methods of imaging microwave
frequency magnetic fields and currents on micron length scales and sub-rf-period
time scales in microwave devices. These imaging techniques will open up a new
microscopic understanding of microwave device properties. Special attention will
be given to superconducting microwave devices as they are now poised to make
significant inroads into the cellular telephone and PCS markets. The key
limitations to this new technology, beside reliable cryogenic cooling, is the
problem of power dependence and nonlinearity of the devices. Our imaging
techniques will be specifically focused on the understanding and compensating
for the microscopic origins of power dependence and nonlinearity in these
devices. The imaging techniques to be employed include scanning microwave
microscopy, bolometric and non-bolometric scanning local energy deposition, and
scanning SQUID microwave microscopy. ***
