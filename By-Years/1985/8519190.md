Time-reversing viscous flows are of very general interest and contain features
as yet not well mapped out. Special cases have been extensively investigated.
This effort will use supercomputing to lift previously necessary limiting
conditions. This work will prove valuable in generalizing the understanding of
unsteady flows as well calibrating the numerical method for the case already
known.
