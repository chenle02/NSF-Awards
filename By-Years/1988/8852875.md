This award will provide equipment which will allow the Sociology Department to
build upon a successful National Science Foundation LOCI grant. The curriculum
implemented with the LOCI funds integrated research methods into course content,
and these changes brought about a large increase in the number of students using
the department's computer laboratory. Funds from this award will be used to
purchase personal computers and statistical software which will complement the
existing mainframe terminals and software in use in the laboratory. In addition,
funds will be used for the purchase of computer hardware which will allow the
department to extend the use of the LOCI pedagogy, which has proven so
successful with their majors, to non-majors. The grantee institution is matching
this NSF award with funds from non-Federal sources.
