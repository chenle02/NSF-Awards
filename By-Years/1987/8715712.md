The research work will have as its focus measurements of electron-positron
(e+e-) collisions at the TRISTAN collider in Japan using the AMY detector.
TRISTAN is currently the highest energy e+e- accelerator operating in the world
(50 GeV). TRISTAN will reach 60 GeV by the end of 1988 and higher energies may
be possible after 1988. The AMY detector is located at an intersection region of
TRISTAN where micro-beta magnets will be used to increase the data collection
rate by a factor of three to four above that possible with the other TRISTAN
detectors. The field of research is that of experimental elementary particle
physics. This research studies the basic building blocks of matter (e.g.,
electrons, positrons, quarks, and Higgs bosons) at very high energies. The
experiments use accelerators (colliders) which provide the highest energy
particles made in the laboratory. The data is collected and analyzed using
highly complex and sophisticated apparatus and techniques.
