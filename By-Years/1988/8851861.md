The Physics Department will improve the undergraduate nuclear physics curriculum
by giving students hands-on experience in the latest state- of-the-art
technology in real-time data acquisition, monitoring and control that is used
not only in the area of nuclear physics, but also in the chemical industry and
in the medical field. The purchase of a CAMAC system will be the first step
toward this goal. This system includes a CAMAC crate, a crate controller, three
CAMAC modules (analog to digital converters) and an IBM PC/AT compatible PC with
associated software for data acquisition. The CAMAC system will be used in the
advanced undergraduate physics laboratory to acquire, monitor and control data
in nuclear physics experiments. Since this system has found widespread use in
industrial, research and medical applications, this equipment will better
prepare undergraduate physics students for graduate school and industry.
