The economy and subsistence practices of the aboriginal Belyuen tribe of
Northern Territory, Australia are changing as the group becomes more integrated
with the national Australian economy. However, Belyuen women continue to gather
bush foods even though market foods are available. In this project, the
researcher will establish why women continue to concentrate on food gathering
activities by analyzing the local ethnobotanical and ethnozoological system
within an ecological framework and seeing how food-collecting has been affected
by local and national policies. In addition to extending our knowledge about
tribal societies as they become more integrated in the national socio- political
system, this project will increase our understanding of how gender systems
interact with economic and ecological systems. This project has implications for
developing societies and for industrial societies with non-industrial
subpopulations throughout the world.
