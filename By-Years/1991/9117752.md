Professor Gingerich is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to study the thermodynamic stabilities of metal,
carbon, and semiconductor clusters. Thermodynamic properties of small inorganic
clusters will be determined from high temperature equilibrium measurements with
a Knudsen effusion cell mass spectrometer. Systems studied will include diatomic
transition metals, carbides and nitrides, and clusters of metals, carbon,
silicon, germanium and inter-group IV compounds. Bond energies and enthalpies of
formation will be derived from the measured reaction enthalpies. For selected
molecules the equilibrium measurements will be complemented by theoretical
calculations and matrix isolation spectroscopic investigations in order to
elucidate the molecular structure and nature of bonding. %%% The proposed
investigations will provide much needed fundamental knowledge for refractory
materials of applied interest. It is expected that the results obtained from
this research will aid the finding of new materials with improved technological
properties.
