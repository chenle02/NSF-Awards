In continuation of their efforts on laser spectroscopy probing of excitation and
coherence processes, they propose to use this renewal grant to undertake
research in the following areas: (a) ultrashort time dynamics of electron and
excitation transfer in model systems in condensed media; (b) selective-pulse
excitation for the invesitgation of coherence and relaxation processes; and (c)
laser spectroscopy studies of microscopic solvation and clustering. The
techniques that they shall use in this research (which are already used in their
laboratory) are picosecond and femtosecond spectroscopy, multiple pulse optical
excitation methods, and multiphoton (TOF and PES) detection methods. Their
objectives are to apply (and modify) these techniques to learn about the
dynamics of energy relaxation, solvation, and coherence in condensed media, and
to examine the picosecond and femtosecond dynamics of molecules undergoing
(microscopic) solvation and clustering formation.
