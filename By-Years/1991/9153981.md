This project is a five year program that provides 80 contact hours of workshops
to 40 middle and high school biology teachers each year. Participants are
recruited primarily from schools with over 75 percent enrollment of
underrepresented students. Sessions begin during the academic year and continue
into a summer week- long session. During the workshops, teachers are updated in
current advances in biological science and are provided with cost effective,
hands-on, investigative activities that convey state- of-the-art concepts for
use by all students. These activities, which feature cooperative learning, are
easy to implement and cost effective. Teachers and their students may be invited
to participate in university research laboratories in the Center for Cancer &
Developmental Biology. Evaluation of the project includes pre and post testing
of teachers and their students, examination of teacher authored lesson plans,
and examination of student research projects and their inclusion in county
science fairs. Project dissemination occurs through required inservice
workshops, distribution of project products locally and nationally, through
school curriculum guides, and through publication in national science teaching
journals. Cost sharing in the amount of $314,165 equals 72.5% of the NSF award.
