Paleomagnetic measurements on sedimentary rocks have been used in the past to
reconstruct plate motions, but recent work has shown there to be a systematic
shallowing of paleomagnetic inclinations in these rocks when compared with
volcanic rocks. Thus a possibly serious error exists in paleolatitude
calculation conducted to date. This study will systematically test the expected
latitudinal dependence of inclination shallowing using lithified Atlantic DSDP
sediments. Detailed study of the process will be conducted on a small group of
preselected samples. The results will help resolve discrepancies in the existing
database and will thereby permit accurate reconstruction of past tectonic
motions.
