This photonics project is the start of a three-phase initiative to develop a new
photonics program that a) responds to regional employment shortages in this
emerging field by training much-needed technicians, and b) produces graduates
who choose to go on to receive more advanced degrees. Phase one adds a photonics
option to the college's existing manufacturing offerings by instituting a
Photonics Technician Certificate, creating a new optics laboratory, and
exploring the local need for an Associate in Applied Science (AAS) degree in
Photonics. Future phases will implement the AAS degree, extend the student
recruitment effort, and pursue articulation agreements with four-year
institutions. The project team applies lessons learned from an NSF S-STEM grant
for student recruitment, and collaborates with the National Center for Optics
and Photonics Education (OP-TEC) and the ATE program at Indian Hills Community
College. This project: Develops new courses by adapting and field testing
photonics curricula in collaboration with OP-TEC and local industry; Trains
faculty in both content and teaching methods; Adapts existing strategies used by
other ATE grantees, including those designed to equip all students with the
mathematical ability to succeed; Collaborates with local manufacturers on an
Industrial Advisory Board; Develops a local pipeline from high school to AAS
degree to 4-year degree; Provides a replicable model of how to implement a new
technical program in an emerging technology field in a systematic manner,
including local partners.
