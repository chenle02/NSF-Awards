Mossbauer Spectroscopy allows detailed chemical, structural and magnetic
information to be obtained about atoms on the surface of a solid or within its
bulk. The Wartburg Physics Department will acquire equipment to allow upper
division students to use this valuable technique. It will be used in upper level
laboratories for physics majors and in student projects. One of the projects
will be aimed at characterizing the active phases of iron and iron-component
catalysts and examining the catalytic properties of these phases. The equipment
needed for this project are a multichannel analyzer, velocity transducer,
function generator, drive generator, high voltage supply, detector, pre-
amplifier, amplifier and single channel analyzer, and radioactive source.
