Although sterility in hybrids between species has been documented repeatedly,
its genetic causes are poorly understood, and only one gene that may contribute
directly to hybrid sterility has been identified. Hybrid sterility may be caused
by genes failing to trigger other genes in what are referred to as "regulatory
pathways", hence ultimately disrupting the processes that produce functional
sperm. We propose to use a novel method to identify which genes are active in
two Drosophila species but inactive in their hybrids, hence identifying the
regulatory pathways that have been disrupted resulting in
sterility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modern evolutionary biologists have an
impressive understanding of how genes evolve within populations, but a
relatively poor understanding of how one species splits into two, as when their
hybrids are sterile. This research will illuminate the mechanisms of speciation,
providing insights into the fundamental evolutionary processes that regulate
biodiversity on earth.&lt;br/&gt;
