This award supports cooperative research on chemical and mantle xenoliths from
Northeast China, and provides an important opportunity for US scientists to
study and sample young volcanic rocks from an area which has had only limited
opportunities for collaborative research. The US principal investigator, Douglas
Macdougall, of Scripps Institue of Oceanography, will work with scientists at
the Chinese Academy of Science's Institute of Geochemistry in Guiyang, to
characterize and understand the evolution of selected areas of the Chinese
lithosphere. Samples will be collected in China, and analyzed primarily in the
US, with joint participation by US and Chinese scientists in both phases of the
projects. This research is expected to contribute both to understanding of the
chemical composition of the earth's upper mantle and to the further development
of cooperative relationships among US and Chinese scientists.
