The North Plant Documentation Center is the name given to the computerized
database and ancillary functions at the Herbarium of the University of Alaska
Museum. It is the sum of all activities and products derived from computerized
label data of the specimens at the Herbarium. As the largest collection of
Alaskan vascular plants and the second largest for bryophytes and lichens, it is
an important resource to the field of systematics. The user community is much
larger, for primary data on plants and their distributions are fundamental to
land-planning, environmental monitoring, and botanical research in general. The
center provides a single source for information that is fully documented by
specimens. There is no other institution with both the specimens and the
singular commitment to the flora of Alaska. This project will support completion
of the retrospective data banking of the Center's holdings. With the entire
flora well represented, the Center will be able to provide a large amount of
vital data to a varied clientele. From its database it will be able to provide
excerpts or full records of its holdings in support of detailed monographs,
synoptic floras, biotic inventories, environmental assessments, and studies of
rare plants. The completed database will be queried by others to plan loans and
field research.
