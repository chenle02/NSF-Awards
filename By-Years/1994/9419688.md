9419688 Williams This symposium entitled "Materials Research at the Crossroads
of Physical and Solid-State Chemistry" is being organized by the Physical
Chemistry Division of the American Chemical Society to develop, integrate, and
apply new approaches in the classical disciplines to issues of broader scope
within the solid-state/materials chemical communities. To our knowledge, there
has not been a similarly structured meeting or symposium offered previously,
although specific topics have been discussed at meetings of the Materials
Research Society, the Gordon Research Conferences, and the Materials Physics
section of the American Physical Society. This symposium is unique in that it
addresses a broader range of materials types within one symposium, addresses
primarily a chemical audience, and finds common themes in the manner in which
materials are designed, synthesized, and characterized. ***
