The Physics Department at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute will carry out an
Undergraduate Research Participation Program for ten weeks in the Summer of 1991
with a follow-up during the 91/92 academic year. Ten undergraduates will
participate with at most four from Rensselaer and six from other, primarily
undergraduate and women, institutions in the Northeast. Candidates will be
sought from all fields of science and engineering and they will have completed
their junior year, although a few sophomores may be admitted under special
circumstances. Regularly scheduled seminars and social functions during the
summer will provide contact between the participants, as well as faculty. In
addition, the research groups hold weekly meetings, which discuss technical
issues of the experiments or modeling studies.
