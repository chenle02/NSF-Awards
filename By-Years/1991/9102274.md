Dr. Ricardo Metz has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Metz's doctoral degree was from the University of California at
Berkeley under the supervision of Professor Daniel Neumark. Dr. Metz intends to
continue research at the University of Wisconsin-Madison under the sponsorship
of Professor Fleming Crim. Dr. Metz's area of postdoctoral research will be the
study of bond-selected and state-resolved bimolecular reactions using overtone
spectroscopy. Longer term, he plans to apply overtone spectroscopy to the
spectroscopy of solvated ions. %%% The Postdoctoral Fellowships Program is
viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge
and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract them into meaningful careers in
contemporary chemical research and teaching.
