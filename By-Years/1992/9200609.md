Fialkow will continue his study of several problems concerning systems of
bounded linear operators on Hilbert space. These problems concern the following
topics: joint hyponormality and related problems in the theory of moments;
spectral theory of elementary operators; and majorization, factorization and
invertible factor theorems in C*-algebras. One part of the research will concern
structural models for subnormal, k- hyponormal, and weakly k-hyponormal
operators, with an emphasis on unilateral weighted shifts; this study will also
concern multidimensional power moment problems. Operator theory is that part of
mathematics that studies the infinite dimensional generalizations of matrices.
In particular, when restricted to finite dimensional subspaces, an operator has
the usual linear properties, and thus can be represented by a matrix. The
central problem in operator theory is to classify operators satisfying
additional conditions given in terms of associated operators (e.g. the adjoint)
or in terms of the underlying space. Operator theory underlies much of
mathematics, and many of the applications of mathematics to other sciences.
