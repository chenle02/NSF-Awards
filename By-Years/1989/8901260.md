The inelastic seismic behavior of two special types of reinforced concrete
(RIC) beam- column connection is investigated. These special cases exist in
situations where (1) the beam centerline does not intersect the column center,
and (2) the beam section is wider than the column. Both cases are remitted in
normal design of R/C ductile frame buildings but the accuracy and safety of
current design provisions has been uncertain. An experimental study program
consisting of simulated earthquake testing of at least eight beam-column
connections, four of each special case noted above will be conducted. A
complimentary analytical investigation will also be carried out to verify the
measured results and extend the results into a prediction of the expected
dynamic response of R/C frame structures with such special connections. The
final goal of the project will be a verification of existing design provisions
or proposals for revised requirements.
