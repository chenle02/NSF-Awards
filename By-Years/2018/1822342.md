Formal verification covers a wide range of technologies that are widely studied
in academia and routinely used in industry. Any acceleration in the diffusion of
knowledge about these techniques will lead to superior technology, better users,
and exciting and far-reaching applications. This grant organizes a Summer School
on Formal Techniques over three years, during 2018 - 2020, for students to learn
about cutting-edge techniques in formal modeling and verification. The lectures
are rigorous and cover the spectrum of formal techniques including static
analysis, model checking, theorem proving, invariant generation, compositional
verification, security and systems biology. The lectures are supported by hands-
on laboratories. Attendees at the school discuss their own research ideas and
interact closely with both the lecturers and other
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The previous summer schools have had a
significant broad impact in terms of imparting theoretical knowledge as well as
practical skills to the students from many different research areas. These
summer schools have been received enthusiastically by the participants, and
helped develop a well-knit community of young researchers. The organizers
collected valuable feedback from the students on the impact of the summer school
lectures on their education and research, as well as longitudinal study across
past attendees of these events to evaluate longer-term impacts. Much of the
feedback has been positive, and there is a strong indication that the lectures
cover material that is new and useful to the students, and the laboratory work
builds confidence in the use of specific formal techniques. The lectures,
software tools, and other course material are available from the previous summer
school web sites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
