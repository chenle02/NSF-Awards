This project is for mathematical research in operator theory. The original
impetus for this theory came from a fundamental insight in quantum mechanics,
namely that physical quantities normally regarded as scalars are better
represented by thinking of them as operators on Hilbert space, where they can
interact in a more interesting fashion. The analysis of operators and how they
transform the underlying space has since acquired a distinguished existence of
its own, apart from physics. More specifically, Professor Bercovici will study a
new class of nonselfadjoint operator algebras called dual algebras, with an
emphasis on the existence and classification of invariant subspaces. He will
enrich the perturbation theory of n-tuples of selfadjoint operators, and will
also investigate skew Toeplitz operators. The latter study impinges
significantly on control theory issues in engineering.
