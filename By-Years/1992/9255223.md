The Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) in the State
of Kansas will bring the faculty at three Ph.D.-granting universities together
to work on four core subject areas: (1) materials and chemical sciences; (2)
biological sciences; (3) engineering; and (4) theoretical, mathematical and
computer sciences. The three universities which will participate are: the
University of Kansas, Kansas State University, and Wichita State University. The
State's competitive research base will be strengthened with the support of the
Kansas State Science and Technology Advanced Research initiative which will
foster mentoring of younger faculty, increase the quality and quality of
graduate and postdoctorate research students, and acquire significant pieces of
research instrumentation. Active Kansas participants in EPSCoR governance will
include key university administrators and State government officers. Over the
three- year award period the State of Kansas will contribute over $8.7 million
to ensure the success of the EPSCoR effort.
