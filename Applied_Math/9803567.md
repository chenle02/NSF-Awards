This award will support research on mathematical models for nonlinear optical
media. These models have the form of nonlinear partial differential equations
that are integrable, i.e. that can be completely linearized in a certain sense,
and of perturbations of such equations. The goal of the research is to further
our understanding of chaotic excitation mechanisms for such models and to obtain
specific solutions that correspond to periodic or single-pulse waveforms. The
theoretical results will also be used as benchmark problems for numerical
computation schemes.

Mathematical models for optical media such as optical fibers and ring-laser
cavities have the form of nonlinear differential equations. This research will
address properties of such models that predict the behavior of such media.
Examples include the natural shape and duration of light pulses that can travel
along such fibers and the spontaneous generation of noise within the medium.
