During the COVID-19 Pandemic, economic stimulus programs helped some precarious
workers – those engaged in temporary, contract-based work, and involuntary part-
time work – to reduce debt, pursue additional education, or change careers. This
project examines the longer-term impact of the coronavirus pandemic, and
resulting short-lived financial supports, on gig-based and precarious workers as
the coronavirus becomes endemic. The project examines how workers in precarious
jobs, which are often public facing, perceive the potential ongoing risks of the
virus and the “sweet spot” of timing regarding career changes or efforts to
establish alternative income sources. Findings from the project inform decision-
making at several levels, including workplace protections, worker
classification, changes to unemployment insurance programs, and financial
supports during a crisis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is the fourth stage
of a mixed methods panel study utilizing interviews and surveys conducted with
nearly 200 gig-based and precarious workers. Participants include gig workers
who find work via online platforms, freelance workers in creative fields, and
fast food and retail workers. While the earlier data collection phases coincided
with the start of the pandemic, the second wave, and the end of unemployment
assistance, this phase coincides with the coronavirus being deemed endemic and
the end of the covid-19 emergency declaration. Findings from the project inform
sociological theories regarding precarious work, job mobility, and the role of
governmental support in an epidemiological natural disaster. Findings also
inform theories regarding differential access to the U.S. employment social
safety net and the impact of high levels of governmental financial support
during a crisis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
