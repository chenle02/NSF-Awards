The project focuses on the conjectural relations between certain arithmetic
invariants attached to Galois representations, in particular the cohomological
invariants called Selmer groups, and the order of vanishing at integers of
either the L-functions, or the p-adic L-functions attached to those Galois
representations. The main objective is to prove that the rank of the Selmer
group of a Galois representation attached to an automorphic form for a unitary
group is at least equal to the order of vanishing at 0 of the corresponding
p-adic L-function (one actually expects that the equality holds). The strategy
consists in a study of the geometry of the eigenvariety, which is the universal
family of automorphic forms, at a point attached to the given Galois
representation, and in the construction of a family of p-adic L-functions on
that eigenvariety. The project has an other aspect, which consists in
reformulating and generalizing the conjectures relating p-adic L-functions and
Galois cohomology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the automorphic methods used in
this project are very promising, it is not expected that they alone will solve
the vast array of conjectures and questions concerning the relations between
p-adic L-functions and Galois cohomology. Many tools and ideas from various
parts of mathematics will be needed to do so. One of the aims of the PI in
reformulating those conjectures is to separate more clearly what part can be
done with which methods or combination of methods, and to foster a greater
involvement of mathematicians in other areas (e.g., theory of transcendence) in
the work on those conjectures.
