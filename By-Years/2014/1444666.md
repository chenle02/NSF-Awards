"Big Data" has emerged as a new approach to computing that is transforming
science, engineering, medicine, health care, finance, business, and ultimately
society itself. The IEEE International Conference on Big Data 2014 (IEEE BigData
2014) provides a leadin forum for disseminating the latest research in big data
research, development, and applications. The conference will take place in the
Washington, D.C. area from October 27-30, 2014 in Washington, D.C. The PC co-
chairs are Jimmy Lin (University of Maryland) and Jian Pei (Simon Fraser
University). This award will help support travel of Ph.D. students at U.S.
universities who are primary authors on full papers that have been accepted to
the technical program or are participating in the doctoral student
symposium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference solicits high-quality original
research papers in any aspect of big data, including infrastructure, management,
search and mining, security and privacy, and applications. Contributions will
advance the state of the art in techniques, algorithms, and
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For further information see the conference
