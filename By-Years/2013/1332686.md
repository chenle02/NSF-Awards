Stanford University will bring together faculty and researchers for a series of
workshops to assess the potential for (1) expanding the number of researchers
and specifically PhD students in Computer Science education research; and (2)
establishing the legitimacy of computer science education research as a research
discipline within CS departments at research-oriented schools. The first
workshop will identify key research directions in computing education drawing
from other STEM education disciplines. The second workshop will address the many
concerns of how Computer Science education research can effectively be housed
with CS departments.
