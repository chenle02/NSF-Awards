We propose to investigate the massive dolomitization of an Upper Miocene reef
complex cropping out in excellent three- dimensional exposures near Nijar,
southeastern Spain. This proposal is a renewal for an ongoing project focussing
on regional dolomitization of Upper Miocene reefs in Spain, previous work having
studied reefs in Mallorca (Balearic Islands). Work in Mallorca has narrowly
constrained age of dolomitization, and field, petrographic, geochemical
modelling approaches have yielded a model which invokes dolomitization of
Messinian reefs by evaporitic basinal brines that formed as a result of the late
Messinian "salinity crisis". A prime objective of the Nijar project is to test
the regional applicability of this model, by mapping dolomite and dolomite type
distributions within the context of the sequence stratigraphy, and by applying
petrographic, geochemical (C, O, Sr isotopes; Ca, Mg, Na, Cl, SO4, Sr, Fe, Mn,
Al, K abundances), and quantitative modelling approaches. Preliminary field and
petrographic work at Nijar has shown similarities in sequence stratigraphy and
dolomite fabrics to those in Las Negras (about 20kms away), and in Mallorca. The
Nijar project will also test other dolomitization models involving meteoric and
normal seawater.
