This University/Industry Center for Computer-Aided Process Engineering conducts
research leading to effective computer-aided process engineering through data
management and user interfaces to integrate application programs. The Center
will outline generic engineering design systems, specify functional requirements
and rank necessity of the components, and develop data models, namely, the
relationship between the entities, and a prototype data dictionary for process
engineering compatible with the needs of project and design engineering.
Additionally, it will develop easy-to-use tools for integrating application
programs, databases, and building user-friendly interfaces; explore requirements
through the application of expert systems programs and concepts to data
management in chemical engineering process design; identify and explore issues
of multi-databases in an environment of distributed computers with emphasis on
data change control; and survey existing systems, including hardware, for
database management systems and requirements (including non-engineering systems)
and identify pros and cons of adequacy.
