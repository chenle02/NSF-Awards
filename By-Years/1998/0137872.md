"Active Chemistry" is a modular, one year, stand-alone, inquiry-based, secondary
school chemistry course. It is modeled in design and pedagogical strategies on
"Active Physics" and is meant to follow it or to be used in conjunction with it
to become a physical science course. "Active Chemistry" is aligned with the
National Science Education Standards and State Frameworks that directs all
students, grades 9-12, to learn the science necessary to solve real-world
problems. The four chapters on Sports Science and Health, Environmental Issues,
Entertainment, and Energy contain three modules. Each module includes a chapter
challenge, a scenario, activities, and a final project assignment. Students work
together in groups to acquire the knowledge needed to address the challenge.
Chemical concepts are introduced on a need to know basis and topics reappear in
various chapters providing multiple exposures in different contexts. The teacher
resources provide a scope and sequence presented in matrix format with unifying
and fundamental concepts identified, suggested instructional strategies and
techniques, and other resources including precautions on safety issues,
equipment lists and assessment tools. A professional development video for one
chapter is provided.&lt;br/&gt;
