Computer Science (31)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project unifies the artificial
intelligence (AI) course around the theme of machine learning and creates a
framework for core AI concepts around that theme. This is adapted from NSF-
funded work at the University of Central Florida. The project develops and tests
an adaptable framework to present core AI topics that emphasizes the
relationship between AI and computer science in general. It is producing a
laboratory manual that presents a suite of projects that can be closely
integrated into a one-term AI course. The project involves faculty from three
schools, and an additional 21 institutions have committed to using the results
of this project when it is complete.
