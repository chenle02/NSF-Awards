This award supports participation by early-career US-based researchers in a
high-profile international meeting on set theory to be held July 3-7, 2017 under
the auspices of the European Set Theory Society, in the Alfred Renyi Institute
Budapest. This meeting, the 6th European Set Theory Society Conference, provides
opportunities for early-career researchers to interact with experts in the
field, to attend tutorials on recent techniques, and to hear reports of the
latest research being undertaken. The homepage of the meeting is:

Advances in the recent decade in set theory have been rapid. New techniques in
previously impenetrable areas have exposed interplay between the prima facie
disparate areas of forcing axioms, infinite cardinal combinatorics, and inner
model theory. Although there have been some tremendous progress on the core
problems of set theory, still some fundamental problems remain a mystery. The
scope of the conference will include: the theory of definable actions of Polish
groups, the structure and classification of their orbit spaces, the closely
related study of definable equivalence relations and complete classification
problems (in model theory, computability theory, groups representations,
topological dynamics, ergodic theory, operator algebras, and combinatorics),
advances in the study of PCF theory, cardinal arithmetic, the determination of
the consistency strength of combinatorial principles, and application to other
fields of mathematics.
