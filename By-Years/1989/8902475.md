This research focuses on a collaborative experiment amongst eight institutions,
Fermilab fixed target experiment, E687. This experiment studies the production
of c and b quarks by gamma rays on nuclei. The initial data collection run for
E687 was completed in February 1988 and a second run will begin at the end of
1989. E687 is considered to be one of the most important experiments now at
Fermilab and the proposers play a major roles in all aspects of E687. The
proposers will continue to take the leadership role in the scintillating fiber
target (active target) for E687, a new method for measuring heavy quark decays.
Limited work will also be carried out in light quark/gluon spectroscopy at
Brookhaven National Laboratory and in initial preparations for experiments at
the Superconducting Super Collider, SSC. The field of research is that of
experimental elementary particle physics. This research studies the basic
building blocks of matter (e.g., electrons, positrons, quarks and weak bosons)
at very high energies. The experiments use accelerators and colliders which
provide the highest energy particles made in the laboratory. The data is
collected and analyzed using highly complex and sophisticated apparatus and
techniques.
