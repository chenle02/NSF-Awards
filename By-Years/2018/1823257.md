Technology that can create compelling immersive virtual environments is now
available on the general market. However, this technology has limitations.
Important frontiers for virtual environments need high quality tracking
equipment. One of these frontiers is the ability to build characters that move
accurately in a virtual environment. A second frontier is the ability to explore
large virtual environments using methods that seem natural. Our goal is to
tailor these methods to the individual user. This research proposal will equip a
lab with instrumentation that will make fundamental advances on these two
problems. It will also train graduate students and provide research
opportunities for a number of undergraduates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research
will equip a laboratory with a high quality motion capture system that will
allow the pursuit of novel scientific questions involving the perceptual
fidelity of virtual environments, examine theoretical questions involving users
and their relationship to their self-avatars, and determine how individual
differences in users can be effectively utilized to provide better locomotion
and navigation in virtual worlds. In particular, this equipment will enable
research in how to design high fidelity virtual environments, and enable the
understanding of the components of fidelity that facilitate learning and
transfer of training, for which self-avatars are a critical component. Likewise,
the equipment will enable significant progress in locomotion methods for
improved navigation and wayfinding in large virtual environments by allowing
examination of how spatial information sources are used by individuals as they
move through virtual worlds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
