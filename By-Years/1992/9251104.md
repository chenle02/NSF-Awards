A flexible data acquisition and control system is used for undergraduate
instruction and projects in a thermodynamics and fluid mechanics laboratory. The
system consists of four IBM PC-compatible computers, each equipped with an
internal data acquisition board and a hard disk on which reside several
compilers and a programmable graphing and data analysis package. Two of the
machines are laptop (portable) computers and two are 386-based desktop
computers. Laboratories currently included in the engineering curriculum will be
revised to incorporate real-time data acquisition, graphing, and data analysis
using the computers. These laboratories include the analysis of combustion
engines, heat pumps, wind tunnel measurements, solar energy collection, heat
transfer studies, soils analysis, and investigations of liquid flow systems. The
equipment also has the capability of producing output control signals that can
adjust in real time the physical parameters of processes under investigation.
