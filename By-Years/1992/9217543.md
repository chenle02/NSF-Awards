This US-Argentina Cooperative Science award supports the collaboration of Hugo
Ernst of the Georgia Institute of Technology and Eduardo Asta of the National
Technological University in Argentina. The project aims to better understand the
phenomenon of crack growth in the presence of extensive plasticity, using
nonlinear fracture mechanics methods. The researchers seek to improve methods of
fracture toughness tests, study proposed parameters for toughness
characterization and their limitations, assess effects of specimen size and
constraint, describe fracture past the fracture mechanics regime, and determine
relations between microstructural characteristics and mechanical properties. The
project will be comprised of testing, analysis of experimental data, and
analytical studies. Two Argentine groups besides Asta's will participate: one
led by Dario Jinchuk of the Institute for Nondestructive Evaluation, the other
by Juan Perez Ipina of the University of Comahue. The Argentine side will
benefit from exchange with US researchers working at the frontier of fracture
mechanics methodology. The US side will gain knowledge about the application of
fracture mechanics methods and access to large experimental data banks that are
increasingly expensive to obtain in the US. Both sides will accrue expertise in
structural reliability under severe loadings, causing crack growth under elastic
plastic conditions.
