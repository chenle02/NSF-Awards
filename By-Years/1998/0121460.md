This project is developing a lightweight infrastructure for deploying workflow
services into digital libraries that can be tailored to meet users' unique
needs. Such workflow requirements typically involve multiple stakeholders
distributed across different organizations who must coordinate their actions.
Recent advances in event messaging systems, hypermedia, and Web-based
technologies (such as XML), are being used to create a lightweight workflow
technology to help the stakeholders of a digital library coordinate their shared
activities. The technology is being designed to support a low entry barrier to
use, multiple computing platforms, and a certain level of autonomy to the
individual organizations that adopt it. Evaluation of the project's techniques
and technology is being undertaken using the workflow processes of three "real-
world" digital libraries: the Web Portal to the Scientific Computing Division of
the National Center for Atmospheric Research, the JESSE electronic journal,
associated with the Digital Library for Earth System Education, and the JIME
electronic journal.&lt;br/&gt;
