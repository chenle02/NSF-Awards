The collision and accretion of allochthonous terranes dominates the Mesozoic
and Cenozoic history of the Pacific Northwest and Alaska. The largest terrane to
dock was the amalgamated terrane sometimes referred to as "Baja British
Columbia", so-called because included terranes such as Wrangellia have apparent
primary Paleomagnetic vectors indicating low latitudes. However, available data
from another included terrane (Alexander terrane) indicates no latitudinal
movement since the late Triassic. As Alexander terrane lies to the south of
Wrangellia, a severe spatial and timing problem exists. This project will
attempt to resolve the paradox by extensive paleomagnetic analysis of sample
collections from these terranes, including removal of overprints and
determination of ages by 40Ar/39Ar techniques. Results offer the potential to
resolve the tectonic sequence of assembly of the Pacific north- west terranes.
