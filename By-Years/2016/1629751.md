A request is made to fund additional and back-up Shipboard Scientific Support
Equipment for the R/V Pelican, a 116 foot Coastal vessel operated by the
Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium (LUMCON) as part of the University-
National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet. The vessel is
owned by the LUMCON and the mission of the ship is to support funded science
research in the Gulf of Mexico. With this proposal, LUMCON provides technical
descriptions and rationale for the acquisition of the following
equipment:&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;1) Hawboldt SPRE-2244/RS Appendix A&amp;B
compliant CTD Winch $205,800&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;The
principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of
the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for
scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of
their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo
separate review by the relevant research program of NSF). The acquisition,
maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded
researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated
instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and
expanding the base of potential researchers.
