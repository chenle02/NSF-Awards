This grant will support the continuation of a study of the details of the
process of photoionization. By Measuring the energy and direction of
photoelectrons emitted when a well-defined quantum state of a molecule undergoes
photoionization, it will be possible to separate the various factors that
determine the interaction. This knowledge is basic to the understanding of many
chemical processes.
