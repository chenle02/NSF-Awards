In this research, a new technique (called Dynamic X-Ray Diffraction (DXRD) will
be developed to study reaction kinetics in solid systems. Ideally, kinetic
measurements should be done with techniques that are non-destructive, have low
energy flux requirements, and can be used continuously or with very rapid
repetition times compared to the half-life of the kinetic process. There are a
number of spectroscopic techniques that meet these requirements in gaseous or
liquid systems, but they usually work poorly, if at all, in solids. (An
exception are those methods depending on magnetic properties, but these are
limited to those few systems that show a change in type of magnetism present.)
