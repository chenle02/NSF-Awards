Plasmodium falciparum unexpectedly has two organelle-like genomes. One has
characteristics reminiscent of chloroplast DNAs while the other appears to be a
highly unusual mitochondrial genome. The putative mitochondrial genome is very
small and encodes small regions with homology to ribosomal RNA in a
discontinuous and scrambled manner. Conserved core regions are retained but
variable regions are largely absent. The characteristics of the rRNA fragments
suggest that they may be functional in ribosomes. This proposal is designed to
determine if the fragments are in fact in ribosomes and to assess some of the
characteristics of those ribosomes. The discontinuous rRNA fragments will be
mapped and compared to other rRNAs, looking for conserved structure-function
correlations. The presence of the discontinuous fragments in particles will be
evaluated and the general characteristics of such particles determined. The
subcellular location of the putative mitochondrial genome will be evaluated and
investigations of ribosome function will be initiated. %%% The unusual nature of
the discontinuous rRNAs suggests that understanding their role in ribosomes will
increase understanding of fundamental ribosomal functions.
