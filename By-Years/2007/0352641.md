The investigators will measure temporal variations in physical properties
(conductivity, temperature), nitrate concentration, pigment biomass and spectral
irradiance at the North Pole Environmental Observatory (NPEO) during 2004-2006.
Data will be acquired from moored sensors at two levels: 50 m (base of the
euphotic zone) and 100-120 m (disphotic zone). There is very little baseline
biological data from the central Arctic Ocean, and this research will provide an
important contribution.
