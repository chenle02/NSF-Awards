Brookdale Community College (BCC) is designing, implementing, and evaluating an
innovative pathway from cyber talent to cyber workforce. It includes a unique
public-private partnership that leverages the agility of community colleges and
the course material of the SANS Institute to develop a scalable, competition-
driven, hands-on education model that has a potential to help with the nation's
critical shortage of cybersecurity workforce. The project designs metrics to
identify individuals with the appropriate aptitude and expose them to vital, in-
depth, hands-on learning model focusing on defending computer systems and
networks. The project utilizes a multiphase competition-based model and, at each
stage, students compete to demonstrate their competence and to advance to the
next phase of the program. Students who successfully complete all components of
the program and demonstrate their mastery have the opportunity to apply for
residency positions where they can hone their skills working with practicing
security professionals on real-world projects. The proposed competition and
residency based model for developing the cybersecurity technical talent has a
real potential for dissemination and implementation in a large number of the
1,200 community colleges nationwide.
