An experimental study, modeling, and analysis of multicomponent adsorption in
adiabatic fixed-beds are being carried out. Dynamic nonequilibrium models are
developed and tested with the experimental data, which incorporate resistances
to heat and mass transfer encountered in real systems. The combined experimental
and modeling studies will increase the scientific understanding of the
interaction and propagation of heat and mass waves, their effects on
adsorptivity inversions, and overall column performance. The nonequilibrium
models may provide the basis for the development of procedures for the accurate
design, operation, and control of multicomponent adiabatic adsorption in fixed-
beds.
