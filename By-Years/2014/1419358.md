The goal of this project is to develop a lightweight infrastructure for
supporting hands-on network security education (NSE) and a compelling set of
exercises that rely on the infrastructure, covering the three basic aspects of
the security: attack, analysis, and defense. Historically, building realistic
Cybersecurity exercises has been both a laborious and resource-intensive task.
Over the course of a semester, the number of virtual machines (VM) and snapshots
on the server can easily become hundreds or thousands, which imposes serious
maintenance overhead on the instructor and systems administration staff Finally,
once created, the VMs are relatively large and are not easily shareable across
the Internet, thereby effectively limiting the exchange of materials among
educators. The project proposes a solution to fundamentally change how
Cybersecurity exercises are created and delivered by creating a flexible
Cybersecurity education infrastructure based on lightweight virtualization
containers. The Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program funds proposals
that address Cybersecurity from a Trustworthy Computing Systems perspective; a
Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences perspective; and proposals focusing
entirely on Cybersecurity Education.

The broader impacts of the project include vastly increasing the availability of
tested, applied Cybersecurity exercises while reducing the need for complex and
hard-to-manage hardware environments, allowing instructors to focus on course
content and pedagogy rather than on system administration. It proposes to
leverage Linux container technology and the docker tool that facilitates
container use. It proposes to create two seed instances: secure programming via
SQL injections; and network defense via data exfiltration. These two pre-loaded
instances can be used as lab exercises or as examples of how to use this
architecture.
