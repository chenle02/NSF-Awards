IBN: 9634357 PI: Niebur In order to avoid information overload, by far the
largest part of the input to our sensory organs has to be discarded by the
brain, and only carefully selected parts are allowed to influence behavior and
to reach long-term memory. This process is called selective attention and it is
the focus of intense research in psychology, neurobiology and the computational
sciences. In this project, we will design and test analog VLSI chips which
implement neurobiologically plausible models of the attentional selection
process that we have developed previously. The system will be tested on standard
visual search paradigms as used routinely in psychological experiments with
monkey and human subjects. Building such "neuromorphic" devices is expected to
greatly benefit the understanding of biological perception since the designer of
a working and robust system has to overcome, and thus to understand, many of the
same functional constraints biological systems are faced with (noise, limited
connection possibilities etc). Also machine vision should benefit significantly
from this work since technical image understanding systems will be confronted
with the same problem of information overload as biological organisms are, once
the still primitive stage of computer vision (compared to biological vision)
will be surpassed. -- Ernst Niebur, PhD Krieger Mind/Brain Institute Asst. Prof.
