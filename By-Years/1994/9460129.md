This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop the
Inductive Plasma Centrifuge (IPC) concept, a novel, high throughput approach for
separating elements of different atomic weights. Mass based separation, ranging
from the separation of heavy metal contaminated wastes to medical isotopes, is
an important problem encountered in environmental remediation activities and in
industry. A cost effective, high mass throughput separation method is needed.
Vacuum arc centrifuges, studied for medical isotope separation, are limited by
low mass throughput and high energy consumption, while gas centrifuges have
limited rotation velocities and small separative powers. The objective of the
proposed effort is to determine the feasibility of the IPC concept to overcome
these limitations. This objective will be addressed in Phase I by performing
three tasks: (1) design and assemble a small-scale IPC experiment; (2) perform
preliminary feasibility experiments at pressures of up to 1 torr in order to
demonstrate rotation frequencies of at least 105 radians/sec, and (3) develop
the conceptual design for a Phase II IPC laboratory prototype device. If
successful, this work will form a firm basis for comprehensive feasibility
demonstrations of the IPC concept in Phase II. This project is responsive to the
1994 Solicitation emphasis on National Critical Technologies in the areas of
Materials Synthesis and Processing, and Pollution Minimization and Remediation.
