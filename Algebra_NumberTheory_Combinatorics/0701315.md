The goal of the proposed project is to investigate some of the p-adic aspects of
the Langlands program. The Langlands program studies the interrelations between
several subjects, including the representation theory of reductive groups (both
over local fields and over the adeles of a global field), automorphic forms,
global Galois representations, and L-functions. Each of these subjects has a
p-adic aspect: one may consider p-adic or adelic groups acting on topological
p-adic vector spaces, p-adic automorphic forms (or their close cousins,
cohomology classes with p-adic coefficients on arithmetic quotients of symmetric
spaces), p-adic representations of Galois groups and their deformation theory,
and p-adic L-functions. The proposed investigation will encompass all these.
Some of the particular results expected to follow from this investigation are:
new results on the modularity of two-dimensional p-adic representations of the
absolute Galois group of the rational numbers, and the construction of several
variable p-adic L-functions attached to p-adic families of modular forms.

Number theory is the branch of mathematics that studies phenomena related to
properties of whole numbers. A typical number theoretic question is to determine
the number of whole number solutions of some equation of interest. The answers
to such questions can often be encoded in certain mathematical functions known
as L-functions. The mathematician Robert Langlands has developed a series of
conjectures (or mathematical predictions) regarding L-functions, which predict
that any L-function should arise from another kind of mathematical function
called an automorphic form. (Number theorists refer to Langlands conjectured
relationship between L-functions and automorphic forms as a ``reciprocity
law''.) Langlands developed an array of powerful representation theoretic
methods to study his conjectures. These are methods that exploit the many
symmetries of automorphic forms and L-functions to analyze their mathematical
properties; these methods have been incorporated into a body of mathematics
known as ``the Langlands program''. A more recent approach to the study of
automorphic forms and L-functions is the use of p-adic methods. These are
methods that involve using divisibility properties with respect to some fixed
prime number p to study the Taylor series coefficients of the automorphic forms
and L-functions. Recently, the representation theoretic methods and
p-adicmethods have begun to be unified into a so-called ``p-adic Langlands
program''. The proposer aims to develop new results and methods in the p-adic
Langlands program, to use them to establish new results about L-functions, and,
in particular, to establish new reciprocity laws.
