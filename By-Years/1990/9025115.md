The use of forward genetics to study development has given us profound insights
into how genes act to shape the body plan of a multicellular organism as it
develops from a fertilized egg. So far, however, this approach has only been
extremely successful with invertebrate organisms, particularly Drosophila. The
goal of the proposed research is to develop and apply genetic techniques to
identify genes that play critical roles in the early development of a vertebrate
animal, the zebrafish, Brachydanio rerio. Dr. Hopkins plans to mutagenize fish
and examine their progeny for developmentally interesting early mutants. She
will try to develop techniques for mutagenesis by DNA insertion so that mutated
genes can be cloned easily, however, she will also work towards, and will
probably begin screens, using gamma ray or chemical mutagenesis. The advantages
of the zebrafish for genetic analysis were recognized by Streisinger some years
ago, but only recently has the potential of the zebrafish for the genetic study
of early development begun to be widely recognized.
