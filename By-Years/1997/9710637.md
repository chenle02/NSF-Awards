*** 9710637 Dunn This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project
addresses the problems associated with current microelectronic lithography
systems which utilize masking technology. These problems include: the need for
multiple masks required for subsequent layers of an electronic module; the
difficulties associated with generating large-area masks; and the dependence on
foreign suppliers for mask substrates. The only available technology which does
not require masks is laser direct-write imaging which suffers from an inherently
slow speed due to it's bit-by-bit, serial mode of addressing. This project would
eliminate those short-comings through the development of a maskless, large-area,
high-throughput, high-resolution, lithography system which combines a Digital
Micromirror Device (DMD) with patterning technology. The DMD is a micro-
mechanical, spatial light modulator with high parallel-processing power which
replaces the conventional mask seamless scanning technology. It can generate any
possible pattern with high resolution over an unlimited area. The proposed
program will fill a critical need in the microelectronics manufacturing
industry, and also significantly increase U.S. competitiveness in an enabling
technology area. The composite market for maskless lithography systems comprise
four major application segments; flat-panel displays, (FPD's), multi-chip
modules (MCM's), printed circuit boards (PCB's), and semiconductor integrated
circuits (IC's). The total sales for these products exceeded $750 million in
1996 and is project to grow to over $1.5 billion in the 2002. ***
