The Proterozoic rocks in the western United States appears to consist of a
collage of terranes that accreted to a cratonic nucleus during successive
collisions. The boundaries between these packages are marked by intense
deformation and separate rocks of different histories, but due to later
overprints, are commonly difficult to detect and interpret. This project will
focus on Proterozoic boundaries well exposed in the Grand Canyon that preserve
excellent records of the path of deformation and metamorphism. It will
investigate plutons and pegmatite networks to define timing relationships and
will explore isotopic variations that can lead to understanding of the origins
the various crustal blocks. Results are expected to provide documentation of
several proterozoic tectonic boundaries and to develop a set of criteria for
boundary recognition in less-well exposed areas.
