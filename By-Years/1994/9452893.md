9452893 Gomez The Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research
(EPSCoR) in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico will enhance the research
competitiveness of approximately 50 university faculty working in three research
thrust areas. The selected research areas are: (1) Biotechnology; (2) Materials
Science; and (3) Science and Engineering Infrastructure. Each of the research
areas hate identified short, intermediate, and long range goals (up to the year
2000) and devised strategies to: achieve national and international levels of
excellence; strengthen human resources in science and technology; create
advisory councils of distinguished researchers to guide project development;
establish collaborative agreement with national and international groups and
laboratories; and vigorously seek additional funds to build on the base provided
by EPSCoR. Collaborative agreements have been made with the
Industry/University/Research Center, the Corporation for the Technological
Development of Tropical Resources, and the Puerto Rico Scientific Community
Council to promote and advocate for the strengthening of the Commonwealth's
science and engineering community and the development of R&amp;D in the private
and government sectors.
