This award will provide supplementary support to enable Dr. David Sprague of
Yale University to conduct collaborative research for one year with Dr.
Toshisada Nishida at Kyoto University in Japan. They will investigate the social
behavior and demography of Japanese Macaques on Yakushima Island, in order to
illuminate the process of mating across the boundaries of macaque troops, and
hence the social structure of this primate family generally. The processes by
which females initiate mating consorts with alien males will be observed, in
order to clarify the role of female choice in the mating success of these males
and the criteria by which females choose mating partners. Dr. Nishida and his
colleagues have developed a respected school of behavioral studies on the basis
of their experience with Japanese primates, and their approaches to the
explanation of primate behavior is somewhat different from, and therefore
refreshing to, those of western primatologists. Dr. Sprague has worked with his
Kyoto colleagues before and their experience will complement the expertise which
he has developed on this subject over the past eight years.
