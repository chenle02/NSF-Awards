9633958 Sheares The exploitation of the synthesis by the PI of a soluble
poly(p-phenylene) derivative is proposed for gas permeable membrane
applications. The first polymer of this class synthesized in our laboratory,
poly (2,5-benzophenone), is a thermally stable polymer as one would expect given
the rigid poly(phenylene) backbone. However, the material is also amorphous,
soluble, and film-forming. These results point to the potential for the
synthesis of a variety of processable, thermally stable polymers using a facile,
mild nickel catalyzed reaction. Additionally, the chemistry will allow the
freedom to vary the substituent polarity and chain packing density for the
purpose of studying fundamental structure/property relationships in polymeric
membranes. The ability to make systematic modifications in the polymer
sidegroups may lead to membranes with improved permeability and selectivity. The
effort is divided into two tasks: (1) synthesis and characterization of new
2,5-benzophenone and 2,5-diphenylsulfone-based polymers and (2) gas permeability
analysis and polymer modification. %%% This research will provide the basis for
new polymer synthesis aimed at novel gas-permeable membranes with potentially
improved permeability and selectivity for environmental applications. ***
