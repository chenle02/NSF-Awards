Present manipulator control technology comprises traditional
proportional/derivative and proportional/integral/derivative controllers. These
controllers are based on theory evolved over 30 years ago. They are easy to
implement and performance has been adequate although not optimum. Improved
controllers could provide optimal performance and substantially improved speed
and accuracy. Furthermore, problems associated with inertia variation, friction,
structural flexibility, and direct drive manipulators demand that improved
control techniques be evolved. This project addresses that task. It applies
advanced control theory to manipulator control. Specifically, adaptive control
ideas are brought to bear on manipulator control. Ultimately, these methods may
engender the improved control which industry will demand of future manipulators.
There are potential applications to other classes of machine control as well.
