A theory for the thermodynamic properties (solubilities, vapor pressures,
distribution coefficients) of ionic organic molecules is to be developed.
Experiments are performed to test its accuracy and limitations. The theory is to
be created from two existing, but unrelated theories, the Perturbed Anisotropic
Chain Theory (PACT) and the Restricted Primative Model (RPM). The PACT treats
molecular attractions (van der Waals forces, dipoles, quadrupoles, hydrogen
bonding) as perturbations about the hard sphere potential. It includes the
effects of rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom and hence can be used
for small, medium, or large molecules, including polymers. The Restricted
Primative Model allows the prediction of ion-ion interactions. By combining
these two theories, it is possible to predict accurately the properties of ionic
organic molecules (e.g., amino acids, alkanol amines) and ionic polymers
(proteins). Two kinds of experiments are performed using electrolytic systems:
vapor-liquid equilibria are measured for some systems and the other measures
liquid-liquid distribution coefficients.
