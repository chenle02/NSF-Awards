Concerns about ethical abuses in televised political advertising have grown
substantially as a result of developing video technology. This demonstration
project is designed to explore the development of criteria and coding
instruments for determining types of ethical abuses in technology for televised
political ads. A panel of experts in communication ethics will develop criteria
for identifying types of abuses. The criteria will be used to develop a coding
instrument to be applied to political spots and a small pilot project on a small
sample of actual spots will be conducted, to determine the usefulness and
workability of the coding instrument. The demonstration will also develop a
script for an educational videotape which would discuss the problem of political
ethics and technology, providing samples of misleading technological
applications and suggesting standards of evaluation. This project marks the
beginning of scholarly work on a topic of major importance on issues of
technology and democracy; results are likely to advance scholarly and public
understanding of the effects of media in political life. The investigator and
the expert panel are highly qualified; the research plan is good; the budget is
very reasonable; and the proposal is recommended for support with high priority.
