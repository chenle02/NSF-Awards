Narrative: Many of the useful products formed by microorganisms are known as
secondary metabolites since they are not required for the growth or primary
metabolism of the microbes. Antibiotics such as penicillin and cephalosporin C
are examples of secondary metabolites currently produced on a large scale.
Products from genetically altered organisms also resemble, for the most part,
secondary metabolites. Current production methods involve making the product in
individual batches. It would be more efficient to do this in a continuous manner
if good processing and separation steps could be developed. The use of
immobilized microorganisms (i.e., attaching the organisms to solid supports)
presents an attractive approach to continuous processing, and that is the focus
of the proposed research. This research will investigate the regulation of
secondary metabolite production by immobilized cells through controlling the
nutrient levels. Also, it is intended to study the effect of immobilization on
the stability of genetically altered microorganisms, as well as the effect on
altering the metabolism of attached cells. The results of the research should be
extremely useful in developing new continuous production processes for secondary
metabolites.
