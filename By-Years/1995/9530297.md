This project explores two aspects of discrete search:(a) The search for the
majority in the set of objects;(b) The search for critical points in an unknown
function.In both cases the main tools are detailed analyses of binary decision
trees and Kraft's inequality. The goals of the project include the design of,
analysis of and the proof of lower bounds for search algorithms. ***
