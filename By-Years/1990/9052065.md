This project has enabled the institution to acquire a General Electric OMEGA
300NB MNR instrument with various accessories. The acquisition was seen as
necessary for proper introduction of the underclass students to FT-NMR
techniques, and to allow upperclass students to perform various advanced
experiments. Most importantly, it was a necessary addition to the department's
arsenal of equipment to permit first-rate undergraduate research to proceed at a
reasonable pace. Research projects that will involve the new instrument include
photodimerization of tropone, synthesis of propellances and other strained
molecules, characterization of metalloenzyme models, investigation of shale- gas
interactions, and orientation studies in polymers. The institution has
contributed to the project an amount in excess of twice the NSF funds
