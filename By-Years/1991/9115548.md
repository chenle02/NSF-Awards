Research will be undertaken which will assist in the design of new materials
with desired physical properties. This research will be based on understanding
the factors which influence the structure and electronic properties of
electroactive polymers. The first part of the work deals with the "band
structure engineering" of electroactive polymers. This is made possible by a
combination of accurate total energy and gradient calculations first leading to
reliable predictions of the geometric structure which is not readily available
from experimental data. Based on the established structures, accurate band
structure predictions can be carried out. The effects of non-planarity, three-
dimensional, interactions and soliton lattices are taken into account.
Variations of chemical composition will be analyzed. In the second part of the
research, the vibrational spectra of conjugated polymers will be calculated. The
approach, which relies on empirical scaling calculations on monomers and dimers
but does not use empirical data from the polymer, should make experimental
infrared and Raman spectra much more useful in determining structural features
of a large class of important materials for which present structural data is
either incomplete or impossible to obtain. %%%
