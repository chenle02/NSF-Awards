Loss 9500840 This project focuses on problems in analysis originating in physics
that feature a strong interaction between nonlinear evolution equations and
optimization problems. Specifically this project concerns establishing and
applying sharp inequalities to obtain precise bounds on behavior and evolution
of the solutions of hydrodynamic and kinetic equations, and equations describing
collective phenomena such as the Ginzburg--Landau equation. In most of these
problems, the sharp inequalities come from optimization problems for which the
symmetry of the optimizers is a crucial issue. Several parts of the project are
aimed at the development of methods for establishing symmetry properties of
optimizers in cases, such as the Ginzburg--Landau problem, where the classical
rearrangement inequalities cannot be used. This project is focused on problems
in nonlinear analysis originating in physics and the applied sciences. Its
primary goal will be to discover and prove new theorems by exploiting the
interplay between nonlinear dynamics and optimization problems. This interaction
has been the source of much progress in the investigators' recent work, and the
project consists of concrete problems in which it is expected to be particularly
fruitful. ***
