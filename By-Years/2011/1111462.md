This award in the Chemistry of Life Processes (CLP) program supports work by
Professor Michael Maroney at the University of Massachusetts to carry out
fundamental studies of the mechanism of superoxide disproportionation catalyzed
by nickel-dependent superoxide dismutase, an enzyme found in bacteria. Nickel
superoxide dismutases (NiSODs) represent a novel approach to the elimination of
superoxide in biological systems, and thus contribute to the biodiversity of
mechanisms for oxygen detoxification. Other nickel metalloenzymes play critical
roles in microbial redox catalysis, including hydrogen utilization
(hydrogenases), methane production (methylcoenzyme M reductase), and CO/CO2
chemistry (carbon monoxide dehydrogenase and acetylcoenzyme A synthase), and are
thus important catalysts in energy science.

The study of NiSOD will contribute to our understanding of redox catalysis by
biological nickel sites via examination the only redox nickel enzyme
characterized to date that contains no other cofactors, and thus offers a clear
spectroscopic view of the chemistry involved. These studies, which use a
multidisciplinary approach involving molecular biological and spectroscopic
techniques, will contribute to our knowledge of the design of redox centers for
catalysis that will contribute to synthetic systems for hydrogen
production/utilization and CO2 reduction.
