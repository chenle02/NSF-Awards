9624081 Koseff This project will complete development and testing of laboratory
techniques for measuring the mixing efficiency of breaking interfacial
(internal) waves, evaluate methods for estimating the mass flux by measuring the
flux directly and measuring the small- scale structure of the turbulence, and
study the evolution of the turbulence created by the breaking wave. The specific
techniques to be tested are a Digital Particle Tracking Velocimeter (DPTV) and
Laser-Induced Fluorescence (LIF), which yield data in a plane rather than at a
single point. In addition, a novel technique for generating a breaking
interfacial wave at a specified (and fixed) location will be attempted. ***
