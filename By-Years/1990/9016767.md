The major goal of this project is to develop a computer program to model the
cognitive processes involved in forming impressions of candidates for political
office. The program will be a model of the researchers' theory of cognition and
evaluation and will account for what information is attended to, how the
information is stored in memory and retrieved, and how available information is
integrated into a summary evaluation of candidates. Current theories of voting
make unrealistic assumptions about cognition in candidate evaluation and do not
subject their assumptions to rigorous testing. A large empirical study by one of
the researchers will provide the information on citizen candidate evaluation
that can be used in testing the theory about cognition and candidate evaluation.
