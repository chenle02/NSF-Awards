The role of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the benthic carbon cycle of the
deep sea will be defined by determining both the pore water concentration and
the benthic flux of DOC. Six stations will be visited along a transect from
Woods Hole MA, to Bermuda. Carbon isotopic composition will be determined for
pore water DOC and the DOC flux. These measurements together with the results of
a separately funded study of organic matter decomposition and calcium carbonated
dissolution at the same sites, will yield the first complete mass and isotopic
budgets for carbon at the sea floor. In addition to providing the first
quantitative estimate of DOC fluxes out of the sediments, these results are
expected to (1) resolve an outstanding imbalance in present benthic stable
isotope budgets, (2) constrain the role of bottom water carbonate ion in the
neutralization of metabolic acids, and (3) help to define the source of food for
the benthos.
