The global internet traffic is aggressively increasing at an enormous rate,
posing significant challenges to modern network protocol design. In addition,
multimedia has become the "biggest big data" running through the last mile of
wireless access networks, such as video on demand, cloud-based video games, and
social media video sharing. This project explores potential solutions to support
such big volumes of multimedia traffic over resource-constrained wireless access
networks. In particular, this project investigates new approaches to improve
quality of experience (QoE) for multimedia users by employing high level
economic theories, orchestrating low level communication resources, and
exploring selfish user behaviors among neighboring
devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to test the hypothesis
that the wireless big data multimedia communication challenge could be partially
solved by leveraging a new concept of smart media pricing to transform the
wireless resource allocation from rate-distortion fashion to price-distortion
fashion. This project pursues two coherent thrusts beyond traditional resource
allocation: (1) creating a non-uniform quality-driven smart multimedia pricing
model to assign different prices to multimedia packet groups with different
quality contributions and decoding influences, and thus leveraging price as a
new dimension in resource allocation; (2) designing a profit-driven cache
delegation protocol to improve multimedia quality through offloading, and thus
encouraging users to scavenge recently cached media contents from neighboring
devices. The models, algorithms and protocols developed through this project
could possibly identify new frontiers of pricing policy design in wireless
multimedia resource allocation research. Research findings will be integrated to
education curriculum and student advising, to broaden students' future career
potentials and contribute to the U.S. workforce preparation.
