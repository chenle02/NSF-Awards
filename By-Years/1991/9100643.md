The Mechanical Engineering Department of the University of Minnesota, Institute
of Technology has a program of summer research in mechanical engineering for
science and engineering undergraduates. Fifteen students (seven from ME, eight
from other schools) participate in the program. Applicants for the program are
asked to submit transcripts, letters of recommendation, and an essay.
Participants are selected by a panel of faculty members. The program starts with
an orientation in which research projects and facilities are described.
Participants are asked to select a project on which to work from a group of
twenty ongoing research programs in Mechanical Engineering. A faculty supervisor
monitors the progress of each student. Students are given increasing
responsibilities as their skills develop. Students are asked to attend biweekly
seminars which explore current research areas in Mechanical Engineering. The
students live on campus in dormitories close to one another so that they may
share their research experiences. An informal social program is organized. At
the end of the summer, students are asked to prepare oral and written reports on
their research activities. An attempt is made to find on-campus research jobs
for students who do well in the program.
