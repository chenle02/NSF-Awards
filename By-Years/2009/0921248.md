Thousands of watershed groups or partnerships have emerged across the United
States to protect water resources and improve water quality. Many of these
watershed groups have been unsustainable due to lack of funding, ineffective
leadership, and failure to incorporate local ecological knowledge and risk
perception into their decision making processes. This research focuses on the
role of local ecological knowledge and risk perception in watershed management.
Both parameters can inform decision makers about local ecological, social, and
political contexts, essential for constructing management schemes that promote
sustainable development and community wellbeing. Using a study site in southern
Illinois, the study will: (a) delineate watershed partnership stakeholders'
conceptions of their watershed risk context; (b) explore stakeholders'
perceptions of water quality risks and determine if they have shared and
integrated perceptions of risk; and (c)characterize the nature of the
relationship between local ecological knowledge and risk perception and how this
relationship is influenced by the watershed risk context.
