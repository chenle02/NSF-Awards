The investigators propose to study novice teachers' development of mathematical
knowledge for teaching and the influence that previous preparation, school
context, and opportunities to learn-on-the-job have on that knowledge. The
project as supported represents a planning and development study that may lead
to a larger cross-national study. The investigators will develop surveys of
teachers, a sample framework, unique survey methodologies required, and will
enlist country participation. The contributions of the planning and development
phase will include sampling methodology and survey instrumentation that can be
used in other contexts.

The larger project as envisioned will survey six representative and independent
samples of teachers with zero to five years of teaching experience in the U.S.
and in three to five other high achieving countries. The work builds upon a
successful, existing award to the investigators--the Teacher Education
Development Study (TEDS-M)--that is examining the math knowledge of
undergraduate students who are preparing to teach math.

As a result, the proposed study is the next logical step in this program of
research and will tell us more about how U.S. teachers compare with teachers of
other countries in terms of their mathematical knowledge and mathematical
knowledge for teaching.
