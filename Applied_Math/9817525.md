This proposal is on nonlinear analysis with an emphasis on applied mathematics
problems in material science and financial mathematics. Particular applications
in material science include modeling grain boundaries, super cooled
solidification, and superconductivity. In financial mathematics, applications
include pricing contingent claims in incomplete markets and consumption-
investment problems. As an analytical tool, the PI proposes to develop a theory
of bounded variation to suitable for vector-valued functions. This theory of
functions of type BnV may have a wide impact in real analysis. In financial
mathematics, the PI will look at problems with portfolio constraints,
transaction costs, and models with stocastic volatility.

The sophisticated mathematical models arising in the study of new materials and
in financial transactions require new methods of mathematics to show that the
models are consistent with reality and give reasonable results. The PI will be
investigating new methods of analysis to apply to such problems as
superconducting materials and financial models of derivative transactions
