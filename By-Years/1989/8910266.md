The objective of this research is to develop in detail and demonstrate an
improved method for automatically identifying the concepts present in a natural
language text, which goes beyond categorization and is able to identify relevant
relationships and propositions. Robust methods for text analysis based on
pattern matching have shown some success in topic categorization, and have been
applied to recognition of concepts as well, with mixed results. In contrast,
systems that analyze text at deeper levels have very limited ability to deal
with text that cannot be completely parsed and interpreted. In this project, a
method is pursued for achieving greater accuracy and depth of conceptual
analysis without sacrificing robustness. The basic idea of the method is to
analyze the text syntactically producing a chart structure, and then apply
pattern matching to the arcs of the chart rather than to the raw text. If
successful this method will represent a major innovation in practical processing
of natural language. It will lead to more powerful and precise methods for
document classification. It will also provide a critical (and so far absent)
component of systems for intelligent information retrieval.
