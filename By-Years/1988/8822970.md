Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
available to the chemist for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It
is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions of molecules
in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to
chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The Department of Chemistry at
the University of Iowa will use this award from the Chemistry Shared
Instrumentation Program to help acquire a high-field NMR spectrometer. The areas
of research that will be enhanced by the acquisition include the following: 1)
Organofluorine chemistry 2) Novel natural products from fungi 3) Synthesis,
spectroscopy and novel reactivity of metalloporphyrin compounds 4) Synthesis and
chemistry of reactive organometallic complexes 5) Polymer synthesis and
transition metal catalyzed organic reactions 6) Synthetic organic and natural
products chemistry.
