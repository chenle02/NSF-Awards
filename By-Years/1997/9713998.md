*** CMS-9713998 Panoskaltsis An interdisciplinary program will study the
fabrication and mechanical properties of shape memory alloys (SMA) with emphasis
on thin films. Such films have applications to microelectromechanical systems
(MEMS); SMA have been shown to be the actuation method with the largest energy
density when compared to other micro actuation methods. Thus, the development of
rational design procedures for SMA microactuators is needed if the potential of
SMA in MEMS is to be realized. To develop such a design procedure we propose the
following five major tasks: Task 1: Development of measurement methods for thin
film SMA. Task 2: Development of processing/property relationship for thin film
SMA. Task 3: Development of constitutive relations for SMA. Task 4: Development
of design tools and material data base. We seek to provide a sound mechanics
base for SMA actuators MEMS devices. In addition, we seek to provide a sound
materials science base relating processing parameters to SMA microstructures and
SNM microstructures to mechanical behavior. Our overall aim is to develop
complete design tools for the use of SMA in MEMS devices.***
