Research on a novel processing technology to produce sheet materials from bulk
solids is proposed. The objective is to develop a means to produce high quality,
low cost silicon ribbon. This new technology when developed will reduce the cost
of silicon wafer production. Current silicon wafer production from Czochralski
grown crystals wastes, through sawing, lapping and polishing operations, up to
70% of the as grown crystal which represents a billion dollar loss world wide.
Success of the new process will produce single crystal silicon ribbons of
semiconductor quality with a three fold reduction in cost and no more than a 10%
waste of crystal material. The new technology will be energy efficient and
applicable to electronic materials, glasses and ceramics. The innovative use of
thermal and electrical gradients to control steady crystal growth is a principal
feature of this research. The research will provide data and control parameters
necessary for process automation in Phase II. Improved insight for the
processing of other materials of commercial or scientific interest will result.
