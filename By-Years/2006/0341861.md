This project will extend an existing chain of ground-based magnetometers (SAMBA
= South American Meridional B-field Array) into Antarctica. Two additional
magnetometers will be emplaced, one at Palmer, a year-round U.S. station, and
the other at Patriot Hills, a more remote Chilean summer-only station. The
installation at Patriot Hills will be done with the logistical support of the
Chilean Antarctic Institute. The scientific goals of the expanded array are to
increase the spatial resolution of existing cusp-to-cusp chains, to extend the
number of conjugate pairs of stations between the northern and southern
hemisphere thus increasing the size of the inner magnetospheric region that can
be remotely monitored from the two hemispheres, and to establish an auroral
latitude station conjugate to the Canadian Poste de la Baleine station in order
to study conjugate differences of substorms and general auroral activity.
