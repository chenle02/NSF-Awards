Nematodes are a group of unsegmented roundworms that can parasitize plants.
Their simple morphology increases the difficulty of classifying them and of
unravelling their evolutionary history. Dr. Virgina Ferris, a leading specialist
on the systematics of nematodes, proposes to learn DNA mapping and sequencing
and then apply these techniques to nematode systematics. Dr. Ferris' previous
work using nematode morphology revealed some widely cited biogeographic patterns
that are consistent with the history of continental drift. In order to test the
patterns of descent suggested by morphology, the PI pioneered the use of enzyme
electrophoretic analysis in nematode research. The infusion of new enzyme data
from her lab has provided insight into morphological convergence between
distantly related taxa. Dr. Ferris' intention to master molecular techniques
represents a new level of sophistication for nematode systematics. Using data
from morphology, enzymes, and DNA, Dr. Ferris will have unique insight into the
evolution of the nematodes, and she will be setting a new standard for
invertebrate systematics.
