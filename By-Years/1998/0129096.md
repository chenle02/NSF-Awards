&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal

Park&lt;br/&gt;SGER - 3-D Sight Distance Computation&lt;br/&gt;August 1,
2001&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI proposes exploratory research aimed
at solving a perpetual transportation design problem - the automated and
efficient measurement of available sight distance for three-dimensional highway
alignments. This is an important problem in its own right because of the growing
need to automate design feasibility test and evaluation for highways due to
workforce reductions. Automation is thwarted by the computational complexity of
the problems. If successful, research the results will be a more efficient
algorithmic to the sight distance problem and improved highway design
evaluation, selection and safety. This will have a significant impact on the
transportation community, including universities, public and private agencies
such as roadway construction and maintenance, traffic operations, safety.
Additionally the mathematical framework required to solve the problem can
support a number of other investigations, such as clear zone widths, passing
lane demarcations, etc.&lt;br/&gt;
