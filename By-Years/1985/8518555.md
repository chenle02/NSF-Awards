The optical characteristics of the halogen and metal compounds are being
investigated--such as SiF;i4, SiH;i4, CF;i4, AsF;i3, AsH;i3, XeF;i2, HF, F;i2,
CI;i2, SF;i6, Ga;i2H;i6, As(CH;i3);i3, and As(C;i2H;i5);i3--which are used in
the photoetching and photodeposition processes of microelectronics fabrication.
This study measures the photo adsorption, photonionization, photodissociation,
and laser-induced fluorescence cross sections of the halogen and metal-halide
compounds mentioned above. Intense light sources, such as synchrotron radiation,
excimer lasers, YAG laser, dye lasers, and condensed-discharge lamps, are used
to study the optical properties of the halogen and metal compounds in great
detail. The optical spectroscopic approach is used to investigate enhanced
surface reactions and light emission, including chemiluminescence using lasers.
