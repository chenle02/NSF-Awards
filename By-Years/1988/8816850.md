This project will continue detailed geochemical and petrological studies of
Mauna Loan lavas on the island of Hawaii. Previous work has produced a
comprehensive model for Mauna Loa's magmatic system, showing that it is markedly
different from that of neighboring Kilauea volcano. This project will build on
that work, testing these ideas and developing them further through study of
specific problems. These will include: a) detailed geochemical and mineralogical
studies of picritic lavas and the extensive 1859 flow because it is thought
these could contain information on the nature of the parental magmas that supply
the volcano; b: study the long-term secular variation in lava composition,
emphasizing trace element and isotopic chemistry in order to evaluate possible
changes in source composition ov the last 30,000 years; c) provide detailed
glass and mineral chemistry for all major historic eruptions, integrating this
with exisiting geochemical data in order to test and refine the magmatic model;
d0 through geochemical analysis of stratigraphically controlled prehistoric
Kilauean lavas, follow up on a recent discovery which suggests that, previous
geochemical evidence to the contrary, Mauna Loa and Kilauea may be magmatically
interrelated.
