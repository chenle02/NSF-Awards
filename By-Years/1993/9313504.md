Taylor The University of Louisville s Department of Biology occupies the Life
Sciences Building, which was built in the 1960s when the institution s focus was
on teaching rather than research. As a result, the subsequent increase in
research activity by the faculty and students in the department has been
hampered by the building s configuration and support systems, which were built
to serve classroom and teaching lab functions. The University plans to renovate
a portion of the basement of the Life Sciences Building to accommodate modern
research in microbiology and molecular biology. The area will be reconfigured
for group research, including undergraduate and graduate students, and building
systems (fume hoods, lighting, plumbing, electrical, and ventilation) will be
modernized. Walk-in growth chambers will be installed to support research and
research training in microbiology. The renovation will resolve safety issues
stemming from the use of hazardous materials and will create environments
suitable for state-of-the-art research instruments. Overall research
productivity of the department will increase as a result of the renovation.
Reconfiguring the area will increase the number of students who can take part in
faculty research, and as a result a greater number of students will be attracted
to scientific careers.
