Mathematical Physics is a vibrant area which deals with the mathematical
analysis of problems motivated by physics. It has enriched many disciplines in
Mathematics, and has made lasting contributions to various areas of Physics. The
Congress of the International Association of Mathematical Physics (IAMP) is a
primary conference for Mathematical Physicists and is well attended by
participants from around the world. It provides a unique opportunity for not
only learning about the most recent advances in the field, but also for engaging
in detailed discussions about significant developments and open problems in
related areas with the world leaders in mathematical physics. This travel grant
will enable young American researchers to attend the forthcoming IAMP Congress
this summer in Leipzig, Germany. Without funding these young scientists and
graduate students would not be able to participate in this important Congress.
