9452848 Taylor This three year project is to establish a network of students,
teachers, researchers and volunteers to investigate various aspects of the
monarch butterfly migration phenomenon. A curriculum is proposed that will
encompass the biology of monarchs, the migration research and experimental,
hands on activities along with authentic research for children in grades K-12.
Two groups, each of which includes numerous classroom teachers are engaged in
developing the curriculum; Dr. Karen Oberhauser and her team at the University
of Minnesota will develop activities and materials appropriate to the lower
grades and Dr. Orley Taylor and Mr. Brad Williamson at the University of Kansas
will develop activities and materials appropriate for secondary level students.
Project dissemination will be by the Internet and professional meetings. End
products of this project include a Monarch Handbook and supporting instructional
videotapes.
