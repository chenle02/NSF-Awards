This project is the initial development of an in-site sensor package designed to
quantify spatial and temporal variations of environmental parameters within
submarine hydrothermal systems. A prototype sensor will be developed that
includes a titanium-sheathed, porous, multi-chambered prove that will allow in-
site recording of temperature within the interior of active submarine
hydrothermal sulfide chimneys. The ultimate goal is to explore the actual limits
to life in vent systems and to define the conditions under which different
species or consortia thrive, survive, or expire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
