This research deals with the problems of designing and building practical,
custom VLSI-based computers for lattice calculations. These computational
problems are characterized by being iterative, defined on a regular lattice of
points, uniform in space and time, local, and relatively simple. Examples
include numerical solution of differential equations, iterative image
processing, and cellular automata. The recently invented lattice gas automata,
which are microscopic models for fluid dynamics, are a testbed for the work. The
machines envisaged--lattice engines--would typically consist of many instances
of a custom chip and a general-purpose host machine for support. In many
practical situations, the performance of such machines is limited, not by the
speed and size of the actual processing elements, but by the communication
bandwidth on- and off-chip, and by the memory capacity of the chip. The specific
research consists of three phases to be conducted concurrently: (1) performance
analysis of existing architectures, (2) extension of current theory to give
bounds on achievable throughput rate as a function of chip I/O bandwidth and
memory capacity for the particular lattices of interest, and (3) construction
and testing of prototype machines. Examples of computational problems amenable
to lattice calculations include the numerical solution of differential
equations, iterative image processing, and cellular automata. These are all very
important problems. The focus of this project on the problems of designing and
building practical custom VLSI-based computers aimed specifically at this class
of calculations offers the potential of much faster problem solutions than on
general-purpose computers.
