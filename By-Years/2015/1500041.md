This project will advance the scientific community's understanding of turbulence
in the solar wind, which is the quasi-steady outflow of high-temperature,
ionized gas (plasma) from the Sun. Turbulence plays a key role in heating and
accelerating the solar wind, which in turn mediates the interactions between the
Sun and Earth's near-space environment. This project will thus ultimately
contribute to the scientific community's ability to understand and model space
weather, which includes disturbances in the Earth's magnetic field that have the
potential to damage power grids. In addition, this project will contribute to
the training of future scientists by supporting the research team's involvement
in, and organization of, the annual Solar Heliospheric and INterplanetary
Environment (SHINE) Workshop. This Workshop attracts roughly 200 attendees, of
whom approximately 60 are students. The Workshop provides students with
specialized training in space science and helps integrate students into the
community of space-science researchers. The principal investigator of the
project will teach in summer schools for undergraduate students, graduate
students, and postdoctoral researchers in the fields of plasma physics and space
physics. The principal investigator will also incorporate research findings from
this project into his teaching of physics and astronomy at the University of New
Hampshire. These activities will contribute to the development of a strong
science-technology-engineering-mathematics (STEM) workforce, which will benefit
society at large.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The particular scientific focus of the
project's turbulence research is on the phenomenon of intermittency and its
effects upon solar-wind turbulence. Intermittency is a property of turbulent
flows in which random fluctuations in, for example, the velocity of the medium
(``eddies'') become concentrated into a decreasing fraction of the volume as the
size of the eddies decreases. Intermittency profoundly impacts almost every
aspect of solar-wind turbulence, from the rate at which it heats the
interplanetary medium to the mechanisms by which turbulent energy is transferred
to the different types of charged particles contained in the solar wind. To
tackle this problem, the research team will employ a range of methodologies,
including mathematical modeling and computer simulations, and they will test
their theoretical predictions using spacecraft measurements.
