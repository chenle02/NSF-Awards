This project will continue research on the computational complexity of
differential and integral equations. Past experience in this area has shown that
standard formulations of these problems are often intractable. A goal of this
project is to develop new formulations of these problems that are still
practical, but may lead to tractable problems. These formulations will be based
on the information-based complexity theory.
