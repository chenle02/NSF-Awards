Abstract 9316163 Hernandez This is a continuation of successful project at
South Pole, Antarctica, which uses a Fabry-Perot spectrometer to measure high
altitude (greater than 85 kilometers) winds and atmospheric temperatures by
measuring the Doppler shift and line widths of several atmospheric emissions.
Measurements over the past several years have led to the discovery that, because
of the location of the observatory at the geographical South Pole, waves of
global scale can be followed as they travel entirely around the Earth. This
feature has allowed the disentanglement of waves traveling in opposite
directions around the Earth. These newly discovered waves have periods ranging
from a few hours to many days. ***
