High performance liquid chromatography/ion chromatography instrumentation is
being used in laboratory activities in organic chemistry, analytical chemistry,
biochemistry, environmental chemistry, advanced laboratory and student directed
research in the Chemistry Department at Taylor University. Concepts currently
taught are reinforced by these experiences and the range and sophistication of
applications is enhanced.
