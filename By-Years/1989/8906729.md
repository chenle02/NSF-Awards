This awards partially supports acquisition of instruments for measuring surface
charge of colloidal particles, electrophoretic mobility of colloidal particles,
and viscosity of colloidal dispersions. The instruments will be used to
characterize particles produced by the sol-gel process as precursors in the
fabrication of high-temperature superconducting ceramics. Better control and
characterization of the particle precursors should lead to higher quality
ceramics.
