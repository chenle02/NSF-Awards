Proposal: DMS-9970398 Principal Investigator: Steffen R. Rohde

Abstract: Rohde will investigate distortion properties of conformal and
quasiconformal mappings, using methods from geometric function theory as well as
from dynamical systems. Quasiconformal mappings are weakly differentiable
homeomorphisms that are "almost conformal," in the sense that they distort
angles by at most a bounded factor. These maps generalize conformal mappings and
arise naturally in geometry, geometric function theory, complex dynamics, and
PDE. Two specific problems Rohde will investigate are to estimate the derivative
of a conformal map of a disk that admits a quasiconformal extension to the
complex plane and to find bounds for the Hausdorff dimension of quasiconformal
images of circles (so-called quasicircles). Both questions are closely related
to Brennan's conjecture concerning the degree of integrability of the derivative
of a conformal mapping of the unit disk. Rohde will also study geometric
properties such as porosity or wiggliness of sets in euclidean space, together
with estimates for their Hausdorff dimension. Such sets appear naturally both in
complex dynamics and in geometric function theory.

Conformal mappings have applications in many areas, both within mathematics and
outside it. These include control theory, heat conduction, fluid dynamics, and
complex dynamics, to name just a few. One standard use of coformal mapping is to
change coordinates from one region to a simpler region, say to a disk, where a
problem can be viewed from a new perspective, hopefully one in which the
solution to the original problem becomes more readily apparent. A famous
instance were this approach paid huge dividends occurred in aerodynamics, where
conformal mappings were instrumental in coming up with the original design
profiles for airfoils. From the standpoint of conformal mapping, regions with
smooth boundaries have been well understood for some time. However, the
appearance of fractals in many branches of science led to the natural problem of
investigating the conformal mapping properties of regions bounded by highly
nonsmooth, fractal-type curves. The core objectives of Rohde's research are, on
the one hand, to obtain a deeper understanding of fractal curves by means of
conformal mappings, and conversely, to study some problems about conformal
mappings by analyzing the geometry of regions with fractal boundaries
