The equipment requested is a fast-pulse mode-locked laser system. this system
will enable research on fast time division multiaccess techniques for all-
optical networks. All-optical network architectures use optical signal
processing for clock generation, modulation, encoding, decoding, protocol-
handling and threshold detection. Optical bandwidth- expansion protocols such as
spread spectrum and time division have already been demonstrated in our
laboratory, and a 12.5 Gbps network has been implemented that accommodates 125
users. Future research will explore the fundamental limits of optical networks
with optical pulse compression, moving toward terabit/sec optical
communications. They will use optical processing to implement higher layers in
the networks. The unique virtues of optical processing, such as speed and
parallelism, should lead to unique network architectures with capabilities far
beyond present-day systems.
