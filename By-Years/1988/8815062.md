Dr. Michael S. Adams of University of Wisconsin-Madison will visit Dr. Jan Kvet
of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences' Institute of Botany to develop plans
for a joint workshop focussing on wetland ecosystems. The resulting proposal is
intended for consideration under a new U.S.-Czechoslovakia Cooperative Science
Program and if successful, should contribute to our knowledge of macrophyte-
dominated, submersed littoral zone communities.
