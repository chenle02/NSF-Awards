With previous NSF support, we have begun a careful study of mode conversion
between optical guided modes in magnetic garnet thin films induced by microwave
magnetostatic waves. This interaction may lead to new microwave and optical
signal processing devices including microwave spectrum analyzers and optical
frequency shifters. We propose to continue this work by studying two issues
related to increasing the conversion efficiency resulting from the interaction.
First, the microwave nonlinear phenomena which occur when high microwave power
is used to achieve efficient mode conversion will be studied by not only
examining the microwave spectrum, but by examining the optical spectrum of the
converted mode and the angular distribution of the diffracted beam. Second, we
propose to study optical mode conversion induced by magnetostatic waves
propagating in a separate layer of a garnet heterostructre. Previous theoretical
studies have suggested that efficient mode conversion may be easier to obtain in
a heterostructre, with separate layers optimized for microwave and optical
properties, than in a single magnetic layer.
