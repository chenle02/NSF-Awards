This award provides funds to the Department of Biological Sciences at the
University of Tulsa to help train undergraduate students in the philosophy,
mechanics, and execution of scientific research. This project will enhance an
already strong program in undergraduate research participation, and will extend
this program into the summer. Another goal is to enhance opportunities for
participation in scientific research for members of underrepresented groups. The
Undergraduate Summer Research Program will consist of a research workshop,
independent research projects, weekly group meetings, invited speakers, and a
research colloquium. The research workshop will introduce the students to the
philosophy and mechanics of the various fields in biology represented by the
participating faculty. One result of the workshop will be the development by
each student of an individual research project. These projects will focus on
nectivore foraging ecology, plant reproductive ecology, vertebrate reproductive
physiology, or reproductive behavioral ecology. The students will complete their
projects over the course of the summer. The weekly group meetings will provide a
forum for review of literature, progress reports on research projects, and for
solving problems that arise during the course of the projects. The invited
speakers will expose the students to a wider variety of viewpoints in biology
than is available through the participating faculty. Finally, students will
communicate the results of their projects and experience critical peer review
through the research colloquium.
