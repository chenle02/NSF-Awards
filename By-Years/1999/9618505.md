Ayres, Thomas AST 96-18505 Dr. Ayres continues his program of research into the
presence of cold gas in the solar and stellar atmospheres. He will take
advantage of new instrumentation available for imaging and spectroscopy in the
IR to 1) explore the temporal evolution of the dynamic, inhomogeneous solar
surface, 2) investigate the behavior of CO bands at 4.7 microns as a function of
Teff, log g, metallicity, and chromospheric activity in a survey of late-type
stars, and 3) model the inhomogeneous outer atmosphere of the sun with 3-D
geometries and extrapolate the results to stars. ***
