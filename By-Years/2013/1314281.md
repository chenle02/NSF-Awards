The advent of mobile health (mHealth) technology brings great opportunity to
improve quality of life, improve individual and public health, and reduce
healthcare costs. Although mHealth devices and applications are proliferating,
many challenges remain to provide the necessary usability, manageability,
interoperability, availability, security, and privacy. The goal of this project
is to engineer the tools for, and lay the scientific foundation of, secure
wearable mHealth. In the process, the investigators are developing a general
framework for body-area pervasive computing, centered around health-monitoring
and health-management applications.

The vision is that computational jewelry, in a form like a bracelet or pendant,
will provide the properties essential for successful body-area mHealth networks.
These devices coordinate the activity of the body-area network and provide a
discreet means for communicating with their wearer. Such devices complement the
capabilities of a smartphone, bridging the gap between the type of pervasive
computing possible with a mobile phone and that enabled by wearable computing.

The interdisciplinary team of investigators is designing and developing
'Amulet', an electronic bracelet and a software framework that enables
developers to create (and users to easily use) safe, secure, and efficient
mHealth applications that fit seamlessly into everyday life. The research is
determining the degree to which computational jewelry offers advantages in
availability, reliability, security, privacy, and usability, and developing
techniques that provide these properties in spite of the severely-constrained
power resources of wearable jewelry.
