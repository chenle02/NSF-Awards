This proposal seeks to analyze pore pressure data from a borehole in the Nankai
subduction complex (site C0002), to develop an interactive portal to disseminate
data from this borehole, and to ?shepherd? the installation of new borehole
instrumentation at Nankai. The pore pressure data will be analyzed in concert
with seismic and strain measurements in an effort to provide a direct
correlation between pore pressure and seismic strain. The new portal will be
connected to a cabled system (DONET) and will make all borehole data available
to the wider community in real time. The new community instrumented borehole
will span a splay fault in hole C0010 and also be connected to the cabled
system, providing real-time access to data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
impacts: The new data portal will be integrated with an existing system already
in classroom use at Penn State, allowing undergraduates access to the real-time
data sets. The work will provide information regarding the behavior of potential
tsunamigenic faults. The work is international in scope and highly leveraged by
international funds.
