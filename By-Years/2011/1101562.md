This award will provide support to defray expenses of participants to attend a
conference on analysis and its applications during May 16-20, 2011 at Princeton
University. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This major conference will include lectures by
world leaders in Harmonic Analysis, Several Complex Variables, Partial
Differential Equations, and Geometric Analysis. The conference will also
emphasize the interaction of Analysis with Combinatorics, Number Theory, and
Theoretical Computer Science. All of these areas were significantly impacted by
the research and teaching of Elias Stein, and the conference is being organized
in honor of his influence. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will allow
participants, as well as others in the mathematical community, to learn about
recent progress on a broad range of subjects in Analysis. The organizers will
invite graduate students, young postdocs, women and minority researchers to
participate actively in the conference. In addition to the plenary lectures, the
conference will include a panel discussion on teaching Mathematics,
collaboration in Mathematics, and the writing of Mathematics books.
