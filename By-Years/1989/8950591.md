The chemistry of the natural and man-made environment has long been a focus of
all levels of chemistry education at St. Andrews. This project extends the
students' opportunity to learn and apply modern analytical techniques to "real-
world" systems. High pressure liquid chromatography and high sensitivity atomic
absorption spectrometry are used to help illustrate fundamental chemical
principles ( redox, solubility, and acid-base reactions; sampling and analysis)
using environmental chemical systems as a vehicle. The important advances in
chemical techniques into the realms of very low pressures, air- sensitive
substances, and high-energy systems has tended to take attention away from the
equally important chemistry of earth-surface conditions. The aim and
significance of the project is to intrigue and involve young chemistry students
by including in their early training insight into how the ideas of blackboard
and laboratory chemistry play themselves out in the complex world of ordinary
experience. The institution is providing funds equal to the amount of the award.
