Abstract - Griffin &amp; Maverick - 9311527 Copper metallization is a potential
new material technology for manufacturing ultra large scale integration (ULSI)
devices. Advantages of copper include low resistivity and high resistance to
electro- and stress-migration. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) offers several
advantages relative to other deposition methods including the ability to achieve
good film conformality over high-aspect ratio features (for example, trenches
and multi-level metallizations). This project is aimed at studying the
reactants, mechanisms, and reactor design criteria needed to establish low-
temperature CVD of copper thin films as a new metallization technology of ULSI
devices. The primary goal is to develop quantitative, mechanistic rate
expressions and reactor transport models of various Cu CVD processes. These
models will be applied to analyze experimental growth rates for specific CuI and
CuII compounds measured using a vertical flow, single wafer reactor. Special
attention will be given to product inhibition effects at high conversion, to
which end kinetic results will be complemented with independent studies of
ligand adsorption/desorption kinetics on high surface area copper powders. V l
