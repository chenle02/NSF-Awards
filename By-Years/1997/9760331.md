Lynntech Inc. will develop a new additive process for manufacturing of printed
wiring boards (PWBs) which is based on the photopolymerisation of conducting
polymers. This process does not require a conducting substrate for deposition of
conducting polymers, and copper films, lines and/or through-holes are readily
electroplated on the polymer with high resolution. This process technique holds
significant promise in PWB manufacturing, where high resolution PCBs are needed
and process waste minimisation is imperative.
