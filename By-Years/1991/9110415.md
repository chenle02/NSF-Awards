This project focuses on a working conference to coordinate the efforts of
Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and other predominantly
minority institutions in developing a national agenda to carry out major reforms
that will improve mathematics, science and engineering education for minorities.
This effort will also eliminate the duplicative or fragmented efforts by the
representative underrepresented groups who will be attending this conference.
One measurable outcome of the conference will be the establishment of a
comprehensive interactive network that will implement the action plan that
results from the meeting. Another important outcome will be the sharing of
information and resources among the participating institutions as well as
strengthening their linkages with industry, governmental units, and professional
societies. The principal investigator has devoted much of her professional life
to science and engineering issues for minorities, including leadership roles on
several NSF advisory groups, and is therefore highly qualified to lead this
important effort.
