The project involves work on two distinct types of problem in harmonic analysis
and additive combinatorics. The first collection of problems will be concerned
with on the further development of the theory of strongly singular integrals
(linear operators whose integral kernels are too singular at the origin to be of
Calderon-Zygmund type) and in particular will focus the use of oscillatory
integral techniques to investigate the regularity of these classical operators
both along varieties and on different Lie groups. The second collection of
problems will concern the application of Fourier analytic techniques to problems
in additive combinatorics, in particular we will focus on quantitative results
relating to the beautiful observation (made independently by Sarkozy and
Furstenberg) that subsets of the integers with positive upper density
necessarily contain square differences.

Broadly speaking the project will focus on two main problems. The first of these
is specifically concerned with the generalization (and extension to more general
abstract settings) of some well known results from classical harmonic analysis.
The second problem relates to proving quantitative versions of results from
density Ramsey theory establishing the existence of certain arithmetic patterns
in large sets of integer points.
