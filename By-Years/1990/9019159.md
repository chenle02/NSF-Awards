Mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana which are defective in the repair of DNA damage
induced by ultraviolet light will be isolated. Genetic analysis will be used to
elucidate the molecular mechanism of the various pathways required for reversal
or repair of damage to DNA and determine which of the repair pathways are
involved. Mutants defective in recombination can be expected to also be isolated
since many basic cellular mechanisms also utilize the repair pathways. After
mutant characterization, strategies for cloning the involved genes will be
pursued. The availability of DNA repair mutants of this model organism will
enhance studies of this important area of research in plants.***
