The objective of the Spatial Analysis Laboratory is to achieve a better
integration of the collection, analysis, and visual presentation of geographic
information at the undergraduate level. With this new lab, project objectives
are reached through the integration of techniques courses and content- oriented
courses and through extensive real-world problem-solving projects. Students are
able to apply computer and statistical knowledge in content courses as they
advance through the program. Extensive hands-on, project-oriented, and
cooperative learning fully engages students in classes. Projects are related to
the real-world problems in the region, such as economic development, so that
students can be personally and emotionally involved. Six annual publications
result from class projects: Geographic Data: Sources and Quality, Data Book for
Economic Development in Appalachian Kentucky, Statistical Atlas of Appalachian
Kentucky, Geographical Distribution of Landfills in Appalachian Kentucky,
International Trade Reference Book for Appalachian Kentucky, and Student
Portfolios.
