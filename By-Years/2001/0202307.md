The Community Colleges of Colorado plan to establish a regional center in
information technology (IT) to significantly increase the supply, capability and
diversity of the IT workforce in Colorado. The Center is a consortium of the
community colleges with the Colorado Institute of Technology, the National
Workforce Center for Emerging Technologies and a proposed Colorado IT Industry
Advisory Council. A technology symposium is held to engage industry and colleges
in a dialogue about key issues. Industry needs to become aware of the roles for
two-year college graduates in IT. The IT curricula in two-year colleges need to
be upgraded and expanded based upon standards and industry requirements. The
faculty, teachers, counselors and administrators need ongoing professional
development. Students need to be provided consistent information and advising
about IT positions. This symposium serves to develop the basis for the Center.
