With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
(CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at Lake Superior State University
will acquire a high performance liquid chromatograph. This equipment will
enhance research in a number of areas including a) the identification and
monitoring of algal toxins in drinking water supplies; and b) measurement of
thiaminase activity and the role of thiamine deficiency in early mortality
syndrome in Great Lakes predatory fish. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) is an extremely powerful technique used for the
separation and analysis of complex mixtures. The results from these studies will
have an impact in a number of areas, especially environmental chemistry and
biology. This instrument will also be used as a tool for undergraduate senior
research. &lt;br/&gt;
