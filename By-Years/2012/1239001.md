The Eight William Rowan Hamilton Geometry and Topology Workshop is a five-day,
directed workshop on Measure and Asymptotics in Group Theory and Low-Dimensional
Geometry, to be held at the Hamilton Mathematical Institute (HMI) in Dublin,
Ireland, August 28-September 1, 2012. The workshop will consist of a two-day
mini-course for graduate students and junior researchers, followed by a three
day lecture series. Among the main topics of the workshop will be the recent
work of Agol, Hagland-Wise, Kahn-Markovic, Wise, which has culmunated in the
recently announced proof by Agol, of the virtual Haken conjecture. Another main
topic will be the measure-theoretic properties of groups such as amenability,
boundary amenability, and measure
equivalence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the William Rowan
Hamilton Geometry and Topology Workshop is to investigate common themes and
techniques among significant areas of current research in geometry and topology
and to support junior researchers interested in these areas. The workshop will
bring together leading researchers in geometry and topology with graduates
students and junior researchers who have a special interest in problems related
to group theory and low-dimensional geometry will investigate a number of
important questions at the forefront of research in these areas. The confluence
of expertise from dfferent areas will result in new collaborative projects, and
in broadening the research horizons of the
participants.&lt;br/&gt;http://www.hamilton.tcd.ie/events/gt/gt2012.htm
