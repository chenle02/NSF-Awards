There is growing evidence that borehole temperature profiles in the upper 300 m
of the earth contain recoverable and valuable information on surface temperature
histories over the last three centuries, a time period critical for climate
change studies. The PI will (1) develop a capability for routine 1 mK (0.001 K)
temperature logging of drillholes, (2) evaluate the thermal stability of
drillholes (ultimate noise level) in relation to existing theory, (3) partition
curvature in borehole temperature profiles into transient and steady-state
components through repeat logging, and (4) instrument a test borehole to be used
in "observatory mode" with a weather station at the surface and fixed thermistor
string down hole. The study will help define procedures for placing error bounds
on surface temperature histories and extracting maximum information on climate
change out of borehole temperature profiles.
