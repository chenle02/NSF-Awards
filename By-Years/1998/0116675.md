This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award provides funds for the
acquisition of an ultra high speed camera capable of recording 16 digital images
of 1280x1024 resolution at frame rates up to 200 million frames per second. The
camera will be used to study material deformation and chip-tool interface
friction in metal cutting.

The ultra high framing rate will enable extension of current capabilities for
determination of the velocity, strain and strain rate distribution in the
primary and secondary shear zones in low speed orthogonal cutting to much higher
cutting speeds. Results will be used to determine material constitutive
properties at high strain, strain rate and temperature, obtain the shear stress
along the chip-tool interface, and verify computational models of metal cutting
at high cutting speeds. The camera will also be used in experiments in a second
course in manufacturing processes.
