This is a proposal to support an expansion of the Women in Science and
Engineering (WISE) Project in the Women's and Gender Studies (WGS) Program at
North Carolina State University. The WISE project promotes the advancement of
women and people of color in science and engineering through the integration of
women's studies into the undergraduate and graduate curriculum via faculty
development seminars. The current proposal is for two years of funding to
support companion seminars for interested faculty and graduate students. The
immediate goals of the proposed seminar project are to foster community among
the participants, address their interests in theory and research from women's
studies, and promote informed conversation within science and engineering
departments and classrooms. The long-term goals of the proposed seminar project
are to provide an institutionally sustainable vehicle for the recruitment and
retention of women and people of color as faculty and graduate students in
science and engineering, promote the national dialogue about best practices in
accomplishing this, and contribute new scholarship by and about women in science
and engineering to the field of women's studies.

This project is supported by the NSF ADVANCE Program. The overall mission of the
ADVANCE Program is to increase the participation of women in the scientific and
engineering workforce through the increased representation and advancement of
women in academic science and engineering careers.
