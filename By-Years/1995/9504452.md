9504452 Webster The proposed research is in the area of several complex
variables; more specifically, it deals with real submanifolds of complex
manifolds. Two topics are emphasized in the proposal: the investigator
introduces a concept of double-valued-reflection in an effort to understand real
algebraic curves sitting inside complex algebraic curves (thus the notion of
double-valued-reflection generalizes that of conjugation); the embedding problem
of abstract Cauchy-Riemann structures is to be pursued further, focusing on
finding those properties shared between embeddable and non-embeddable Cauchy-
Riemann structures. The study of Cauchy-Riemann structures can be thought of as
an attempt to understand certain real surfaces sitting inside complex spaces;
emphasizes the interplay between real and complex geometries. The upshot is that
to understand a real object better it is often necessary to introduce complex
variables.
