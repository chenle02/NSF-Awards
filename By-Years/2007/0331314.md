Proposal : IIS-0331314&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of
Pittsburgh&lt;br/&gt;PI: Ronald Larsen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The grant
will support a two and one-half day workshop to identify and develop research
agendas for future digital libraries research and information infrastructure
programmatic activities as envisioned in a number of major commissioned Federal
and NSF reports and international working group reports. Funding will support
the participation of approximately 40 invited scholars and researchers who have
distinguished themselves in disciplinary and organizational achievements in the
area of digital libraries and networked knowledge environments, and who have
demonstrated leadership in the national and international community. The
workshop is being organized by senior members of the digital libraries
community, some of whom have been instrumental in designing past agency and
interagency programs. The event is scheduled to be held June 15-17, 2003 in
Chatham, Massachusetts.&lt;br/&gt;
