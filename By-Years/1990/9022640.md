The goal of this research is to study the corrosion processes in refractory
metals and refractory metal-bearing alloys. The primary focus will be on the
characterization of the microstructural evolution of corrosion scales using
thermogravimetry, SEM, TEM, and XTEM techniques. Specifically, the sulfidation
of Niobium, Niobium- bearing Chromium alloys, and Iron-Chromium-Niobium and
Chromium- Molybdenum systems will be investigated. In addition, in-situ
oxidation and hot-corrosion of pure Chromium, Nickel-Chromium alloys, and
NickelAluminide will also be studied in the Environmental Scanning Electron
Microscope (ESEM). This will be the first application of ESEM to high
temperature oxidation and sulfidation of metals. The research is expected to
help with the development of new corrosion resistant alloys by contributing to
the fundamental understanding of corrosion mechanisms.
