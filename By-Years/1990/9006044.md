The focus of this proposal is the experimental examination of lipid exchange
rates between 'gel- and 'fluid-like' lipid clusters in membranes using model
membrane systems. Theoretical modeling of lipid dynamics suggest that long range
thermodynamic fluctuations of lipid chain conformations are responsible for
several important membrane phenomena such as enhanced passive transport of
sodium ion through the bilayer at the lipid 'melt' temperature and increased
two-dimensional lateral diffusion rates. However little direct experimental
evidence of lipid structural fluctuations is available. Submicrosecond lipid
reorientational processes which exists in the bilayer may be studied using
polarized fluorescence measurements. The fluorescence 'time-window' can be
extended to span this critical submicrosecond region, by using fluorescence
probes with lifetimes on the order of several hundreds of nanoseconds to detect
submicrosecond acyl-chain motions. This extended submicrosecond time window,
which has not previously been explored, may provide the key to understanding
important lipid membrane mediated events e.g.ion transport, fusion and membrane
signaling.
