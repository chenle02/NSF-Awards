The number, size, and availability of scientific datasets have grown enormously
over the last few years. As scientific activity becomes more data intensive and
collaborative, a key challenge for cross-disciplinary research will be discovery
of diverse data sets, managed within distributed repositories and registries.
Currently, discovery of information on the Internet is largely performed through
automated approaches, characterized by web crawling and associated algorithms,
or labor intensive indexing and categorization, such as the National Library of
Medicine index for medical literature. There are significant amounts of data
housed in repositories where only researchers with expertise in the specific
field know and access the data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project builds a user
driven architecture for data discovery (UDADD), a capability that enhances
discovery of scientific datasets by building a global index from diverse
communities with minimal input. In the UDADD approach user actions, such as
dataset queries or downloads, drive the construction of a global index. These
actions are recorded and gathered automatically, through cooperation with
repository managers. Two software plugins are provided to help the repositories
interact with the UDADD system. The architecture includes ranking techniques
based on frequency and recency of use of the datasets. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
pilot architecture will be demonstrated and evaluated using cooperating
repositories within the DataNet Federation Consortium. Currently, six science
and engineering communities participate in the consortium, including national
scale projects in oceanography, social science, cognitive science, hydrology,
engineering, and plant biology.
