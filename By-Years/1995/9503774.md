9503774 Mecartney The University of California at Irvine (UCI) will acquire a
field emission gun scanning electron microscope (FEG-SEM) with energy dispersive
spectroscopy (EDS) capabilities, dedicated to support interdisciplinary
materials research in engineering and science. Participating faculty from the
Departments of Chemical and Biochemical Engineering, Mechanical &amp; Aerospace
Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering, and Chemistry have joined
together and agreed that this instrument is the number one priority for these
faculty involved in the synthesis and characterization of materials. The
equipment will be used primarily for the education of graduate students in the
interdisciplinary Materials Science &amp; Engineering graduate program and for
research projects focusing on (1) the fabrication of nanocrystalline alloys (2)
composite materials synthesis and deformation (3) chemical synthesis mf new
materials (4) materials issues in microelectronic devices and (5)
superplasticity. The acquisition of this analytical FEG-SEM is an essential next
step in building the microstructural characterization of materials facility at
UCI which currently contains state-of-the-art analytical TEM and XRD
instrumentation. %%%
