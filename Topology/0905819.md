There has recently been a tremendous amount of progress in the areas of Kleinian
groups and the geometry of 3-manifolds. Several long-standing conjectures have
been solved, the most spectacular being Perelman's proof of the Geometrization
Conjecture, but also including the Ending Lamination Conjecture (Minsky, Brock
and Canary) and the Tameness Conjecture (Agol, Calegari-Gabai). The goal of this
proposal is to get a more exact understanding of how geometric structures on
3-manifolds are reflected in their topological properties. Since hyperbolic
structures on closed manifolds are unique, studying them through families
typically requires allowing singularities or obtaining them by gluing flexible
manifolds with boundary. Getting explicit, quantitative information about a
geometric structure requires a refined understanding of the flexible structures
from which they are obtained. These variational techniques can also be applied
to understand other types of geometric structures, such as projective and
Lorentzian structures, that don't have an invariant metric. We will also
consider interesting questions about geometric structures in other dimensions
(hyperbolic structures in high dimensions, projective structures on surfaces).

In this proposal we wish to study geometric structures in dimension 3, as well
as other dimensions, using a combination of analytic, geometric, and topological
tools. This is a very active and interesting area that has recently had an
influx of new ideas and techniques. Geometry in dimension 3 is particularly
appealing because it is visually accessible to many people, including beginning
mathematics students and those with less technical backgrounds. It also has
applications to physics and has led to the creation of a number of graphical
interfaces that have been widely utilized.
