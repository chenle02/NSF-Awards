The investigator and his colleagues study the problem of extracting features of
images and their properties via scales and local scales using the classical
theory of function spaces and partial differential equations. They use the
knowledge of scales and local scales in images to obtain an efficient method for
image decompositions and multiscale representations, which are image dependent.
Finally, they extend the theory of scales and local scales to higher dimensional
data (graphs and manifolds), and to find efficient computational methods and
algorithms to solve these problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reducing a complex data
to simpler representations that can be more easily analyzed is an important task
in mathematics and information science. The study of scales and local scales
provides a tool for doing this task. In particular, it provides a tool for
organizing and clustering the internal multiscale structures of the
data.&lt;br/&gt;Applications include medical imaging, hyperspectral imaging,
satellite imaging, material science, terrain data analysis, and dimension
reduction in higher dimensional data.&lt;br/&gt;
