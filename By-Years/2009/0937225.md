This project will create a substantial U.S. presence in the international
Visiting Lecturer Program (VLP) in mathematics, organized and sponsored by the
International Mathematical Union (IMU). Under this program, mathematicians from
developed countries deliver intensive short courses in advanced mathematics for
degree programs at universities in developing countries. Two main objectives of
U.S. involvement are: 1) to build capacity in mathematics and mathematics
education in developing countries, and 2) to increase mathematical interaction
between the U.S. mathematical community and the vast, mostly untapped reservoir
of mathematical talent in the developing world. The program will draw on a large
pool of U.S. mathematicians who have already indicated their willingness to
participate, essentially pro bono, in the VLP in the coming years. They will
offer 3-4 week math lecture courses in topics at the advanced undergraduate
level, such as statistics, differential equations, numerical analysis, etc., the
capacity for which is lacking at many universities in developing
nations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three long-term effects of the VLP will be the
establishment of a critical mass of successful students of advanced mathematics
in individual developing countries, establishment of contacts between U.S.
mathematicians and the brightest young mathematical talent in those developing
countries, and establishment of ongoing international contacts between U.S.
mathematicians and the international mathematical community engaged in similar
efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
