9619834 Kouvetakis The Departments of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Chemical, Bio,
and Materials Engineering, Physics and Astronomy, and the Center for Solid State
Science at Arizona State University (ASU) will establish a Research Experience
for Undergraduates (REU) site at ASU. The goal of the REU program is to
introduce basic materials synthesis and processing to prospective middle and
high school teachers, that is, pre-service teachers. The REU site is designed to
attract undergraduate students that are engaged in education and teacher
training at ASU and at institutions where the opportunities to participate in
research programs are limited. Student participants from universities, community
colleges, and tribal colleges in Arizona will be involved in research which
includes bioactive surface coating for medical implants, semiconductor corrosion
from process residuals, and binary and ternary semiconductor alloys. The student
participants will develop teaching modules for the pre-college classroom under
the joint guidance of the science and education faculties at ASU. %%% This
project targets an important sector of the undergraduate student population:
future middle and high school teachers, and has the potential for a broad-
reaching impact on the science education of future generations. ***
