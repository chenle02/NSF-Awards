This grant will support a two year program of research involving a search for
electrically charged, massive particles thought to make up a significant part of
the mass of the universe. Such "charged dark matter" is made up of particles
called CHAMPS, and is thought to exist in order to explain various cosmological
phenomena. The existence of dark matter has never been established, but searches
for it form an interesting component of current research in particle physics.
The proponent hopes to participate in theoretical studies of the interactions of
CHAMPS with the atmosphere of Earth as well as that in space, and to conduct an
experiment using an apparatus mounted on a balloon to be launched later in 1992.
