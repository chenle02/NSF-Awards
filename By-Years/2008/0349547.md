With the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, Professor
Schwartz and his colleagues at the University of Colorado are examining the
mobility of molecules in self-assembled monolayers. Using single molecule
fluorescence microscopy and scanning force microscopy, the effects of molecule
mobility on the growth and ultimate structure of these molecular thin films are
studied. The structural consequences of molecular mobility in the formation of
specific lateral assemblies in these monolayers are determined. The results of
this fundamental research is of interest in the design and production of
molecular electronic devices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using fluorescently labeled
molecules, single molecule fluorescence microscopy is used to examine the motion
of molecules in organic self assembled monolayers. The effects of mobility on
growth and final structure are examined. These studies provide the fundamental
information necessary to understand organic thin film growth and self assembly
processes of interest in the construction of molecular electronic devices.
