9320668 Faller Yale University Dr. John W. Faller, Chemistry Department, Yale
University, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic
Chemistry Program for studies related to asymmetric synthesis and catalysis. New
methods for asymmetric and regioselective syntheses will be developed using
metal complexes. These will include an efficient stoichiometric reagent for the
preparation of monallylic alcohols based on a chiral Mo complex, the use of
chiral poisons to simplify the preparation of catalysts for asymmetric
synthesis, and the development of chiral sulfoxides for the resolution of chiral
metal complexes. An object which is not the same as its mirror image (e.g. a
left compared to a right handed glove) is said to be chiral. Many pharmaceutical
and agricultural chemicals are chiral and often only one of the two mirror image
molecules is desired. Since it is difficult to obtain a single mirror image, the
production of such molecules is an important goal in contemporary chemistry. In
this project new strategies toward solving the problem of "asymmetric synthesis"
will be applied to a broad range of reactions and new, more economic
preparations of these important molecules will be developed.
