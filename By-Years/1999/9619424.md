AST-9619424 Dr. Ronald Reynolds has completed the instrumentation for the
Wisconsin H-Alpha Mapper (WHAM) Fabry-Perot facility and installed it on Kitt
Peak, Arizona. He will now begin an observational survey to explore the warm
ionized component of the interstellar medium. The survey will significantly
improve our basic knowledge and understanding of the composition and morphology
of interstellar matter and the principal mechanisms of ionization and heating
within the disk and halo of the Galaxy. =================================
