9725756 Logan This is an award to support conduct of a workshop to consider
advances in the knowledge-base needed to support environmental engineering
practice. Emphasis in this workshop will be to identify the research needed to
address the engineering component of the National Research Council's recent
National Forum on Science and Technology Goals of its six environmental research
and development needs. Background to conduct of this workshop will include
reports from the forum on environmental engineering research and education
conducted under NSF 96-26774 in May of 1997 and the conference and workshop on
environmental problems characteristic of urban coastal communities to be
conducted in October of 1997 under NSF 97-11151. Workshop participants will
include representation from the National Academy of Engineering and the
Association of Environmental Engineering Professors. The product of this
conference is expected to be used in planning operation of the Environmental
Engineering Research program as it addresses outstanding issues in environmental
engineering practice. Results are also expected to assist in advancing the
National Science Foundation's commitment to the core strategy of integrating
research and education as articulated in its strategic plan. ***
