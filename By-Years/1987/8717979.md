The objective of this three-year U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research project in
atomic physics between Bogomil Obelic of the Rudjer Boskovic Institute and Mitio
Inokuti from Argonne National Laboratory is to study the ionization properties
of low-energy photons and charged atomic particles in gases of radiological
interest. By observing ionization processes, scientists can learn about specific
properties and atomic structure of gases. Furthermore, the proposed
investigation has importance for modeling the biological effects of certain
types of radiation. A benefit of this international collaboration is the joining
of the theoretical expertise of the U.S. scientist with the experimental focus
of the Yugoslav investigator. This project was approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav
Joint Board on Cooperation in Science and Technology and is supported through a
joint fund consisting of matching contributions from the U.S. and Yugoslav
governments. The U.S. contribution is provided annually by the Department of
State. No NSF funds are involved. The grants are composed principally of
Yugoslav dinars and made to the principal Yugoslav institute. Grants include
travel for U.S. scientists to Yugoslavia and a modest dollar allowance for
Yugoslav scientists' living expenses in the U.S.
