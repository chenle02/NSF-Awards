This proposal is one of three proposals to each plan participation in a new
multi-university I/UCRC that aims to promote a research program of interest to
both industry and universities on the analysis of multiphase phenomena. This new
multi-university center will be able to have a broad impact on the industry
through having each member's resources being enhanced by those of its partners
which are also being recommended to receive a planning grant. The three
partners, of which this is one are the Michigan State University, University of
Tulsa, and University of Akron.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed Center's goal
is to focus on tackling the sophisticated challenges of computational multiphase
transport phenomena which are of importance in the automotive, biochemical,
chemical, food, mining, petrochemical an pharmaceutical
industries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new center will focus on challenging
problems in:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Multiphase turbulent flows&lt;br/&gt;-
Multiphase materials processing,&lt;br/&gt;- Multiphase mixing&lt;br/&gt;- Next
generation filtration based on nanoscale fibers, and multiphase
separations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
