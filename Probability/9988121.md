The Symposium on Inference for Stochastic Processes will be held at the
University of Georgia from May 10-12, 2000. At the Symposium leading researchers
in the field will give invited talks on their original research, and interact
with young researchers and graduate students. Publication of selected (refereed)
proceedings is planned. Particular efforts will be made to include African
American, female participants and persons with disabilities. The Institute of
Mathematical Statistics (IMS) will co-sponsor the Symposium as an IMS Special
Topics Conference. Moreover, the Symposium is recognized as a Satellite meeting
of the Fifth World Congress of the Bernoulli Society, and an important component
of the program will be devoted to Inference Problems in Stochastic Geometry. A
unique feature of the Symposium will be the small size which has been designed
for maximum interaction of participants on the very significant topic of
Inference for Stochastic Processes.
