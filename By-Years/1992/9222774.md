9222774 Atema The way in which sensory receptors process rapid changes of
stimulus over time has not been studied much in chemical reception (smell and
taste), where the emphasis has been on molecular recognition. Yet complex and
dynamic odors characterize the natural environment, and are likely to be very
important to how the brain integrates chemosensory signals into appropriate
behavior. This work develops novel electrochemical measuring techniques for
investigating the spatial and temporal resolution of olfactory receptors on the
very accessible model system of the antenna of marine crustaceans. A new
tightly-controlled stimulus delivery technology allows a variety of stimulus
parameters to be used while measuring the magnitude and reliability of response
parameters, looking at effects such as excitation and adaptation patterns. The
data will be incorporated into a model of chemosensory dynamics, and extended in
studies on receptor development and central coding. This work will have impact
beyond chemosensory neurobiology into areas of diagnostic tests for smell and
taste performance for the food industry as well as medicine, and to the
potential biotechnological development of underwater chemosensing robotic
devices for ecology and for fisheries exploitation. ***
