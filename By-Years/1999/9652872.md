During the past eight years we have developed, taught and fine-tuned the upper
division mathematics course "Great Theorems: The Art of Mathematics". Unlike
many upper division courses which present the results of one specialized field
via a litany of technical constructions, our course offers the motivating
problems and original solutions which inaugurated various branches of
mathematics (e.g. integration, number theory, analysis, abstract algebra). By
reading the original sources, students witness first hand the genesis of
history's most revolutionary ideas in mathematics. The course serves as a lively
capstone experience for students majoring in science, engineering, education,
and mathematics. It can also be offered as an upper division elective to
students who have completed one year of Calculus instruction. Teaching
successfully with this pedagogy requires not only an appropriate collection of
original sources, but also mathematical and historical annotations, as well as
commentary, placing the sources in context. We will write a book of annotated
original sources entitled "Discovery of Ideas: Revolutionary Theorems in
Mathematics," to fulfill this need, using editorial feedback from an advanced
graduate assistant who will do apprentice teaching of the course with our
manuscript.
