This project is addressing the need to strengthen the Pre- calculus and Calculus
I courses offered to freshman and sophomore students. Computer laboratory
experiences are providing students the opportunity to gain an enriched and
comprehensive understanding of mathematics. The project results will be
disseminated through workshops, seminars, and conferences to all university
institutions of the Island. The material produced for the laboratory activities
is being written in Spanish and could be used by other hispanic students in the
United States.
