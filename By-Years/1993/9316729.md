9316729 Strausfeld Some insect species have in their brain a complex anatomical
structure called the mushroom body, which has been linked to learning and
behavior. This SGER work explores the hypothesis that the mushroom bodies
provide a network of connections, a multiplex neuropile, that mediates visual
place memory. The novel approach is to work out "gene expression neuroanatomy"
along with behavior in the fruitfly, Drosophila, with its well-known genetics.
Gene expression will be used to define genetic subsets of neurons in the
mushroom bodies, genetic crosses of Drosophila with behavioral deficits will be
made, and the existence of visual place memory will be tested. There is some
risk whether genetic tools will be successful in clarifying the neuroanatomy,
and will be able to provide a link to the visual memory mechanisms. The results
will be important beyond the issues of invertebrate central neuroanatomy, in
providing a framework for future genetic and systematic studies of complex
memory circuits at the cellular level. This work will have an impact on sensory
neurobiology, insect research in general, learning and memory, and evolutionary
studies. ***
