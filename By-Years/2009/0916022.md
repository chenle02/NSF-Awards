Collaborative browsing, also known as co-browsing, allows multiple users to
access the same web pages in a simultaneous manner and collaboratively fulfill
certain tasks. As a useful and attractive technique, co-browsing has a wide
range of important applications such as online training and customer supporting.
Existing co-browsing solutions must use either a specific collaborative
platform, a modified web server, or a dedicated proxy to coordinate the browsing
activities between web users. Besides, these solutions usually require users to
install special software on their computers. These requirements heavily impede
the wide use of collaborative browsing among Internet users. We propose to
design and develop an efficient framework for Real-time Collaborative Browsing.
This framework is a pure browser-based solution. It leverages the power of Ajax
(Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) techniques and the extensibility of modern web
browsers for performing co-browsing. Our objective is to achieve real-time
collaboration among web users, without the involvement of any third-party
platforms, servers, or proxies. The proposed framework will enable fine-grained
co-browsing on arbitrary web sites and web pages. The success of this project
will provide significant research contributions to on-line collaboration. Our
research results will be disseminated to industry and academia through high-
quality publications and the development of prototypes. The educational aspect
of this project focuses on integrating education and research activities, and
enhancing the undergraduate and graduate system and networking curricula.
