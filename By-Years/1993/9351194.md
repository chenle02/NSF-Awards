9351194 Lindstrom A laboratory is being developed which will enable students to
carry out mathematical experiments and projects making use of computers running
the symbolic manipulation/calculation/graphics package Mathematica.Students
write up their results and are often be encouraged to work collaboratively. The
math Lab is improving education by helping students become excited about and
committed to mathematics ; providing students and instructors with the resources
to investigate more complex and realistic applications of mathematics than can
now be handled in class; and giving students a grounding in the techniques and
possibilities of experimental mathematics. ***
