This project has three major components; feedback synthesis for boundary
control problems, modeling and inverse problem techniques for biological
systems, and sensitivity analysis and regularization for inverse problems. In
the first of these, computational techniques will be developed which will lead
to point and boundary control for partial differential equations. Applications
include the design and implementation of controls for large flexible structures.
In the second, the mathematical theory of inverse problems will be used and
extended in order that mathematical models of structured populations can be
automatically generated from experimental data. In this way perhaps hidden laws
of structured population interactions can be discovered or more completely
understood. The third topic involves the study of strategies so that singular or
unstable processes may be regulated, thereby allowing computational methods to
be used with some degree of confidence. Optimal choices for regularizing
parameters are to be sought.
