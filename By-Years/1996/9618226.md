9618226 Smith We plan a geological, geophysical, and geochemical investigation
of the Puna Ridge, the submarine extension of Kilauea Volcano's East Rift Zone.
Our main scientific objective is to identify and constrain the fundamental
processes which govern the intrusion of magma and the eruption of lavas along a
centrally-fed rift zone. The characteristics of rift zone morphology are
typically used to infer the internal architecture of volcanoes which underscores
the broad applicability of this study, and the importance of fully understanding
the formation and evolution of a volcanic rift zone. Currently, the controls on
the emplacement of dikes and the transport of magma along a rift, the role of
magma storage within the dike system, and the controls on the shapes, sizes, and
styles of lava deposits are not well known. Our multidisciplinary research
project will use a diverse suite of scientific techniques to characterize and
understand the processes acting at the Puna Ridge, including the analysis of
high-resolution swath bathymetry and side-scan sonar imagery, near-bottom
magnetic profiles, digital photography, and samples collected by rock dredging
and glass coring.
