9352656 Quint This project is enabling the Ventura College Mathematics
Department to establish a computer laboratory classroom whose main purpose is to
improve students' understanding of the major underlying concepts in precalculus
and calculus. The mathematics faculty recognizes the need to utilize a computer
algebra system in these courses so that students spend less time manipulating
symbols and more time clarifying and visualizing mathematical principles. The
center is serving as a classroom for weekly precalculus-calculus sessions. It is
also serving as the location of weekly supplementary courses for precalculus-
calculus enrichment. Finally, it is available to students outside of class for
completing homework assignments and for attempting to find answers to their own
independent questions. Students are improving their communication skills as they
work together in the laboratory/classroom setting and as they integrate prose
and mathematical output into their assignments. ***
