Vision in Drosophila (fruit fly) utilizes a fundamental biochemical pathway to
convert light into chemical and electrical signals that eventually are processed
by the brain. This type of cellular signaling is found in both plants and
animals an is known to be active in hormonal, sensory, nervous, secretory,
developmental processes in humans. Several decades ago, a mutation (designated
norpA, for "no receptor potential") in the fruit fly was found which renders the
animal blind without effecting eye structure. Within the past few years the
norpA gene has been cloned and shown to encode the enzyme phospholipase C, an
important factor in the production of a number of intracellular chemical signal
agents. The lack of this enzyme renders the fly blind. In higher animals this
gene encodes a number of enzymes and proteins whose function are unknown. The
goals of this proposal are to utilize molecular genetic methods to study the
expression of the norpA gene, identify its products, reintroduce them into the
deficient animal to determine the products function in terms of their importance
to the process of visual transduction.
