9604287 Karr The proposed research investigates the effect of a bacterial
infection on reproductive success of the host it infects. Because the bacteria
influences reproduction, it profoundly impacts both the population and
evolutionary biology of its host. The bacterium, Wolbachia, reduces or abolishes
the ability of male hosts to father offspring with uninfected females. Research
preliminary to this proposal establishes that mild heat shock such as that
encountered in the wild can reduce the reproductive incompatibility. The
research would: (1) Determine the frequency with which D. simulans larvae
naturally experience heat shock; (2) Determine the range of temperatures and the
developmental stages at which the incompatibility can be cured; (3) Distinguish
whether CI-abatement occurs via outright killing/suppression of Wolbachia and/or
is mediated by increased expression of heat-shock proteins; (4) Experimentally
examine whether natural heat shock actually cures the reproductive
incompatibility in natural populations. The proposed research promises to
integrate diverse aspects of ecological and evolutionary physiology,
reproductive biology, molecular biology, population biology, and bacteriology,
and is likely to yield results significant to each of these areas. Ultimately,
this information could be useful for the rational design of new forms of
biological pest control.
