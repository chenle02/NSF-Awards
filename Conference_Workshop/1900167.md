This award provides funding for US participation in the conference "Great Lakes
Mathematical Physics" that will be held June 28-30, 2019 at Oberlin College. The
conference focuses on recent developments in mathematical physics, specifically
in the areas of random matrices, quantum spin systems, one- and many-body
localization in disordered quantum systems, the KPZ equation and universality
class, and rigorous results in general relativity. A number of distinguished
mathematicians have agreed to attend and speak at this conference. This award
gives early career researchers, members of underrepresented groups, researchers
not funded by NSF an opportunity to attend and participate in this conference.
The organizing committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to
target groups through a number of different activities. More information will be
made available at: https://sites.google.com/msu.edu/glamp2019/

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
