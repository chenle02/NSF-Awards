This study concerns the behavior of solitary-wave (pulse) solutions to certain
nonintegrable Nonlinear Schrodinger-type partial differential equations that
have drawn attention from physicists and engineers in recent years, particularly
in nonlinear optics applications. The study will focus mainly on systems that
model pulse propagation in parametric waveguides made of materials with
quadratic nonlinearity. These equations share the property that their solutions
show highly phase- sensitive behavior (for example in collision outcomes). One
part of the study will investigate the existence and stability of travelling
waves for certain systems, using variational techniques and detailed eigenvalue
analysis of linearized operators. A second part of the study will involve the
development of ordinary differential equations as models for phase- sensitive
pulse behavior, including collisions between two quadratic pulses.

The equations to be studied arise in fiber optics; their solutions model light
pulses travelling down a fiber. They are of interest to optical scientists and
engineers because they model light pulses that are unusually narrow and require
unusually low energies to produce; the hope is that many such pulses could be
packed closely together to increase the speed of data transmission through
optical fibers. This study will address fundamental properties of these pulses
by identifying factors important for predicting their stability (when a pulse is
affected by noise and interactions with the fiber and other pulses, to what
extent does it retain the pulse shape necessary to transmit information?) and
their behavior in collisions (when two pulses meet each other head-on).
