The sodium ion cycle of extremely alkalophilic bacilli is a simple cycle of
secondary porters: an electrogenic sodium ion/proton antiporter that catalyzes
accumulation of protons (pH homeostasis) and extrusion of sodium ion, and
functions secondary to the proton-pumping respiratory chain; and sodium
ion/solute symporters that couple solute accumulation to sodium ion re-entry
down its electrochemical gradient. The physiology of the cycle is well-
characterized, but the molecular properties of the porters and their regulation
are unexplored. This project develops genetic approaches that facilitates a
molecular characterization. In addition, the gene encoding the antiporter will
be cloned. This action funds a visit of an Israeli scientist to collaborate on
the cloning of a gene for a transporter protein in bacteria capable of living at
extreme pH levels. This transporter plays an integral role in regulating
internal acid levels and controls the organism's ability to adapt to extreme
environments.
