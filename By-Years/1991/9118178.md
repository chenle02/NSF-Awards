This award will provide for half the funds needed to upgrade the computer
facilities that support research in the hydrogeology laboratory at Johns Hopkins
University. The additional funds necessary for this acquisition have been
committed by the University. This upgrade will make it possible for the PI and
his students to pursue their latest generation of groundwater modelling projects
which require state-of-the-art computer processors, memory and graphics
capabilities. This upgrade will allow the PI and his students to pursue
effectively research to be carried out under the recently awarded grant
(9117864).
