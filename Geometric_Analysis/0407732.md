Abstract

Award: DMS-0407732 Principal Investigator: Lars Andersson

This proposal aims to investigate the Cauchy problem for the Einstein equations.
Several aspects will be studied, including nonlinear stability of cosmological
spacetimes, as well as the nonlinear stability of various versions of the
Einstein equations for spacetimes with one spatial Killing field. Studies of the
asymptotic behavior near spacetime singularities will be carried out, with
particular attention to aspects of the BKL proposal and asymptotic silence. Here
a combination of numerical and analytical methods will be used. Elliptic gauge
formulations for the Einstein equations will be investigated. These are of
interest for large scale numerical computations, as well as for the Cauchy
problem for rough initial data.

The Einstein equations describe the geometry of spacetime, which in turn
determines the motion of bodies (planets, stars, galaxies) in space, as well as
the dynamics of fields and particles via their respective field theories. The
geometric view of the universe provided by the Einstein equations has led to
some of the most fundamental and paradoxical features of our picture of the
universe, including the initial spacetime singularity or Big Bang and black
holes. The mathematical study of spacetimes in extreme conditions such as near
the Big Bang singularity or near the singularity in black holes has led to a far
reaching conjecture called ``Cosmic Censorship'', which implies that phenomena
which violate the intuitive notions of causality must be hidden (censored) from
observers. In this project, problems related to cosmic censorship are studied
using a combination of computer based and analytical techniques, with a
particular focus on the evolution of geometry from initial conditions.
