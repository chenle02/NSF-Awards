9406067 O'Neil A newly developed simplified method of oxygen isotope analysis of
phosphatic materials will be exploited in a proposed program of
interdisciplinary research projects that utilize basic principles of earth
sciences, chemistry and biology. Particular emphasis will be placed on
applications of the method to paleoclimatology, determination of equilibrium
fractionation factors at low and high temperatures, biomineralization,
mechanisms of phosphate-water interactions, anthropology, and paleontology. The
proposed research program includes, among others, the following projects: (1)
Bacterial synthesis of hydroxyapatite and fluorapatite with determinations of
equilibrium fractionations between H2O and PO4 (dissolved and solid) as well as
the mechanisms of the exchange reactions and REE uptake, (2) Paleoecology of
Pleistocene cave bears (paleoclimate), (3) Viking Settlements in Greenland
during the Little Ice Age (anthropology, paleoclimate, paleodiet), (4) A test of
proposed large oxygen isotope excursions in late Devonian oceans from analysis
of conodonts, (5) Paleoecology of whales and fishes, and (6) Laboratory
calibration of 18O- fractionations between apatite minerals and water at high
temperatures. Samples for all projects are in hand and preliminary data have
been obtained.
