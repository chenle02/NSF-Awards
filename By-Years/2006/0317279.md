This grant supports the acquisition of an ion chromatograph (IC) to be used for
fluorine relative dating (FRD) of skeletal apatite in paleobiological
investigations of Quaternary mammalian evolution and extinction in the West
Indies. The FRD technique is based on the principle that bone hydroxyapatite
irreversibly acquires fluorine from groundwater so that the ratio of measured
fluoride to phosphate concentrations in fossil bone is time dependent. An IC can
be used to directly measure both fluoride and phosphorus concentrations in bone
samples simultaneously allowing for higher efficiency and more precise FRD of
bone sample than can be done using independent techniques to measure for halogen
and nutrient concentrations in fossil bone. The FRD technique will allow for
rapid and inexpensive preliminary relative dating of fossil skeletal remains
that in many cases will later be more rigorously dated via radiocarbon
techniques. The IC will support hands-on undergraduate involvement in analytical
chemistry techniques as applied to modern research in paleobiology at Scripps
College, a women's undergraduate institution. ***
