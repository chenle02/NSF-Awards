The purpose of this research is to examine the geographic patterns of genetic
variation in ponderosa pine and limber pine, with the goal of understanding how
those geographic patterns were formed. This study takes advantage of unique
patterns of inheritance in pines. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is inherited
maternally and is dispersed only short distances in seeds. Chloroplast DNA
(cpDNA) is inherited paternally, and has the potential to disperse great
distances in wind-born pollen. Minimal gene flow of mtDNA allows it to detect
genetic differences evolved between glacial refugia. High gene flow of cpDNA
enables it to measure the degree of gene flow among populations. Sequence
variation of mtDNA and cpDNA will be used to describe the variation across the
ranges of both species. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Biologists have studied geographic
variation of plants and animals for centuries, but advances in molecular
techniques have dramatically increased the information that can be collected
from natural populations, and advances in the treatment of the data have
dramatically increased the information that can be extracted from the data.
Analyses of mtDNA will allow us to look far back into history, to see how the
waxing and waning of the glaciers pushed forests across the landscape. Analyses
of cpDNA will reveal the extent of pollen flow, and allow us to determine
whether different populations evolve independently, or whether gene flow binds
populations together, as if the distances among them were an illusion.
