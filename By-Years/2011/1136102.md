This Robert Noyce Phase 1 project represents a partnership between the
University of Tennessee, Knoxville's (UTK) VolsTeach four-year, two-career path
program (a UTeach replicate), the National Institute for Math and Biological
Synthesis, Anderson County Schools, Roane County Schools, and Knox County
Schools. It is a collaborative effort between content area professionals in math
and science, teacher educators, a national institute emphasizing the
quantitative nature of science, and three school systems in communities under
economic distress. Over the course of the project 45 Internships are supporting
freshman and sophomore student service in a variety of educational outreach
activities, while 42 Noyce scholarships are supporting a select group of junior
and senior VolsTeach students.

Intellectual Merit: Two key components of the project designed to improve the
quality of the teachers the program prepares are: a Noyce Research Methods
course to equip the Scholars for engaging their future students in STEM inquiry,
and a monthly Noyce Seminar Series on STEM Issues that is broadly advertised to
encourage participation from a variety of stakeholders including experienced and
novice teachers, those preparing to be teachers, faculty in the sciences, math
and education and the interested public. Formative and summative assessments are
being conducted on all aspects of the project.

Broader Impact. The program is providing quality teachers in STEM disciplines to
school systems that most need them. These teachers have a strong foundation in
engaging students in inquiry learning, including experience with cooperative
learning and model research systems that support high school student math and
science literacy and its application to technology. In addition the Noyce
Scholars are being supported during their early years as teachers thus ensuring
they will be able to implement creative teaching methods in STEM in the high-
need schools where they will serve. Information about the project, particularly
the research methods course, is being disseminated statewide and nationally in
publications, conference presentations, and other communications.
