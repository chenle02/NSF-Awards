Progress in the neurobiology of learning and memory has benefitted recently by
the discovery that the hippocampus and associated brain structures play an
important role in "working memory," the type of memory that allows us to recall
specific recent events. Major successes in creating animal models of working
memory have come from the development of the delayed non- match to sample (DNMS)
paradigm, a working memory test that involves three sequential phases: A cue
phase when the memory cue is presented, a delay phase during which the animal
must remember the cue, and a choice phase during which the animal must recognize
and reject the memory cue in favor of an alternative. Investigators have shown
that damage to the hippocampal system results in severe impairments on
performance in DNMS, indicating that this system is critical to information
processing for working memory. This research is aimed at determining what role
the circuitry of the hippocampus plays in DNMS. Dr. Eichenbaum's strategy is to
exploit the rats' striking learning and memory capacities with olfactory and
spatial stimuli to describe the neural correlates of memory for these distinct
types of information. He is recording the electrophysiological activity of
single neurons in the hippocampus as rats perform DNMS tasks using either odors
or places as the memory cues. By comparing the firing rates of neurons across
the three phases of the task, he will be able to identify which component of
memory activates hippocampal circuits, that is, whether the hippocampus is
primarily involved in storage (cue phase), in holding (delay phase), or in
recognition (choice phase). In addition, by comparing neuronal firing rates
across the two categories of memory cues (odor and place), he will be able to
determine the general, rather than stimulus-specific, qualities of cues that are
processed by the hippocampus.
