INT-0201376&lt;br/&gt;David Stanley&lt;br/&gt;University of Nebraska-
Lincolnl&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is about international
collaboration with researchers in Korea, focusing on insect immunity: The insect
pathogen Xenorhabdus nematophilus depresses host immunity by inhibiting
eicosanoid biosynthesis. Insects are the most successful group of animals and
the only serious biological competitor with humans. Insects exert tremendous
economic and public health impacts on human life and life quality. The
development of effective and environmentally compatible insect management
strategies is necessary. The earlier collaboration study shows that a bacterial
factor which is present in the organic fraction of the bacterial culture medium
inhibits cellular immune reactions. The proposed study is to identify the
bacterial factor responsible for inhibiting eicosanoid biosynthesis and to
determine the influence of this factor on bacterial
pathogenesis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
