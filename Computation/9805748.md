9805748 Estep Systems of quasi-linear reaction-diffusion-convection differential
equations have widespread importance in modeling physical phenomena in such
diverse fields as biology, chemistry, metallurgy, and combustion. Some examples
are shear flow in fluids with temperature dependent viscosity; Hodgkin-Huxley
type models of nerve bundles; and models of the spread of disease in
populations. Because such problems are typically highly nonlinear and exhibit
complex behavior, numerical solutions of the differential equations have become
the main tool for investigation of their properties. However, these same
qualities give rise to some fundamental scientific questions: How can reliable
and accurate estimates of the accuracy of information computed from numerical
solutions be obtained and how can a desired range of accuracy be achieved? The
project will address these question on three levels: theoretical analysis;
implementation in code; and application to practical problems. The proposed
approach is based on developing an a posteriori theory of error estimation in
which the error is estimated in terms of quantities depending on the numerical
solution that can be computed or approximated. The theory will then be used to
develop methods of computational error estimation and adaptive error control.
The PI will also analyze the reliability and accuracy of the computational error
estimates and, because stability has a direct impact on the accuracy of
numerical solutions, the preservation of stability properties of the
differential equation under discretization. Practical goals of this project
include; a publicly-accessible code for solving general reaction-diffusion
problems using computational error estimation and adaptive error control,
applications to the practical models like those mentioned above, and an
educational component in the form of a textbook on the finite element method for
the basic nonlinear models of science.
