Student Design Essay Competition: Foundations of Design&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
objective of this award is to support undergraduate and graduate student
attendance at the annual American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME)
International Design Engineering Technical Conferences. A secondary objective is
to encourage students to think deeply about what engineering design will be like
20-30 years in the future. Students will communicate their thoughts on this
topic in an essay which will be judged by a distinguished group of engineering
design researchers and educators. Travel funds will be provided for students who
are selected through the design essay competition. A poster session will be
organized at the conference to give the students an opportunity to interact with
researchers and discuss their ideas on the future of engineering
design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports the NSF goal of ?achieve
excellence in U.S. Science, mathematics, engineering, and technology education
at all levels?, especially, with respect to ?provide opportunities for young
people that will attract them to and prepare them for careers in science,
mathematics, and engineering?. The competition will be widely advertised through
the ASME conference website and through emails to groups of researchers in
engineering design. Posing the task as an exercise by an industry employee
requires the students to consider the effect of global competitiveness on
engineering design practices. Conference experiences promote growth in
individual students and can also serve to strengthen the overall research
quality of the research at the student?s home institution when this knowledge is
shared among their peers.&lt;br/&gt;
